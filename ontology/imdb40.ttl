Because up to that point we had been utterly dazzled by breathtaking staging impassioned performances and a display of filmmaking craftsmanship in all its forms direction editing design that had the packed audience stunned.Well two hours later I'd been proved wrong. Condon has created a vivid emotional spectacle that will dominate the 0607 Oscar nominations. Dreamgirls is one of the five best movie musicals ever made.There is really nothing new about the storyline  smalltown singers make it big and ride the rollercoaster of fame. But thats what works so well for the film  the great cinematic clichs are embraced and played to the hilt by a creative team both behind and in front of the camera that knows what makes a great Hollywood musical.There's not one weak link in the cast. Condon's camera is in love with Beyonce Knowles and she handles the journey from the innocence of the groups early years to the staggering success and fortune of the group at its peak with surprising range. While most singeractress attempts are failures Madonna Whitney Britney k.d. lang Beyonce proves to have genuine talent.Jamie Foxx centres and grounds the film in a lessflashy role but one that is crucial to the films credibility.But there are two standouts. Eddie Murphy as fading star Early has never done better work. And Jennifer Hudson delivers an absolute tourdeforce performance in a role that sees her dominate every scene she is in. Her belting solo number was applauded by the audience a rare enough occurrence during an industry screening but a moment that was repeated a few times thru the film. Hudson is a lock for the supporting actress Oscar even this far from the ceremony.Dreamgirls is a better movie in every way than recent award winning musicals Chicago and Moulin Rouge both of which I am a huge fan. It is a film that tells a classic ragstoriches story utilising great cinematic technique and bravado. 2006 has offered up some great moviegoing experiences for me Thank You For Smoking Children Of Men V For Vendetta Little Miss Sunshine for the sheer cinematic thrill it provides however Dreamgirls proves to be the best two hours I've spent in a cinema this year.".

He unfolds a new inedited face and I predict a new career. The predictability of the tale becomes rewarding rather than annoying and I was surprised and moved all the way through. Jammie Foxx's unsympathetic turn manages to deliver a punch of humanity. Byonce Knowles Danny Glover and the rest of the cast are a perfect foil for Jennifer Hudson's Cinderella Story.

	schema:reviewBody "What a spectacular movie musical experience! This is one worth waiting in line if not purchasing advance tickets for. Beautifully realized by writerdirector Bill Condon 'Dreamgirls' brings back thoughts of a few years ago when the movie musical version of 'Chicago' knocked our socks off and with the help of the gorgeous 'Moulin Rouge' helped to revive the modern movie musical. The sets costumes musical numbers all flow beautifully and make for an incredibly affecting motion picture.As amazing and eyepopping as all of the scene work and musical numbers are this is ultimately a movie rooted in its performances. Jamie Foxx gives further credence to his stature as an incredibly talented musician and Beyonce Knowles known for her vocal talents still manages to impress with her songs and her voice. Not to mention her stunning beauty as each costume and scene in which she appears seem to top one another in terms of showcasing her incredible beauty. Eddie Murphy blew me away with not only his truly heartfelt performance as Jimmy Early but his amazing voice and showmanship. What a talent! Anika Noni Rose who I fell in love with on Broadway in 'Caroline or Change' gives her performance as Laurelle soul and a deep rich vocal styling. But let's face it..we are all going into 'Dreamgirls' wondering if 'American Idol' contestant Jennifer Hudson can pull it off. She has quite a bit to live up to as Jennifer Holliday's performance as Effie White in the original Broadway production is legendary. Add to that the fact that this is Ms. Hudson movie debut she must have been feeling a huge weight on her shoulders to do the part as well as the show justice. If she isn't able to do anything less than nail the part of Effie as well as her signature song 'And I am Telling You' the whole production no matter how great the other aspects hold up runs the risk of crashing loudly. The question on everyone's mind is Can she do it? Let me just say this... I have never sat in a theater watching a musical where the audience erupted in applause like they would in a Broadway theater after a performer's song. Everyone and I mean everyone! was wildly applauding when she struck her last note in 'And I am Telling You.' It was such an intense experience to be a part of. I mean...as I am writing this I am getting goose bumps. But not only is her singing tremendously effective but her actual performance is just as good. She brings a vulnerability and an innocence that perhaps would not have come through had the part been given to a more experienced movie performer. Ms. Hudson is nothing short of breathtaking and even if you are not crazy about the rest of the picture doubtful you will almost certainly be amazed by her talent. Just remarkable. This has to be one of the most impressive motion picture debuts in the history of cinema. Even during the closing curtain call when Jennifer Hudson's name was shown there was again wild applause. A star has been born!!!".

But let me tell you it's just been a tremendous year for film. Kudos all around. I tell you none of the BP nominees last year could compete this year. And I loved Brokeback Mountain and Munich.Dreamgirls is an amazing movie. I know what you're thinking. I didn't believe the hype either. But I saw it today and I actually don't think it's been hyped enough. Everyone deserves to be nominated. But it's just that kind of year folks. Too many awesome performances not enough nominations. Of course the major buzz has been going to Jennifer Hudson and she does deserve as much praise as she's getting but that's because she's a 15. Everyone else is a 10. So she's better but it's ridiculous how awesome everyone else is. Of course Eddie Murphy's great. He's been in those movies where he plays like 10 fat people which should have gotten him some recognition all these years but of course they wouldn't go for that. But now that he's done such a great job here whatever awards he'll get he'll deserve. And those of us who loved Party All the Time are definitely not surprised at his vocal prowess. Jamie Foxx is great again you know but this time he's playing the villain so maybe that's why he's kinda been ignored. Anika Noni Rose. I don't know where she came from but I loved her too. All great voices. All great performances.Beyonce. Okay I'm not a huge fan. She's talented and I appreciated her acting from Austin Powers. Yeah that sounds weird but you could tell she was comfortable on screen and had a lot of fun. I don't generally like the way she and her contemporaries sing nowadays so I wasn't expecting much either way. I figured she'd be passable. But she did such a great job playing Diana Ross. Everything down to the gestures and the fact that she wanted to lose weight for this tells me that she definitely took her job seriously. And it paid off.I think this is rated PG13. I can't remember why. I think there are a few bad words and one quick flash of some drugs. But I wouldn't mind taking a kid to this. Because there is so much more to it that's worth it. In a strange way I thought it would make a great double feature with Happy Feet. So much toetapping to be done. People waited in my theater through the credits for Jennifer Hudson's nameimage to pop up and they all clapped. That never happens where I live either. Never. And there were little old ladies going WOOHOO! after a couple of Effie's songs.If you like movies this year go see everything. But make sure that you save time for this one. You're gonna love it.".

Something which the film industry's been waiting for since Chicago won a Best Picture Nod at the Oscars in 2002.The casting is pitchperfect. Jennifer Hudson is astounding which keeps you wondering about her departure from American Idol due to insufficient voting??!! That voice and those emotions pave the way for Oscar glory. Beyonce Knowles though many critics have credited her as the weakest link in the movie is far from being weak. Her radiantglamour and her 20lbs less voluptuous figure shine whilst the Dreams are on stage. She is far from being the weakest link. As Deena Jones Beyonce has the voice experience looks and talent. Eddie Murphy actually acts and NO! he does not overact play multiple characters or provides unneeded humor there is a vein of emotions displayed vividly in his character James Thunder Early  from his love between his wife and backup singer drug addiction and winding career. Its too bad it took Murphy this long to realise his capability and potential in a significant contribution to the film industry. Jamie Foxx  is easily the weakest link. His performance is insipid and it seems like he has been pasted in the scenes to give them attitude and egoism. Though its a very Jamie Foxx character and is pretty much Curtis Taylor Jr. Jamie Foxx's onscreen presence and performance was not good enough. Anika NoniRose did not receive the acclaim she deserved. Sure she is the least known in the cast but her portrayal of Lorell was spoton and was as powerful as Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson's performances. Her voice was amazing and I hope this movie rockets her career.The music especially the additional songs gave this movie the final touches. Amazingly directed by Bill Condon this is one movie that lived up to its hype. Loved every bit of it.".

Though its a very Jamie Foxx character and is pretty much Curtis Taylor Jr. Jamie Foxx's onscreen presence and performance was not good enough. Anika NoniRose did not receive the acclaim she deserved. Sure she is the least known in the cast but her portrayal of Lorell was spoton and was as powerful as Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson's performances. Her voice was amazing and I hope this movie rockets her career.The music especially the additional songs gave this movie the final touches. Amazingly directed by Bill Condon this is one movie that lived up to its hype. Loved every bit of it.";

To put it shortly Bill Condon directorwriter delivers the goods with this film. It's most definitely the first of its kind. It moves at a rapturous pace that leaves you breathless and delivers performances that are both subtle and fittingly over the top.The movie explains plot holes from the Broadway musical and adds many historical occurrences Martin Luther King Jr. etc. that gives the film a much more social awareness. Most of the sung dialogue from the musical is replaced with spoken with the exception of a few scenes. The music itself has always been wonderful and this able cast performs it spectacularly.The performances are something else. Jennifer Hudson Eddie Murhpy and Anika Noni Rose will blow you away. Murphy's vocals though not as strong as his leading ladies suit his character perfectly and shows a vulnerable side to him towards the end that we never knew he had. Rose makes the transition from a giggly little girl into a fullblossomed woman seamlessly and Hudsonwell let's just say that any major hype you've heard about her does not do her performance justice. Beyonce Knowles will catch you off guard with her beautifully subtle performance brilliantly channeling Diana Ross with her musical performances. Jaime Foxx Keith Robinson Danny Glover and Sharon Leal also hand in admirable performances.I could not recommend this film more. It gives hope AGAIN to the movie musical that Chicago revived and The Phantom of the Opera Rent and The Producers almost killed. I can't say whether this film will be the next Chicago I do foresee MANY Oscar noms including Best Pic and others I certainly hope it will be. I dream it will be bigger. It is definitely not the next The Producers. I can say this though It is the first and only Dreamgirls that we will ever encounter.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a preview screening of Dreamgirls on Nov. 15. and have to say I was pretty blown away by it. I can always tell when a movie really hits me because the thought immediately runs through my head Wow I can't wait to OWN this on DVD. Needless to say Dreamgirls is now at the top of my To Buy list.I saw the original Michael Bennett production in 1985 a few years into its Broadway run when Jennifer Holliday was no longer in the Effie role. But even without Holliday I found the show and its score to be among Broadway's best. While I certainly hoped this movie would at least give us a respectable representation of what made the Broadway show so thrilling I must admit I was afraid to get my expectations too high after the recent string of disappointing stage to screen musical transfers  Phantom of the Opera Rent and The Producers. Yeah I had heard the buzz was good for Dreamgirls but well you know how that goes. Sometimes the bigger the buzz the flatter it falls.And let's face it. Movie musicals are just flatout tough to pull off. While I consider the number of truly great movies to be pretty small the list of truly great movie MUSICALS is even smaller. And the ones that manage to do more than just recreate a literal adaptation of the stage play truly utilizing the medium of film to create something bold and cinematic are almost non existent Cabaret Chicago...maybe one or two others...end of story. Plus I think it's even more difficult to successfully transfer musicals to film today given modern audiences inability to accept characters breaking into song.So I hope I'm not adding to the already extensive hype when I report that for me at least Dreamgirls delivers big time. The film manages to achieve the near impossible task of remaining faithful to it's source material in fact several times it gives direct nods to Bennett's brilliant original staging while utilizing the medium of film to it's fullest creating something fresh and exciting in its own right. Dreamgirls not only transitions seamlessly between spoken dialog and musical numbers but redefines musical storytelling by using the musical artifice of breaking into song carefully and judiciously to punctuate only those moments in the movie when the emotion builds to the point where words can no longer adequately contain it. I can't express strongly enough how impressed I was with the way Bill Condon managed to handle these transitions. Truly masterful. But it's not just the transitions that are handled well. The movie is artfully rendered and exquisitely produced in literally every area with outstanding heartfelt performances by each and every cast member. And yes Jennifer Hudson is as good as they say. I can honestly say that there's no way I can imagine this film being done any better. If there's any weak spot in Dreamgirls it's the dramatic flaws inherent in the piece itself. The second act of the stage play after and I'm telling you I'm not going was never quite as dramatically intense or focused as the first. And the movie feels pretty much the same way. But believe me this is a minor flaw compared to what's RIGHT about Dreamgirls. Make no mistake. This film is going to be a triumph and earn a place in movie history. Not to mention my DVD library.".

Alan Arkin's sweetly deft performance as the little girl's doddering grandfather in 'Sunshine' was really no comparison and not even in the same class. i suppose it was nice to see the overthehill Arkin receive an award after all those years but Arkin has been acknowledged with nominations before and i doubt Eddie Murphy will ever find another role like this that showcases his numerous considerabletalents. shame. the academy awards blew it and missed an important opportunity. i guess the pros don't always know what they're doing.fortunately they knew what they were doing with Jennifer's Hudson amazing acting debut as the much beleaguered character Effie. Hudson is nothing less than astonishing. it's hard to conceive that she is new to acting in major productions because she takes to acting like a fishinwater. Effie is a major role in 'Dreamgirls' with lots of singing and emotional requirements. Hudson manages both singing and acting exceptionally. her rendition of 'I'm Not leaving' is a awe inspiring mix of acting and singing. when Simon Cowell told Hudson she wouldn't go anywhere he must have been out of his mind. along with Eddie Murphy Hudson gives one of the decade's very best and most memorable performances.i don't want to ignore the performance by pop star Beyonce either. she's just great and a even match for the enormously over powering charisma of Murphy and Hudson. Beyonce makes the transition from music video star to handling a major film role smoothly and effortlessly.there are also notable and memorable performances from 'Frog Prince' princess Tiana Anika Noni Rose and Jamie Foxx from the excellent drama 'Ray'.'Dreamgirls' is also a good film and good cinema. it never sacrifices it's sense of filmmaking for Broadway musical contrivances. it also handles it strong emotions without ever being sappy maudlin or overly sentimental. considering the amount of highly charged emotions that pervade the story it is all done with a certain matter of fact dryness and with dignity. the characters never seem whiny pathetic or undignified. in fact they seem like people who are struggling to keep their dignity intact.of course the music is tuneful and catchy and out of this world. the scene where white singers do a very souless cover of the black 'Cadillac Car' is a little exaggerated but hilariously well deserved.the very idea that Eddie Murphy lost out to the geriatric Arkin will probably always steam me and be one of the reasons i now pay very little attention to the Oscar shows. 'Dreamgirls' is a powerful film with mesmerizing performances and deep statements about race and the media. 'Little Miss sunshine' was basically nothing more than a communist manifesto for seven year olds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dreamgirls despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile onscreen. Unfortunately what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs perhaps too many? but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only  the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie Jennifer Hudson. The film is slick and technically wellproduced but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments watching Jamie Foxx's Svengalilike manager manipulate his acts to the top but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain despite his having been right from a business standpoint for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestantOscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather hamhandedly takes her side but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious egotistical selfcentered diva who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude the charges are more than wellfounded but the stage showfilm seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter  using the implication that much like the talent card motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately Hudson is not that actress. She sings well but the dialogdriven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number is wellsung by Hudson but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous not to mention pretentious and condescending particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit drained of emotion energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.".

During the first 4560 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sungthrough dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound the rest of the film is just bad Broadway show music. Then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film.".

It's nothing deep I'll say right off the bat. It's no cinematic masterpiece that will be a beacon for films to come. What it is however is an absolute ball. It's the only film I think I've ever seen that really captures the experience of seeing a great musical in the theater. It's fun it's rousing and it just made me feel good. The music is outstanding and surprisingly comes off as stuff that might really have been recorded during the eras depicted with maybe just the right tinge of Broadway to them. The vocal performances are just outstanding. Of course by now everyone knows the standout is Jennifer Hudson who will be unstoppable at the Oscars this year. Her acting is quite good but she'll win it for the singing. I would also be perfectly happy to see Eddie Murphy take home a statuette. He's excellent in both comedic and dramatic moments. Much of the rest of the cast is good too including Beyonc Knowles and Anika Noni Rose. The story is of course based on that of the Supremes and in that way I felt a little Susan Alexander Kane  Marion Davies situation going on with Deena Jones  Diana Ross. While the Dreams are supposed to be only like the Supremes the film kind of does imply that Ross was not an extremely talented singer which is of course patently false. Anyway small quibble. No Dreamgirls is no masterpiece but I like it about as much as I liked Chicago probably a tad more and I wouldn't be too ticked off if the Academy went with it for Best Picture. I do prefer it slightly to The Departed. I just don't think Scorsese's fourth best movie about organized crime should be crowned. Definitely recommended as long as you know what you're getting into.".

All of the characters were much more believable on screen and the added songs really fit in with the rest of the score. The greatest triumph of this movie has to be Jennifer Hudson as Effie.

Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!Now the first half hour was good but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many soundalike tunes.Condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I'd expected they would. Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people singing AT each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big love me number was criminal! Condon just shot her stomping around the stageno drama at all! God it sucked!AND note to all involvedthat singtalking dialog stuff might work on stage but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom. All that I'll teeeell youuuu something Efffieeee! crap should have been left on the editing room floor. Those aren't songs.Again the filmexcept for Eddie Murphy's amazing performancewas nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that prerelease one to beat Oscar buzz? As a whole this film was except for Eddie NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie! except for Eddie I'd rank it right up there with Grease 2.

I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. The film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen. Her performance of And I Am Telling You was the only time that I felt the hype was deserved. You cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary Ray performance and Beyonce Knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie. Her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film.The movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song Beyonce's heartfelt solo to Jamie Foxx too long.DH  Vancouver WA".

	schema:headline " DREAMGIRLS  A Movie Musical To ReIgnite The Genre With It's Soaring Energy...";
	schema:reviewBody "DREAMGIRLS Firstly it would be unfair to review a film like DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging some of it's many flaws. After a year of hype DREAMGIRLS proves a slight disappointment in terms of emotional gravitas  depth. When a film is hyped for an entire year as the frontrunner for the Academy Award filmgoers have every right to go into the film expecting fullydeveloped characters rich emotion  detailed storytelling. However filmgoers be warned... you aren't bound to get what you expect. DREAMGIRLS is rather shallow in terms of character development  genuine plot. However if you go in expecting the film to be a stunning spectacle of entertainment  fun you will not be disappointed.Whatever DREAMGIRLS may lack in terms of complexity it makes up for with sheer energy  relentless commitment to entertain its audience. The admittedly thin story revolves around the discovery  rising stardom of a trio of young women from Detroit Deena Jones Beyonce Knowles Lorrell Robinson Anika Noni Rose  Effie White Jennifer Hudson. After meeting manager Curtis Taylor Jamie Foxx at an amateur night the girls find themselves on tour with one of the country's leading AfricanAmerican entertainers named Jimmy Early Eddie Murphy. As they tour the country Curtis romances the girl's lead singer Effie White  slowly develops the girls as a solo act named the Dreams.However once the Dreams are ready to crossover on their own the dynamic changes completely  the happy rise to stardom becomes troublesome. In order to market the group to white audiences Curtis replaces Effie with Deena as lead singer causing a rift in the group dynamic which leads to Effie's retaliation  inevitable dismissal from the group. While the first half of the film focuses on the rise to stardom the second half focuses on the continued stardom of Deena who is now married to Curtis  the struggle of Effie to make it on her own. As is clear from the plot description the actual twists  turns of the plot are rather complex... but the depth with which they are examined is very lacking.Nonetheless what makes DREAMGIRLS one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences of the year is the sheer energy  talent of it's inarguably incredible cast. From the very first notes it is clear that DREAMGIRLS is a return to the grandest of musical formats. Bill Condon has decided not to hold back in any way. The costumes the lighting the music  the choreography are so in your face incredible that once this movie gets going the audience can't slow down. Bill Condon does a decent job of incorporating some racial tones into the film with the Detroit Riots and I Have A Dream.. but these racial elements can't eclipse the glitz  glamor that makes DREAMGIRLS what it is.No review of DREAMGIRLS would be complete without acknowledging the contributions of it's incredibly talented cast. Jamie Foxx in the role of conniving businessman Curtis Taylor Jr. brings a subtlety to the screen that is almost offputting at first when you consider how flashy his performances usually are. However Foxx's subtle sliminess makes the slow revelation that Curtis is a man virtually devoid of emotion all the more unsettling. Meanwhile Beyonce Knowles as frontwoman Deena Jones is certainly the most beautiful screen presence to reach the silver screen in years. But it would be an understatement to simply acknowledge Beyonce's beauty as she manages to travel leaps  bounds above her previous screen efforts. On the page Deena is an incredibly underdeveloped character but in the few moments of depth we see in Deena it is clear that the script shortchanged Beyonce's potential here. Eddie Murphy is a sheer joy in one of his best roles  he exhibits a singing voice that sounds like it was plucked straight out of Motown's heyday. Again like Deena Jones Jimmy Early is rather underdeveloped on paper with a drug addiction that seems more like a plot contrivance than a genuine character flaw... but Eddie Murphy gives the subplot more resonance than one would expect from the script. His relationship with Lorrell played by a delightful Anika Noni Rose is surprisingly the most well developed romantic pairing in the film.Finally one can't possibly review DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging the fact that this will go down in history as the moment the world was truly introduced to the talents of Jennifer Hudson. As the most crucial role of the film Effie White is the most emotionally rich character in the entire piece while also being a scene stealer both vocally  attitudewise. Hudson delivers on all levels especially in the vocal department. If she does not go on to be a significant force in the music industry it only goes to show that the industry sometimes has no clue what to do with genuine talent. In the acting department Hudson doesn't shine quite as strongly as she does vocally... but for a reality star's film debut this is a transcendent performance richly deserving of the awards attention she has received.Overall one might ask why a film like DREAMGIRLS with it's numerous flaws and shortcomings is still ranked with a 10 by myself. Personally I think sometimes a film does not have to be graded simply on it's depth  complexity. There's a place in this world for movies that soar as sheer entertainment just as much as there is a place for heavy dramatic pieces. DREAMGIRLS isn't the type of film that will change your life or reach it's audience on a deep level. However it is the type of film I could watch over  over on DVD  still not absorb every detail. DREAMGIRLS might not be the Best motion picture of the year but it certainly is the most entertaining motion picture I've seen in years.... A ...".

The story line is OK and does refer to the Supremes story as we all know... However the music apart from the BIG number is boring. I bought the CD and played it twice and got bored! I immediately listen to Wicked and what a major difference! Now that is what you call a great score! The greatest thing about this movie is Jennifer Hudson! She is perfect for the part and she does a great job with her acting. Also she gives a great performance of a really great song. Everyone knows she was under pressure to reach the levels of Jennifer Holiday and I think she did a good job. However its was her acting ability that pulled it off.The other star of this show was Eddie Murphy. He was quite outstanding in this film and his role was almost believable. The problem he had was that he was not given enough time to develop the role...The other huge gap in this film was the relationship that was supposed to exist between Foxx and Hudson. Where was it? I think they could have cut the terrible slushy scenes with Foxx and Knowles and concentrated on the relationship with the other two. Now that would have made the film much more interesting.Ah but we have to have our eye candy Beyonce to sell the film. What a pity any time was spent on her as I must be the only person around who is not bothered if I never saw her again! However I am certainly going to follow the career of the brilliant Jennifer Hudson! You go girl!".

	schema:headline " Excellent portrayal of an eventful life lived in 'interesting times'.";
	schema:reviewBody "Two and a half hours well spent  if you know the history of the French Wars of Religion. If not and you think the DVD cover promises a battlefest then you may be disappointed. The one major battle scene is short and adequate but war  or how to end it  remains the background theme to this film and occupies little of the screenplay. The film is more about politics than war.As such it is pretty faithful to the events and characters involved. Charles IX was only 23 when he died but appears older. The protagonist Henry of Navarre one of the few French kings regarded as 'good' had a reputation for lechery and the opening scene shows our hero embarking on his lascivious path at a very young age. It also establishes his persona as a downtoearth lover of peasants enjoying the bucolic life in his small kingdom in SW France.Standing between Henry and the French throne we have the last two Valois kings Charles IX and Henri III  childless weak and dominated by their mother Catherine de Medici who is depicted unsympathetically as scheming and unscrupulous. History dealt Catherine a bad hand. She gave her husband Henri II 10 children in 12 years. He then got himself killed in a joust and left her to run a country where religious civil war was about to break out.Secure in her island fortress on the other side of the Channel the childless Elizabeth I of England has been credited with preserving religious peace over the same period. Catherine's position was weaker. Effectively the ruler of France for 30 years she desperately bought time for her sons to grow up. To complicate matters further we have the powerful Catholic Guise family with their own ambitions for the French throne and the fact that Henry of Navarre is a Protestant in a land where the majority are still Catholic.Grappling with the French Wars of Religion is difficult enough for any history student. Making a film about this topic demands a careful balance between detail and entertainment. The screenplay includes all the main characters and events and will mainly appeal to those with some background knowledge. More battles would not have explained the story.To sum up we have one battle four political assassinations a lot of rampant sex between the hero and various women one dramatic escape the famous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of Protestants and the good King Henri IV dispensing religious toleration and material wellbeing to his subjects. To do all this in only 150 minutes is a remarkable achievement.Inevitably this film will be compared with the awardwinning 'La Reine Margot' 1994. The Margot of 'Henri 4' is a much less sympathetic character. This film tells a different story and covers a longer time span. Of the two films I think I prefer this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two and a half hours well spent  if you know the history of the French Wars of Religion. If not and you think the DVD cover promises a battlefest then you may be disappointed. The one major battle scene is short and adequate but war  or how to end it  remains the background theme to this film and occupies little of the screenplay. The film is more about politics than war.As such it is pretty faithful to the events and characters involved. Charles IX was only 23 when he died but appears older. The protagonist Henry of Navarre one of the few French kings regarded as 'good' had a reputation for lechery and the opening scene shows our hero embarking on his lascivious path at a very young age. It also establishes his persona as a downtoearth lover of peasants enjoying the bucolic life in his small kingdom in SW France.Standing between Henry and the French throne we have the last two Valois kings Charles IX and Henri III  childless weak and dominated by their mother Catherine de Medici who is depicted unsympathetically as scheming and unscrupulous. History dealt Catherine a bad hand. She gave her husband Henri II 10 children in 12 years. He then got himself killed in a joust and left her to run a country where religious civil war was about to break out.Secure in her island fortress on the other side of the Channel the childless Elizabeth I of England has been credited with preserving religious peace over the same period. Catherine's position was weaker. Effectively the ruler of France for 30 years she desperately bought time for her sons to grow up. To complicate matters further we have the powerful Catholic Guise family with their own ambitions for the French throne and the fact that Henry of Navarre is a Protestant in a land where the majority are still Catholic.Grappling with the French Wars of Religion is difficult enough for any history student. Making a film about this topic demands a careful balance between detail and entertainment. The screenplay includes all the main characters and events and will mainly appeal to those with some background knowledge. More battles would not have explained the story.To sum up we have one battle four political assassinations a lot of rampant sex between the hero and various women one dramatic escape the famous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of Protestants and the good King Henri IV dispensing religious toleration and material wellbeing to his subjects.

And Hannelore Hoger is suitably evil as queen Catharina de Medicis a major plotter against Henry.The production values are reasonably good though as in many other historical films battles are not very credible when it seems to involve the fight of dozens of people instead of thousands films like these should consider using computer generated imagery to give modern audiences the feel of a large battle.The same subject matter was covered in La Reine Margot a French film released in the 1990s starring Isabelle Adjani as Marguerite de Valois in Henri Margot is played as a semi hysterical woman by Armelle Deutsch. I saw La Reine Margot at the time it was released but I really don't remember a lot about it except that it was a much stylized affair Henri is a much more down to earth film.".

But contrary to another reviewer who thought it too long actually it's too short and oversimplified.The dire murderous and suspicious atmosphere is very well realized as many of those admired crowned heads have behaved sometimes like insane mass murderers and luckily the glamorized feel of too many historical films has not crept in here. But the script looks rushed hurrying and compressing events decades characters and their motivations. Thus even the action is unclear for a viewer unfamiliar with that age and place and important historical or dramatic events are but hinted at or simply omitted the Ligue and its rebellion the deaths of Charles IX Henri III and of his brother the last Valois heir and also Caterina's death.In reality the historical characters have been pretty complex and contradictory Caterina was not only an evil and scheming hag such as her portrayal in Dumas' novels but an active and courageous politician striving mostly in vain to maintain a fragile balance in a kingdom devastated by three rival factions the Court the Guise family with its Ligue and the Huguenots led by the future Henri IV. Or Henri III her favorite son was indeed a weird undecided bisexual perhaps bipolar fellow but certainly not an idiot it was him who 'eliminated' his main rival the duke de Guise and finally allied with the future Henri IV against the Ligue and named him heir presumptive. The death of Gabrielle is not elucidated in the film was it Rosny the king's main adviser really? Unbelievable.Maria de Medici is treated in an infantile manner and even the king's assassination is very poorly explained. Also lacking are many other tentatives of assassinating him throughout all his life course. The pacification of France after his last conversion and crowning took in reality many years and required much effort from battles to bribery for rebellious dukes. By the way the duke d'Epernon the last standing rebel and a main mastermind of the king's assassination is absent from this film.To sum all these up despite its ambitious luster strangely the film has the feel of a low budget one too few characters rushed situations poorly explored motivations quite few extras in the scenes at the Court.

Biopic fits in the truest sense as the film starts with the main character as a boy and ends with his assassination. I am not sure how close it is to the Heinrich Mann novel it is based on but it's a historic drama from 5 years ago and while it is usually not particularly my favorite genre I was nicely entertained most of the time. Here and there there was a scene where it dragged a bit but it was still bearable for a 2.5 hour film. It's packed with intrigue violence killings sex and relationship struggles most of these pretty graphic. These relationships involved queens wives and last but not least God. There are many emotional scenes in this film. The film is written and directed by Jo Baier a man who won several Adolf Grimme awards in the past already for his works. It is a multicultural movie. Many countries involved here and actors from these countries too especially Germany and France. You may have come across Krl Pippig Hller Hoger Striesow Markovics Urspruch and Monot already if you are interested in German movies.Ulrich Noethen scored a supporting actor nomination at the German Film Awards for his performance here and he was certainly one of the standouts of this movie. Julien Boisselier did not know him before was a good choice for the lead character but not a perfect one. All in all the movie did not have any real moments of greatness but no major weaknesses wither. If you like the genre this certainly deserves a watch. Give it a chance.".

Her teachings discouraged severe ascetic practices reflecting her belief that God intended humans to pursue contented lives devoted to hard work charity and spiritual invocation.'Vision' focuses on various intrigues within Hildegard's world of nuns monks and bishops as well as the nobility who provided financial backing for cloistered orders. No doubt there was some jealousy within that circle which obstructed some of her endeavors but she was a formidable figure in 12th century Germany traveling widely on preaching tours at a time when women were traditionally banned from such pursuits. Hildegard's contemplative disciplines were a crucial aspect of her life's work but being impossible to film they are mostly ignored in favor of her worldly activities. The acting and cinematography are sufficient for the task at hand but anyone hoping to learn about Hildegard's esoteric philosophy is likely to be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I muse what if I woke up and found myself in the middle of the 12th century in Western Europe? What was life really like? The present film centering on one of the most uppity women of the Middle Ages Hildegard von Bingen takes you into the medieval world as few films do. As much as we often like to idealize the Middle Ages particularly since the 19th century the period was anything but ideal. Unlike today people had few rights and the powersthatbe could uplift or destroy almost at a whim. In the church people with power used threats of persecution usually in the name of heresy or blasphemy which could result in excommunication and even execution as a means to reign people into modes of behavior which fit their desires and designs. Hildegard von Bingen was one of the few people who stood up to these forces and refused to bow to unreasonable demands easily.Hildegard was remarkable because she was a woman who challenged predominantly male authority during an age when women wielded very little political influence outside of noble circles. Some queens did have some authority in political realms but an abbess of a monastery making requests and even demands of bishops and other nobles was almost unheard of. An abbess had authority within her cloister but rarely outside. Typically abbesses were expected to be completely obedient to the local abbot and bishop following their orders without question on bended knee. But Hildegard was not afraid to vocalize her desires and even her frustrations in front of very powerful forces. She is famous for having visions and claiming communication with God an assertion which infuriates the local church leaders who contest that such claims are an insult to the prophets of scripture. Why should God single her out and give her insight not given to bona fide holy people of the Bible? However she wins favor with one of the bishops who allows her dialogs to be transcribed. Another aspect of Vision like Name of the Rose concerns the beautiful medieval books.The 12th century was markedly different from modern society today but I think there were aspects more similar than we like to acknowledge. If we take a peak behind the curtain of castles and cathedrals we see the same human desires and weaknesses we all share which I think is one of the points of Vision. A large part of the film involves Hildegard's attachment to a young novice nun Richardis and the relationship becomes closer than even one of mother and daughter. Unfortunately political and ecclesiastical power threatens the relationship and not even Hildegard has enough influence to stop it.The present film is a wonderful tribute to one of the most remarkable figures of the Middle Ages. Barbara Sukowa offers a tourdeforce performance as the medieval abbess who defied convention during an age when nonconventional voices were often silenced and sometimes violently. The scenes appear to have been shot in real medieval churches and castles which brings the viewer into the 12th century in a way very uncommon in most cinema which depicts these times. Although the 12th century is now 800 to 900 years away the atmosphere is strangely familiar. Although details about everyday life would probably be unbearable for most of us in the modern age such as the darkened candlelit rooms and the constant threat of illness many desires and fears which permeated life then are not unlike today. Highranking officials often sought power while there were others who simply wanted to love and be loved and find the best means possible to bring this into being. People in the Middle Ages were still human beings.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a disappointment. The viewer coming to the film without a knowledge of who Hildegard of Bingen was and her significance is likely to leave the movie in almost the same condition. Why nine hundred years after her life is she still discussed? This movie will not answer that question.The plot is minimal and predictable. It tells the story of Hildegard's becoming a nun becoming the head of her group of sisters starting her own nunnery her conflicts with male authorities and her relations with political authorities. At least as presented in Vision this is not riveting. Neither the photography nor the acting is very impressive.While the movie alludes to Hildegard's musical works her scientific and medical interests and devotes time to her visions we do not receive a coherent well developed picture of the woman and her accomplishments. And that is a disappointment since Hildegard was an interesting person.In short Hildegard the person simply is not the same as Vision the movie. A movie reviewer ought not confuse the two.To cite just two points on which a more enterprising film might have focused1 For all of the movie's talk of Hildegard's visions no effort is made to present them visually. That could have been quite dramatic cinema. Even if the budget constrained dramatic staging of the visions a skillful writer would have used a plot device such as manuscript illuminations or wall paintings for graphic effect. It would have provided us with some feel as to their power and impact on her contemporaries. Alas instead the movie has Hildegard narrating small disconnected passages without any real vitality.2 The movie ends just as Hildegard is going out to preach. She made four such trips and apparently they had major impacts throughout the Rhineland. Yet we do not see those trips. Undoubtedly they could have been presented in very dramatic fashion. Alas again the movie misses a great cinematic opportunity.One final point before closing. Yes Hildegard is a strong woman resisting domination by male Church leaders a creative artist and an interesting intellectual figure. Unfortunately her legacy is not wholly uncontroversial. Some of her visions are profoundly antisemitic. During the Second Crusade of 1147 the Jewish communities of the Rhineland were massacred. While Bernard denounced these mobs Hildegard was silent. Wouldn't a more balanced picture of Hildegard have shown these moral failures? It might have made for a more interesting movie.".

It was written and directed by the excellent director Margarethe von Trotta.As the German title tells us this film is about the life of Hildegard von Bingen one of the most fascinating historical figures of the Middle Ages. Von Bingen was a nun a mother superior a mystic a healer a theologian and a composer. Her musical works have survived and they are still popular among lovers of early music.The gifted actor Barbara Sukowa plays von Bingen. Sukowa possesses the skills to make it clear to us that von Bingen was not only brilliant. She was a strong forthright person. She did not hide behind her nun's habitshe used her status as a Mother Superior to interact with many of the other great personages of the 12th Century. She corresponded with bishops theologians philosophers and members of the royal families of Europe.This movie shows us some beautiful scenery and so it would be better seen on the large screen. However in my opinion this is a mustsee film. If DVD is your only option go for it!Note If you read the other reviews for Vision you'll see that I'm not the only IMDb reviewer to like it. However the average IMDb rating of the film is a dismal 6.6. I find this inexplicable. It's one of those situations where I ask myself Did those people see the same film I saw? My adviceignore the low rating and decide for yourself whether this is a movie worth seeking out or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vision From the Life of Hildegard Von Bingen or just Vision is a GermanFrench collaboration from 2009 and the language in here is almost exclusively German. It is another femalecentered work written and directed by feminist filmmaker Margarethe von Trotta and like many other times actress Barbara Sukowa plays the main character the title character in this case. The cast includes a handful actors and actresses from Germany that will definitely be known to film buffs most of them wearing nun outfits. Obviously this does not include Heino Ferch and Devid Striesow and I personally felt that they were almost unrecognizable in here something entirely different for them for once. But this is also already the only truly positive aspect here one of very few interesting things about this film.The downside frequent and deep down is the usual stuff you get with Sukowa and often also von Trotta. I have seen the lead actress in many works before and she has huge problems in hitting the right notes. She almost never does and instead she goes painfully over the top in her performance as this is the only thing she can do to try to stay relevant and memorable because of her lack of talent when it comes to range and subtle acting. This film is the best example for all this. Even in her big nun outfit and with the audience only seeing her face for the most time her performance still feels very false and unauthentic. I never had the impression to watch an actual nun.The script is only slightly better if at all. There are moments when you can at least feel the filmmaker's intention to come up with an interesting story but these are pretty rare and most of the action feels as if it has one intention only namely make the character of Hildegard von Bingen look as baity as possibly and create as many oh so important moments for her as possible. You can certainly not say that the main character was written in a boring manner but instead she was written in a way that lacked realism entirely so people would never forget her I guess. Sad to see that von Trotta still has not learned anything about the art of subtlety and restraint. Young nuns keep dying and it has nothing to do with good storytelling. It all feels rushed in for the sake of having the title character deal with these losses not because it made any sense. Herzsprung is as bad as she usually is ridiculous German Film Award nomination and Kalenberg who I usually like more plays a character who was written in the most stereotypical way you could imagine.There were also major flaws in the story in general. Herzsprung's character cries to Sukowa's that she is so scared and has no idea what to do without her if she dies one day and almost the very next scene she tells her mentor that she will move on to another monastery and the bond seems to be lost entirely at least from one side. Extremely bizarre. Then the rushedin death so we won't forget how brilliant and likable von Bingen is. There are huge plotholes from start to finish. The visions reference in the title add almost nothing to the film and the way Sukowa acts in these scenes is the most cringeworthy stuff you could imagine. Also needless to say that this film lacks relevance in terms of depicting an actually existing person completely. It will not get anybody interested in von Bingen at all I am afraid and the reference to scenes added for dramatic purpose won't cut the cake anymore. Major disappointment here. Stay far far away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woman's Work is Never Done  This movie a true story about an unstoppable12th century woman who advanced theology philosophy music and women's rights is interesting and informative. Hildegard von Bingen rose above the men around her to forge changes. The oppressive patriarchal atmosphere in which she functioned is almost tangible. The prevailing religious mood of 12th c. Germany is so vividly portrayed as to sting the senses and underlines the importance of Hildegard's opposition. She preached love and refused to endorse the harsh religious practices of the day. Mercy was better than sacrifice she said and she was passionate about the right to selfdetermination. The movie captures this pure emotional passion not sexual by its brilliant casting and fine acting. The film Vision from the Life of Hildegard von Bingen written and directed by Margarethe von Trotta is an inspiration and we are grateful she brought the accomplishments of this woman to the screen. Barbara Sukowa in the title role convincingly portrays the commitment of a woman compelled to live out her destiny. This is an opportunity to learn about a woman a thousand years ahead of her time. Living within the walls of the Benedictine order Hildegard von Bingen accomplished so much in so many areas of life and the history of the whole era comes to life in this film much like the history of John Keats' era came to life in Bright Star. The powerful insights von Bingen received from her visions of God are shown being recorded in manuscripts by her male secretary  Volmar sympathetically played by Heino Ferch. The healing powers of her music are witnessed in the film and remain available for all to enjoy today but what a treat to see it all happen in Technicolor in 2010 in America.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them  I didn't even like There's Something About Mary too much although I'm not sure it's really a teen film.I own all three American Pie films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions  the movie takes time setting up their personalities quirks etc. and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example the movie Swingers. That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? American Pie is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude yes. It's crass very. It's sexist maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do  some are moderately entertaining like the Johnny Depp film Private Resort but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. American Pie is better one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel which was released in 2001 a couple years after the original. Jim Biggs returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler Seann William Scott there it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are updates on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkietalkies the incident with the glue the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not I think I like this better than the first film. The third is probably my favorite if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard one of the great character actors of our time. American Pie 2 is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those pointless sequels but I liked it and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films  so considering I'm giving this seven stars that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well here we are back for more of the same antics we got in American Pie. There may be a sense we've seen this all before but somehow American Pie 2 really works. All the characters we know and love or hate from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gutbusting laughs. Even though we're going back over much of the same territory the sequel is more consistently and explosively funny than the original. What could have easily been a pointless unnecessary sequel actually manages to be something fresh funny and appealing.As with the original the Jason Biggs character of Jim is the glue holding the film together. Everything revolves around him in one way or another. Where in the original film each of the main male characters came with his own romantic storyline this time around Jim takes center stage. Most of the female characters have been shunted to the sidelines here with Shannon Elizabeth Tara Reid Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne being mere bit players. Their absence doesn't hurt at all and may actually help by making the story more focused. This one's all about the boys with Jim and friends renting a summer home following their first year of college. Back for more hilarity are Chris Klein as Oz Eddie Kaye Thomas as the increasingly bizarre Finch and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the comparatively dull Kevin. And even though none of the others like him the script finds a way to contrive to get Seann William Scott's juvenile vulgar obnoxious Stifler tossed into the mix. Where the other guys might go to the edge of what is appropriate Stifler is always willing to go careening over the edge and his antics are a hoot.If you thought nothing could be more embarrassing than what happened to Jim in the original film just wait. And along to heighten the embarrassment is Jim's father played wonderfully by Eugene Levy who in trying to help inevitably just makes things worse. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here Alysson Hannigan as Michelle also does a great job. Oh the wacky things that go on at band camp. With a slew of familiar characters moving from one hilarious situation to the next all backed by a winning soundtrack American Pie 2 succeeds in equaling and even surpassing the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out loud.  Now I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time though and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel he walks in on him while he's having sex only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.The laughs are still there and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foulmouthed insults but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word fkface it gets kinda old.I'm always going to hold the American Pie movies several notches above the standard grossout teen comedies because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.The music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs including Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool andunlike with the first American Pie unrated editionthere is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version there was only a brief nudity but you get to see much more in this version.I'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first but it is one sequel that lives up to the originaland that's saying a lot!My score  7 out of 10".

At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel he walks in on him while he's having sex only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.The laughs are still there and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad.

All that obsessing and wondering about the other does he  she like me do I love him  her? is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the babes the booze and the parties. You have to look past that every guy's perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are being true to yourself and your friends but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film e.g. Steve Stifler but it sure concerns the main characters' life Jimbo's life. The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel.

Oh and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good even those who are different from us as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now everyone's more jaded even especially the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's and he'll love it but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now American Pie is an Rrated film so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd exactly but then neither was Porky's or any of its knock offs. The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim Jason Biggs still has his sexual hangups. Remember Michelle Alyson Hannigan the bandcamp girl? Jim went to the prom with her and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile Stifler's Seann William Scott still trying to hump everything in sight Oz Chris Klein is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica Natasha Lyonne is in France Finch Eddie Kaye Thomas is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler after their muchtalkedabout union at the party in the first movie and Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas is aching after his breakup with Vicky Tara Reid. There have been no drastic character changes either everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means of course that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies  the testosterone of singleminded males.   As in real life although the males in the movie have grown up they still think like high school kids. And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species! But while the theme of the movie is sex sex and sex hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school they think they know it all. Bring life on! they chortle with glee. We know it all! But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid they never ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that to me makes this a very special movie  although rest assured it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not for once pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages how much fun could it really be? Trust me if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.".

Puerile base vulgar and unkind but funny. Characters get things jammed up their bottoms glue hands to genitals and more. It is like a Donald McGill seaside postcard enlarged and moved to America.The plot is simple five friends sit in a beachhouse planning a party each with his own girl problems to solve come party time. Next door are two pretty tactile ladies who might be lesbians. Comedy ensues.The film divides itself between our hero Jim preparing for the arrival of a Russian girl who he believes to be a sure thing and the others in the house. There are two serious subplots one of the friends has a girlfriend who lives far away and another is trying to get back with his ex.Much of the comedy relies on whether you can stand the characters and stomach what happens to them. The odious Stifler for instance seems too much a bully to be likable and the scenes where he is humiliated gain something from this. Jim on the other hand is basically decent and whilst laughable we want him to succeed.I found the two serious subplots of little interest I am older than the ideal agegroup and they don't really seem very applicable to me now. Were I 18 they might well do although they do weigh the comedy down. Also perhaps deliberately the character chasing his ex appears simply wretched rather than likable. Still viewers may learn something.Which brings me onto the fact that this film is basically moral. Forget the sex and farting jokes at base the film is broadly correct about the way men and women behave and falls on the side of decency. The central relationship between Jim and Michelle an excellent turn from Alyson Hannigan at once weird funny and sympathetic is sweetness with a thin veneer of crudity and shows the real heart of the film. Excellent also is Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad embarrassing and hilarious but protective and sincere. For silly throwaway entertainment this scores highly. If you are a vicar or Pauline Kael don't bother but if you are looking for a film that is simple fun this does well. The characters and subplots make it uneven  I often ended up waiting for the action to switch to better characters  but there are moments of real hilarity so long as you can tolerate the rudeness that comes with them. This film will inevitably offend and disgust more prudish viewers but for someone willing to watch silly vulgarity without throwing all moral sense to the wind it is one of the classics of its type. Besides morality is what you make it. To my mind compared to the gross gloating sadomasochistic excess of The Passion of The Christ it seems wholesome indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel from director J.B. Rogers Say It Isn't So. Basically Jim Levenstein Jason Biggs Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher Chris Klein Kevin Myers Thomas Ian Nicholas and Paul Finch Eddie Kaye Thomas have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls Michigan after finishing their first year of college and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler Seann William Scott but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor Michigan so the four friends plus Stifler for rent pack their bags and make themselves comfortable finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with exgirlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum Tara Reid back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather Mena Suvari who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge. Jim is worried because Nadia Shannon Elizabeth will be returning and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty Alyson Hannigan. Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle Denise Faye and Amber Lisa Arturo may be lesbians and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis the other to the porn video at hospital supported by his Dad Eugene Levy he is told there will be swelling for a while and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success all the guests drinking and dancing with joy with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriendgirlfriend Kevin and Vicky happy as friends Oz and Heather still happy together and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman Chris Owen scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom real name Janine pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom Justin Isfeld as Justin  'MILF' Guy 1 John Cho as John  'MILF' Guy 2 Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother Casey Affleck as Tom Myers Joelle Carter as Natalie Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever Biggs more foolish than before Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm Scott much more foulmouthed and sexobsessed and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple just teens getting back together to drink a lot have sex and party hard but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to the highlights are Stifler being peed on the terrible trumpet playing the phone sex scene the lesbian fun and the super gluing it is a fun comedy. Good!".

But somebody on the screenwriting team here doesn't understand the concept of a joke. You've got your set up then your punch line. Then you move on to another joke. It's really not that funny to stand around and repeat variations on the punch line unless your sense of humor is in the Ha ha! she said f! vein.More fairness the actors and the director here are capable. For the most part it's a craftsmanlike piece of work but an uninspired one.A year of college hasn't matured any of the characters. One wonders what future sequels will be like.

With this movie though they didn't.American Pie 2 was probably the weakest of sequels in a summer full of sequels.  The jokes are the same maybe changed just a little.  The characters have nothing no new motivations they are all just battling the same things as in the first movie.  From Stifler's mom to parents catching Jim in personal moments the sequel steals er borrows from American Pie 1 without a second thought.The result?  One dumb movie.  First of all Jason Biggs Jim is horrible to watch.  You just want to punch him for being so stupid.  The scene where he plays the trombone?  Not the least bit funny.  People laughed WHY?  Finch is annoying as ever constantly speaking like he is 50 not in a funny way but in a really bothersome way that sees him featured for a good part of the movie when he is better as a supporting character a very small supporting character.  Kevin is a pointless character he doesn't do anything except talk to his old girlfriend Vicki the whole time constantly asking her to Catch up and hang out.  This also means Vicky is a waste of time as is Oz who somehow became a complete neutered male from the beginning of the first film.  He is an entirely different person even from the end of that one does anyone care?  Jessica and Heather great to see people from the first one but do they add anything?  No.The only thing this movie does is play Stifler well.  He essentially has to strap the movie on his back and carry it because everyone else is boring. How does he do this?  He says the Fword a lot.  This even loses humor after 50 times so by the end you wish you never spent the 6.50 to watch this junk.  The worst part is when the opening scene runs and people have seen the previews and still laugh very hard why people?  It doesn't make sense.  Out of all of the scenes in the movie the audience has definitely seen that before.AND YET between the predictable script the rerun jokes the low brow bail out humor guys kissing football down low little kid swearing monkey drinking alcohol and the painful acting of Jason Biggs American pie 2 will somehow make a lot of money.  It makes you wonder....IF they make a third one I hope they invest a little time in writing characters that we care about and get rid of characters we don't Shermanator Jessica etc..  Be new and inventive just don't insult us by showing us the first movie with a different title.  1.5 STARS".

	schema:reviewBody "What made American Pie work as much as it did was the commentary on teenage sexual activity.  Don't rush in was the message it's not worth it. Fall in love instead and things will come naturally.  Peppered with some suggestion about how to be a better lover it had a point in there somewhere.2 does not.  At all.  Ever.  It is gratuitous stupid juvenile and crude.  The jokes the ones that aren't blatant repeats of the first movie  e.g. trumpet in butt vs. flute in female genitalia or penis in pie vs. hand glued to penis are more toilet humor than guilty chuckle.  The worst moment was the Petey scene during which I was mildly amused until Jason Biggs proclaimed and I have gigantic balls!.  It was as if the record stopped.  It made no sense and was ridiculous.Also note that the women are conspicuously seldom in this film.  Could it be that they saw the script and gave little time to it?  Could it have been that they thought a sequel was lame enough?  For whatever reason they all but passed on this film I assume they must've had obligations to appear and so made the least of it they were right in doing so.  Let's see who gets better scripts in the coming years Tara Reid and Mena Suvari  or Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott of Dude Where's My Car shame.".

	onyx:emotionText "What made American Pie work as much as it did was the commentary on teenage sexual activity.  Don't rush in was the message it's not worth it. Fall in love instead and things will come naturally.  Peppered with some suggestion about how to be a better lover it had a point in there somewhere.2 does not.  At all.  Ever.  It is gratuitous stupid juvenile and crude.  The jokes the ones that aren't blatant repeats of the first movie  e.g. trumpet in butt vs. flute in female genitalia or penis in pie vs. hand glued to penis are more toilet humor than guilty chuckle.  The worst moment was the Petey scene during which I was mildly amused until Jason Biggs proclaimed and I have gigantic balls!.  It was as if the record stopped.  It made no sense and was ridiculous.Also note that the women are conspicuously seldom in this film.  Could it be that they saw the script and gave little time to it?  Could it have been that they thought a sequel was lame enough?  For whatever reason they all but passed on this film I assume they must've had obligations to appear and so made the least of it they were right in doing so.  Let's see who gets better scripts in the coming years Tara Reid and Mena Suvari  or Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott of Dude Where's My Car shame.";

	schema:reviewBody "American Pie 2 is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and my personal favorite from the series. Not only does it deliver great comedy but also showcases the evolution of the characters and how they face their first summer back from college. This is something that I think resonates with a lot of people and it was one of the reasons why I loved it. So 1 year later we see Jim Kevin Oz Finch  Stifler get back to hanging out and looking to spend the perfect summer by partying their asses off. For this they will have to move to the lakeside and rent a beach house in order to end their holidays with a memorable farewell party. Friendships will be tested realizations will arise as well as love and in the end we get to find out if these group's bond was made stronger from the experience. For starters this movie once again delivers in its trademark raunchiness with hilarious moments mainly involving Jim but also Stifler. Storywise we see the maturity most of these characters have garnered. I think the one that truly sees this in the best way is Kevin as he is still clinging on to his old life trying to be with Vicki and hanging out with his group. But Vicki only wants to be friends and so Kevin learns that he must not live in the past while also accepting the promising future he has. For me American Pie 2 is a great sequel to an already great movie. In fact for me it eclipses the original and makes for an even better experience. It's funny disgusting and most of all entertaining in every aspect. Rating 1010".

Now the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas rather than just rehashes of the first was a bit annoying too. But all in all it's an OK sequel and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical and not as wellwritten and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same too much the same in fact as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first like several of the scenes. Overall the movie is not as good as the first but it's OK. It's worth watching if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first and fans of teen comedies in general. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' which I consider his best. Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films that too had its wonderful moments and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky' Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes. Like most of his films 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and oneliners like 'You had me at hello' 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them no matter how long the screen time has something that contributes. Thus next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx all good actresses could respectively bring out the sweetness vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy humour liveliness enthusiasm and devotion towards family of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.In addition the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laughoutloud Bonnie Hunt a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating ohlookI'msocute child models.The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles Rolling Stone Marvin Gaye Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side the wild and smooth cinematography slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the moneyobsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being in the form of a father and a husband a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life is one remarkable story.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the 1997 Academy Awards host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees of which Tom Cruise was one as being a burned guy a mentallychallenged guy a mentallyabused guy a paralyzed guy and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable. Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's justabove used car salesmen. Their antics which require a highlevel of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as moneygouging and materialistic. In the film Jerry Maguire Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.Who am I and what am I doing? Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency SMI tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring transcendent and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration he loses his place at his agency and many of his highestpaying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently he also loses his attractive but shallow fianc. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athleteclients' multimilliondollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence he retains his client Frank Cush Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father played by Beau Bridges. However on draft day he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar through deception convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now Maguire has retained only Tidwell and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.So the question asked of the movie is Can a sports agent find a more meaningful possibly spiritual life and still acquire the highpaying clientle? And maybe even more to the point can an agent make a difference beyond just being a highpowered money negotiator? Jerry Maguire is a thoroughly entertaining richestoragstotranscendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.The film works at almost all levels particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Awardwinning performance playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and moresatisfying existence. Rod Tidwell Gooding wide receiver for the Cardinals is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team and Cruise giving to his clients and coworkerlover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.In the materialistic world of late 20thcentury America Jerry Maguire is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the moneyobsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of selfpromotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. Jerry Maguire offers an alternative although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you life is about what you leave behind.".

	onyx:emotionText "At the 1997 Academy Awards host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees of which Tom Cruise was one as being a burned guy a mentallychallenged guy a mentallyabused guy a paralyzed guy and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable. Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's justabove used car salesmen. Their antics which require a highlevel of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as moneygouging and materialistic.

It has funny moments but it's not Animal House or American Pie. It's a drama but it keeps the stakes low. This isn't Armageddon they aren't trying to save the world. There are no life or death decisions. The romantic stakes aren't that high either Renee Zellweger loves Tom Cruise but she's been in love before and if this doesn't work out she will be again. The only really high stakes are the money. By keeping the stakes low JM let's us watch it with a bit of detachment.This is more of a drama than a comedy. A good test is whether the characters change. Here Tom Cruise starts off completely cynical abruptly changes to ridiculously idealistic then spends the rest of the movie finding the right balance. Renee Zellweger starts by loving Tom Cruise from afar then gets him then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.JM is fun to watch. The characters though flawed are sympathetic.

No it's not perfect and no it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre moneyspinners so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that against all odds he can act his heart out when given the right role as can Cuba Gooding Jr. neither of them better previously or since  and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.And on top of that it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent finetuning it to perfection and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your selfawareness questioned once in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "By definition and depending upon who you're talking to Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or to many just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead you're alive you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there in fact be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writerdirector Cameron Crowe explores in Jerry Maguire' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.Jerry Maguire Cruise is a highpowered sports agent for a huge agency handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money he gets the big bucks for those he represents he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it the answer would be a resounding No.'  But then something happens.  One night he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror and for whatever reason it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish soulless empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany he seizes the moment sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a missionmorality statement' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment he goes to his office makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.In the cold light of morning however he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry then when the big M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be Money' and not Morality' as in Money talks Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves he vows to make it on his own.  He's up he's positive he has his statement and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the real' Jerry Maguire. Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writerdirector with Say Anything' in 1989 in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story as well as the presentation is original and imaginative and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it because these are threedimensional people not just cardboard cutouts and moreover Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry he has the look the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it as well.  As Rod Tidwell the pro football playerclient who sticks by Jerry and insists that he Show me the money!' Gooding equals if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise Gooding is perfectly cast and points up again what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.Not to be outdone by her costars Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast single mom Dorothy Boyd. She's such a giving' actor and she endows Dorothy with a gentle caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy with his back turned to her that he has broken up with his fiancee Avery Kelly Preston is priceless and alone makes this film worth watching repeatedly.  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked as she is such a vital presence in this film.  910.The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell Frank Jay Mohr Bob Sugar Bonnie Hunt terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd Dorothy's sister Regina King Marcee and Jonathan Lipnicki unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe this movie is indeed magic.".

Renee Zellweger fits perfectly by having great chemistry with Jerry and by having a normal plain look.

When Jerry Maguire a sports agent played by Oscarnominated Tom Cruise has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in his Oscarwinning performance.

However Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft.  However he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all Jerry Maguire is classic Hollywood stuff made in the presentday.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  Jerry Maguire is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However its ability to mix comedy romance and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:headline " Only Cameron Crowe can make a movie like this";
	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this movie for the third time and I still love this movie as much as I did after the first time I watched it. Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work is that everything is real. The characters their emotions the story The whole is absolutely amazing.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about Jerry Maguire is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Rene Zellweger and her cute son amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.I read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong Tom Hanks is an excellent actor but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.So my conclusion for Jerry Maguire If you haven't seen it you should definitely see it. If you have seen it I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful as where are used from Cameron Crowemovies.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Cruise had one of his best roles and earned his second Oscar Nomination for Best Actor for his charismatic JERRY MAGUIRE a richly entertaining comedy drama that is a seamless blend of character study and romantic comedy. Jerry is a driven and ambitious sports agent for an international agency that represents professional athletes in all sports who has a crisis of conscience that motivates him to write a mission statement which turns out to be more of a defiant manifesto blasting everything that is wrong in his business. he distributes his memo throughout the office and though it gets faint praise initially it does end up getting him fired from the agency. We then see Jerry try to continue his business though he only has one client who agrees to stick with him. Directorwriter Cameron Crowe FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH ALMOST FAMOUSsolidified his position as a master cinematic storyteller with this epic story told on an intimate scale. His extremely deft screenplay is sharply delivered by a perfect cast. This role seems tailormade for Cruise and he makes the most of it. Cuba Gooding Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his starmaking performance as Rod Tidwell Jerry's most loyal client Renee Zelwegger was the find of the year as Dorothy Boyd the secretary from the agency who follows Jerry when he's fired and agrees to work for him and eventually falls for him Bonnie Hunt scores as Dorothy's sister as does Kelly Preston in one of her best performances as Jerry's shark of an exfiance. Regina King should have received an Oscar nomination for her solid performance as Tidwell's wife Marcy Jay Mohr is quite funny as Bob Sugarman a rival agent who is battling Jerry to represent another football player Jerry O'Connellwho is being watched over by his protective dad Beau Bridges. A rare gem from the 1990's that is not only grandly entertaining but vividly real...there's nothing false or affected here though some might find Gooding's Tidwell a little over the top this film is one of those rare treats that is long but you hardly feel it. A real treat and a must for Cruise fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jerry Maguire has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It's given us the lines Show me the money Help me Help you You had me at hello and You complete me. And it's that last line that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character grow from just an agent to becoming much more it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one. Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he's engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital the client's young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a mission statement for the company. The mission statement basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn't like it. The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete's earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they're just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they're more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise and he gives one of his best performance. I think it's every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr's. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It's sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise's office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his mission statement into practice. All in all I think it's a good movie with a very observant script complimented by great acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Jerry Maguire a number of times but it was only on my most recent viewing at the age of 23 that I came to truly appreciate it. Yes it is all the things I described in the title but it is also a charming and original film filled with excellent performances under the control of a man who knows exactly what story he wants to tell. I'm not going to tell everyone it doesn't have its flaws I can picture Crowe sitting there and smiling to himself after writing You had me at hello but this is anything but a bad film. Jerry Maguire features an unusual central romance with Cruise and Zellweger's characters getting together more out of convenience than love on his part anyway. The relationship is handled with maturity and honesty by all involved. Cruise is terrific throughout the whole film but it is his moments with Zellweger and her character's son where he truly shines. Zellweger herself oft maligned also puts in a great performance and in my opinion she has never looked lovelier. But it is the relationship between Cruise's Maguire and Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr's Rod Tidwell that is the film's real selling point. It's a relationship built on loyalty trust and friendship. The film has its twists and turns and it is too long but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.Oscar Note I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy. You'd be hard pressed to find a more electric entertaining and effective performance in any film.".

C'mon!!! can anyone take the message of this movie seriously!!!! One of the messages of the movie is that love is more important than money but a the end is all about the money I mean if the movie does not seem contradictory to you well... I guess that people are willing to swallow any kind of trash and even think that the movie had a MESSAGE.... On top of that Cuba gooding Jr is despicable in this film sooo over the top his character is both unlikable and so stupid so is the part of R Zellwegger not to mention the kid who is one of the reasons why abortion should ALWAYS be legal. False pretentious corny cheesy I felt used and abused by the filmmakers who may think that we're all a bunch of idiots! I won't discuss Tom cruise in this movie just because he's not the biggest problem on this movie is the cynicism of a script that wants to sound deep while actually being one of the shallowest movies ever. I mean if you have a brain and a heart in the right place you just can't like this aberration of a film. Sorry to all the people that liked it but in all honesty if you watch the movie with a bit of a critical eye you just can't help to feel manipulated and sacked try and see it again if your'e honest at least you'll recognize that this corny sentimentalism is very much planned no auteur here but a bunch of movie executives trying to make us feel sorry for a bunch of wealthy unlikable and ridiculous characters. One of the worst movie ever! I can't believe that so many people took this movie seriously and that even more people haven't been able to call this movie what it is TRASH".

One of the messages of the movie is that love is more important than money but a the end is all about the money I mean if the movie does not seem contradictory to you well... I guess that people are willing to swallow any kind of trash and even think that the movie had a MESSAGE.... On top of that Cuba gooding Jr is despicable in this film sooo over the top his character is both unlikable and so stupid so is the part of R Zellwegger not to mention the kid who is one of the reasons why abortion should ALWAYS be legal. False pretentious corny cheesy I felt used and abused by the filmmakers who may think that we're all a bunch of idiots! I won't discuss Tom cruise in this movie just because he's not the biggest problem on this movie is the cynicism of a script that wants to sound deep while actually being one of the shallowest movies ever. I mean if you have a brain and a heart in the right place you just can't like this aberration of a film. Sorry to all the people that liked it but in all honesty if you watch the movie with a bit of a critical eye you just can't help to feel manipulated and sacked try and see it again if your'e honest at least you'll recognize that this corny sentimentalism is very much planned no auteur here but a bunch of movie executives trying to make us feel sorry for a bunch of wealthy unlikable and ridiculous characters. One of the worst movie ever! I can't believe that so many people took this movie seriously and that even more people haven't been able to call this movie what it is TRASH";

No it's not perfect and no it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre moneyspinners so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that against all odds he can act his heart out when given the right role as can Cuba Gooding Jr. neither of them better previously or since  and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.And on top of that it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent finetuning it to perfection and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your selfawareness questioned once in a while.".

When I viewed the voter history for this movie I couldn't believe the rating it had received after 13400 registered users had voted. This movie was excellent from the direction to the production sets.  The acting was superb by all but could not and would not have been as great if it had not been for the vision of the director.  I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes the sequences the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet I try to observe details in a production that make a good bad or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.  I believe a film should consume the viewer to me that's great filmmaking.  If I can leave my seat or carry on a conversation while watching a film it's not great it might be good but not great.  Jerry Maguire had my undivided attention.  Kudos to everyone involved in the production of this movie.  I waited four years to see this movie which I finally purchased on VHS cassette two or three months ago.  It was a worthy investment and I will soon purchase it on DVD.

The acting is superb and to be honest the comic relief was a tad out of place.The movie contains some very good acting and some excellent scenes and dialogue. It also features a heart wrenching monologue by Angus played by Charlie Talbert when he confides in his grandfather George C. Scott who's about to be married.So see beyond the awkward comic elements and Angus is an enjoyable actor driven movie that did not get the attention it deserved.You'll probably enjoy the soundtrack as well. Whatever happened to the obviously talented Talbert anyway?".

At times gutwrenching in its portrayal of high school cruelness at other times sweetly heartwarming in its portrayal of high school innocence Angus is an endearing good guy trapped in a waspy snakepitlike high school in Anytown USA. The strength of Angus is its believability of course it's farfetched at times it's a movie and yet it still works amazingly well. Charlie Talbert and Chris Owen Angus and Troy respectively are a real treat to watch as the pair of outcasts. Their chemistry radiates offscreen and they become both heroes and comic relief in a combination that drives them to the audience's heart. Some of the film's best belly laughs in fact are direct results of their alltoobelievable dialogue.James Van Der Beek is one of the most hateable bad guys I've seen in some time and boy he plays it well. What a deliciously different role compared to his often annoying Dawson's Creek persona! This is some great work by him even if its not a lot. Strong support from George C. Scott and Kathy Bates it was fun watching them in a heartfelt film like this especially Scott General Patton himself. Please if you ever get the chance to see this film SEE IT!! You will not be untouched nor remorseful. You'll have a new favorite way to pass an hour and a half.  Great score by David Russo I'd love to see a release of it!".

	schema:reviewBody "What makes the teenage years so vexing is how a young person's line of thinking evolves from the logical unadultered mannerisms of childhood to the obstinate interpretive idiosyncrasy of adulthood.  As children we might remember seeing things and make a simple yet direct remark about it yet as adults we might see things stop to think about it taking into account all our past experiences and teachings and make an observation when we soon realize that there are other people that have their own observations.  Worse yet is how the young person does not immediately see this transformation.It is during these years where we begin to contemplate a new reality one based on indifference and hopelessness.  It is here where the young person begins to interpret ideas histories and ideologies of all sorts however good or bad they intend to be and have the option of either rejecting or accepting them.  This is where our hero Angus Bethune played flawlessly by Charlie Talbert is thrown in.  As a child he has always been the butt of jokes and along with his best friend Troy Wedberg Chris Owen the target of bullies.  His protection has relied on wit humor and physical prowess. His love for Melissa Lefevre Ariana Richards is just as strong as his hate for Rick Sanford James Van der Beek.Yet showing his affection to his yearning love is in his opinion an unreasonable goal.  What could possibly make Angus reason like this?  Could it be Rick?  By the time we are done with the first act we see that Rick has already managed to mentally emotionally and socially control Angus.  Rick is also highly manipulative as he uses his bullying tactics over Troy to betray his own best friend.  As if that wasn't enough he's the goodlooking quarterback and the head of the class which yields ostensible power to him. He shows no compassion to whoever he feels is not normal that is whoever does not follow his concepts of physical and social beauty. Although the film does not demonstrate how Rick obtained such line of though his mind is nodoubtedly locked in to this ideology.  Aptly would Camus describe Rick and his cronies no longer represent men but an idea raised to the temperature of the most inflexible of wills.What about Angus?  What about his influences?  He seems to have a very supportive and eccentric family composed of his truckdriving mother Kathy Bates and his active unrelenting grandfather George C. Scott.  Troy equally eccentric provides support at school.  Yet nothing works  In his mind his positive traits good at science excellent tackler full of heart cannot overcome his negative ones overweight timid reclusive. He doesn't open his blinds in his bedroom to let the sunlight in and he already has plans to transfer to another school where he can be accepted for once.  He wants nothing to do with the outside world which he feels doesn't want him anyway.When Rick forces Angus to come into this world by rigging an election so as to make him dance with Melissa Angus becomes really confused.    Will Angus go to the dance or not?  He can have his moment with Melissa yet he will risk humiliation knowing that Rick had set this up.  However the real question this second act is this  If he makes a decision what will it be based on?  How will other people and their ideas affect his decision.Hereafter his support group will aggravate Angus' confusion by bombarding him with ideology.  His Grampa says Screw 'em to anybody who opposes what he wants of which includes marrying a woman thirty years his junior demonstrating that Angus should not fear what others think of him thus he should go.  His mother wants Angus to focus on his studies so that he can get his ticket out of Owatonna High thus he should not go.  Troy in his whimsical self thinks Angus needs to change his image and manner in order to find acceptance thus he should go.  Angus himself thinks that in spite of the opportunity to dance with the girl of his dreams he knows that Rick will make a fool out of him thus he should not go.  How can Angus make sense out of all this?This is where Grampa comes in.  He knows his grandson very well and he has faith in Angus' warm qualities.  He even goes out to get him a nice tuxedo albeit a plumcolored one but Angus refuses to wear it.  Angus loves his Grampa but Angus feels weak upon the implications of the dance.  This all changes however when Grampa dies.  Early in the film Grampa wished that Angus could talk to Melissa just once before he died.  Sadly he will not live to see this.  When Grampa's fiancee April Anna Levine brings the plum suit to Angus Angus realizes he has betrayed Grampa's faith in him.  He will say Screw 'em and set out to attain his goal as well as his selfesteem and selfdetermination....Thus Angus no longer sees Rick as a bully but as a danger to his wellbeing.  Melissa is not merely a love interest but a token for being courageous and brave.  He has a label for these people now based on numerous levels of reasoning.What's so amazing about this film is how it is richly paced.  You can take delight in the visual aspects of the film and show compassion for these people.  Composition creates a moving experience with the story using the warm colors of autumn.  Music also plays an important role as it balances teenage angst with feelings of longing and disillusion.How sad that you truly can't enjoy a film like this if you see it quickly! Angus warrants a deeper study into the nature of bullying use of power teenage confusion and conditioning obesity and the power to overcome themes that lie much deeper into its afterschoolspecial facade.  Don't let the theme of acceptance thwart you off!  I must warn you  If you felt alone and alienated in high school this movie won't disappoint.  If you didn't feel alone and alienated either avoid this film or stop denying it take the bitter pill and see no observe it.Now go have another.".

Of all the High School teen flicks I believe this to be the most dramatic and sophisticated in storyline. James Van Der Beek plays the classic quarterback that everyone has met before and just loves to hate. Angus has always thought that the key was to be more like Rick Van Der Beek but then realizes that he truly needs to be himself. As it turns out Angus' chelating crush Melissa Ariana Richards is just as frightened of other people as Angus is. As a cruel joke Angus is nominated to be Winter King at their school. Angus realizes the intentions behind the nomination and turns the situation into a positive experience. This movie is full of humor classic characters we all knew and underwear up the flagpole. I deeply recommend this film. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all things in my freshman year of high school this movie came out and I was stunned. It was about a guy whose own life mirrored my own I just got up and applauded literally through the whole thing. Angus was me in school right down to his geeky friendsidekick. I was a different kind of person from the rest of the crowd. I was big and smart kept to myself mostly but that was so I didn't get into trouble. The biggest difference? I have Tourrette's Syndrome and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out. It was nice to see that people like me could be shown on the big screen in so positive a way. So of course I had to write a review on it here.The movie is about a fat kid who like me was good at science and fair at football though I truly despise football thanks Coach! who has a single mom and lives with his grandfather both played marvelously by Cathy Bates and George C. Scott. Angus wants to get with the popular chick who just happens to be dating his archrival in school that has suffered numerous broken noses over the years from Angus' wrath.You grow to love his grandad who gives him advice on how its OK to be different to just Screw 'em! If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was then Angus is your movie. And his mom once more like me seems to be one of the only people who truly ever understand him. Top it all off with his big science project to be able to attend the Magnet School in town and you've got something spectacular! Add the soundtrack for extra points and I give it a 10 out of 10! Go for it Angus! God I love that line!".

Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'? Although there is some comic relief  as in life  there also is  this is not what I would call a comedy. This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed. It is the best case for antibullying efforts in school that I have ever seen.So why the bleeping bleep is this NOT on DVD? Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are first timers in school would buy.This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mislabeled in the name of sales and won't be the last  but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ? My kids would watch this in a heartbeat !!! Hey  anyone at Disney listening ??? Snap this film up while it's cheap and rerelease it. Guaranteed money maker every year.The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is Sleepover  while I like that one too it's not anywhere near as real as this.10 out of 10 for the movie ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "I grew up with this movie I enjoyed it so much. I watched it every week of my childhood. I wasn't really one of those kids who got picked on I just thought Angus was a true real life hero and I looked up to him. There isn't too many one dimensional characters in this film. Everyone has feelings and the movie does a great job of showing their feelings. I have not read the short story but if it's anything like this movie it'll be great.Like all teen movies it has a strong message that is spelled out for everyone. Unlike other teen movies this one seem to show everyone's side of high school life even though the two main character's are outcast they're not really nerds. they both play on the football team and one of them is really good. You don't really expect that from losers. The whole movie has great gags that everyone can enjoy and they're really funny.Charlie Talbert plays Angus Bethune Great name right? his best friend Troy Wedberg is played by Chris Owen Can't Hardly Wait and he is just hysterical throughout the whole movie. George C. Scott Patton plays Angus' grandfather that is always falling asleep and he plays the role of dad to Angus giving him advice. Kathy Bates Misery does a great job as Angus' mother Kathy Bates is just a great actor. Then we have James Van Der Beek Varsity Blues playing the bully and he does do a great job at it and Ariana Richards Jurassic Park plays Melissa Lefevre which Angus has a crush on.Overall I recommend this movie to anyone that likes teen movies such as the breakfast club can't hardly wait and sixteen candles. As longs as you went to public high school this film can't get old.".

I then went to Best Buy only to realize that Angus is not sold on DVD and VHS is near impossible to get a hold of. Thats when it hit me.Angus is a very under rated movie. It depicts a very real world of the years of Highschool. The main character is Angus hence the title. An overweight fat kid who has dreams to leave his town while constantly thinking about his Dream Girl. His grades are good enough to go to a college out of the town to escape his outer demons. Demon that being the star quarterback of the school and most popular kid Rick who picks on him and his friend. His main good relationships are with his Mom Grandfather and best friend. The plot point of the movie comes when Angus is chosen by Rick as a joke to go to the dance with his dream girl. Angus then must face his insecurities and step up. At the end of the movie Angus overcomes the troubles of high school and humiliates Rick to get a kiss from his dream girl.The movie is just brilliant with good character depth on all the characters. Even the dream girl admits to Angus that she has an eating disorder. It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD yet. But if it is on TV check it out.".

He is on the football team where he hopes to impress a cheerleader who is dating his worst enemy. He is adored by his mother and seeks advice from his livein grandfather. It is arranged that Angus and the cheerleader are prom King and Queen. Predictable yet with a wonderful message directed by Patrick Read Johnson. Charlie Talbert pulls off a comical performance as Angus despite an outcome viewers will likely predict before he does. Chris Owen as Troy is bullied because of his large ears but he is Angus's best friend and offers assistance in preparing him for the dance. Ariana Richards plays the fetching cheerleader but the role is typical and only seen largely through the fixation of Angus. Kathy Bates plays his mother in a role she does her best with but it is standard issue. George C. Scott plays an uncle who cannot find the energy to stay awake although he attempts to deliver sane advice to Angus. Theme bashes bullying while honoring one's uniqueness resulting in a film that should appeal to teenagers with a message for adults in preparation for that time in life. Score 7  10".

Kathy Bates plays his mother in a role she does her best with but it is standard issue. George C. Scott plays an uncle who cannot find the energy to stay awake although he attempts to deliver sane advice to Angus. Theme bashes bullying while honoring one's uniqueness resulting in a film that should appeal to teenagers with a message for adults in preparation for that time in life. Score 7  10";

	schema:reviewBody "Angus 1995  out of 4 Charming gem about an overweight teenager named Angus Charlie Talbert who is constantly being tormented by the kids at his school. This eventually leads to him being the target of a prank that gets him elected homecoming king where he's going to have to dance with the Queen which just happens to be the girl of his dreams Ariana Richards. Through all of this Angus has his grandfather George C. Scott and mother Kathy Bates there trying to do what's best for him. ANGUS is a truly charming little gem and it's really too bad that it never found a bigger audience because it's really a good little movie. Of course it's going to have a big message going throughout but what really makes this film work are the performances and the relationship that Charlie has with the people around him. The main focus is the relationship between Charlie and his grandfather with this here getting some of the most heartwarming scenes in the picture. Talbert is excellent in his role as the abused teen as he really has a lot of passion in the performance and I think it's fair to say that he perfectly handles the emotional challenges of the role. Bates is also good in her supporting bit as is James Van Der Beek and Richards. The real scene stealer is George C. Scott who is just so tender and fun here as the advice giving grandfather. The film certainly borrows some from CARRIE but this here is just played for laughs and its message. The film isn't a masterpiece but for its type it's very charming and fun to watch.".

By the time it was over I was pumped to have stumbled on to it.Angus Bethune is such an easy character to like and to pull for. I loved how at the climax of the film they way Angus stands up for himself isn't really what we wanted to see but it turns out to be even better.His mom and grandpa are great and their dinner table banter is awesome. The way the two of them support Angus in their own ways really works out for him well in the end.Van Der Beek is great as the high school villain. I haven't seen a ton of his workmost of what I've seen has been his selfeffacing Internet stuff so I find him to be a likable guy. It is a testament to his acting ability then that he was able to portray such an unsavory character so early in his career.I love the way that Angus' secret crush Melissa was treated. We see a lot of her but don't hear a thing from her for most of the film. We make assumptions about her based upon her standing at school and when she finally opens her mouth we are proved wrong.The flag pole scene is such an apt depiction of an embarrassing adolescent momentwe get glimpses of what it looks like through Angus' eyes and just when you think it couldn't possibly get any worse holy ! We've all had moments like that.All in all this was just a fun movie with a great message. Screw 'em! Easy to say tough to do. The world would be a much better place if we were all better at doing it.".

There are many comedic moments that suddenly crash with dramatic situations that could make anyone cry. I mean the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker specially before grandpa dies but then it picks up the teenager situations.Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend and then loses the most important person in his life  his grand father.Now this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying death loneliness etc.Recommended.".

I would have given it 1010 but I felt James VanDer Beek as the popular but mean jock was a bit too two dimensional. Believe it or not the key reason I saw it was due to the clip of a dance I saw on Film'96 with the Mazzy Star song 'Fade Into You' being played. This song is exquisite and they also used Love Spit Love's 'Am I right' in the movie. I go with my gut instinct a lot with films and I was not disappointed. I know this was a small release but I honestly think if you trust me on this one you won't regret it. Angus is a lovely gem of a film for anyone who wanted a movie were the boy with a heart of gold gets to have his day.".

	schema:reviewBody "German movies about the Nazi dictatorship are usually heavily subsidised but nothing to write home about which actually goes for most German movies these days. Jud S  Film ohne Gewissen by Oscar Roehler stands out because it tries to go beyond the simplistic message that the Nazis were evil. Instead it honestly tries to explore the fact why an actor who didn't sympathise with the Nazis nevertheless chose to play lead in Veit Harlan's antisemitic masterpiece. We witness Ferdinand Marian getting sucked deep into the heart of darkness. Oscar Roehler also takes a good look at the sexual life of the fascist bohme with an impressive performance by Gudrun Landgrebe who looks unbelievably foxy despite her sixty years of age.This was also the only movie I can think of that displays survivors of the Nazi death machine not as saintly survivors but as brutalised human beings.That said I take umbrage at four aspects of this movie the  pardon my French  overly drastic fellatio scene between Goebbels and housemaid Britta who wears a golden swastika pendant to hammer home the fact that she's a Nazi slag and while I'm at it the actress playing her Anna Unterberger is far to blonde and svelte for a realistic housemaid in the movie Ferdinand Marian's wife Anna is a semiJewess who is eventually murdered by the Nazis while Marian lives the high life of a Nazi Alist actor in reality she wasn't Jewish although she had previously been married to a Jew and in consequence her daughter was half Jewish and survived her husband by three years in my book that alteration was hammy and unfair game unlike displayed in the movie Marian probably died in an ordinary traffic accident and didn't commit suicide I didn't get the scene where Marian is in a nightclub in Prague with a transvestite also in that same scene we see a German soldier firing into the crowd with his Luger a histrionic scene which would have resulted in carnage plus a court martial for the shooterYou have to view these criticisms in the light that this movie was booed at the Berlinale ostracised by many critics and the highest Jewish representative in Germany even called for it to be banned. Of course everyone is free to dislike and criticise this movie but I simply don't understand what caused this massive rejection of a serious wellmade and captivating movie.PS for reference if you want a movie that really deals with Nazism in an inappropriate manner check out Der Vorleser.".

Jud S  Film ohne Gewissen by Oscar Roehler stands out because it tries to go beyond the simplistic message that the Nazis were evil. Instead it honestly tries to explore the fact why an actor who didn't sympathise with the Nazis nevertheless chose to play lead in Veit Harlan's antisemitic masterpiece. We witness Ferdinand Marian getting sucked deep into the heart of darkness. Oscar Roehler also takes a good look at the sexual life of the fascist bohme with an impressive performance by Gudrun Landgrebe who looks unbelievably foxy despite her sixty years of age.This was also the only movie I can think of that displays survivors of the Nazi death machine not as saintly survivors but as brutalised human beings.That said I take umbrage at four aspects of this movie the  pardon my French  overly drastic fellatio scene between Goebbels and housemaid Britta who wears a golden swastika pendant to hammer home the fact that she's a Nazi slag and while I'm at it the actress playing her Anna Unterberger is far to blonde and svelte for a realistic housemaid in the movie Ferdinand Marian's wife Anna is a semiJewess who is eventually murdered by the Nazis while Marian lives the high life of a Nazi Alist actor in reality she wasn't Jewish although she had previously been married to a Jew and in consequence her daughter was half Jewish and survived her husband by three years in my book that alteration was hammy and unfair game unlike displayed in the movie Marian probably died in an ordinary traffic accident and didn't commit suicide I didn't get the scene where Marian is in a nightclub in Prague with a transvestite also in that same scene we see a German soldier firing into the crowd with his Luger a histrionic scene which would have resulted in carnage plus a court martial for the shooterYou have to view these criticisms in the light that this movie was booed at the Berlinale ostracised by many critics and the highest Jewish representative in Germany even called for it to be banned. Of course everyone is free to dislike and criticise this movie but I simply don't understand what caused this massive rejection of a serious wellmade and captivating movie.PS for reference if you want a movie that really deals with Nazism in an inappropriate manner check out Der Vorleser.";

	schema:headline " New Jud Sss strikes a sensitive German nerve in Berlin";
	schema:reviewBody "JUD S Jew Sweet was the title of a film commissioned by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in 1940 to be made as an antiSemitic vehicle intended to inflame the German people against the Jews of Germany and set the stage for their extermination. Jud S  Film ohne Gewissen Jud S  A Film Without a Conscience is the title of a new film by ace German director Oskar Roehler which goes back to 1940 to tell the story behind the making of the most notorious film in German cinema history  which in his own title he calls A film without a conscience.The original Jud S is still considered to be so racist and inflammatory that it is legally banned from public screenings in Germany and prints of the film can be seen only at rare special screenings for academic personnel under strict supervision the picture being regarded even now as an an evergreen piece of racist propaganda which might still incite neoNazis in Germany to violence against Jews.Surprisingly this clearly wellintentioned film by a leading German director of liberal persuasion was greeted with boos of hysterical outrage by elements of the German critical establishment at the general press screening. No other competition film this year was booed clearly a still highly sensitive Germanic nerve was struck. Those who were against the film didn't just dislike it  they HATED it and surely not on esthetic grounds alone. Jud S Film ohne Gewissen' is essentially a film about a film and to some extent a film within a film as extensive portions of the reconstructed original film are shown which basically follows the rise and fall of the actor Ferdinand Marian who was forced to play the leading role in Josef Goebbels' fiercely antiSemitic 1940 film 'Jud Suess'. No clich goose stepping soldiers are to be seen in this picture which is set among the elitepolite society of the Nazi era providing an unusual view of the period and the people behind the scenes. At the very beginning of the film Goebbels a highly manic but extremely savvy Moritz Bleibtreu spots Marian at a rehearsal of Shakespeare's Othello playing Iago and concludes that he will be perfect for the title role of his planned antiSemitic propaganda film Jew Suss. Marian balks fearing the role might actually injure his career but Goebbels cannot be dissuaded and Marian is compelled into playing the title role of the film which becomes a gigantic hit and makes him an overnight star. However his beautiful halfJewish wife Martina Gedeck senses danger and begs him not to return to Germany when they attend the Premiere of the film at the 1940 Venice Film Festival in Italy. They could go to Casablanca says she and from there take a boat to America  shades of Rick's Cafe! And here a cute insert we are informed that the film has been highly praised by a young Italian critic with the remarkable name of Michelangelo Antonioni!Marian does go back to bask in his new found glory but as the war progresses Jewish wife Dora is carted off to Auschwitz and He finds himself in a position much the same as that of the actor in Mephisto who was manipulated by the Nazis against his will to promote the aims of the Third Reich in Hungarian Istvan Szabo's 1981 Oscar winning film of that name. Austrian actor Tobias Morreti plays Ferdinand Marian much as Klaus Maria Brandauer also Austrian played actor Hendrik Hoefgren in Szabo's Mephisto  as a puppet manipulated by the Nazis and finally destroyed by them. Many German critics found Moritz Bleibtreu's Goebbels way too over the top but the actor defended himself saying that this Goebbels was meant to be a satire not a documentary portrait and this is precisely what rubbed the Nazi still lurking in the bones of many of these critics the wrong way. How dare you make fun of such a key figure of German history!  I personally found Bleibtreu's Goebbels extremely effective and satirically hypnotic  arguably the best thing he has done to date.Perhaps another point that didn't go down too well with the hypersensitive antiNazi German critics was the fact that Goebbels is presented not as a madman but as an extremely clever master of propaganda who knew that propaganda has to be subtle in order to be effective. No dummy he the notorious Nazi propaganda minister and a very canny portrayal by Herr Bleibtreu indeed one that in this writers's humble opinion should have won the Best Actor Silver Bear by a mile.Katja Nicodemus main critic of the intellectual German weekly Die Zeit came right out and called a Spade a Spade the day after the controversial Press screening saying As a German  I am shocked by the reaction of the German press to this film. What all this means in terms of collective German guilt feelings over the role of Germany as Genocide Inc. during WW II is really hard to sum up nicely. There are clearly many Germans still around who would prefer to see the whole thing swept under the carpet or at least portrayed in a more savory documentary manner. Maybe some politically overcorrect Germans didn't like the fact that Roehler took the liberty of having his actors sing the banned Nazi anthem Deutschland ber Alles in full at a Christmas party near the beginning of the film  too realistic nicht wahr? Und isn't this supposed to be a VERBOTEN song!  One thing that can certainly be said however without making any bones about it is that Oskar Roehler's new film is definitely a film WITH a conscience about a film with a purely Nazi conscience. And if they don't like that  well one can only wonder about the Collective Unconscious of the booers.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was rejected at Berlinale for a good reason. Moritz Bleibtreu an  in my eyes overbooked yet middle class actor  played Dr. Goebbels as badly as a character can be played. There are basically three ways he could have approached his role as Dr. Goebbels precisely sticking to the historic figure e.g. Bruno Ganz in Der Untergang a parody  mockery Charly Chaplin in The Great Dictator and his own independent interpretation Robert Carlyle in The Rise of Evil. He was not capable to choose any of them and attempted a rather embarrassing mix. As we know from the few YouTube movies showing the real Goebbels this man was able to speak very clearly and well accentuated carefully pronouncing each word with his slight Rheinland accent. Bleibtreu is attempting to imitate this accent but since he obviously never has learned to pronounce clearly a talent now too often missing at modern German actors it only sounds funny but not like Goebbels. It is also a wellknown fact that Gobbels limped slightly the accent is on slightly yet Bleibtreu plays him as an almost invalid! At other times he forgets to limb at all! The third and in my eyes most despicable fact is Bleibtreus overacting in a movie which is about the very magic of not overacting! like Marian as Jud S. He is shouting playing a roaring and rampaging moron who tries to appear devilish and only makes himself a laughing stock as an actor. By the way the blowjob Britta is giving Gobbels was cut out in the German cinema version. Historic facts have been klittered German word meaning gluing together what every you can find in an extreme way. Too many wrong mistakes for writing them down. The movies deserve 2 stars at max and only for the fact that Ferdinand Marian was so exceptionally well played by Tobias Moretti. I can only recommend buying the real Jud S at Amazon.com to compare.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing given the premise";
	schema:reviewBody "Jud Sss  Film ohne Gewissen is a German movie from 5 years ago written and directed by Oskar Roehler. Roehler is one of the most successful German filmmakers right now and here he adapted Friedrich Knilli's book for this controversial movie. It runs for almost 2 hours and features Tobias Moretti Kommissar Rex as the title character. This film will do absolutely nothing for you if you do not know already about the events that are depicted in there. You so not necessarily have to have seen the original Jud S but it helps. However you really need to know about the film's contents and also a bit about Marian Harlan Goebbels... And even if this applies to me that I do know about all of this as I am particularly interested in the Nazi years and World War II I was still disappointed by the movie. It is tough to point a finger on what exactly went wrong. It may be the script. The actors exclude many big names at least here in Germany. I will not list the names but you can check the cast to see them. Roehler once again works with 2 actors who I am a bit surprised to see in here Bauer Stadlober. He has a tendency of casting popular actors that do not have that much talent really. But as long as they are just in smaller roles it's fine for me.Anyway the premise here is excellent. It was a really interesting time for movies in Germany and as despicable as propaganda films may be it's still interesting to watch them and figure out how they could alter people's minds back then. It's a film about a film. But it's also a film about Ferdinand Marian's life around that time. We find out about his wife and how that relationship made things really complicated in every regard. But we also find out about his thought process and how Goebbels basically forced him to accept the role. Still his doubts were mostly not because he despised the propaganda but because people would see him as a Jew. Back then films were something entirely different. Audiences thought frequently actors would also personify with their characters in real life even if that may sound absurd by today's standards. Anyway all in all I was pretty disappointed here. This film has not many interesting scenes really and it also drags and should have been kept a lot shorter. They certainly missed a chance here of turning a truly interesting story into an interesting film. I was particularly disappointed by Bleibtreu who offered absolutely nothing as Goebbels here apart from overthetop face expressions and screaming. This was a disappointing work. Not recommended.".

Hence some of the dialog was rather lost on me and very likely some of the drama as well.I primarily viewed this film not for the story but in the hopes of spectacular mountain scenery and spectacular mountain climbing sequences. There was some of this but not nearly enough for my tastes or I would have given the film a higher rating. A better film also German but available with English subtitles is North Face Nordwand IMDb tt0844457 which is both very dramatic and has very spectacular mountain climbing sequences although I still wanted more there as well.To my mind the best parts of the film took place in Pakistan and in the Pakistani Himalayan foothills.

I love seeing exotic locales like that which I am unlikely to see otherwise and I found the film worth my time just for that.

They had little food no climbing gear and especially no warm clothes with them. Equipped this way they had to bivouac basically to sit down on the snow and try to sleep without any protection from the cold or blowing snow two nights above 6500m. That is terrible terrible hard to endure. The scenes when they bivouac are hard to look at because we image what it must have been. I had a few nights of sleep in cold but not freezing temperatures and it's awful I cannot image what those guys went through. Looking at the film now I think it shows what kind of a person Reinhold is this must be the reason he survived through all his altitude climbs he must be a very rare type of person with an extremely tough and enduring type of organism.This movie also remembers me about the first climber to summit the Nanga Parbat peak Hermann Buhl who also had to bivouac near the summit in a standing position for a whole night before the descent.Finally this is not just a mountaineering film as the climbing scenes began only at half of the projection.".

Indeed Joseph Vilsmeier Bergkristall knows how to impressively film nature and rigid landscapes. Never known as brilliant filmmaker Vilsmeier knows how to routinely produce quick cheap and efficient filmsforTV director and knows how to handle his landscapephotography.The weakest link among the actors is actor Karl Markovics or rather his portrayal of expedition leader Karl Maria Herligkoffer whether the portrayal is accurate Messner had been fighting many bitter legal battles until Herligkoffers death in 1991 or fictional which many expedition members claim I cannot tell. But Markovics known to GermanAustrian TVviewers as Inspector Stockinger plays the role like it was a caricature of 'The Fuehrer' a man stuck firmly in the 1930's ethos throwing blood and honour speeches you'd almost expect him to wear a brown uniform and give a Sieg Heilsalute any minute. Only later once Messner and his brother have started their fateful journey do we see some humanity but by that time we've already identified the character Herligkoffer as some leftover fascist.In contrast stands the figure of Florian Stetters Reinhold Messner who at the beginning of the movie faces his nemesis Herligkoffer like a Christlike figure marked by his Nanga Parbat experience and walking on crutches yet dignified righteous victorious even. Yes Reinhold Messner is primarily known for his expeditions and only secondarily for his larger than life ego. Alas for both Messner and the audience Stetter isn't the actor to carry a movie  especially not a movie about a larger than life figure like Messner. His performance reeks of television routine rattling down his lines leaving the audience to wonder why they should cheer for such protagonist. Same goes for Andreas Tobias playing Messners doomed brother Guenther who had appeared in a number of TVseries and production prior to Nanga Parbat and nothing much since. Well perhaps acting isn't meant for everybody.What's left are some beautiful filmed mountain climbs  especially during the first part of the film beware if you're not comfortable with great heights this movie might not be for you  and an often riveting mountaineerdrama. Drama because if you're looking for an authentic documentations of the actual events you might be disappointed. If authenticity is what you're looking for watch 2007's To The Limit.I'd give the film generous 6 points from 10.".

Alas for both Messner and the audience Stetter isn't the actor to carry a movie  especially not a movie about a larger than life figure like Messner. His performance reeks of television routine rattling down his lines leaving the audience to wonder why they should cheer for such protagonist. Same goes for Andreas Tobias playing Messners doomed brother Guenther who had appeared in a number of TVseries and production prior to Nanga Parbat and nothing much since. Well perhaps acting isn't meant for everybody.What's left are some beautiful filmed mountain climbs  especially during the first part of the film beware if you're not comfortable with great heights this movie might not be for you  and an often riveting mountaineerdrama. Drama because if you're looking for an authentic documentations of the actual events you might be disappointed. If authenticity is what you're looking for watch 2007's To The Limit.I'd give the film generous 6 points from 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nanga Parbat is a German movie from 5 years ago that runs for 100 minutes and was directed by Joseph Vilsmaier a filmmaker for many decades already. It deals with the Messner Brothers climbing the mountain in the title and is based on real events. I am fairly certain that most Germans over the age of 20 still know today who Reinhold Messner is even if he is already in his 70s now. And most are probably also vaguely aware of his most heartbreaking expedition the one during which he lost his brother. And that is the one this film is about. I am probably a bit biased here. First of all I never found Messner likable and second of all I never understood the concept of faster further higher and you probably have to in order to understand Messner's efforts or a appreciate a movie that centers around him. Death certainly was an option and I cannot see why anybody would risk his life for this one especially as it does nothing good to other people. Yes it may have to do with personal goals but still in this context I do not understand why this would be a personal goal for anybody.Florian Stetter does a decent job as the lead actor but I found Markovics almost as memorable. He is good as usual and always fun to watch. Like I said before the climbing scenes did nothing for me. The snowcovered mountains may have been a good watch but in terms of the story or the drama I did not really care. Also the brother relationship was not elaborated on convincingly in my opinion and this may have been the only aspect that could have saved the movie for me. So yeah I thought this would become a disappointment but still gave it a chance. It came as I expected mostly because the topic is fairly unappealing to me. If you like these kind of movies check out the in my opinion equally underwhelming Nordwand after watching Nanga Parbat. Seems to be a trend to use the mountains names for these films. Anyway I do not recommend the watch. Maybe the best aspect is still the music as it comes from 2time Academy Award winner Gustavo Santaolalla Brokeback Mountain Babel.".

Ever the selfcentered type he asked himself whether the construction workers were really there for a reason or just a bunch of freaks whose only perpose in life is to disturb his sleep.This simple idea eventually led to a hilarious satire of administration gone berserk. Bomba Tzur plays Blaumilch a madman who's obsessed with digging. He escapes from an asylum early one morning steals a pneumatic drill and starts digging up one of TelAviv's busiest streets! Within hours downtown Tel Aviv is reduced to a gigantic traffic jam the local residents go insane and Mr. Blaumilch is having the time of his life. But when the officials of the Tel Aviv municipality get wind of this no one including the runty mayor knows who to give credit for this unexpected project nearsighted bureaucrats secretly blame each other for it. In the confusion nobody thinks to check what started the whole thing except our hero Ziegler which obviously nobody believes even when he eventually discovers the truth. Eventually city hall sends in reinforcements bulldozers and heavy machinery and the dig becomes a monstrous excavation which can only lead to disaster. Or perhaps not... This movie is terrific. Very well directed shot scored cast and acted by a who's who of Israel's best comic actors of the time. Director Kishon throws in some very clever setpieces. Excellent 60's atmosphere too. A winner.

Apart from its highly original idea of a lunatic digging a canal in the middle of a streetthis film was famous for its set design which consisted of a replica of a fictitious canal right in the middle of Tel Aviv city.A thing which might irk some feminist viewers is that this is a bit sexist in nature as there are numerous ribald jokes consisting of futile attempts made by office boss to seduce his beautiful secretary.

	onyx:emotionText "Apart from Lemon Popsicle series of films from Israelthere are not so many directors in the history of Israelian cinema who have made successful comedy films.If there is a man who has made enjoyable comedy films it is Iprahim Kishon.As he was primarily a great writerhe was able to infuse his writing talents in his films.It can be said about Iprahim Kishon's film Te'alat Blaumilch that its visual as well aesthetic style was completely different from the films made by other comic geniuses like Max LinderBuster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Apart from its highly original idea of a lunatic digging a canal in the middle of a streetthis film was famous for its set design which consisted of a replica of a fictitious canal right in the middle of Tel Aviv city.A thing which might irk some feminist viewers is that this is a bit sexist in nature as there are numerous ribald jokes consisting of futile attempts made by office boss to seduce his beautiful secretary. Iprahim Kishon made three great comic films and this film is one of those laugh riots which is surely going to drive you crazy with endless bouts of laughter.";

It's a nightmare for the residents who appeal to the government to do something. But because the government is made up of idiot bureaucrats now that's a stretch nothing is done. After all the officials reason someone must have ordered this work to be done. Much of the film consists of these officials trying desperately to cover their butts and pretty soon they start taking credit for the messsaying it's all part of a wonderful beautification project. They even order MORE workers to expand the project! However one lowly official realizes the worker is insane but no one will listen.It's a clever idea of bureaucracy gone madan excellent parody for any developed nation. But all too often the film seemed to have acting direction and music that all worked together to try too hard to make the film kooky. I think a more serious and less slapstick approach would have worked better as this film has almost a Sherwood Schwartz quality about it he's the guy responsible for Gilligan's Island. Not badbut it should have been better.".

	schema:headline " The greatest horror slasher movie of all time the best one in the franchise clever  unique my personal favorite number 1 slasher";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my personal favorite horror slasher movies period it is my number 1 personal favorite horror film in the Elm Street series I never replace this movie with a sequel because it is one of the greatest clever and creative films ever made of all time. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic the original the greatest classic horror slasher movie of all time. I love this film to death I am huge fan of this movie it is dear to my heart. I have a poster of this movie hang on a door in my room my girlfriend give it to me as my birthday present. This movie was so successful that it spawned 6 sequels a TV show a recent remake and countless merchandise. This movie is 10 the best in horror genre ever. The best one in the franchise it is so unique and clever that it grabs you from your seats. It was written and directed by master of horror him self Wes Craven R.I.P. It is really a tragedy that he died in August 30 2015 I remember people making video responses to men who gave us Freddy Krueger and wonderful horror films in the decades I have seen some of his movies and I really miss the legend. I love the soundtrack playing on the end of credits Nightmare by 213 one of the best songs ever. I love the cast in the movie so much. A horribly disfigured man with knives for fingers stalks and kills teens in their dreams and subsequently real life. The original A Nightmare on Elm Street stands head and shoulders above every other movie in the series for a variety of reasons. Obviously it has the originality factor going for it introducing audiences to Freddy and his evil work but it is also much darker than the other films. Freddy isn't the comedian cracking cheesy oneliners every time he slaughters a teenager but he still has a subtly dark sense of humor that draws viewers in. The film has great pacing and special effects with far and away the best final act of the series.Heather Langenkamp is the best as Nancy Thompson she is my favorite horror actress of all time Heather was unique heroine who has to fight against Freddy Krueger Robert Englund who stalks Nancy and her friends in their dreams and hunts and kills them one by one. Nancy finds out a dark secret in her family and why Freddy is hunting her. She try's to warn her friends her parents no one believes her that Freddy is real and alive. She has to fight for survival her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. The bathtub scene is my favorite in the film in which Nancy is sleeping in the bath and you can see Freddy's glove with knives for fingers try's to stab Nancy instead he try's do drown her in the bathtub but she manages to swim back up to the opening of her bathtub and pulls herself to safety badass scene.Nancy Thompson was so clever beautiful badass smart and intense carefully she out smart Freddy. She put booby traps for Freddy Awesome! Jonny Depp is badass as Glen Lantz he is so awesome and he plays his character so believable. He later played Tom Hanson in 21 Jump Street he was so good in the 80's and convincible playing his character he should be the hero in this movie. Robert Englund is the only one and a real horror creep scary Freddy Kruger only Robert could play a character like this. He is the best horror icon ever. Sorry but Jackie Earle Haley is not Freddy Krueger that will always be Robert Englund. He played In 8 films Freddy Krueger and in TV series the character. Freddy Krueger is a horror icon ever.A Nightmare on Elm Street stars John Saxon Ronee Blakley Heather Langenkamp Amanda Wyss Nick Corri Johnny Depp and Robert Englund.Amanda Wyss as Christina Tina Gray was excellent as Nancy's friend from school who had a the same dream about the same disfigured man with knives for fingers who is stalking her. John Saxon as Lt. Thompson is so great in the film as Nancy father trying to figure it out the murders and helping her daughter out. We can all say A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic the best one in the Elm Street series it is Wes Craven's best film to date. In which Freddy Krueger is scary villain he is not a comedian like he was in the sequels. There is a lot of gore special effects in the film a lot of blood. It is rated R bloody disgusting slasher movie ever. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 favorite slasher horror film.".

On August 30th 2015 Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare Scream ShockerThe People Under the Stairs Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross 26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 to become an ongoing franchise and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street Scream  New Nightmare Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. The first film is so original realistic and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put boobytraps for Freddy? Awesome!Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractiveand gives 100 as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100 superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.A Nightmare On Elm Street 1984 is the best classic slasher filmone of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film it is fast paced entertaining not boring or over long film but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 1010 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

	schema:reviewBody "The teenagers of Springfield Illinois are having nightmares. Tina and her best friend Nancy learn that they're dreaming about the same creature a hideously burned man in a dirty red and green sweater who bears an odd weapon a glove with razor fingers. When Tina is brutally murdered in her bed one night suspicion falls upon her volatile boyfriend Rod who was the only other person in the room with Tina when she died. But Rod swears he didn't do it and tells Nancy that he too has been suffering from terrible nightmares in which a knife fingered man is trying to kill him. Nancy begins to suspect that something evil is happening within their dreams and that perhaps the boogeyman is real. When Rod turns up dead in his jail cell Nancy is convinced that a ghostly killer is stalking them in their sleep. Her mother worried for Nancy's sanity takes her to a dream clinic where her sleep patterns can be monitored. When Nancy awakens screaming from a nightmare with a bloody slash mark on her arm she shows her mother and the doctor what she has pulled out of her dream the battered fedora that the killer always wears. The hat bears a name tag Fred Krueger. Nancy's mother recognizes the name and soon tells Nancy the story of a brutal child killer who had terrorized the town many years ago. When he was released on a technicality Nancy's parents and the parents of the other nightmareplagued children hunted Fred Krueger down and burned him alive. Fred Krueger is dead but he's found a way to return and wreak vengeance upon the children of his killers. Nancy knows that she must find a way to stop him before he kills her and everyone else on Elm Street.I just sat down and watched this movie again the other day and it's still damn impressive. The acting isn't always the greatest and it looks just the slightest bit dated but it's still a really damn good movie. It's power lies in the fact that sleep cannot be avoided. In so many other horror movies the victims are nothing more than vapid cattle wandering dumbly up the slaughterhouse chute and calling out Is anyone there? as they go up. They purposefully get themselves into stupid and dangerous situations and therefore we feel no real pity for them when they are eviscerated. However in A Nightmare On Elm Street all the characters have to do to endanger themselves is to go to sleep. Even the most hardcore insomniac like myself knows that eventually sleep will come for you it is unavoidable. We cannot blame our cast for wandering around doing stupid things in their dreams because how many of us have had dreams in which we show up for work naked? Very rarely are we in control of our dreams and in A Nightmare On Elm Street the only person in control is Freddy Krueger. Robert Englund as Freddy is flawless. Before this movie was released the boogeymen of horror films had always been hulking silent expressionless shapes usually hidden way behind masks. Not that there's anything wrong with that! But Englund gave us a new kind of Boogeyman  a smartass. Freddy is hideously burned covered in scar tissue and has all the fashion sense of a wino but he's cool. Not content to simply disembowel his screaming victims Freddy has to tease them a little first flirting humiliating or showing off. He makes Tina watch him cut off his own fingers and smiles at her like a drunken uncle who's just pulled a coin out from behind her ear. He sticks his tongue in Nancy's mouth via her telephone. He doesn't waste his sense of humor on the guys in this film but there's plenty of sequels in which he makes up for that. This is such a great innovative film filled with pretty cool special effects disturbing sound effects including scraping metal fingernails and baby goats bleating in terror and creepy music. The boiler room is an especially unnerving set complete with hissing pipes and dripping chains. A young Johnny Depp and his feathery 80s hair make their debut in this film as well and though his character is about half a million miles away from Captain Jack Sparrow the raw talent is still very much in evidence here. This remains the best movie of the Elm Street series with a few good sequels and some really crappy ones. But Freddy is always worth watching.".

Tina and her best friend Nancy learn that they're dreaming about the same creature a hideously burned man in a dirty red and green sweater who bears an odd weapon a glove with razor fingers. When Tina is brutally murdered in her bed one night suspicion falls upon her volatile boyfriend Rod who was the only other person in the room with Tina when she died. But Rod swears he didn't do it and tells Nancy that he too has been suffering from terrible nightmares in which a knife fingered man is trying to kill him. Nancy begins to suspect that something evil is happening within their dreams and that perhaps the boogeyman is real.

Wes Craven brought us one of the most terrifying ideas what would happen if your nightmares were real? That if you died in your dream you died in real life? He brought us A Nightmare on Elm Street a low budget horror film that has made it huge in the horror genre's world. The whole concept of the film is just what makes it so brilliant. Not to mention how cool is it that this is Johnny Depp's first film role? Who knew that that kid was going to be so huge one day right? But the entire cast made this into one of the scariest movies that will always bring you a few nightmares on it's own.Tina is a girl who has been having tons of nightmares about a scary figure a man who is severely burned and has knives for fingers. She's so scared of this man that she asks her friends Nancy Nancy's boyfriend Glenn and her boyfriend Rod to stay over. But Tina is brutally killed in the middle of the night the only witness is her boyfriend leaving him as the suspect of murder. But when he is murdered in jail Nancy knows there's something wrong and soon she's having the same nightmares as Tina. Soon she knows that she might be next no one believes her until her mom reveals a deep dark secret about the mysterious figure Freddy Krueger. He was a sick child molesterkiller who the neighbors burned alive to keep him away but now he's after their kids and he's not going to take it easy on Nancy.A classic horror film that's perfect for a sleep over with your friends to watch in the dark. It's such a great film that sparked quite a few sequels and a new icon for slasher films. Freddy Krueger is so cool and extremely scary just for the fact that he's so confident in knowing that he will kill you. He's ruthless scary and clever and he's coming to kill the kids in their dreams. A Nightmare on Elm Street is such a great film and I highly recommend it Wes Craven is an original genius who spawned a new type of terror.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "While I love horror films I am not a big fan of the slasher genre which has come to dominate and indeed practically to define horror since the late 1970s. While I do love the original Psycho most slasher films follow a different and far more predictable formula. The idea of a faceless killer going around stabbing teenagers just doesn't frighten me a whole lot though some of these films do fill me with disgusta rather different sort of emotion.I am far more frightened by films that deal with distortions of reality where it's hard for the characters to tell what's real and what's not. Admittedly that genre isn't always so lofty either. Dreams are one of the most overused devices in the movies having a whole set of clichs associated with them. We are all familiar with the common scene in which a character awakens from a nightmare by jerking awake in cold sweat. This convention is not only overused it's blatantly unrealistic for people waking up from dreams do not jerk awake in such a violent fashion. Moreover these scenes are usually nothing more than little throwaway sequences designed to amuse or frighten the audience without advancing the plot.What makes Nightmare on Elm Street so clever is how it creates an entirely new convention for representing dreams on screen. The dreaming scenes are filmed with an airy murky quality but so are many of the waking scenes making it very difficult to tell whether a character is awake or asleep. Indeed the movie never shows any character actually fall asleep and as a result we are constantly on guard whenever characters so much as close their eyes for a moment. In crucial scenes it is impossible to tell whether what we are seeing is real or happening only in a character's mind. But the movie ultimately suggests that the difference doesn't matter. The premise of the movie in which a childkiller haunts teenager's dreams and has the capability of killing them while they're asleep turns the whole It was all just a dream convention on its head in this movie the real world is safe and the dream world is monstrously dangerous.The movie finds a number of ways to explore this ambiguity including a bathtub scene that invites comparisons with the shower scene in Psycho without being a cheap ripoff. My personal favorite scene and one of the scariest I've ever seen in a movie is the one where Nancy dozes off in the classroom while a student is standing up in front of the class reading a passage from Shakespeare. The way the scene transitions from the real classroom to a nightmarish version of it is brilliantly subtle.The director Wes Craven understood that the anticipation of danger is usually more frightening than the final attack. There are some great visual shots to that effect including one where Freddy's arms becomes unnaturally long in an alleyway and another where the stairs literally turn into a gooey substance in imitation of the common nightmare where it is hard to get away from a pursuer. The movie continually finds creative ways to tease the audience never resorting to red herring that tired old convention used in almost all other slasher films.Despite the creativity in these scenes A Nightmare on Elm Street is still a formula movie with relatively onedimensional characters and no great performances. This was Johnny Depp's first role as Heather Langenkamp's boyfriend and although he does get a few neat lines of exposition his speech about dream skills his personality is not fleshed out and there is no sense of the great actor Depp would go on to become.Within the genre however A Nightmare on Elm Street is a fine work. My main criticism isn't its failure to transcend the formula but its confusing and obtuse ending apparently put there in anticipation of sequels but managing to create a mystery that the sequels were unable to clear up. The climactic confrontation between Freddy and Nancy is weakly handled. The crucial words she says to him are surprisingly clunky and her father's muted behavior during that scene is almost inexplicable. It has led me to consider an alternative interpretation of the scene but one that feels like a copout. The scene that follows and where the movie ends is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsilymade final two scenes come close to ruining the movie and it is a testament to the film's many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings.".

Another thing is the concept. Yes the story of course is just simply ridiculous at times but it's the perfect concept to fill a movie with with some scary scene's and brutal killings with tons of blood.The movie has the same scary gritty atmosphere like a horror movie from the 70's when the horror genre was at an alltime high. The actors are giving their best but some of the dialog is just plain cheesy. Still I think that the actors should deserve more credit then they are getting right now especially Johnny Depp made a impressive movie debut. The talent was already showing back then. His role in this movie was way bigger than I expected it to be by the way.Really entertaining horror classic. Some things might look cheesy especially the ending I really laughed my butt off! and the story in general but the atmosphere gore and Kruger make up everything!

	schema:reviewBody "If Sean Cunningham John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper defined the horror genre in the late 70's early 80's then Wes Craven destroyed it not only once but twice with Scream. However before Scream there was A Nightmare On Elm St and before there was the ghostface there was Freddy Krueger bastard son of 100 maniacs. Up until this point horror was very predictable most films adhered to the 'rules' of horror if you have no idea what the rules are they are simply the 'virgin' survives if you have sex you die if you drink or get high you die and never say I'll be right back cause u won't for more details see Randy in the Scream Trilogy. In 1984 this little film came out about a murderer who killed you in your dreams.It was a seemingly simple concept but it was terrifying to see the main character Nancy played brilliantly by a young Heather Langenkamp battling not only her adversary the irrepressible Robert Englund but the trauma's of her alcoholic mother smothering and absent father their divorce her idea that she might be going crazy and sleep as she deduces from fairly early on that if she sleeps she dies.

Craven makes you comfortable by having you believe that everything is ok that it was all just a lil dream and dreams can't really hurt you that is until the very end. It shocks you leaving to come to your own deductions similar to the ending of The Exorcist it is up to you to judge who triumphed good or evil.When you think about it what was worse for Nancy the stalking of Freddy or her gradual sleep depravation how long can anyone survive in their right mind with no sleep. Plus it also demonstrates that at the core of those sleepy American towns something is rotten. The image of these surbanites in the form of Nancy and her friends parents forming a mob and setting fire to Freddy Krueger is in a sense more frightening than the child molesting murdering image of Freddy himself. Craven like Stephen King likes to illustrate in his work that some of the most horrid things happen in small quite towns. Maybe because around these times America was reeling from the emergence of numerous serial killers. Whatever the reason this film is a classic for so many reasons and I dare anyone to tell me different!!".

	onyx:emotionText "If Sean Cunningham John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper defined the horror genre in the late 70's early 80's then Wes Craven destroyed it not only once but twice with Scream. However before Scream there was A Nightmare On Elm St and before there was the ghostface there was Freddy Krueger bastard son of 100 maniacs. Up until this point horror was very predictable most films adhered to the 'rules' of horror if you have no idea what the rules are they are simply the 'virgin' survives if you have sex you die if you drink or get high you die and never say I'll be right back cause u won't for more details see Randy in the Scream Trilogy. In 1984 this little film came out about a murderer who killed you in your dreams.It was a seemingly simple concept but it was terrifying to see the main character Nancy played brilliantly by a young Heather Langenkamp battling not only her adversary the irrepressible Robert Englund but the trauma's of her alcoholic mother smothering and absent father their divorce her idea that she might be going crazy and sleep as she deduces from fairly early on that if she sleeps she dies. Nancy was a character that you cared about.

	schema:reviewBody "I love A Nightmare On Elm Street. Every time i watch this i think it has a terrific energy and strength running through it. I like the way the film starts with Freddy Kruegar making his Finger Knife Glove in his basement cellar then the music kicks in what a creepy score as the first teenager is frantically running around his mazelike Boiler Room in her dream state. Freddy is only hinted at in the shadows or ripping through cloth with his glove and i love the way you can hear animals and creepy noises emitting from all around Tina as she becomes cornered before Freddy comes out of the shadows. A great opening.Tina Grey is played by Amanda Wyss who is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. I always remember her character in this film the way i remember the Chrissie Watkins character at the start of Jaws i think you know what i'm coming too. Tina's encounter with Freddy in her backyard is my favourite moment in this film and it is one of the most horrifying deaths I've ever seen. Its frightening to see and if you are faint hearted at splashing blood then look away because it is a screamer.Heather Langenkamp is excellent in this film. Shes very attractiveand gives 100 as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. My favourite moments with Nancy are mostly her scary encounters with Freddy scored to an energetic music beat by Charles Bernstein. I would say part of the movie's success is down to his creepy score. I also love the bathroom scene when Nancy falls asleep absolutely gross and hilarious at the same time. The thing is these 'funny' moments are actual imagines of how Freddy wants to prey on his victims before killing them this is done in this first film with a measured discipline then you watch The Dream Master and Freddy is basically killing kids while being 100 comic about it as well.One of my favourite other scenes in this film is when Nancy is following Tina's corpse down her School halls having falling asleepand runs into a prefect women who states 'Wheres your pass?' Nancy doesn't respond in kind and as she goes running down the hall the girl reveals herself to be Freddy 'No running in the hallway' an eerie moment that is funny too.Finally special mention must go to Robert Englund as Freddy Kruegar. This actor's contribution to the character is 100 superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. Rightfully so.A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror thriller and along with Halloween is one of the best horror movies ever made.".

Krueger was an evil child molester burned alive by the parents of the children he had slain in the past. Now years later he has reappeared in the nightmares of Elm Street's teenagers. Nancy Heather Langenkamp continually experiences these haunting visions in which the permanently scarred man chases her through the shadows of a boiler room  the same room in which he used to slay his helpless victims. Nancy considers her dreams to be typical nightmares one of her best friends is apparently sliced to death during a deep sleep in her home.Soon Nancy's dreams become worse and her boyfriend Glen Johnny Depp admits that he has also been experiencing unpleasant nightmares. Together they uncover the truth behind Krueger's death years ago and vow to stay awake as long as they can and strategize a plan to bring Krueger back into the real world and kill him once and for all.Loosely based on true events Wes Craven's inspiration for the tale originated after he reportedly read that a number of people across the world had died in their slumber. Blending fantasy with reality Craven wrote and directed one of the most iconic horror films of all time which  similar to Halloween before it  spawned an inferior legion of sequels and imitators all of which continue to pale in comparison to the original.The brilliance of A Nightmare on Elm Street is that it relies on psychological fear vs. cheap exploitation tricks. Halloween directed by John Carpenter and released in 1978 had resparked interest in the Hitchcockstyle horrorthrillers and A Nightmare on Elm Street builds upon this cleverly channeling the mystery surrounding dreams and using it as a gateway for chills and thrills. Midway through the movie a doctor played by Richard Fleischer tells Nancy's mother that the process of dreams  where do they come from?  has yet to be explained and the fact that all humans tend to have dreams on a regular basis is essentially why this film remains so scary even by today's standards. Some of the special effects are quite outdated but unlike the Nightmare imitators gore plays second to the plot and characters  something rare in a horror film.The sequels became sillier and gorier. Fred's name changed to the less menacing Freddy which we all now know him by he was given more screen time the makeup on his face was not quite as horrific he began to crack jokes more often and his voice evolved into a less demonic cackle. In the original Nightmare it is interesting to note that Freddy is rarely given screen time at all  we see his infamous hands wearing gloves with butter knives attached on the fingers to slice his victims we see his hat we see his sweater we see his outline in the darkness of the shadows but even when we finally see Freddy upclose Craven manages to keep the camera moving so that we never gain a distinct image of the killer. Now twenty years later there's no mystery anymore  Freddy's face is featured on the front cover for most of the films and his very presence has become the cornerstone of all the movies in the franchise. But in 1984 long before Craven predicted his character would become a huge part of modern pop culture Freddy was mysterious and not very funny at all.The acting is one of the film's weaknesses  Heather Langenkamp is never totally aweinspiring as Nancy truth be told although she does a decent job Depp  in his bigscreen debut  shows a sign of talent to come but basically mutters clichd dialogue most of the time. The costars are acceptable at best. However the greatest performance is  not surprisingly  by Robert Englund as Freddy who is in the film barely at all. Ironically as mentioned above this only makes the film succeed at scaring us.The direction is not as superb as Halloween and for that matter either is the film. Over the years Nightmare has arguably been given an overrated reputation although it is inferior to Halloween. However compared to some of the other socalled horror films released during the '80s  including Friday the 13th and other dumb slasher flicks  A Nightmare on Elm Street does seem to stand as one of the best horror films of the decade. Despite its flaws it is quite smart with a surprise final ending and one of cinema's greatest villains lurking at the core.A Nightmare on Elm Street is really Nancy's story. The film focuses on Nancy's troubles Nancy's dreams and Nancy's actions. The ending of the film becomes a bit muddled  the booby traps are unfortunately a bit goofy and Freddy helplessly almost humorously chasing Nancy around her home supposedly trying to murder her is something the film could have done without  but overall it is a satisfying mixture of horror thriller and fantasy a movie that taps into two seldomrecognized everyday events in human life which are sleeping and dreaming. Craven's ability to realize this unknown fear in a movie is needless to say quite fascinating. A Nightmare on Elm Street is not a great movie but for horror buffs it is a mustsee and for nonhorrorbuffs there is a fair amount of other elements to sustain one's interest.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece of modern horror! Still the best in the series!";
	schema:reviewBody "After such gruesome drivein flicks as The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes master of horror Wes Craven wanted to make a movie that would bring the slasher genre back to life since the genre was clouded by untalented unoriginal films that shouldn't have been made. So along came A Nightmare on Elm Street. To this day Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood Nancy Thompson Tina Gray Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?A Nightmare on Elm Street created a terrifying villain a plot that is very original and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is or Jason Voorhees or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen.

If horror movies got nominations Englund would be first in line to win the award.Craven's direction is perfect. He films A Nightmare on Elm Street with a great amount of flair and he provides plenty of gore that will satisfy gorehounds and enough scares to make you jump.The verdict A Nightmare on Elm Street still holds up as one of the scariest horror movies ever made.

	onyx:emotionText "After such gruesome drivein flicks as The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes master of horror Wes Craven wanted to make a movie that would bring the slasher genre back to life since the genre was clouded by untalented unoriginal films that shouldn't have been made. So along came A Nightmare on Elm Street. To this day Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood Nancy Thompson Tina Gray Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?A Nightmare on Elm Street created a terrifying villain a plot that is very original and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is or Jason Voorhees or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen. His death is second best.Nancy's parents Donald and Marge Thompson are played by John Saxon of Black Christmas and Ronee Blakely of Nashville.

But in this movie he's a force to be reckoned with.Besides that the concept is truly unique  a sociopathic child killer who can enter into your dreams.

	schema:reviewBody "Do you need a big budget to make a good Horror Movie? No Wes Craven and many other Directors of that Genre proved that more than once. From today's point of view some special effects might look a bit poor but some others are still impressive and they still stick in my mind. What I impressed more than the blood and gore scenes are the creation of a new kind of Horror figure Freddy Krueger. In a kind he is a modern Vampire. He isn't like Bela Lugosi's or Christopher Lee's Dracula a fashionable and handsome man who tries to seduce his victims. No he is more like Max Schreck's Count Orlok of the classic Nosferatu. An ugly person you fear when you see him. Freddy Krueger doesn't suck out the blood but the sucks out the fear of his victims. He needs their fear to live and like a Cat with a Mouse he plays with his victims before he kills them. Most of them are teenager and like a Vampire he is coming into the night when all the children sleep. If one of the youngsters let him in their dream it's pretty difficult to survive for them.It's not so easy to create a horror figure. Director Wes Craven had the luck to find with Robert Englund the perfect cast for this role. Also some of the young actresses and actors are showing good performances. As Max Schreck was Count Orlok Robert Englund is Freddy Krueger. No wonder that so many sequels would follow. Next to the creation of a perfect new horror monster the whole movie follows somehow the concept of old classics. If you hear a children song in a horror movie it's always scary. The concept of the plot is like an old urban legend myth or old classic ghost story. A young teenage girl is telling his parents that she dreamed of a monster that tried to kill her. Nobody believes her and keep on telling her it's just a nightmare. Freddy Krueger cannot come into the dreams of adults they don't have the imagination of fantasy anymore.Next to the plot I was always impressed of the style of directing and photography of A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's 80's style with contemporary music. The movie it self has a Gothic nightmarish atmosphere but Wes Craven used the colors and the look of the 1980's for it. The first A Nightmare on Elm Street Movie isn't a typical Horror Mainstream product. Wes Craven not only broke with some of the common rules of the genre he also reinvented some old classic rules of the genre into a new light. I highly recommend this piece of 80's culture to every movie fan not only the horror fans. If you don't like horror series don't watch the sequels but watch Wes Craven's Version of a Nightmare.".

When Tina is mysteriously murdered her boyfriend Rod Nick Corri is accused but there aren't concrete proves and Nancy begins to relate all to that man of her nightmares. Soon she will discover the truth about that man and will be in danger during her nightmares.Here's a terrific horror classic that introduces one of the greatest and most famous villains not only in the horror genre but also in the entire Cinema history. Fred Krueger is his name and he is back to end with those who were saved. The plot is really good with suspense every minute and a terrific atmosphere. I love how this film use the sensation of a nightmare that we feel like it was real a sensation that all of us have experience sometime to create a great horror atmosphere. In this case is really terrifying for Nancy to awake with proves that her nightmares are real. But she is a very brave girl I love how she after realizing that nobody is going to help her becomes an expert to can elaborate a really brilliant plan. In the end we have the beginning of an endless story that until now has about seven films and counting.Cast all the young actors did a good job. Is funny to see Johnny Depp in his first film as Nancy's boyfriend. Robert Englund is the memorable Fred Krueger definitely a terrific villain even with funny scenes. Remember the I'm your boyfriend now Nancy. Conclusion It's a fact right now we make fun of it that my cousin doesn't want to sleep after watching this film when he was about 7 years old. Nowadays this film is not so impressive for young audiences because it doesn't have any gore but this is a perfect horror film that creates a terrific atmosphere full of suspense because of a magnificent villain that becomes more interesting and at the same time more terrifying when his past is reveal. Definitely A Nightmare on Elm Street is a film that you should watch at midnight to see if you can sleep after. I could so I think you will too.PS I also recommend the parodytribute of the Simpsons with Willie as Krueger appears in the Treehouse of Horror VI.".

The film deals with a deceased child molester who now lives only through the dreams of the children of those who cooked him to death.  Robert Englund is truly frightening as Freddy Krueger a dark figure whose only purpose is to kill all the siblings of his killers.  The knifestyled finger glove has become a trademark of this amazing character who was created by writerdirector Wes Craven.  The film goes for suspense drama and gore and delivers for the most part.  None of the characters are developed very well but most do not live to see the end of the film so it really does not matter.  A great horror film that still delivers today.  Ignore the endless sequels they each detract from this truly original and interesting film. Look for a young Johnny Depp as one of the unlucky teens.  4 out of 5 stars".

The main character in this movie Nancy Thompson deserves the title heroine in my opinion. There are few good horror movies where people fight back and this is one of them.Being a big fan of John Carpenter I felt Wes Cravens film where worth checking out and so far I'm not disappointed. i think most of you 70's and 80's horror fans noticed the same thing like me this kinda reminds me of John Carpenters Halloween. The lead role is a few years younger and Michael Meyers is replaced with Freddy Krueger an equally creepy bogeymanish character.Of course like all horror movies is write reviews about I note that these are not for the faint of heart. It scared the hell out of me that's for sure. And it may freak you out even more I just wan't to make clear it's R rated for a reason so don't show to anyone under 13 or 14 it's not that bad just don't show it to a child.PS.MINOR SPOILERS You may be a little confused at the end but remember it's just a dream. And Nancy is in the 3 movie so she's fine SPOILER ENDS.So for a great horror film with a heroine that kicks ass I give this movie a 1010.".

In this genre in particular you had the Father Michael Myers of Halloween the Son Jason of Friday the 13th and last and most importantly the Holy Spirit none other than Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street.A Nightmare on Elm Street is on a slightly different level than the other gory slasher films of the 80s. It delves into a different part of the viewer's psyche that a lot of other films have ignored. Freddy our villain is as gruesome as our other horror movie monsters although he's acquit with slightly more witty banter but he can only attack you one way in your dreams.Having the dreamworld as Freddy's playground is one of the smartest and scariest ideas film maker Wes Craven could have come up with. Sleep is a thing that all humans have to do no matter how hard we try to stay awake. Caffeine and cold showers can only take you so many days before you eventually drift off into slumber where a reallife nightmare awaits you.As far as the acting goes in this film you can't get any better for a number of reasons. Freddy's Robert Englund sly and sometimes perverted remarks bring a sense of comic relief into the script a thing many other horror films don't have. Also this was Johnny Depp's first role in a featurelength film. And let me tell you the 17 year old Johnny made being torn in two look pretty realistic. Our heroine of the film Heather Langenkamp played a very believable strong role. She made the audience root for her the whole way through and made viewers feel her frustration when no one would believe her about her night stalker.Along with a great musical score that made The Nightmare on Elm Street theme famous a great cast and a very talented director Nightmare is safety one of the slasher genre's greatest films. With six sequels to follow a television show and various merchandise it is obvious that this was one of horror's biggest franchises. With its cult following this movie will be loved for generations to come.".

What's good Johnny Depp and Christian bale are good the pacing is good the sets and period detail are perfect. The score is quite good too.What's bad a shootout sequence is obviously shot on a video camera looks cheap and has a major discontinuity in it. Other scenes the camera is shaky.Also for a movie that prides itself on historical detail it plays fast and loose with the facts about the Dillinger gang. For instance the death of Baby Face Nelson is complete fiction. You are duped into thinking the director cares about historical details with all the period sets cars news stories on the radio etc but actually major parts of the plot are just made up. Of course the reason that historical movies rarely follow history exactly is that real events don't naturally follow standard narrative.So it is not a documentary which is fine so it must be a character movie right? This brings me to its biggest flaw. An important goal of a movie like this is to build an emotional connection with the central character. This ought to be easy with a character like Dillinger because he actually built a huge public fan base as a latter day Robin Hood despite being a murderous bank robbing crook. It tries hard and it does get close particularly with the scenes involving Billie one of Dillinger's many girlfriends. In the end though I just did not care all that much about him..It is competent but ultimately it fails to match up in comparison with other movies of this genre. Right now the IMDb rating for this movie is higher than The Untouchables Once Upon a Time in America or Goodfellas which is a testament to the cinematic ignorance of the majority of IMDb voters. No doubt the same people will rate this comment down probably without even reading it simply because I did not give the movie a 9 or 10.".

Death Sequences These were all mixed up and as a bit of a history buff I didn't like that! Dillinger was not the last of his gang to die I believe it was Baby Face Nelson who was not killed with Homer Van Meter either. And Pretty Boy Floyd although no real link with Dillinger was killed after Dillinger and his boys.2. Character Development This was very very poor for what was rumoured to be a big hit of Summer 09! Too much time was definitely spent on the whole DillingerBillie relationship and on Purvis. Sure they were the big name stars but it should've been about characters not star pulling power!! Handsome Harry Pierpont Baby Face Nelson Pretty Boy Floyd etc. deserved more screen time! The scene with Pretty Boy Floyd I had no idea who he was meant to be at first! I thought it was some random chase through an orchard! Pierpont disappears about halfway through never to be heard from again. Then Dillinger's going round with some more guys who shortly end up dead. Half the time I was lost as to who was who except the bigname stars and the characters I'd learnt a bit about.3. Action sequences Way too long in my opinion and could've been cut down to make way for more character development. The sound effects weren't even that effective as to me they sounded more like fireworks at some points or were too loud.The good points are few in number. The acting was good camera work was substandard lighting was good angles were okay if not a little dodgy in places etc. There is however nothing that I can really stick to as a fantastic feature of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who was John Dillinger? We all know he was a flamboyant criminal who robbed banks but who WAS he? The question of who Dillinger WAS is far more interesting than the question of what Dillinger DID but this film sadly chose only to concentrate seriously on the latter and gave up almost immediately on the former.This film goes out of its waywith a poor grasp of history's timeline by the wayto show us what Dillinger did and who he hung around with but it does next to nothing to explore who Dillinger was as a person or even as a criminal.

The question of who Dillinger WAS is far more interesting than the question of what Dillinger DID but this film sadly chose only to concentrate seriously on the latter and gave up almost immediately on the former.This film goes out of its waywith a poor grasp of history's timeline by the wayto show us what Dillinger did and who he hung around with but it does next to nothing to explore who Dillinger was as a person or even as a criminal.

	schema:reviewBody "Why is it that anyone who is critical of Michael Mann's Public Enemies is promptly branded as a hater on this Web site? I don't hate this film or the filmmaker I just believe it's not a very good film.I've enjoyed some of Mann's films in the past. I am a fan of Thief 1981 Manhunter 1986 and Heat 1995 and thought The Insider 1999 and Ali 2001 were interesting. But as far as I am concerned The Last of the Mohicans 1992 was overblown  it is not as one poster claimed one of the five best films ever made it's not even one of the 5000 best films ever made  Collateral 2004 started off intriguingly before turning into an utterly conventional thriller and Miami Vice 2006 was rubbish.But I went into Public Enemies with much optimism given that it stars Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard. And the subject seemed thoroughly suited for Mann.What a tremendous disappointment Public Enemies turned out to be.There is absolutely nothing special about this film. The best it can be called is middling. It is humdrum runofthemill and certainly not something I expected from someone of Mann's caliber.For starters this film is not about public enemies it's about a public enemy. Blink and you will miss Pretty Boy Floyd. And you have no idea who Baby Face Nelson is until someone in the film points him out.The film began promisingly with the exciting breakout from an Indiana penitentiary. The cinematography looked terrific in that opening shot and there was something delightfully visceral about that sequence.But then came the rest of the film.The story moved from one tedious set piece to another. Roger Ebert whose criticism I respect lauded Mann for his meticulous research for this film. I wonder if Mann's meticulousness included killing off Pretty Boy Floyd Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter before Dillinger when in real life they all outlived Dillinger. And Van Meter was not gunned down along with Baby Face Nelson.I realize Mann's fans claim this is a movie and Mann was taking artistic license to enhance his story as is his wont. But I wonder whether these fans would have echoed similar sentiments if Mann say had Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier in the Rumble in the Jungle in Ali or had Ali lose the fight to Foreman in that film.Historical inaccuracies aside Public Enemies is just dull. Mann wants us to believe that Dillinger and Billie Frechette were soul mates. But the only word to described their relationship  as Mann shows it  is bland. Which is a shame considering he had two fine actors in Depp and Cotillard and completely wastes them. They are given very little to work with and their dialogue is at times downright embarrassing.Depp has oodles of charm and charisma but he plays Dillinger solely as cool. There's nothing more to his persona and when Depp has to be mean on a few occasions it just doesn't work. Christian Bale on the other hand is entirely forgettable as Purvis. It's a nothing character and Bale plays him exactly as he has all his other recent roles. This is a somnambulist Batman and John Connor playing Purvis mumbling his lines and showing next to no emotion. You learn nothing about Purvis throughout the entire film.I felt sorry for the wonderful Cotillard because her relatively minor role is made even more minute because her character has no depth and she gets little help from a wanting script. In fact none of the characters has much depth if any and so Mann wastes a talented cast of supporting players that includes Stephen Dorff Stephen Lang David Wenham Matt Craven Giovanni Ribisi Jason Clarke Leelee Sobieski and James Russo.Then there's the cinematography and I really don't know if one can blame Dante Spinotti for this. I realize Mann is in love with digital technology and while that might have worked on Collateral and Miami Vice it does not here. With the exception of a few lovely shots the rest of the film looks like it was shot on someone's cheap holiday camera. I have seen home movies that looked crisper brighter. The nighttime scenes look thoroughly washed out and sans any contrast and the infamous shootout in Little Bohemia  which is terribly choreographed  looks like a lousy video game.I am not averse to shooting in digital. There are countless films that look terrific shot on highdefinition digital. Take a peek at The Lookout 2007 for instance. It looks spectacular shot on highdef. I personally believe that period pieces should be shot on film but even granting Mann's decision to shoot digital why on earth didn't he use say Panavision's Genesis or the Red One cameras? He certainly wasn't constrained by the budget.I realize Mann could take a crap at Hollywood and Vine and his fans would consider it a masterpiece. But it's still crap and just because it came from Mann doesn't turn it into gold.Public Enemies is simply a disappointing movie. It lacks any depth the characters are boring at best insipid at worst. The film ambles along without any sense of how to tell a story or put that story into the context of American history and after a while all I could think of was how much better Arthur Penn fared with Bonnie and Clyde 1967 how much more I wanted to see that film instead and could we please get to The Biograph already.But Mann even managed to screw up the grand finale by adding an unnecessarily hokey and sentimental coda.".

	schema:reviewBody "Public Enemies is an alright docucrimethriller that thought wellmade ends up coming out dry. Many of the scenes are well paced but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger. What I mean to say is that this is a good movie but you probably won't leave the theater feeling like you've learned anything about John Dillinger other than trivial facts. The movie never really gives Johnny Depp a chance to shape the character into a believable icon because as I previously stated this film feels more like a dramatized overview of Dillinger's career instead of focusing on the man himself.Now Johnny Depp is a fine actor and he reminds us in this movie that he isn't only a goto man for quirky weird whimsical and bizarre characters. In Public Enemies Depp reminds us that he is talented as a traditional actor and that he is still one of the best in Hollywood today. The problem is the script he is given for Public Enemies never lets him expand on anything regarding John Dellinger as a person. In Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' Denzel Washington was given a chance to really emphasize the qualities he felt reflected his view of Frank Lucas. Public enemies Johnny Depp never truly gets to define what he feels are the most important aspects of his portrayal of Dellinger because often the film gets too caught up in the action and events instead of its characters.Christian Bale bounces back after a subpar performance in 'Terminator Salvation' and it's good to see him working his voice manipulation ability again because I for one was beginning to think he'd gotten stuck on his Batmanstyle growl. Playing the FBI agent pursuing Dillinger he is an interesting character due to his dedication and could have been a really interesting character but like Depp Bale never really gets a chance to try and expand on his character.The music isn't anything you haven't heard before in previous crime films of this sort but for the most part it works. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack to this film but it certainly didn't take away from the experience. Also songs from the 30s are played throughout and most of the time they manage to fit into the story's many montage scenes very well.Director Michael Mann seems a tad bit off when compared to some of his previous films. He often goes for a look that makes the audience feel that they're in the middle of everything and that's good in small stretches but I felt he used this technique too often and I found myself growing a tad bit dizzy at times and had a desire to see what was going on in the shootouts. I found it strange that with his recent films such as 'Collateral' where the characters had been the centerfocus of the entire film he could then make a movie about one of the most infamous criminal minds and have it be more about the history than the characters who lived it.The thing that is most fascinating about this film is the costumes and sets. The men and women behind these really outdid themselves and created a very authentic view of 1930s Chicago. This aspect of the film alone makes it worth seeing! Every costume and set seems to have been made with the utmost attention to detail and the final result is very pleasing to the eye.The final product in an okay docudrama on the life of one of America's most infamous criminals but in the end you really don't discover anything about John Dillinger that you couldn't have found out by looking him up on Wikipedia. So this is a pretty film to look at and with Depp and Bale it's a good way to introduce those unfamiliar with Dillinger to the criminal but if you were looking for a character study on the bank robber you may find yourself a tadbit disappointed.I wouldn't come close to calling Public Enemies one of the best movies of the summer or of the year but when compared to several other films that are currently being screened I would still highly recommend it. With movies like 'Transformers Revenge of the Fallen' out there your money is best spent on Michael Mann's Public Enemies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll spare you any suspense here. Simply put Public Enemies is a major disappointment. There is one aspect that the film has going for it though and that is the performances. Johnny Depp is great but as I've read in other reviews not exactly irreplaceable. Marion Cotillard is fantastic but underused. Christian Bale is solid but pretty forgettable. Unfortunately everything else about the film proved disappointing.This is the story of John Dillinger who robbed banks broke out of prisons shot a lot of guns loved a woman he met and didn't spend much time with and...not much else. At least that's what Public Enemies would have you believe. So little actually happens in this film it's a marvel they managed to stretch the running time past an hour and a bit.A short run through John Dillinger Johnny Depp escapes from a prison. Then he robs a bank. Then he meets Billie Marion Cotillard and they fall in love. He robs another bank. Melvin Purvis Christian Bale wants to catch him. Shootout. Bank robbery. Repeat. He gets shot. How long did that take me 30 seconds? I'm not saying the film was unnecessary it was just unnecessarily long. So many scenes could have been cut down or just taken away altogether. The shootout near the middle of the film took so long to get through that about halfway through it I had completely forgotten what it was they were doing. From that point on it was nothing but bullets blood yelling and a lot of flashes from the guns that nearly blinded me.The film wasn't exactly a treat for the eyes either. The look of the film was horribly uneven split evenly three ways between beautiful crystal clear shots amateur student film handheld and security camera footage. Either one wouldn't have been awful on its own but it was just so wildly inconsistent that a good chunk of the time I was too distracted wondering what had happened to the camera sometimes between shots in the same scene to worry about the story.And like I said above there's not much story to tell here. I'm sure the man had a very interesting life but there was no real point to the film. It didn't seem like there was any specific story to tell. Quite simply put it was merely about John Dillinger. Well just what about John Dillinger? you ask. And I don't have an answer for you. Sorry. Either way the film didn't highlight Dillinger as a hero or as a villain and while I don't mind the impartial nature of the film in itself I had a hard time really caring about what happened to him.The love story was easily the most entertaining part of the film. Too bad it didn't show up much. My favorite parts of the film involved Marion Cotillard and they didn't last long. What a shame. If they had cut down the major shootout or cut out one or two of the bank robbery scenes that were mostly all the same they could have focused more on that story and I wouldn't have minded the runtime as much.So aside from the good performances from just about everyone involved there's not much to get excited about here. It was overlong pretty low on plot and filled to the brim with unnecessary scenes that had left my mind before I had even left the theater. Such a disappointment. It could have been something great and it just...wasn't.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Very disappointing retelling of the 13month John Dillinger crime spree across the Midwest in 193334. Here's why without any BS 1. No personality. Gang members remain ciphers throughout. When Red Hamilton Jason Clark dies after being in EVERY OTHER SCENE you think Who the hell is he. None of the subsidiary people pop unlike the vast number of vivid unique individuals in HEAT. 2. Depp miscast badly. Read about Dillinger he was ebullient charming commanding. With NO experience he commandeered the best pro bank robbers in the Midwest to follow his lead and led them on a 13month blaze of glory and infamy. Depp instead is pensive moody brooding internalized he never displays the charisma and guile that the historic Dillinger did. He was chosen for his romantic chops not his gangster chops because of . . . 3. Misemphasis on romantic. Mann pays too much attention to Dillinger's least interesting thing that is his affair with Billy Freschette. This was clearly NOT a loveuntodeath deal like Bonnie and Clyde. Before Billy Dillinger had girlfriends after Billy Dillinger had girlfriends and during Billy Dillinger had girlfriends. The guy had been in stir 9 years he had a lot of catching up to do. Mann emphasizes this affair ignores Dillinger's unique connection to his family in Indiana very interesting his leadership skills his courage. Very odd and unfortunate and disappointing choice. 4. Accuracy as in lack thereof. Mann really doesn't progress beyond Milius's 1973 truncated take he starts out with lies Dillinger at escape from state pen by his cohorts Purvis singlehandedly bringing down Pretty Boy Floyd in the first two scenes and it never gets better. In fact most of the men we watch die in the film died AFTER not before Dillinger including Floyd and Babyface Nelson and Homer Van Meter and Harry Pierpont. Why did Mann buy rights to Burroughs' Public Enemies if he was going to make stuff up? Also SPOILER a major meme in the film is that the syndicate under Frank Nitti got Dillinger because his kind of spectacular showboat caper was screwing things up for the big money boys in the literature I can find NO evidence of this being the case. 5. Introduced then abandoned themes Mann intros at least four major ideas about Dillinger and his fate which could serve as a kind of structure for the movie then he abandons all of them leaving them as pointless curiosities. The first I've mentioned that the mob got Dillinger. No. 2 from Burroughs Hoover used the Road Warrior bandits crime spree as a methodology to grow his Bureau and cement his own control of it and his place in popular culture. No. 3 the coming of western gunman. Indeed at a certain point the Bureau did bring in experienced gunfighters as Mann shows but he never really dramatizes or builds on their contribution to the takedown of the bad guys. He seems to set up then walk away from the idea of cowboys vs. bank robbers. Very disappointing. 4. The inexperience of Hoover. He includes a scene it actually took place in 1936 not '33 where a Senator derides Hoover and makes a big deal over the fact that Hoover's never made an arrest. Then of course Mann doesn't bring that issue to conclusion showing Hoover arresting Alvin Karpis who is a kind of mystery guest he's played by Giovonni Ribisi who appears and disappears from the film without explanation. Which leads to 6. Editing woes. Ribisi is just one such mystery guest other big name wellknown people appear in meaningless undeveloped characters suggesting that whole subplots of the film were left out and what we're seeing in a hasty shortened edit like the version of Once Upon a Time in America that was initially released. You can fairly ask what the hell are Ribisi Leelee Sobieski Matt Craven and Steven Lang even doing here when they have so little to do Craven doesn't even have any lines! I am looking forward to a director's cut sometime in the future. On the plus side yes great clothes great cars great location shots superb editing and beast of all great gunfights. But the guns demonstrate some astonishing marginal attention to detail while much large issues of history are deliberately misstated. Why does Mann get the fact the Babyface had a Colt .38 Super converted to a machine pistol with a Thompson vertical foregrip mounted on the dustcover look fast or you'll miss it at the Little Bohemia shootout but insist after John Milius SPOILER that the Babyface was slain there. Nelson didn't die until October and he went down hard taking two FBIers with him. Ultimate judgment such a squandered opportunity! There's probably never going to be another big Dillinger movie and it sickens me that Mann willfully made so many dubious decisions. These people lived and died and fought and bled for and against us gave us their lives they deserved SO MUCH BETTER.".

	schema:reviewBody "Public Enemies this film has been built up for quite a while why not? It stars Johnny Depp as one of history's most famous bank robbers. Also the city of Chicago has been excited to see this in some strange way we considered Dillinger to be a Robin Hood as he never took money from the common man just from the banks. He also was clever enough to escape jail by making a fake gun out of a soap bar I lived in Indiana for a year and people are incredibly proud that Crown Point was where Dillinger had fooled everyone lol. So naturally I was really looking forward to seeing this movie especially with Johnny Depp as John Dillinger it's a can't miss. Unfortunately for me the film fell short of our expectations as the way it was made and how there is lack of material for Depp and Bale to work with to give these characters any depth. Mann makes a film that is using a digital camera for a film set in the 1930's and doesn't really bring his A game to the film as it's more like Here's Dillinger's story enjoy.Set in 1933 John Dillinger is brought to a penitentiary but is there to break out the rest of his gang. After loosing a few of his friends he's headed to Chicago to make his mark on the banks. Melvin Purvis is upgraded by J. Edgar Hoover who is protecting the FBI from scrutiny by politicians to lead the hunt for John. John later meets Billie Frechette whom he takes to dinner. He states plainly what he will do for her and how he will treat her if they are to have a relationship. After a shoot out gone horribly wrong and making the police look more incompetent Purvis demands that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive. Though Hoover had hoped for more pristine agents he agrees. While John and Billie are enjoying the luxuries across the States the police finally find Dillinger and arrest him and his gang in Miami. However Dillinger and a few inmates escape from prison using a fake gun. He is goaded into a bank robbery job by an acquaintance Dillinger agrees. The robbery goes fine until Nelson impulsively kills a nearby police officer alerting more of the robbery making Dillinger Public Enemy Number 1.Now Public Enemies is by no means a bad film some of the actors were terrific and the sets were perfect as well as the whole feel of the film. But it just won't stop with the Run! Chase! Run! Chase! Shoot! Shoot! scenes that seem to dull down after a while. The love story between Dillinger and his gal Billie didn't seem too necessary it added to the story but for me felt a little out of place at times. I have to tell you that I'm feeling so incredibly bad for Christian Bale this year as it seems like he's been given characters who are not well written but I'm starting to wonder if the Batman voice is his new trademark because he was starting to use that voice again in a few sentences. Depp does the best he can but once again with the lack of material he's made out completely as the hero of the film instead of maybe having more of a documentary feel to it and being biased on how cool Dillinger was. Maybe he's Mann's personal hero who knows. But over all the film is decent enough for the watch I'd just say if you want to see it go for a matine or a rental it wasn't worth the full price.710".

For John Dillinger Johnny Depp it was a time of infinite possibilities and opportunities. To combat the sharp incline in rampant criminal activity J. Edgar Hoover Billy Crudup forms the FBI led by Melvin Purvis Christian Bale. Together they target Dillinger as public enemy number one. Relying on new methods of intelligence gathering such as tracking the purchase location of a coat or recording phone conversations the firepower of trained gunmen and his own relentless nature Purvis gets closer and closer to Dillinger and company.I like baseball movies good clothes fast cars... and you. What else do you need to know?  John Dillinger. Johnny Depp IS John Dillinger. He's perfect for the role. The cool confident and almost cocky nature of the character is really portrayed on screen such as bragging to reporters about his bank jobs and teasing Purvis and agents who are after him. It's a look of how a man lived and succeeded in a hard time. Dillinger was a man that lived in the moment as only a man in the depression could. From the worlds on John Dillinger I'm to busy having fun today to even think about tomorrow. Who knows what tomorrow might bring? Bale also succeeds in his role and is a solid counterpart against Depp. It works well having two top well known actors opposing each other on screen. The film is directed by Michael Mann who brought us such films as Heat The Insider and Collateral and he adds another good film to his resume with this one. The action sequences bank heists and shootouts in this film are probably the biggest highlights. After all this is from the same guy who gave us one of the most famous and arguably the best shootout of all time in Heat. The sequences are cool slick and gritty. Excellence at it's best. I have to throw in a note of praise for the superb shootout at the Little Bohemia lodge which was an extremely impressive sceneThe cat and mouse aspect makes it intriguing but I think more could have been added to it. It just feels as if something was missing. Much of the film focuses on the love story between Dillinger and Billie Frechette Marion Cottillard It's also interesting to see the other gangsters of this time and how they relate to Dillinger and the criminal world.Much has been made of Public Enemies being filmed on HD video mostly complaints. I must say that at times the picture looked amazing. The night sequences especially looked beautifully slick and realistic. I loved the cinematography here. The cars headlights street lights and everything looked fantastic. Other times it doesn't look as good. It just felt as if something didn't look right. I'm not sure what to think about this. One problem I had with this film would have to be the lack of character depth in many of the characters. At times it seems as if we are expected to know and understand the characters before going to see the film because it is a real life story. But as a film it could have developed the characters more to help us and those who know nothing about Dillinger his life or Purvis and the FBI understand them better. Another problem was some of the historical inaccuracies. Many things portrayed in the film do not happen as they did in real life. Many sequences are just out of order. I know the filmmakers had to know about this and just tried to work it in as best as they could. It's not a documentary it's a movie.I really enjoyed Public Enemies. It's a solid crime drama and a good summer film. I understand expectations were through the roof but that's a little hard to ask for. It's a really good film but not quite a great one... The action is fun the story is interesting. Maybe instead of being a very good film it could have became a really great film if more was put into the characters? I'm not sure. It just felt as if something were missing. But who can knock a film for still being good?".

Relentless Gman Purvis a convincing but bloodless Christian Bale and his rising boss FBI chief J.

That 1967 classic works so well because it's characterdriven. Even in the sketchy but powerful scenes that outline John Dillinger's romance with FrenchNative American hatcheck girl Billie Frechette Marion Cottillard working wonders with limited material character is subsidiary to function I rob banks Johnny says. And then What else you need to know? Well quite a lot actually for a rounded character to emerge. Mann's movie is meticulous as to period look to facade but not to essence. Its street scenes are full of detail its clothes immaculate and accurate. Taking place in 193334 however it provides too few overt signs of the Great Depression. The film is also misleading in showing the Dillinger gang only robbing grand marblehallandcolumn banks when in fact they mostly robbed small and middling sized ones.The overall result is a collection of contradictions. There is romance but the effect isn't romantic. There's precise realism but the overall effect isn't realistic. Perhaps the only unmitigated pleasure that remains is the images the digital with its cold precision its crisp edges even when many of the cameras are jiggly and handheld the depth of detail in darkness the color that is neither bright nor faded the sheer satisfying crispness of everything and everybody. And in this one aspect a sublimely heightened vrit whose look is something quite new 'Public Enemies' matches 'Bonnie and Clyde' it makes us feel we're seeing period scenes with contemporary eyes. The best and most memorable images are the complex ones you won't see in stills where many actors are running back and forth in front of the camera the gunshots are popping realistically in every direction and there is no hint of the usual film chiaroscuro or highlighting but the light is somehow beautiful. The cameras move too much but they do rub your face in the action. What's gong on you may figure out later.Maybe you can't avoid mythologizing when you shoot a movie about a famous Thirties bank robber and shouldn't try to but Mann does. He's working with great accomplishment from that meticulous historical account involving dozens of players on both the cop and the crook sides. Dillinger and alternatively the totally unappealing Purvis stay in the foreground. But there too is a contradiction because the way Depp plays his part witty cold and focused rather than warm and downtoearth his character ends up being impressive but ultimately absent. Contrast Warren Beatty's impotence and blinking charm as Clyde Barrow an absence you yet want to cuddle. Even when the characters are strong in Public Enemies they don't get enough chance to interact. Dillinger is rarely with Frechette. His chance to confront Purivs is too brief the moment when Purvis tells him he's to be extradited to Indiana and he quips There's absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana. He's not facing off Purvis he's playing to the audience.This should have been one of the showpieces of the season and it is indeed a blockbuster with class in a world of junk. Its virtuoso look and complexly orchestrated scenes will hold up with time but despite a freshness in approaching familiar genre material it's missing that certain 'je ne sais quoi.' Even though it's different it lacks style moviemaking panache playfulness suspense the ability to push a climax the capacity to take a breather so the momentum builds up again. There's an impressive twittering machine functioning here on all its Ford V8 cylinders. But the light touch is missing the capacity to make you say Yeah! to simultaneously stand apart and admire while utterly caught up in it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "My grandpa's first reaction when he heard this movie was being released was why? Why yet another movie about Dillinger? What can it add? My grandpa's question triggered my thinking. Movies and Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to care anymore about adding something to history or the medium. They just seem to compulsively adapt other movies toy lines or videogames into modern reworkings. It's a culture of thoughtless recycling. Fortunately and although I haven't seen the '30s or '70s biopics Michael Mann does have something to show.The first surprise is how the movie is shot. As one of the most vocal followers of digital video Mann seems to exploit its handicaps instead of trying to convince us it can look as good as film. Throughout the movie we're treated to 3D video feel artificial grain and closeups which show up every pore on the actors skins. It's like someone sent a documentary crew back in time. However this incongruous approach also made me experience the 1930s in a way I'd never done before as a reality instead of a postcard. Almost all movie depictions of the public enemies era even the gritty ones like Bonnie and Clyde are stylish and sophisticated. Instead Mann's compulsive attention to prop and costume detail combined with the handheld camerawork are immediately urging and attentiongrabbing.Mann as a filmmaker always seemed to me more interested in technique than depth or story. This is arguably the same film he has made twice before I'm talking about Thief and Heat only this time historybased. As I read on about Dillinger and Melvin Purvis after watching the film I realized the movie's script is very unusual in that it almost seems to strip the juicy bits out of the story. Where is the scene with the people soaking their handkerchiefs on Dillinger's blood or the '30s era depression portrait? Like you guys were saying Little Bohemia was in fact an embarrassment to the FBI in which civilians got shot and the criminal walked away unharmed. Except for a weird scene in which Dillinger walks into the Chicago police station and wanders around there's a very downtoearth approach to the character taking away his more mythical elements and leaving us with a career robber who like James Caan's character in Thief seems to abstractly decide to fall in love to make up for lost time.The movie focuses obsessively on this relationship instead of the more obvious paths it could have taken. Hoover's incompetence and his closet homosexuality are brief side notes. So is Melvin Purvis. The movie strips him of a personality showing only the professional side of the policeman. This is so evident that when the title card near the end informs us that he later shot himself I had to laugh it was so random. I seem to be speaking against all of this but in fact what I'm doing is pointing out how unusual all of these directorial choices are. In fact I celebrate them. Public Enemies is a movie that might seem frustrating to many but to me it was a refreshing exciting journey into a world too often depicted and too easily neutralized. It's a great thing to see a copmenandrobbers film without feeling like I've seen it all before. And make no mistake the film's action scenes are intense.I'd like to finish by pointing out that the movie has a hell of a cast. Johnny Depp is a revelation in a time when it looked like his awesomeness was exhausting itself. Christian Bale is not given much to do as Purvis but he's competent mostly the Bale serious face we see too much of all the time. Billy Crudup's Hoover is great he deserves his own flick. Marion Cotillard is a great foil to Depp. There are a lot of very famous faces on the film in fact maybe too many and some of them are only in for very brief seconds  Lily Tomlin Giovanni Ribisi and Leelee Sobieski enter and leave the screen and they're all very good but none have any big scenes. This might be the artsiest blockbuster I've ever seen. Which in my mind is a compliment.".

Johnny Depp is marvelous no matter what and his is a star performance. There is only a vague approach to a real characterization but I didn't care because I go wherever Johnny Depp wants to take me. It was like that with Gary Cooper too wasn't it? Part of the sneaky narrative is to have Dillinger the criminal played by the angelic Depp and Purvis the noble FBI guy played by Christian Bale that emanates evil without even trying. If you're interested in performances like I am Billy Crudup is the thing in a sensational turn as J Edgar Hoover in spite of the digital thing that makes him look as if Hoover suffered from some rare skin condition damn shame if you ask me. Marion Cottillard is absolutely lovely but we knew that already and the rest of the characters remain an enigma they enter and leave the scene without us ever having a clue who they are. Giovanni Ribisi Stephen Dorff Jason Clark who were they and Lelee Sobieski? It was startling to see her appear on the third act. Who was she suppose to be? In any case the film has a Michael Mann feel and it's technically great. The shootings are extraordinary and Johnny Depp totally beautiful. I suppose that should be enough to applaud and recommend Public Enemies. I did and I will even if I must confess I expected more or maybe less.".

Which brings me to Christian Bale. This is an actor who has so much more to offer than the half baked roles he has been getting this year. You get a feeling this year that he is being offered big movies which don't give him a character he can bite his teeth into. First there was Terminator Salvation and now this. In both his character never really seemed into the movie as compared to the others.

	schema:headline " Incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable";
	schema:reviewBody "I like Michael Mann's work  the man is a true talent...which makes it all the more incomprehensible that he could create such a baffling piece of cinema. I saw the film at a preview in NYC a couple of nights ago and my brain still hurts trying to catalog all the places this film went so very wrong.Ultimately the film's problems emanate from the script which does little to illuminate the characters in any visceral way save for a sliver of Dillinger. We the audience really don't know who anyone is or why we should care...until very late in the game but by then we are simply praying fervently for it to be over. I'm not saying we need to like Mr. Depp's character in any way we simply long to understand him or just enjoy his foibles. As laid out by Mr. Mann we never do a maddening experience.And why in sweet heaven's name is it called Public Enemies? We never ever focus on the the plural in that title the other enemies are barely seen or known. If the film needed to be cut virtually eliminating the other enemies then change the title to Public Enemy No 1. The title they went with has nothing to do with this movie.Then there's the look of the film muddy and indistinct. How is it possible to take a woman as lovely as Marion Cotillard and make her look anything less than beguiling? Mr. Mann's choice of lighting and camera lens gives the film an unnecessarily shadowy and grimy look  and that keeps us at arm's length from the characters in a very frustrating way.And why was the sound so muddled rendering many lines difficult to hear? I don't think it was the theater we were in an excellent UWS venue.The story of Dillinger presents a wonderful chance to show the fascinating historically accurate tension between the characters of Dillinger J Edgar Hoover Purvis against the backdrop of an American public who were fans of the outlaws. These perfectly juxtaposing circumstances are never exploited for us to enjoy.Normally I'd RACE to see a film with Depp Bale Crudup Cotillard  I love them all. In this case I raced FROM the theater...murmuring why why why.".

	onyx:emotionText "I like Michael Mann's work  the man is a true talent...which makes it all the more incomprehensible that he could create such a baffling piece of cinema. I saw the film at a preview in NYC a couple of nights ago and my brain still hurts trying to catalog all the places this film went so very wrong.Ultimately the film's problems emanate from the script which does little to illuminate the characters in any visceral way save for a sliver of Dillinger. We the audience really don't know who anyone is or why we should care...until very late in the game but by then we are simply praying fervently for it to be over. I'm not saying we need to like Mr. Depp's character in any way we simply long to understand him or just enjoy his foibles. As laid out by Mr. Mann we never do a maddening experience.And why in sweet heaven's name is it called Public Enemies? We never ever focus on the the plural in that title the other enemies are barely seen or known. If the film needed to be cut virtually eliminating the other enemies then change the title to Public Enemy No 1. The title they went with has nothing to do with this movie.Then there's the look of the film muddy and indistinct. How is it possible to take a woman as lovely as Marion Cotillard and make her look anything less than beguiling? Mr. Mann's choice of lighting and camera lens gives the film an unnecessarily shadowy and grimy look  and that keeps us at arm's length from the characters in a very frustrating way.And why was the sound so muddled rendering many lines difficult to hear? I don't think it was the theater we were in an excellent UWS venue.The story of Dillinger presents a wonderful chance to show the fascinating historically accurate tension between the characters of Dillinger J Edgar Hoover Purvis against the backdrop of an American public who were fans of the outlaws. These perfectly juxtaposing circumstances are never exploited for us to enjoy.Normally I'd RACE to see a film with Depp Bale Crudup Cotillard  I love them all. In this case I raced FROM the theater...murmuring why why why.";

	schema:reviewBody "Public Enemies is poorly directed poorly acted poorly shot and especially poorly written.At no point was I convinced by any of the performances. Depp walks around looking smug throughout the film. That's not acting. I can look smug anybody can look smug. All of the other performances were also twodimensional as in flat but that has as much to do with the way the characters were written and the way the cast members were directed in their performances as it does with the actors' own abilities.So far as the screenplay is concerned when you take a reallife bank robber who did in fact shoot and kill innocent people and make him look heroic that is disgusting. I live in Zion Illinois halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee. Much of Dillinger's life of crime is within an hour's drive from my home. His crimes and actions are wellknown around here. He was a disgusting criminal and it was a great day when he was gunned down outside the Biograph Theater.Johnny Depp tried to justify Dillinger's life of crime by stating that he didn't rob people but banks in his promotional appearances. What does he think a bank is? When you rob a bank you rob everyone who does business with that bank. If I have an account at a bank whether it be a savings account a checking account a CD or whatever I am robbed too if that bank is robbed because it is my money that is being taken not the bank's money. Depp's words are nonsense. He bought into the legend instead of the facts.Another awful thing about this film is the camerawork and cinematography. The camera moves and moves and moves hardly sitting still and focusing on anything. Hold the camera still! Let's see a shot that lasts for more than a few seconds!This film is offensive and it's the worst film I have seen at the theater so far this year.".

A time when people were starving and in need of a guntoting charismatic midwestern boy to stir things up a bit one bank robbery at a time.A Cast of Winning Players Director Michael Mann is known best for Heat Collateral and Miami Vice. His attention to detail is known and it is said that he went above the call of duty in his research for this movie.

Johnny Depp is solid as the charismatic bank robber adopting his mannerisms speech and swagger and even the trademark smirk that is seen on all of Dillinger's photos. Christian Bale is perfect as Melvin Purvis looking similar to the G man and confidently playing the role convincingly.Digital Camera and No true sense of good and Bad The camera threw me off a bit switching from an old sepia toned look to a digital one during fights. At times it made you feel as if you were an observant on the street while other times it felt just like a movie. I wasn't sure why this was but I concluded that Mann wanted us to be there with Dillinger most of the time and at other times we are to observe from a distance. There was no great love felt for any of the dark heroes the charismatic Dillinger was likable but I never felt concern for his wellbeing. The FBI agent in Purvis Christian Bale was the typical white knight archetype and was given little personality outside of this so I felt nothing for him either. The romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette Marion Cotillard was interesting but felt clichd gangsters always have THAT chick in these movies and just like real life that political blowhard J.Edgar Hoover Billy Crudup is the only real bad guy in the entire film.Final Thoughts It felt like a different time period and the choreography of the gunfights were done well enough to keep me interested. With as colorful a crew as the boys who ran with John Dillinger it would have been hard to direct a movie like this while keeping everyone relative. Men like Alvin Karpis Giovanni Ribisi Pretty Boy Floyd Channing Tatum and Baby Face Nelson Stephen Graham are given screen time as well as Capone's number one doboy Frank Nitti Bill Camp. Still there was so much shown that you tend to lose your familiarity with Dillinger's quest for whatever it is he wanted and the hopelessness of his situation settles in after awhile. It is a good movie with no real emotional weight just a this is what happened gloss to the entire thing with a sprinkling of charisma to top it off.

It bounces along leaving little room for back story or leisurely character development like Dillingerit lives for the moment. Johhny Depp is superb as Dillinger Christian Bale a thoroughly convincing Melvin Purvis his taciturn but determined GMan nemesis.A plot curio is that some time is given over to J Edgar Hoover's fight to establish an FBI with Purvis operating as his local enforcer.But the role is under developed it could be dropped with no impact on the plot making you wonder how much extra footage was left on the cutting room floor hopefully set for an appearance on the DVD.Marion Cotillard a native Frenchwoman plays the part of the leading lady and Dillingers love interest well enough. In a role which offers infrequent appearances she conforms to the genre requirements of being easily bedded hit and cries on demand.Critics have queried the way that the digital film is shot.There is none of the lushness of last of the Mohicans nor the grittiness of Collateral but the compelling plot leaves little time to worry about that.Review audiences also complained of poor sound quality and mumbled dialogue not faults that I could identify with on this showing.The showdown between Dillinger and Purvis happens early on in a scene which is played straight and without lingering fanfare it is certainly no rerun of De Niro v Pacino in Heat.If the film lacks anything it is a sense of Tragedy so wonderfully apparent in De Palma's Carlitos Way. Depp and Purvis are played so ruthlessly and efficiently by Depp and Bale that pathos and emotional attachment are on pretty short display.The period is lovingly recreated by Mann and the action sequences unsurprisingly never fail to disappoint indeed when Dillinger is first shown robbing a bank his vault over the counter is seen in graceful slow motion. Diana Krall has a pleasing cameo as a nightclub torch singer performing Bye Bye Blackbird and the costumes are a consistent delight.Punchy light on its feet and offering weighty roles for Depp and Bale this will be enjoyed by ardent fans and the curious alike.".

	schema:headline " An emotionless film with good action scenes and acting!";
	schema:reviewBody "Public Enemies is a biopic about the robbinglife of John Dillinger told from his perspective and from that of the police.Michael Mann the director of among others Last of the Mohicans was also the director of this movie. In the previous named film he did a good job in this one however I found that it didn't live up to my expectations. He made some bold choices whereby the movie suffered. He sometimes made it look like they were filming a documentary which may sound logical because it's based on a true story but it really wasn't integrated nicely into the film and didn't fit well with what the movie had set up as a theme. He also let the camera shake a lot which also didn't always work. Sometimes it did like in the beginning sequence which I by the way very much enjoyed. In that beginning sequence he used good soundtrack and changed the camera viewpoint often whereby he has created an interesting and tense scene. Unfortunately the rest of the film wasn't as good as that first scene. Mann also used close ups very often in this film which gave a claustrophobic feel to the movie. That didn't fit with the movie as well. But he interchanged them at times with long shots and due to this you weren't always caught in a claustrophobic feel. He also overused shadow and that sometimes created a nice shot but other times it didn't work out that well. But overall this wasn't really annoying and it worked most of the times. It helped to create a dark atmosphere and I believe that that was what Mann was trying to reach. The cinematography wasn't the greatest too it was not a good looking movie. Which is by the way surprising because the cinematographer had previously worked with Mann in other movies that did look good. Michael Mann did however capture the action scenes very good. Those were tense and exciting to watch. Those scenes were actually the one that saved the movie unfortunately. The soundtrack though I found to be pretty good just like the costume design. This really helped to create the atmosphere the movie was going for. The sets too looked realistic and helped with the previous named thing. The sound design was good as well. The gunshots and all sounded realistic to me. The editing of movies is always done in a special way with Michael Mann and in this film that was again the case. Sometimes I was a fan of it sometimes I wasn't because at times scenes were edited in a clever way like with placing the head of the character in one corner and switching between two characters at different places having a telephone conversation but their head is always at the same paces if that was any clear. So it was a hit or miss with the editing. But I found the pacing to be good. Hence this is a two hour plus film I was expecting dull boring parts but there were none due to the good pacing.The acting was very good. I had my doubts with Johnny Depp because there are only two ways he performs absolutely fantastic or absolutely horrible. An example of an absolutely horrible performance of him can be found in the terrible atrocious film called Mortdecai. What a bad film. But in this movie I had a bit of hope it would lean to the fantastic side  Edward Scissorhands for example   because Michael Mann was behind the camera and it did in fact lean to the fantastic side. I very much liked his performance. Christian Bale who played the detective trying to capture John Dillinger too had a good acting achievement. His accent was consistent and sounded good to me. Marion Cotillard played the new girlfriend of John Dillinger. She gave a very good performance. I thought that she was the best out of the cast.The writing was lesser good. The story was interesting and told in a good way but it was emotionless. The characters didn't get any development whereby you didn't care what happened to them or what would happen to them it just felt flat. The only really emotion we see from John Dillinger is when he says what happened in his youth in a quick fashion to Marion Cotillard. And that's about it which is kind of sad actually because we see Jason Clarke's character in a lot of scenes with Johnny's but yet I can't even recall his name. So when he died it just felt like another disposable castmember died even though this wasn't what they were going for. The dialogue however was well written and realistic. Some of the lines were very good but I think that they focused a bit too much on that aspect of the script and less on the charactorial part of it. In the end this wasn't Michael Mann's best films but it wasn't his worst either. The acting was good and so was the beginning sequence. The script was lacking in character development but it succeeded at the dialogues. Nonetheless even though the characters weren't good Michael Mann managed to create good action sequences that held up the movie together with the acting. That's why this film gets a 6.210 from me.".

	onyx:emotionText "Public Enemies is a biopic about the robbinglife of John Dillinger told from his perspective and from that of the police.Michael Mann the director of among others Last of the Mohicans was also the director of this movie. In the previous named film he did a good job in this one however I found that it didn't live up to my expectations. He made some bold choices whereby the movie suffered. He sometimes made it look like they were filming a documentary which may sound logical because it's based on a true story but it really wasn't integrated nicely into the film and didn't fit well with what the movie had set up as a theme. He also let the camera shake a lot which also didn't always work. Sometimes it did like in the beginning sequence which I by the way very much enjoyed. In that beginning sequence he used good soundtrack and changed the camera viewpoint often whereby he has created an interesting and tense scene. Unfortunately the rest of the film wasn't as good as that first scene. Mann also used close ups very often in this film which gave a claustrophobic feel to the movie. That didn't fit with the movie as well. But he interchanged them at times with long shots and due to this you weren't always caught in a claustrophobic feel. He also overused shadow and that sometimes created a nice shot but other times it didn't work out that well. But overall this wasn't really annoying and it worked most of the times. It helped to create a dark atmosphere and I believe that that was what Mann was trying to reach. The cinematography wasn't the greatest too it was not a good looking movie. Which is by the way surprising because the cinematographer had previously worked with Mann in other movies that did look good. Michael Mann did however capture the action scenes very good. Those were tense and exciting to watch. Those scenes were actually the one that saved the movie unfortunately. The soundtrack though I found to be pretty good just like the costume design. This really helped to create the atmosphere the movie was going for. The sets too looked realistic and helped with the previous named thing. The sound design was good as well. The gunshots and all sounded realistic to me. The editing of movies is always done in a special way with Michael Mann and in this film that was again the case. Sometimes I was a fan of it sometimes I wasn't because at times scenes were edited in a clever way like with placing the head of the character in one corner and switching between two characters at different places having a telephone conversation but their head is always at the same paces if that was any clear. So it was a hit or miss with the editing. But I found the pacing to be good. Hence this is a two hour plus film I was expecting dull boring parts but there were none due to the good pacing.The acting was very good.

After Miami Vice I was willing to believe this might be another let down. Right in the first act I knew that this movie was the one I have been waiting for.The last wave of decent crime films was in the first half of the 90's with Heat Fargo Pulp Fiction Goodfellas and Casino. Since then I have been waiting for more cinematically well crafted crime dramas. The ones that were expected to be comparable to the older films I think did not reach that level such as American Gangster. I would say Eastern Promises Gangs of New York Road to Perdition Collateral and The Departed came close but they are more just good movies of their own.Public Enemies is the first film in my opinion to have captured the essence of crime drama in a long time. It jumps right into the era without the explanation that some people wished to have had. We enter right into the world learning quickly the interactions between Dillinger Baby Face Nelson Frank Nitty and much more of the criminal society of the Depression. I've always loved seeing these characters portrayed in the other movies they are featured in but this film really had them right.Michael Mann really exercised himself as an auteur on this outing. Many can criticize his style and decision to shoot HD. Still artists can paint the crucifixion of Christ in many different ways so Mann should have the right to explore the story in his own fashion as well. I personally thought the imagery was fantastic most especially the opening act.Depp Bale and Cotillard were all great. So was the rest of the cast. Great balance between tragedy and humor. Go see this movie in theaters or you will regret it. It's quite simply the coolest movie of 2009.".

Although set during the 1930's Mann chooses to shoot the film in primarily HD and with what appears to be mostly zoom lenses. The fishbowl like hyperclean HD look and video like color timing of the film is inappropriate and offputting. Furthermore the choice of the WideAngled Zoom lens used mostly in documentaries distorts the picture look for ugly distorted hands in the foreground of the frame when Dillinger dances with his girl in the first act of the film and seems student film like. The picture edit lacks a consistent timing and appears rushed and the sound editorial is full of silent holes for no main stream or art house reason that I can think of. It appears that HD or the way Mann uses and color times HD in this particular film was not the way to go for a 1930's gangster film. 35mm or perhaps even Super 16mm with some prime lenses may have worked out better for Mann's Public Enemies. Fincher's DP in Benjamin Button was able to appropriately capture beautiful HD images for him but Mann's camera department seems quite simply off in this film. Why some critics call Public Enemies a work of art is befuddling to me. The direction of the film is poor as well and lacks a consistent style and a poor revelation of information. Mann's Heat Insider and Ali all were more beautifully shot edited and directed than Public Enemies. Even the usually handsome Depp looks old and tired because of the nature of the optics and HD acquisition. Sitting in the theater I saw at least 10 people walk out after about 45 min. into the film and the rest appeared bored and confused. Too bad I was looking forward to a good gangster movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few stories have stirred the imagination as much as the infamous mutiny aboard the HMS Bounty in 1789 and this movie captures the spirit of that historic event very well.Clark Gable stars without his trademark mustache and British accent as Fletcher Christian the officer in charge of the mutiny. Fortunately his performance as Christian was strong enough so that the average viewer would overlook that particular flaw unlike Kevin Costner's turn as Robin Hood in 1991's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.Franchot Tone's portrayal of Midshipman Roger Byam was sympathetic as he appeared to be more of a witness to the events than a participant. Byam's plea for reforms in the British Navy at the end of his court martial put a cap on a memorable performance. It should be noted that one of the factors in creating the Best Supporting ActorActress categories at the Oscars undoubtedly came about as a direct result of this movie with three men nominated for Best Actor. If Best Supporting Actor had existed Tone would have been up for and likely received Best Supporting Actor.And then there's Charles Laughton. As Captain Bligh Laughton made the most of his scenerychewing role. Fortunately for him the openboat sequence added depth to his character avoiding the clich of Bligh being a cruel and inhuman sea captain. Unfortunately for him his likeness graced cartoons and magazines for decades as a depiction of controlling and maniacal leaders.While watching this movie I began to notice a few plot points that Herman Wouk must have used for his novel The Caine Mutiny. For example Byam sees a tall ship and asks if it's the Bounty but the Bounty is a smaller ship behind it likewise Ensign Keith spots a proud new vessel and asks if it's the Caine but the Caine sits beyond a small minesweeper full of rust. Captain Bligh obsesses over two wheels of missing cheese Captain Queeg turns his ship upsidedown over a few pounds of strawberries. And both Bligh and Queeg believe the whole crew of their respective ships are against them even going so far as to conjecture a conspiracy theory based upon halfheard and innocent conversations. By the way I am not trying to discredit The Caine Mutiny in any way both the novel and the 1954 movie starring Humphrey Bogart are classics in their own right and I recommend both reading the book and seeing the movie.Mutiny On the Bounty is a wellmade movie with one of the best musical scores I have heard. When I heard the violins sweeping into the theme music at the opening titles I knew right away I was in for a good time. Strong performances great camera work a wellwritten script and an astounding musical score. All in all this is a movie worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. I haven't seen this movie for many years and it turned out to be even better than I'd remembered it. I really have to admire this film as the acting and entire production are topnotch. I rarely give 10s but this one comes very closeoh heck...the more I think about it the more I realize it does deserve it.As far as the historical accuracy of the film goes while it isn't perfect after all Bligh's exact role in starting the mutiny is tough to determine it did get most of the points of this true tale correctshowing a rare reverence for the source material. All too often history takes a back seat to making a marketable film. The only major thing the film got seriously wrong were the mutineers themselves. However this is because only recent excavations have shown that the men who mutinied in effect killed each other offas they apparently WERE scum after all. But based on material available at the time it was pretty good. As to Bligh's temperament the British admiralty found Bligh completely blameless. However later as governor of Australia Bligh alienated everyone and was by most accounts a real jerk. So the essence of the film appears to be true. Hmm...for once I have no serious complaints about the accuracy of a historical filmthat's pretty rare.The best part of the film however is that the actors were absolutely on top of their game. Charles Laughton though prone to overacting by all accounts was exceptional here. Clark Gable was in his elementand simply one of his best film roles. The same can also be said of Franchot Tonehere he has a much deeper and meatier role than usual. In fact the three came off so well that all three were nominated for Best Actornecessitating the creation of Best Supporting Actor and Actress categories. The rest of the cast the supporting journeymen actors were greatwith Donald Crisp with hair!! excellent as a troublemaker Dudley Diggs as a very sympathetic drunkard and many others in top form.The direction by Frank Lloyd the cinematography music sets and location shooting were also wonderful. So why if this film was so perfect would they try remaking it?! This is a great example of a film whose remakes definitely pale by comparison. A perfect or at least nearperfect film in every way.By the way if you are curious about the real life Bligh after both this mutiny and the rebellion in Australia that he appeared to instigate he was rewarded with the rank of Rear Admiral! Who says life has to be fair?".

But based on material available at the time it was pretty good. As to Bligh's temperament the British admiralty found Bligh completely blameless. However later as governor of Australia Bligh alienated everyone and was by most accounts a real jerk. So the essence of the film appears to be true. Hmm...for once I have no serious complaints about the accuracy of a historical filmthat's pretty rare.The best part of the film however is that the actors were absolutely on top of their game. Charles Laughton though prone to overacting by all accounts was exceptional here. Clark Gable was in his elementand simply one of his best film roles. The same can also be said of Franchot Tonehere he has a much deeper and meatier role than usual. In fact the three came off so well that all three were nominated for Best Actornecessitating the creation of Best Supporting Actor and Actress categories. The rest of the cast the supporting journeymen actors were greatwith Donald Crisp with hair!! excellent as a troublemaker Dudley Diggs as a very sympathetic drunkard and many others in top form.The direction by Frank Lloyd the cinematography music sets and location shooting were also wonderful. So why if this film was so perfect would they try remaking it?! This is a great example of a film whose remakes definitely pale by comparison. A perfect or at least nearperfect film in every way.By the way if you are curious about the real life Bligh after both this mutiny and the rebellion in Australia that he appeared to instigate he was rewarded with the rank of Rear Admiral! Who says life has to be fair?";

It is the most literary version based on the novels of Nordhoff and Hall  there are actually three novels and it did give Charles Laughton his most famous ogre which he repeated later as Captain William Kidd twice but somehow the story was properly told in this version. Somehow making a case for Bligh weakens the story of men rebelling when they can't stand anymore.If one wants to see the story from Bligh's side read his very readable account THE MUTINY ABOARD H.M.S. BOUNTY but keep in mind that it is his account of his side of the story. Christian never did get a chance to produce his side of it. Peter Heyward the real life version of Byams Franchot Tone had the family connections and money to publish his antiBligh account but Bligh's book became a best seller.Historically most people feel that Bligh was more bark than bite. Unfortunately for his reputation he would be involved in later years in two other mutinies that of the entire British fleet the Great Mutiny of 1797 where his ship H.M.S. Director was the last ship to take down it's flag of mutiny and the New South Wales mutiny of 1805 where he was the Governor of the colony and his measures led to a mutiny of the local New South Wales Corp. But the Great Mutiny was actually caused by government corruption and neglect of it's seamen. As for the 1805 mutiny Bligh was trying to control the New South Wales Corps which was not only corrupt but bullying the civilians. In the end his reports led to the recall of the corp. to fight against Napoleon on the Iberian Peninsula. But Nordhoff and Hall presented Bligh as the villain there too.The film also has more to it than the ranting of Bligh at MR. Christian! There are moments of comedy. Laughton's temper and anger are punctured a few times when the new cook Herbert Mundin keeps bungling things. When Laughton is angrily confronting a dissatisfied sailor he happens to be staring directly at the sailor and Mundin. He orders the sailor to step forward but Mundin does causing Laughton to sputter. Also Mundin manages to toss garbage over the side so that it ends up hitting Laughton in the face. One wishes there had been more than this or better than that an attempt to bring the two actors together in a comedy. Add to this Mr. Bacchus Dudley Digges whose leg depending on when he is talking about it was lost in a sea battle with the French by a shark who six months later turned up dead with the leg still inside him and shot off by a pirate off Madagascar or something like that. His death in the film is a signal for the collapse of the one spot of humanity linking Christian's faction with Bligh's.It is now generally accepted that Bligh was one of the greatest navigators in history and the open boat voyage after being thrown off the Bounty remains an incredible achievement he lost only two men. The film's best moments for Laughton is in this section as he suddenly becomes far more wiser and humane trying to keep his crew healthy and able to continue to sail to safety. But when in charge of a full ship Bligh could not or would not control his temper and his tongue. It was sufficient to get him into trouble. However it was also his ticket to fame. Seaman remember the great navigator and the cartographer  the man who sailed with Captain Cook and who fought at Copenhagen in 1801 next to Horatio Nelson. But the public will always remember the illtempered martinet fairly or not whose tongue made nautical history.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1935 the worst years of the depression were over the pitfalls of the early talkies had been overcome and Hollywood was starting to regain its confidence. For the first time in several years pictures were being made as big and bold as they had been in the late silent era. And like the flagship of this new era comes this highly fictionalised account of the Bounty mutineers.Although this is very much a Hollywood production it may seem a little strange to see that allAmerican lead idol Clark Gable playing an Englishman. This being the days before such things really mattered and Gable not really being one to shift his persona too much he makes no attempt whatsoever at an English accent. And yet he fits in very well. Gable always carried with him a touch of the theatre where he cut his teeth and proves himself a powerful counterpoint to the blustering Charles Laughton. With his barrel chest wavy hair and easygoing swagger he does have the makings of a swashbuckling hero and this is the role Fletcher Christian takes in this adventuresome adaptation. Gable is in a way Hollywood's ambassador in the story  just about convincing as an 18th century naval officer but familiar enough to give US audiences a lead into the movie.Opposite Gable is a mix of American faces and the British actors who had started to migrate stateside. Charles Laughton's performance as Captain Bligh is integral to the movie. You realise here that Laughton was rather a short man and he plays on this making Bligh a jumpedup Napoleoncomplexed bully all sharp jabbing motions an arrogant stance and a face like a dead fish. Alongside Gable and Laughton the third Best Actor nominee was Franchot Tone although he is not really exceptional merely worthy. There is a typically strong turn from Donald Crisp and Eddie Quillan is surprisingly decent if a little overwrought. The only wrong note is perhaps Herbert Mundin or at least his character. The bumbling little comedy performer was always good to see in Errol Flynn adventures and the like but he is wrong for this more serious affair. Note how he seems to disappear from the story when the mutiny takes place which is fair enough  one couldn't really imagine that sweet little chap joining the mutineers or cast adrift and dying by inches.The director is one of the masters of old Hollywood multiple Oscarwinner Frank Lloyd. Lloyd's smooth confident setups bring a tense fractious feel to life on board ship while never using too much obvious technique as to make it seem artificial. A lot of shots such as the early one of Gable leading the press gang show men facing each other in profile aggressive combative. In almost every shot we are made to feel the motion of the ship and even below decks we have the swinging of hammocks. By contrast the scenes on dry land are palpably solid emphasising the change to a more peaceful life on Tahiti. Lloyd is also one for composing tableaux that are memorable and iconic. There's an oddlooking but very effective shot shortly before the flogging scene with punishmentdoler Morrison staring coldly ahead on the lefthand edge of the frame that has seared itself into my memory.And ultimately it is just such a grand iconic feel that characterises Mutiny on the Bounty. The Herbert Stothart score is a bombastic medley of nautical themes and emotional underscoring. The forceful rhythmic editing of Margaret Booth provides us with some striking montages. And of course there is the fact that nothing is faked. Fullsize replica ships were built and location filming was carried out in Polynesia with none of the ugly back projection shooting that mars many pictures before and after. Such a mighty production demonstrates why you need such largerthanlife stars as Gable and Laughton. Here is a movie that does everything it can to announce that big Hollywood is back in all its glory.".

Victor McLaglen took home the statue for The Informer with the fifth nominee being Paul Muni for Black Fury.Clark Gable wisely did not attempt a British accent and yet there was no criticism of his performance as Fletcher Christian. Christian was first mate of the HMS Bounty and a man of conscience. It tears him up inside to see the sadism and cruelty of Captain Bligh on this voyage. The men aren't king and country volunteers as he tells the captain. But the captain has his own ideas.Normally Charles Laughton played a whole lot of twisted andor tortured souls for the screen. His Captain Bligh is a man with a deep inferiority complex. The key to him is in the dinner scene on board the Bounty. Watching him you can see the envy and jealousy he has of the confident and self assured Gable the callow youth Franchot Tone brimming with idealism and even the surgeon Dudley Digges who despite his drunkeness and crudity is a professional man with some education. It's so much like James Cagney's captain in Mister Roberts and worse because at that time the British Navy gave him the authority of God on that ship.The conflict between Gable and Laughton is obviously the main plot of the film. Yet there is a subplot that's rarely talked about the conflict between Gable and Franchot Tone. Tone who was also American but was stage trained and could fit into a British setting easily plays Roger Byam one of the young midshipmen on board and who Gable befriends. The key to his character is right at the beginning of the film when he's being sent off to sea by Henry Stephenson playing Sir Joseph Banks. Seven generations of Byam's family have been part of the glorious naval tradition of Great Britain and none have failed in their duty. That should be uppermost in your mind.Gable and Tone have different ideas of duty and it tests their friendship. Each chooses a different path yet Tone ends up defending Gable against Laughton. Franchot Tone's finest screen moment for me has always been at his court martial where he makes a stirring speech in defense of the rights of the ordinary British seaman.As always though the mark of a really great film is the impact those small character roles leave. The men on the Bounty include Donald Crisp Stanley Fields Eddie Quillan Herbert Mundin. My favorite though is Dudley Digges as the ship's surgeon Mr. Bacchus. At the drop of a shilling he'll tell you how he's lost his leg. Outrageous humorous and a kindly man who softens the blows of Laughton's harsh discipline had there been the Supporting player categories then Mr. Digges would have been my choice for 1935 as Best Supporting Actor.Even in black and white made in the studio back lot Mutiny on the Bounty still holds up well today. Despite two subsequent versions of the story this version has stood the test of time.".

They did but having been to Tahiti at least they did right by Polynesia....even the words were Tahitian!! Hard to imagine that in a 1935 film.What was wrong was the reasons for the mutiny and the portrayal of William Bligh. I have nothing but praise for every role Laughton has done. SUPERB!!! But the real Bligh was the exact opposite. Too gentle I think and didn't see this all coming.Put yourself in the crew. Almost a year at sea eating rotten salt pork then months in a tropical paradise with sexy girls....would you look forward to that return voyage???".

	schema:headline " Quite Possibly The Best Movie Of The 1930's";
	schema:reviewBody "In a decade that saw some spectacular movies in a variety of genres from All Quiet On The Western Front in 1930 to Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz in 1939 Mutiny On The Bounty is in every way at least equal to and in my opinion better than any of the others. It is a classic example of moviemaking at its finest.Technically the film is superb. Well filmed and with realistic sets the viewer feels as if he really is on an 18th century British Navy vessel. I remember as a teenager coming across this movie halfway through and not really knowing what it was about but being captured by the vividly realistic portrayal of life at sea. That feeling has never gone away when I watch it. The performances are breathtaking. Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian and Franchot Tone as Roger Byam are excellent but it is Charles Laughton as Bligh who steals the show. Everything about Laughton in this film screams Captain Bligh and his is almost certainly the face that comes to mind when one contemplates the historical figure of Bligh. All three were nominated for Oscars as was director Frank Lloyd and inexplicably failed to win although the film itself was named 1935's Best Picture. The film mixes adventure gripping drama and even humour into about two and a quarter hours of sheer enjoyment.You can quibble about a few things. Apparently history suggests that Bligh might not have been quite this sadistic nor Christian quite so noble. There's a strange shot of the Bounty being run aground by Christian at Pitcairn Island and as the ship is about to crash into the island the film inexplicably reverses and the end of the shot is clearly going backward for about 2 seconds. I admit that it was passing strange that both Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam speak with American accents making one wonder how these guys were in the British Navy but for the sake of Gable's and Tone's performances that can be overlooked and at the end the movie gets a bit preachy particularly Byam's speech to his courtmartial. But these are minor and do not detract from one's enjoyment of the film.Watch this if you never have. Watch it again if you have and watch it over and over if you can. It is a masterpiece. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen one of the three major film versions of the famous mutinyand therefore have no knowledge of the plotthe opening credits of the 1935 film will give you a pretty fair warning of what is about to happen. I've seen all three versions 1935 1962 and 1984 and this version has quickly become my favorite. Charles Laughton the famously strict Captain Bligh leads a twoyear voyage from England to Tahiti to procure breadfruit plants and bring them back. His secondincommand Fletcher Christian is played by an unmustached Clark Gable. At first Gable supports his captain and tries to get the crew to behave and obey their commanding officer to avoid his horrible punishments. But when Laughton repeatedly brutalizes his men for small or nonexistent infractions Gable leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. I know Clark Gable was called The King but he really wasn't a good actor. Please nobody throw anything at me and hear me out. He was very handsome made girls swoon by taking his shirt off in most of his movies and had a powerfully confident presence onscreen. But his acting consisted of shouting or smirking with exception to The Misfits. When you watch Mutiny on the Bounty it's as if you're watching Rhett Butler on a boat. He's exactly the same. My criticisms of Clark Gable aside the rest of the movie is very good! The character of Captain Bligh has to be so much more than just strict and unreasonable. He's obviously a mass of problems otherwise he wouldn't act the way he does and in Charles Laughton's interpretation those problems are written on his brow. He broods wants to be better than he is and craves order and respect for deep reasons and it's obvious without being melodramatic. But it's Franchot Tone who steals the show in his performance. He's the most likable character and he delivers so much passion into his lines whether he's interacting with Tahitians and creating a dictionary falling in love or finding a balance between loyalty to his captain and to his friend. I like him anyway but I've never seen him pour so much of himself into a role as in this film.All three leads were nominated for Best Actor in 1936 since the Academy hadn't created the Supporting Actor category yet and the vote split between them. The only nominee who wasn't in Mutiny on the Bounty took home the gold that year but at least the film won Best Picture. The sea scenes were pretty remarkable for 1935 so keep that in mind when you watch it.If you can keep an eye out for James Cagney David Niven and Dick Haymes as one of the dozens of extras in the film. I never found them but you can give it a shot. This is very much a man's movie but I enjoyed it immensely. The characters and production values kept me riveted even past the end!".

It succeeds in everything a film should with an interesting story idyllic and realistic acting and a wonderful feeling. The leading performances of Charles Laughton Clarke Gable and Franchot Tone are the ones of legend. The fact that the 3 of them canceled each other both in the film and in the Oscar for Best Actor is a common fact. Laughton's scenes as the ruthless Captain Bligh succeed not only in making me believe he was a British Naval Officer of the late 18th century but also made me loather him. Rarely do we see actors throwing themselves into their roles like this. Gable's Fletcher Christian is perhaps some of the more daring characters I have seen on the screen with Gable wisely not trying his hand at a British accent and shaving that iconic mustache. Gable's performance is among his career's best and he seemed to fit naturally within the plot and his talented costars. The scenes when he finally loses his temper and lets go of his bottled emotions are awestriking. Franchot Tone in one of his first film roles steals the show with his earnest wise and passionate turn as Roger Byam. His speech in the final moments of the film is the greatest monologue I have heard in a film especially due to his criticism of brutality at the seas and that of Captain Bligh. If the Academy even saw that scene they should have given the thing to him. One of the best movies Ever.".

	schema:headline " The definitive expression of the myths of the adventure film";
	schema:reviewBody "The historical incident of the mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty has been chronicled in a number of films including THE MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY Australia 1915 IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY Australia 1933 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY MGM 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY MGM 1962 and THE BOUNTY Orion 1984. A number of other adventure films are directly imitative from relatively obvious cases such as TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST Paramount 1946 to less probable derivations such as ADVENTURE IN SAHARA Columbia 1938.The 1935 version is by far the best remembered of all of these although the 1962 and 1984 remakes benefited from south seas locations and the early Australian productions had a regional proximity with one of them starring Errol Flynn. While none of the versions are historically accurate the 1935 film most closely follows the original bestselling trilogy of novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall which also formed the basis for the 1962 version. The 1935 film was produced and directed by Frank Lloyd who had spent some of his early years at sea himself and also directed such other notable historical sea adventures as THE SEA HAWK 1924 THE EAGLE OF THE SEA 1926 THE DIVINE LADY 1929 and RULERS OF THE SEA 1939.MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY has an extraordinary cast in Charles Laughton as Captain William Bligh and Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian with Franchot Tone in the pivotal role of Roger Byam a fictional addition to a story whose other primary characters are all actual historical figures. At the beginning the voyage is without a hero becoming an odyssey that takes the protagonists far from their usual existence. MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY opens as Christian raids a tavern to impress a crew including a young man who must leave behind a pregnant wife while on board Bligh has a man flogged who is already dead from punishment. Bligh has lost all grasp of humanity treating his men so barbarically so as to ultimately obviate any loyalty due his position. Christian is cynical but considerate initially unquestioning of the status quo and obeying the captain although never sharing his malevolent streak. However tormented by his duties Christian transforms as the voyage progresses with Bligh's excesses forcing Christian to discover the need for ideals. The narrative seeks to unify these sides of Fletcher Christian's character and live up to his surname which finally causes the need for radical actionmutinyalthough this alternative will make the crew permanent outlaws and exiles. When Christian has Bligh and his followers set adrift in a small boat Bligh's subsequent achievement in steering his loyal men to safety is negated by his motivation to avenge himself on the mutineers. Roger Byam became a victim of Bligh's vindictiveness but unlike Bligh the navy as an institution is redeemed when a royal pardon is forthcoming for him. Christian had been an avuncular mentoring figure for the inexperienced Byam a junior officer whose ultimate conversion to the rightness of the mutineer's cause symbolizes a change in attitudes toward life at sea.In the sea adventure the oceangoing vessel is the kingdom in which the captain reigns where a smallscale allegory of revolution occurs espousing the right of a people to free themselves from oppression. I would suggest that this is the key element that has made this film so memorable and which is lacking in the other versions. The emphasis on the struggle for human dignity against a despot has a resonance beyond its direct context as the reenactment of an episode in naval history.

	onyx:emotionText "The historical incident of the mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty has been chronicled in a number of films including THE MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY Australia 1915 IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY Australia 1933 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY MGM 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY MGM 1962 and THE BOUNTY Orion 1984. A number of other adventure films are directly imitative from relatively obvious cases such as TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST Paramount 1946 to less probable derivations such as ADVENTURE IN SAHARA Columbia 1938.The 1935 version is by far the best remembered of all of these although the 1962 and 1984 remakes benefited from south seas locations and the early Australian productions had a regional proximity with one of them starring Errol Flynn. While none of the versions are historically accurate the 1935 film most closely follows the original bestselling trilogy of novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall which also formed the basis for the 1962 version. The 1935 film was produced and directed by Frank Lloyd who had spent some of his early years at sea himself and also directed such other notable historical sea adventures as THE SEA HAWK 1924 THE EAGLE OF THE SEA 1926 THE DIVINE LADY 1929 and RULERS OF THE SEA 1939.MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY has an extraordinary cast in Charles Laughton as Captain William Bligh and Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian with Franchot Tone in the pivotal role of Roger Byam a fictional addition to a story whose other primary characters are all actual historical figures. At the beginning the voyage is without a hero becoming an odyssey that takes the protagonists far from their usual existence. MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY opens as Christian raids a tavern to impress a crew including a young man who must leave behind a pregnant wife while on board Bligh has a man flogged who is already dead from punishment. Bligh has lost all grasp of humanity treating his men so barbarically so as to ultimately obviate any loyalty due his position. Christian is cynical but considerate initially unquestioning of the status quo and obeying the captain although never sharing his malevolent streak. However tormented by his duties Christian transforms as the voyage progresses with Bligh's excesses forcing Christian to discover the need for ideals. The narrative seeks to unify these sides of Fletcher Christian's character and live up to his surname which finally causes the need for radical actionmutinyalthough this alternative will make the crew permanent outlaws and exiles. When Christian has Bligh and his followers set adrift in a small boat Bligh's subsequent achievement in steering his loyal men to safety is negated by his motivation to avenge himself on the mutineers. Roger Byam became a victim of Bligh's vindictiveness but unlike Bligh the navy as an institution is redeemed when a royal pardon is forthcoming for him. Christian had been an avuncular mentoring figure for the inexperienced Byam a junior officer whose ultimate conversion to the rightness of the mutineer's cause symbolizes a change in attitudes toward life at sea.In the sea adventure the oceangoing vessel is the kingdom in which the captain reigns where a smallscale allegory of revolution occurs espousing the right of a people to free themselves from oppression. I would suggest that this is the key element that has made this film so memorable and which is lacking in the other versions. The emphasis on the struggle for human dignity against a despot has a resonance beyond its direct context as the reenactment of an episode in naval history. MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY celebrates a myth central to the American experience of a downtrodden people who rebel against a cruel king and replace him with a leader of their own choosing. In the process their heritage as Englishmen and their ties to the mother country are left behind in favor of a new land and a fresh identity in the film on the mutineer's refuge on Pitcairn's Island. In celebrating the selfdetermination of a necessary revolution MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY by analogy parallels the reasons methods and outcome of the creation of the United States.";

Of course in 1935 they didn't have the supporting categories.This terrific film shows what men will do to fight tyranny no matter where it is.

	schema:reviewBody "When you go as far back as the midThirties the movie landscape is cluttered with a vast variety of B programmers  mysteries Westerns crime films exploitation flicks and a whole lot more. The rare standout is a picture like Mutiny on the Bounty produced on an epic scale with an almost unheard of run time of two hours. Even rarer is an intelligent story line moving from a starting point to a finale that builds drama and excitement while developing the main characters.The story is a well known one even if one has only a passing familiarity with the various screen versions. A tyrannical ship's captain rules his crew with an iron fist while his first mate gradually begins to question the brutal methods used to instill fear and loyalty. As Captain Bligh Charles Laughton seems fairly at home in a role that he reprised in various incarnations on the big screen particularly as the haughty squire Sir Humphrey Pengallan in 1939's Jamaica Inn and later as the title character in 1945's Captain Kidd. To look at him Laughton seems to have all the characteristics needed for a pirate of the high seas except perhaps for an eyepatch and a hook for an arm. Laughton's treatment of his role here as an exalted British naval commander gives one pause to consider his methods made memorable by frequent whippings to keep the crew in line even if they're already dead.As first mate Fletcher Christian Clark Gable is forced to balance his opinion of Bligh maintaining loyalty to command while favoring more civil methods to win the respect and loyalty of the men on board the Bounty. The turning point in the story occurs with the death of ship's surgeon Bacchus Dudley Digges a position of no return when Christian casts Bligh and his supporters adrift  I'll take my chance against the law you'll take yours against the sea.What's probably most remarkable about the historical facts behind the story is Bligh's miraculous journey back to dry land over a distance of some thirty five hundred miles. For those who stood trial for mutiny once recovered from the island of Tahiti a gallant soliloquy is delivered by seaman Roger Byam Franchot Tone on behalf of the crew who remained loyal to Bligh. Of the three principal characters it's Byam who was the most conflicted renouncing Christian's friendship while maintaining some of his own sympathetic feelings for the men who suffered the Captains' wrath.With occasional interludes on the island of Tahiti to relieve some of the shipboard tension Mutiny on the Bounty delivers a nice blend of action adventure intrigue romance and the occasional humor supplied by Herbert Mundin's unique casting as a reluctant seaman. The more exotic locales of the picture often cry out for a color treatment and though that's addressed in the 1950 and 1962 remakes there's something about the original that makes it endure as first among equals even if historical accuracy is a frequent victim. True cinema fans will want to view all three to make up their own mind.".

But 1935 was the first full year that the motion picture production code was in force and so there were many adjustments being made. One was that the studios turned heavily to period pieces to pacify the censors because they could argue that with all of those ruffles top jackets and petticoats in the way there was no possibility any of the characters could be having sex!But this is a fine production in spite of the reason it was probably made. MGM movies made in the era of Irving Thalberg were generally top notch in attention to detail. Of course the acting is really the best part of the film. And I have to give special kudos to Franchot Tone. Never the star at MGM that Gable was and never the legend that Laughton was he gives a very nuanced performance of a man conflicted. His character has his loyalty to the British navy steeped into his being probably due to family background and thus wants no part of a mutiny yet he sees the cruelty of Captain Bligh's treatment of the men and is fast friends with Fletcher Christian Gable.Laughton always gives a fine performance but his performance as Captain Bligh is a bit one note here threatening to chew scenery but ultimately resisting the urge. At no point did I ever see him as anything but two dimensionally cruel and we have nothing to tell us WHY he behaves this way.Gable has star quality as Fletcher Christian in probably the best role MGM ever gave him. How many people would remember him if not for the two roles he had at other studios in It Happened One Night and Gone With the Wind?The fact that all three main actors here were nominated for Best Actor of 1935 probably weakened all of their chances but then Victor McLaglin would have probably won anyways since he was that good  essentially a one man show in John Ford's The Informer.My rating is for how much I personally enjoyed the film. If you realize that period pieces adapted from literature are generally not my thing and yet I enjoyed it and yet it held my interest throughout I'd say a 710 is pretty good coming from me.".

MGM's big budget blockbuster was bursting at the seams with talent. Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh the abusive and tyrannical ship's master and Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian the brave leader of the mutineers turned in such gripping performances that both were nominated by the motion picture academy for the best actor award as was Franchot Tone for his first rate performance as the harshly mistreated midshipman Roger Byam. This is the one and only time in the history of the Oscars that a single film's cast received three nominations for the best actor award.The plotline of Mutiny is based on a true story. In 1787 the HMS Bounty set sail from England to the island paradise of Tahiti in the south seas on an illfated mission to gather breadfruit plants for slave plantations in the West Indies. The voyage out was a long and hazardous one made worse by the many hardships faced by seamen of the British fleet in the eighteenth century deadly dangerous weather and especially the cruel discipline and torture that were characteristic of the imperial naval service at that time. By contrast the five months' stay on the lush tropical island of Tahiti was idyllic with the ship's crew lazing about in the sun and making love to the beautiful native maidens. It was only on the voyage back to England that the talk of mutiny began finally erupting into a fullfledged rebellion. Even today there is considerable historical debate about Mutiny on the Bounty and the bestselling novel upon which it is based. Some critics believe that the punishments inflicted on the Bounty's crew could not have justified a mutiny and that the movie unfairly takes the side of the mutineers. But they forget that the shipboard rebellion which caught fire at almost the precise moment as the French Revolution was entirely in keeping with the radical spirit of those politically turbulent times. Because of such tragic events flogging would eventually be abolished completely in the American navy and later in the British navy as well. Today all forms of cruel and unusual punishment are outlawed upon the high seas thanks in part to the sacrifices of the brave men on board the Bounty. The legend lives on in the movie and is a rallying cry to the downtrodden victims of oppression all over the world.What finally happened to Fletcher Christian and his men? Did they survive their escape or have later misadventures in the South Seas? No one is sure exactly what became of them. What is certain is that many descendants of both Christian and his followers to this day continue to live on Pitcairn Island the mutineers' final stopping place.If any one star can be credited with the success of Hollywood in the Golden Age it must be Bounty star Clark Gable. He was the most popular movie actor who ever lived in role after role playing the sexually irresistible macho foil to tinsel town's sultriest leading ladies. Ironically because he had to compete with his own costars he didn't win the best actor Oscar for Bounty but he already had won the prize the year before for the romantic comedy It Happened One Night starring as a gossip hungry reporter opposite Claudette Colbert as a spoiled rich girl. Most fans will remember him best though for his unforgettable role as the roguish southern gentleman Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind the movie with the largest audience in history. If Clark Gable nearly always played the romantic idol costar Charles Laughton had one of the most colorful careers of any Hollywood star being cast in the kinds of unusual character roles that many a typecast leading man would fear to play such as Henry the Eighth the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Dr. Moreau in Island of Lost Souls. By the way the actors in Bounty weren't the only ones nominated by the academy for awards. Other nominations were for best screenplay best film editing best musical score and best director which went to Frank Lloyd who had already earned the Oscar in 1933 for Cavalcade. A terrific job all the way around!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite my issues with Hollywood Mutiny on the Bounty is my favourite film. I first saw the slightly poor version with Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard and wasn't very impressed. I then bought this on DVD and loved it. The story based on a true historical incident is about the tyrannical Capt William Bligh bullying and abusing his crew until he drives them to mutiny lead by Lt Fletcher Christian. While this version is not historically accurate and has some unimpressive casting it is very well filmed and has a very good script. The film stared Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian and he is my biggest issue with the film he was not acting he was just being Clark Gable. No attempt at an English accent no real emotions showed just reading his lines. The only reason he wasn't panned for this film was because the character of Fletcher Christian fitted his onscreen persona. He weakest in this film there were so many other better actors in Hollywood at the time that would have been better for the role Ronald Colman could have played him and the one I would have loved to see play him would have been Laurence Olivier . The other star was Franchot Tone as the idealistic Midshipman Roger Byam again no attempt at an English accent but he was acting a bit more than Clark Gable and he JUST about fitted the role OK. But the only person who owns the film is the legendary British actor Charles Laughton as the sadistic bullying Capt Bligh. He was absolutely fantastic and acted everyone off the screen if it wasn't for him I doubt I would enjoy this film. Other supporting roles are a bit better than the leading American stars. Donald Crisp as Thomas Burkitt Eddie Quillan as Thomas Ellison Dudley Digges as the surgeon Dr Bacchus adding the right amount of humour to the film Henry Stephenson as Sir Joseph Banks Ian Wolfe as the slimy Mr Maggs and Bill Bambridge as Hitihiti.This film is grandly filmed with perfect sets and costumes for the period and the special effects for 1935 are VERY VERY good. It is one of the ultimate high sea adventure stories and I highly recommend it for classical film buffs.Derek".

	onyx:emotionText "Despite my issues with Hollywood Mutiny on the Bounty is my favourite film. I first saw the slightly poor version with Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard and wasn't very impressed. I then bought this on DVD and loved it. The story based on a true historical incident is about the tyrannical Capt William Bligh bullying and abusing his crew until he drives them to mutiny lead by Lt Fletcher Christian. While this version is not historically accurate and has some unimpressive casting it is very well filmed and has a very good script. The film stared Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian and he is my biggest issue with the film he was not acting he was just being Clark Gable. No attempt at an English accent no real emotions showed just reading his lines. The only reason he wasn't panned for this film was because the character of Fletcher Christian fitted his onscreen persona. He weakest in this film there were so many other better actors in Hollywood at the time that would have been better for the role Ronald Colman could have played him and the one I would have loved to see play him would have been Laurence Olivier . The other star was Franchot Tone as the idealistic Midshipman Roger Byam again no attempt at an English accent but he was acting a bit more than Clark Gable and he JUST about fitted the role OK. But the only person who owns the film is the legendary British actor Charles Laughton as the sadistic bullying Capt Bligh. He was absolutely fantastic and acted everyone off the screen if it wasn't for him I doubt I would enjoy this film. Other supporting roles are a bit better than the leading American stars.

I'm not one of those people who believe that film story should blindly follow the facts offense which is inspired. This is one of the reasons why this movie I think one great sea adventure.Set design atmosphere authenticity and acting are top notch. One of the few highbudget films that did not take studio in ruin. In the thirties of the last century it was an amazing success.I felt American tone in the British environment. It sounds intimidating but I am of the opinion that the director did it for a reason. In one interesting story covered various topics. I think this is a movie in which everyone can find a segment that he'll like that. The heart of the story is a constant complication that gets climax as sailor rebellion. In the center of the plot are the two main characters so that the excellent acting contributed to a better effect.Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh is described as a brutal sadist. In several scenes we witness the brutality when sailors put in chains or when ordering the flogging a dead man. The man who wants to destroy the human spirit and at the same time calling for certain disciplinary view. But in one part of the film he shows the qualities great sailor a spiritual leader a motivator a wise and capable captain. The desire for revenge and extreme conditions to change human personality. Laughton had to impose in addition to Gable. I enjoyed a brilliant performance by one of the major villains in the history of cinema. This is worthy of an Oscar.Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian without his famous mustache is the complete opposite of Captain Bligh. Exemplary and intelligent master's mate becomes the leader of the rebellion. Just a man who appreciates true values. Gable is perfect in the role.Franchot Tone Byam is a character with which everything begins and ends. I am convinced that the director wanted to induce the audience to perceive the essence of the story from the Byam perspective. I think that at the end of Byam maybe a little exaggerated his role. All in all not bad.Small roles are also spice up the story. Sam Herbert Mundin and Bacchus Dudley Diggins are my favorite.A brutal horrible bold exciting dramatic and romantic story.This movie I could not call epic but certainly excellent.".

Some people still doubt that American Beauty will win as best picture which I don't because I think it was the best film of the decade but almost everyone agrees that this wonderful movie Todo sobre mi madre All About My Mother will win as best foreign language film. And it really deserves that.I've always recognized Pedro Almodvar's talent. Most of his films are very weird and quite surreal but sometimes I don't understand him. So I couldn't decide if I would see All About My Mother on the movies or if I would wait for it to come out on video. It was released in Brazil last October and only yesterday I went to see it at a local cinema. And... What did I think about it? Well... A true true masterpiece!The story of the film is about Manuela wonderfully played by Cecilia Roth a nurse who works at a hospital in Madrid Spain and has a 17 year old son Esteban who doesn't know the identity of his father. On the day of his birthday he dies in an accident and Manuela gets desperate. She reads his notes and finds out that he wanted to know at least the name of his father. So she goes back to Barcelona where she got pregnant trying to search for her exhusband but some surprises will change her life.What Almodvar makes to this movie is just incredible. He makes us cry and laugh specially in the scenes where the transvestite Agrado is. But in fact the film is a deep drama studying carefully the female universe with strength and realism and also explaining the importance of a mother. All the main characters are very well developed and each of them has some importance in the plot. It's really amazing how Almodvar knows women so well and how he loves and cares about them. His film is a very complex masterpiece with some important messages and a wonderful story and should be seen by everyone even for the American people who don't like subtitles. But pay attention the dialogues are fabulous!All About My Mother is surely on my Top 10 of 1999. And... let's wait for the Oscar nominees on Tuesday but I'm sure it will be nominated and certainly win. It's much better than last year's winner as a foreign language film Life is Beautiful and is a serious mustsee. Just do me a favor DON'T MISS IT!Rating 1010".

Leading lady Cecilia Roth is sensational as the mourning mother and the rest of the cast isn't any worse.The supporting roles by Penelope CruzMarise Paredes and especially Antonia San Juan are great.San Juan is a real time transvestite which makes it even more realistic. Almodovar caused quite a commotion with this provocative film although it never goes over the lineat least not in my tastebut you should not be old fashioned or truly religious because then it will offend you.The humor that is put in the film makes it an even better experience.The mixture of intense drama and comedy is perfect.Another brilliant addition is the great soundtrack.The mixture between harmonic classical pieces and jazzy compositions is magnificent.I can't wait to see more of Almodovar's work. 910 currently number 39 in my all time top 100 list".

They have an unusually close relationship and share everything with each other. The happiness abruptly turns into heartbreaking melodrama when Esteban dies in a caraccident while trying to obtain an autograph from his favorite stageperformer. Emotionally devastated Manuela returns to Barcelona the city she fled from 17 years ago when she was pregnant with her son. Slowly and one step at the time our heroine regains her will to live again and she's doing this by helping others. She watches over the confused Rosa during her pregnancy becomes the personal assistant of the depressed actress Huma and even fills in for the part of Stella in the 'Streetcar Named Desire'play and rejoins her old transvestite friend Agrado. This film is about human beings and their thoughts emotions and feelings. So don't expect an adrenalinfilled action movie that'll blow you out of your seat. More specifically Almdovar puts the slightly more eccentric prostitutes transvestites and lesbians members of society in the spotlights and succeeds in informing the masses that these are ordinary people capable of hurtinglovingand feeling. Through the clever and sophisticated use of absolute film classics like All about Eve and  of course  Streetcar this film reflects the depth and maturity of the substance. Todo Sobre Mi Madre contains several colorful characters worth analyzing but it's Manuela's main storyline that impresses the most. Not in the least thanks to the outstanding performance by Celicia Roth! The tears she cries are real and the agony she feels contaminates you the viewer. Roth is a very charismatic actress who amazingly represents every mother in this world. This is the best recent Spanish film I've seen recently aside from Tsis which is a completely different genre and warmly recommended to everyone interested in characterdriven cinema. You better watch it repeatedly to make sure you don't miss any aspect of the player's personalities. This review is dedicated to my Iberian Queen Nisa. I probably never would have seen this film if it weren't for her".

Cecilia Roth is great superb unforgettable but she's not alone Penelope Cruz beautiful vulnerable as a rose' Marisa Paredes an actress in her perfect role without forget to Antonia San Juan La Agrado' and Mr. Fernando Fernan Gomez.Please don't wait until someone tells you more about a film that puts melodrama drama comedy and how not tragedy in a eternal stream of harmony.

From MUJERES AL BORDE DE UN ATAQUE DE NERVIOS Almodovar had shown that in his mind rounded an ace and now several years after and with an irregular filmography brings us his perfect masterpiece TODO SOBRE MI MADRE a homage to all women beginning with Bette Davis Gena Rowlands Romy Schneider and ending with his own mother.Here we see not just a delicious plot perfectly narrated but a camera that fixes everything as if it was the last time our last chance to watch the indescribable feminine nature in a whole panorama where tenderness and courage rule life.A puzzle of transitions a delicate picture of characters and as ever a set design that remarks each scene with a touch of simplicity and sophistication. Cecilia Roth is great superb unforgettable but she's not alone Penelope Cruz beautiful vulnerable as a rose' Marisa Paredes an actress in her perfect role without forget to Antonia San Juan La Agrado' and Mr. Fernando Fernan Gomez.Please don't wait until someone tells you more about a film that puts melodrama drama comedy and how not tragedy in a eternal stream of harmony. It's a pity cinema is more pretty than life.";

Overall All About My Mother is one of the finest film that i've  watched where it is hard for me to find any flaws in it. With Cecilia  Roth playing Manuela the nurse who lost her only sonEstaban to an  road accident Manuela decided to fulfill her son's wish by looking for  her son's father which turns out to be Lola who has become a  transsexual. The whole movie is not only her journey of getting back a  piece of memory of Estaban but at the same time it also looks into  the world of transsexuals and lesbians. Not forgetting Penelope Cruz's  role of Sister Rosa a pregnant nun who contracted HIV from Lola.   With conflicts between Huma a theatre actress and Nina her assistant  come lover Agardo's monologue on being a transsexual and unstable  relationship between Sister Rosa and her mother Almodovar presented us  the dark side of human being apart from a mother who wants to fulfill  her dead son's wishes. Somehow Almodovar hints us a message in most of  his films that even homosexuals and transsexuals are human beings  even though they are totally different from the rest.   In all All About My Mother is one of the few remarkable films that is  worth watching.".

Consequently when Pedro tells a story he becomes obsessed with a culturally rooted notion of honesty. The primary value we are supposed to appreciate here is his honesty then the honesty of his actresses the nonwomen men are just buffoons and poltroons and finally the honesty of the real' characters.Then he takes all the selfreferential tricks of his northern brethren and grafts them on.

And in fact there are several even recent films which successfully use much the same devices. But here the notions of abstraction clash.

Sorry just doesn't mix  doesn't work in either venue.An unrelated complaint is Barcelona. What a wonderful place this city was built for films. Some filmmakers would truly use this opportunity to exploit Gaudi's notions of motion in space what else is film? But here we have a lost opportunity save some colored tiles. Worse Pedro presents the place as if it were a Spanish city. It is no such thing. It is half African it considers itself a separate nation it speaks a different language it hosts a cosmopolitan notion of modernity. It is to the world now what Paris was to the 30s but in three dimensions rather than two. It is ripe for exploitation for just this type of film especially considering the sexual mores the escape the Alicelike entrance tunnel. How could he miss this?".

The remaining male Manuela's 17 year old son Esteban is the only one whose masculinity is physically uncompromised but his feminine side is nevertheless evident in his journal writing in his devotion to the stage  particularly the works of Tennessee Williams and in his chummy confidant relationship with his mother. Nevertheless Esteban does provide the film's strongest testimony of the need for gender balance as he longs to connect to the father he has never known and who exists for him ironically as lack  the missing half of all his mother's old photographs.Unfortunately Esteban's death marks the end of Act 1. He is run down by an automobile while chasing after an autograph from his idol the famous stage star Huma another key female figure in the film. Huma is an aging actress who specializes in victimheroines  William's Blanche DuBois and Lorca's Bernarda Alba.

Following Esteban's death Manuela's attempts to recover from the emotional trauma include working for and befriending Huma as well as a standin performance as Stella during one of Nina's drug flameouts.Manuela's recovery is punctuated by her occasional dips into Esteban's writing journal where he had begun a work poignantly entitled Todo Sobre Mi Madre in honor of still another American work famously centered on female characters All About Eve. The mother Esteban idealizes in his journal is the mother we see Manuela struggling to become in the film. That process accelerates when she agrees to shelter and nurture Rosa who is pregnant HIVinfected and unable to face the censure of her mother or her religious order.Quite in keeping with Garp's claim that Life is an xrated soap opera All About My Mother resolves itself in a rush of soap operaish complications coincidences and confrontations. Rosa dies after naming her unborn son Esteban Manuela becomes the child's surrogate mother and reconciles herself with his dying father thus redeeming the masculine lack that the first Esteban painfully articulated in his journal and the child himself makes a miraculous recovery from his HIV birth legacy.

Lola a transvestite is not aware of Esteban which as the film progresses delivers numerous dramatic consequences and tear threatening montages.As writer and director Almodovar seems to be able to cement the right dramatic input at the right time delivering a supposed expectancy only to strive to shock the audience with a powerful emotional twist or an unthinkable idea. To say what the unthinkable idea is in this 1999 release would be to spoil a well worked powerfully controlled heartbreaker which would cost the true value of a picture purposefully identified with its drama.We have underage pregnancies traumatic and unexpected death family rivalry former lovers drug abuse and fiery working relationships that juxtaposed all cement this in the drama genre and given the context they are used in add to a great sense of realism. The way everything threads together is nicely worked with only a few hitches.Roth's character a former actress is conveniently placed in a theatre to see what will follow to recapture the past the absence of the father for such a long time distances some emotional connection for the audience and no matter how hard the plot works to convey its powerful message it never feels as compassionate and as emotionally connected as Volver.This film does boast some tremendous performances. A young Penelope Cruz would go on and generate her international stardom with this performance as the young worker who is pregnant. Cecilia Roth carries the picture with her constant driven attitude to not look back and thrives on living in the moment. The supporting cast all lend a strong array of drama and some good comedy from Antonio San Juan as Agrado especially her scene on stage.The cinematography and usage of various places keeps the feisty drama alive. The dreadful scene with the prostitutes the stage for the replica of A Streetcar named desire and the terrible incident in Madrid all combine to make this a wonderful drama.Strong well performed and written drama 8.510".

The women of Mother are so unfailingly resilient and benevolent and  there's really no other word but 'fabulous'  that the picture never achieves a real sense of urgency...Ya got me.  It doesn't.  Of course now that I realise that there's less dramatic tension than their ought to be I don't love the film any less.  I don't even miss the dramatic tension which would nonetheless help if it were there.  Partly it's because of the colours.  Almodvar has made a film for us to wallow in and if that's all we can do with it at least the luscious colours  along with the music and truly lovable rather than merely eccentric and fascinating characters  allow us to wallow properly.I will say that those who think Almodvar has wimped out and become politically correct are utterly wrong.  Political correctness has nothing to do with content it has everything to do with treading gingerly and being stilted.  All About My Mother stilted?

Such a display of human dramas seems demoralizing but the truth is Almodovar gives the audience the story in a fresh way never evading the drama the film itself is not somber but radiant with hope faith and friendship. Almodovar has always been very good in depicting the female world but this is his most outstanding creation a beautiful mixture of a superb screenplay which I think every persona that sees it can relate to a story which fills us with tears and smiles at the same time. Cinema is truly a way of communication and what Almodovar achieves with this film is an undeniable connection with the spectator almost every watcher was deeply touched by it. A coincidence? I don't think so it's the work of a master contemporary and sometimes underrated director. We can't say that only Almodovar shone with this movie for every element in it is outstanding every performance is riveting. The performance of Cecilia Roth Manuela should have been an Academy Award nomination at least. The entire supporting cast was incredible specially Antonia San Juan Agrado the prostitute. The cinematography is beautiful and the tango influenced score was a hit. I will also venture to say that this is the best film I have seen in my life one the same lines as Casablanca Psycho and A Clockwork Orange. Thank you Pedro Almodovar for this film! My verdict Evidently a 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The March of the Penguins has to be one of the most beautiful documentaries in recent memory. Luc Jacquet its director takes us on trip to Antarctica where we are introduced to the majestic Emperor penguins. Mr. Jacquet and his cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have done the impossible task to capture these penguins in their own habitat under conditions that seem almost humanly impossible to live let alone take this team to register it for us the viewers in all its splendor and bleakness.The Emperor penguins have to be the most elegant birds on this planet. They have such a noble way of standing and shuffling in almost perfect lines from the sea to the area where they will mate hatch their eggs and then have the females leave for the sea to feed themselves and bring back food for the new chicks. After that is accomplished it's the males turn to do their march back to the sea to feed and fortify themselves returning to the hatching and mating area. What makes these penguins so unique is the sense of family they project at all times. Mr. Jacquet makes it clear for us to understand the behavior of the Emperors in their hostile environment. The English version has the clear narration by Morgan Freeman who expands on the way these birds live and how they are able to survive under extreme conditions. From what I have read about the documentary the English version which we are seeing in this country has a musical score by Alex Wurman that enhances the movie in unexpected ways.Antarctica that icy white vastness at the end of the world has never looked more majestic than in this documentary. Thanks to Luc Jacquet we are enlightened by all what we learn about the Emperors as they endure and survive under the worst possible circumstances and remain the graceful figures they are. Watching The March of the Penguins feels at times like being at the ballet watching a magical dance performed by these flightless birds that manage to look so dignified all the time while doing for us their amazing dance of survival.".

The documentary filmed on location in Antarctica shows the birds' struggle to eat live and reproduce. Each year the birds walk over seventy miles across ice and snow to their breeding ground. There the penguins mate then conceal their eggs from the cold under a fold of their skin and balancing the precious new life to be born on their claws. Fathers take turns in caring for the eggs until they hatch while mothers walk long miles again to bring home food for the chicks. Once the chicks are born the parents work together to feed shelter and raise them. French director Luc Jacquet was a scientist before he became a filmmaker. He succeeded in making the story dramatic compelling and comprehensible to younger viewers. The film is skillfully narrated by Morgan Freeman. It is a definite MUST SEE.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you make the effort to catch March of the Penguins you'll be predictably pleased for the simple fact that if it's penguins you want to see it's penguins you're going to get. Beaucoups de penguins. And you will learn plenty about these noble survivors of the coldest place on earth. If it's Danny DeVito or Burgess Meredith you came to see you are quite off the mark. The Emperor Penguins of Antarctica survive and perpetuate their species in a frozen and surreal environment driven by instincts developed over centuries. They have mostly monogamous relationships and in the midst of this can recognize one another's 'voices'. These relationships help to organize survival. We get seemingly impossible and privileged views of their long marches across barren landscapes complex rituals of protecting of fragile eggs in 160 mph winds huddled in huge packs against the cold males and females sharing food foraging duties and chubby birds diving to great depths for fish. It's a remarkable system of survival. The French filmmakers shot on super 16mm film for one year with 120 hours of images which is a whole winter cycle for the emperor. They saw none of the images as they progressed. Nobody left until it was done and director as LUC JACQUET SAYS It took a year to recover. Reentry is a long process. The result is no doubt some the most remarkable footage ever filmed on the subject. What they do of course to reel in their audience is to anthropomorphize these creatures. Like the recent Parrots of Telegraph Hill we see the penguins take on the attributes of 'love' and 'caring'. The baby penguins toddle along just like little people except that they do so braving extreme minus degree temperatures. Miles of these cute birds march across landscapes like little wind up toys in a John Ford snow desert. The story is assisted by cloying music and narration and the dulcet tones of the ubiquitous Morgan Freeman. But any criticism of the manipulative aspects of the film would be irrelevant in the face of the achievement. These are stunning images beautifully assembled to serve a remarkable story. If your going to get the paying public into a nature flick this is the way to do it.".

There are even some times when the audience fell dead silent in quiet reflection such as when for one or two penguins the long march was in vain.Also bring the family to this one! I saw it with my mother sister and grandfather and we all came out talking about our favorite parts and how amazing penguins are. My mom said she liked Winged Migration more but I actually liked this one more.P.S. I noticed in the credits that there were digital effects artists who worked on March of the Penguins. I'm not sure what digital effects were done. If anyone has any information on this please send me a private message.".

The movie is visually astounding. The cinematographer has managed to capture extreme closeups where you can see the pattern of their feathers as well as breathtaking longshots of hundreds of penguins marching on the beautiful icy backdrop. There is also a suspenseful underwater sequence.The movie is accompanied with poetic voiceovers that tell the story from the penguins' point of view and gentle ambiance music. There are also a few laughs here and there as penguins bump into each other or slip on the ice.The movie could have been handled better from a dramatic storytelling standpoint but it seemed the director was aiming to create a sort of poetic new age nature movie and as such it works perfectly. Admittedly there are points where the style starts to wear on you and some parts seem to be repeating themselves but at 80 minutes long the movie doesn't overstay its welcome.All in all the movie is a memorable experience and manages to be informative and entertaining at the same time and even manages to be moving on occasion.

How exactly they know how to do all this is incredible.First they all leap out of the ocean and begin to march single file for over 70 miles to their preferred breeding ground. They look really cute as they do this.Then when they are at their breeding ground they look for a partner. There are loads more boys than girls so the competition is stiff. But eventually they find a partner and the magic happens. Do penguins fall in love? It seems they do and they all have strange rituals of hugging and talking gibberish. I have no doubts that they are actually talking to each other.As winter comes they all huddle together in a group. Eggs are laid and passed onto the male as the female go off to search for food. Some eggs are misplaced and the unhatched baby penguin dies. It's really sad.As the girls are away the boys have to suffer intense blizzards and snow storms. Some of the older ones die or as Morgan Freeman says simply go to sleep. A closeup of a penguin closing his eyes for the final time is truly a deeply affecting moment. Since this is the part where it's the males fighting for themselves this is probably the reason there are less of them.When the girls return the eggs hatch and adorable little babies poke their heads out and see the world for the first time. But since they are so small they need to stay sheltered. The males are still sheltering and when the female wants it back they have to move very quickly since the fragile little penguin cannot be out of warmth for more than a few moments.Some die. And a scene where a mother pokes at her dead chick is utterly heartbreaking. However the majority survives. As they have done for thousands of years. And as summer arrives they grownups depart leaving the babies on their own. And when one of the plucks up enough courage to dive in the ocean the rest follow. And soon they'll be back to take part in the same ritual the same survival quest.It's a purity and innocence that humans have long long LONG lost. Every creature on earth exists simply to multiply and be the dominant species. But surely Emperor Penguins do it in the toughest of conditions. Nature may be cruel but it's pure. You might even end up a little jealous and insist on living as a hermit or wildman in a vain attempt at getting back to nature. But inevitable you'll probably miss your playstation and porn too much.Morgan Freeman's narration is brilliant. But since he has the second coolest voice in the world after Lance Henrikson I could probably listen to him for hours even if he was just reading the dictionary. The score by Alex Wurman is also great and when coupled with the beautiful cinematography it makes for huge escapism. It reminds me a lot of the Landscape Channel which I used to watch as a kid.I totally recommend the film. And it's cool that for once a family film can be a documentary and NOT some total crap with Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin selling themselves out.".

The result is a brief but complete look into the world of one of the strangest and most determined creatures to have evolved in nature.The trailer gives away anything that might be considered plot. After all it is a documentary about the very direct need to survive. The story is really in the viewing. It is the visuals of the icy expanse and watching the huge the number of penguins in their parade. Once at their destination their behavior is moving and intricately social. They provide the amusing antics everyone associates with the flightless birds they slide around on their bellies and proceed upright in their dignified waddle. However their survival is maintained as a flock as they huddle for warmth share food share responsibilities and police one another's occasionally antisocial tendencies. Director Chalet does not flinch away at the moments when misfortune does strike. There are a couple of villains along the way but they take their place center stage one at a time. A seal and a seagull come forward to take their meals from the flock. Even one of the group's own attempts a kidnapping. Most of the danger comes from the starkly beautiful landscape. Members young old and the unborn fall to the harsh conditions. There are shots of the lost and the frozen that might bring tears or sadness from a younger moviegoer but these incidents do not overcome the overall positive themes of love and successful survival. It is odd that birds that act like fish can do so much to remind us of cartoon versions of ourselves. Although that anthropomorphized perspective is overstated in March of the Penguins it offers a glimpse of a rarely viewed part of world with crisp and beautiful photography and shares a genuine sense of wonder with us. 8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " The real star is Antarctica";
	schema:reviewBody "Incredibly beautiful cinematography musical score and narration by Morgan Freeman made this much more than a nature film about almost unbelievable penguin migrations in Antarctica. Yes the birds were pretty and very admirable for what they accomplished and the chicks were as cute as any babies of any kind anywhere. They got the requisite ooohs and ahhhs from the audience they should have gotten but the filmmakers did a great job of not overkilling viewers with the cutesy approach that ruins so many other nature films. This was a serious look at one of the more marvelous events in nature that the tattooed and pierced MTV generation knows nothing about never will and doesn't care. More's the pity.I liked very much that the French filmmaker tastefully didn't show all the bloody gore of a seal killing an adult and a jaeger killing a chick that lesser nature filmmakers seem to love to do. We got the message loud and clear without all the blood and body parts splashed everywhere. It did not harm the truth of the story at all that graphic scenes were limited.Very classy film all around and anyone with an artistic soul will love the great camera and sound work and all parents and nature lovers should rave at the penguins' parental dedication and sacrifice shown in the last wilderness on earth thankfully mostly unharmed by human interference so we could see the real story just as it has been played out for centuries. Wonderfully well done film don't miss it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Incredibly beautiful cinematography musical score and narration by Morgan Freeman made this much more than a nature film about almost unbelievable penguin migrations in Antarctica. Yes the birds were pretty and very admirable for what they accomplished and the chicks were as cute as any babies of any kind anywhere. They got the requisite ooohs and ahhhs from the audience they should have gotten but the filmmakers did a great job of not overkilling viewers with the cutesy approach that ruins so many other nature films. This was a serious look at one of the more marvelous events in nature that the tattooed and pierced MTV generation knows nothing about never will and doesn't care.

	schema:reviewBody "It is amazing that any animal can survive the months of unfathomably harsh weather depicted in this movie. As told in Morgan Freeman's excellent narration the English version emperor penguins have been doing so for thousands of years. At least they are built for it with oblate spheroidal bodies that maximize volume to surface area and a thick layers of fat and fur to help them survive the tremendous winds and unimaginable cold. As the movie shows they are also uniquely built to protect the eggs and newborn chicks from the drastic conditions that can even kill the adults.What is perhaps even more incomprehensible is that this was filmed by humans surviving those same conditions. Certainly they had the advantage of technology but it is hard to imagine living for days or weeks or months in the Antarctic winter much less carrying equipment and patiently waiting for the subjects to get used to your presence.The only flaw in the movie is what will also endear it to many of those that see it it is edited in a way that seems to give these animals too many human qualities. Throughout all the hardships of survival from the courtship ritual through the caring for the eggs and newborn chicks to the ultimate return to the preferred environment of the sea the penguins seem to show happiness sadness love satisfaction grief and a range of other emotions in very human ways. These are not after all short people in tuxedos they are animals acting instinctively. Granted they do it in an extreme environment but they are animals nonetheless.".

This film provides everything you could possibly want from a trip to the cinema.Of course I am describing a documentary about penguins. The important action linking the above paragraph to a documentary is the film's opening. The first shots show the penguins walking along the horizon. Slightly out of focus they resemble people  are described as nomads enacting an ancient ritual. In these opening shots a bond is forged between the audience and the penguins. The penguins  who throughout are portrayed as a sort of single organism in themselves though there is constant focus on the individuals involved and their personal dramas set against the backdrop of the group as a whole  are established as human.Soon after this humanizing opening the film establishes through visuals not scientific explanation that these impressive nomads are emotional beings who as individuals form a society. These individual penguins show personality and desire separate from yet subservient to those of the group as a whole. Their dilemma  the plot of the movie  is laid out simply  they must reproduce. Their motivations are to survive as a group to reproduce to love and to survive as individuals.The visual simplicity of black and white objects moving against endless expanses of ice sky and later water matches the simplicity of the story.These simplicities allow for brilliance of the visual landscape and the basic endearing and relevant story to come forward. There are many obstacles for the penguins. Gutwrenching pain strife sacrifice and loss are juxtaposed with inspiring moments of humor redemption love beauty and accomplishment.The universals of the story allow the viewer to lose himself inside the shotbyshot movement of the story to switch from one penguin to another longshots to closeups desperation to hope to bask in the beauty of the film and the landscapes and the sheer amazement that this happens on the same Earth as the movie theater and also to care about how an individual experiences this extremely unlikely adventure of life.This is less a nature documentary than a feature film. Watch it as such. The science is there for the viewer to see and accept. Scientific explanation is not the focus of the narration it is the backdrop for the stunning look that carries a deep and rewarding story.This all adds up not just a feature film but to the best feature film of the summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here in Finland there are two versions of this movie played in cinemas. The original French spoken version with Finnish subtitles and the second version which is dubbed in Finnish. I went to see the first one mentioned. When I went to the cinema I was expecting something like a beautiful nature film with magnificent landscapes and talking penguins. I was wrong. It's much more than that! The fact that the global environmental conservation organization WWF was in the project it was crystal clear that there is also a lot of extra dramatization. This is seen very clearly in the film. The film is trying to make the whole audience to feel pity for the penguins with some sad and some funny scenes. The music is also very touching and effective in many scenes but I didn't realized why it had to be English sung music why not French with that synthetic background beat. OK the singing was beautiful and touching but I think the music had been better without that background beat in some scenes! Even so because of all the beauty and the emotion the film was about to make me cry probably the first time in my whole life in cinema.One thing that separated this from an ordinary nature film was the style of commentary the voice of the narrator wasn't actually meant to be just a voice of a man and a woman behind the scenes but the voice of penguin's thought. In my opinion this was a great idea it works well and makes the idea more entertaining.Everyone knows that the life of an animal isn't easy at all. This is shown in the movie but thanks to fine editing the scenes notforsmallchildren including raw and mating scenes are cut off and edited wisely. These scenes have been made to be much more sensitive than for example in nature films and that is why they fit much better also for small children I think.After all I think this is one of the most touching movie I've ever seen. It is very well made and if you like nature films you got to see this. It's a great entertainment for the whole family. Just have to hope there will be made more films like this one in future.".

	schema:reviewBody "March of the Penguins features stunning photography. The scenery is bleak and gorgeous and the penguins are a marvel to watch. It was obviously done under dangerous and very difficult conditions. It gently teaches the basics of the mating cycle of the Emperor penguin. For these alone it's well worth watching  in fact it's well worth paying to see it in a theater since you won't get nearly as good a picture on DVD.But.The penguins are jarringly anthropomorphized in places. And this is the American version. Talking penguins would have kicked my rating down two or three points. The director is particularly enamored of the penguins' headbentdown pose. This appears to be because it looks so touching when interpreted in human terms. But there's no reason to believe that it has the same meaning as the same pose in a human and so it contributes to the anthropomorphism.The music while pleasant and mostly unobtrusive is still jarringly romantic and it's totally unnecessary. Why couldn't we have just heard the birds and the wind? That would have done wonders to set the stage in all its bleak beauty. As it was I found it hard to get involved and the music was part of what got in the way.A few people have objected to the natural violence shown. But in fact the problem for me was that the violence of nature was passed over so lightly. One egg freezes early another egg freezes late one or two chicks die one mama gets offed by a seal and one chick taken by a petrel all very gently. The penguins marching across the ice appeared stoic more anthropomorphism but we get little sense of the difficulty of the trek. And the storms described accurately as ferocious and deadly look on camera like a moderate March day in Iowa. Despite the setting nature is seriously prettified here.Although the basics of the mating cycle are clearly laid out I left wishing the movie had told a lot more of the story. They had time. They could have mentioned the explorers who discovered the mating site fascinating story from the little I know survival rates they give numbers for the weight loss  is the mortality rate too frightening? why the bird lays so large an egg dynamics of the ice ridges aspects of penguin anatomy which enable them to survive the cold and the long fast how can the penguins slide on their bellies so much without losing their insulation. Could have included a lot more. All in all some of my favorite part was the credits where they show a little of the equipment and the setup and the people making the film and how the penguins interacted with the filmmakers.Finally several things didn't fit. They said that the penguins mated over thick ice because it was less likely to melt through before they left but some shots of the location showed rock outcrops implying land and so were actually shot elsewhere. They show the females sloshing through a meltwater creek in late winter when there would be no melting. The narration gets to September and talks about several months of backandforth treks for feeding and then suddenly it's only November. The parents leave the chicks on shore never to see them again and then the chicks stand around for a month with nothing to eat but gaining weight and strength  huh? I don't mind that they used some footage out of place for dramatic effect but they didn't always keep it consistent with the dramatized locale.I like MotP and recommend it but with these reservations. It's a good film that could have been a great film.Edward".

	schema:headline " March of the Penguins";
	schema:reviewBody "March of the Penguins is a beautifully made movie that gives you a rare glimpse into the life of an Emperor Penguin. Details were shown about penguins that I had never realized before. Most fascinating to me was the father's role in keeping the baby chick safe while mom returned to the water for sustenance. It was heartbreaking to realize that an unhatched egg exposed to the harsh winter air would die in seconds. You could feel the pain that the parents felt when they realized that their chick had not survived. The intricate ballet the parents performed when transferring first the egg and then later on the chick was amazing to watch  it was an almost perfectly choreographed dance.Their lives are extremely hard much more than I realized but they seem to have an indomitable spirit to live in a land where many do not survive. Humans believe they have it so hard but the life of the Emperor Penguin gives us a lesson in the determination and will to live when and where many others would have given up. With their backs against the frigid and unrelenting wind the group stands together as a unit to nurture their children and to protect each other from outside forces.Another factor in the movie is the scenery the sunrises the brilliant blue skies they are stunning and absolutely breathtaking and revealed that Antartica although an inhospitable place for humans to live is a beautiful land with stunning vistas. March of the Penguins is that rare movie experience inspiring and eyeopening without being preachy. I thought I was knowledgeable in what I knew about penguins but I quickly discovered I was not. Highest recommendation!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is becoming increasingly rare to find nature documentaries shown on the big screens of corporateowned American theaters. And judging by the scant few people in attendance at a Saturday night showing of THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS I can see why. With the draw of so many garish productions offering the viewer an escape from the real world films that actually do show the complexities and beauty of that world are marginalized. It would seem to me that the decision to release a US version of the french film LA MARCHE DE L'EMPEREUR with different narration performed here by Morgan Freeman and a new musical score by Alex Wurman was based on the success of the animated film MADAGASCAR which features plucky talking penguins. I'm sure that this was not the sole reason but I would guess it played a part in the minds of the distributors who were looking for a return on their investment. What MARCH OF THE PENGUINS shows however is that even without the power of speech the emperor penguins in this film are intelligent and complex. It should also help reinforce the truism that animals do not have to talk or sing to be interesting.THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS follows the intricate and grueling migration rituals of emperor penguins as they cross the vast extent of the polar ice sheet to mate. Literally thousands make the miles long trip in a singlefile formation. Having completed the voyage we then see the busy process of choosing a partner and how the fertilized egg is exchanged to the males so that the females can make the return trek to feed. They will not return to the starved male penguins for about four months. In that time the eggs have hatched and the chicks take their first look out at the Arctic landscape. This frigid environment is unforgiving and not all the young penguins survive. The film handles these scenes gently. There is an inherent sadness in the idea that the world is hardest on those that can bear it the least but it is and the filmmakers do not sidestep the reality of the situation. The babies that do survive frolic and prance about as the camera lovingly follows them in their antics. They grow strong amidst peril and ultimately return to the ocean to begin the cycle anew. This material will be familiar to avid readers of National Geographic magazine the motion picture arm of which helped produce this film or those who watch nature films on a regular basis. Actually THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS doesn't really offer any fresh or groundbreaking insight into the study of these animals. It is however one of the few films that captures in such a stunningly picturesque way the full scope of their journey.In what must have been a harrowing ordeal in itself the film crew coexists with the penguins in the harshest conditions with temperatures falling to seventy degrees below zero and exacerbated by viscously high winds. The director Luc Jacque who also acts as cinematographer along with Jerome Maison seems to have a deep respect and fascination for these animals. These feelings come through as his camera lingers on the birds at times in closeup capturing only colors and graceful movement. These delicate moments are well accented by Wurman's lovely music. The aerial shots of a huddled black mass of male penguins against the stark white landscape are striking and relay the enormity of the adaptive gathering. One detraction is that the narration often tries too hard to graft the equivalent human emotions onto the actions of the penguins. They may feel emotion but it is different from the way that we do there are parallels in the behavior that can be drawn but Jordan Robert's script reportedly a vast improvement over the surreal french version which is mostly informative does becomes heavyhanded at times. That aside THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a wonderful alternative to the daily grind of hyperactive theatrical outings which ignore the unique characteristics of the creatures that we share this planet with. 810".

I saw the IMDb rating of Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies and decided to watch this flick therefore that is my fault. I was expecting to see a funny trash but I found an awfully boring movie with no story dreadful acting and cheap CGI.

For example when the little kid is sitting on Abe Lincoln's shoulders and telling him to move left and right so he can shoot zombies on the other side of a brick wall that Lincoln can't see over... Hysterical. The kid's shooting a big old musket and there is no smoke no recoil and he never has to reload it! Just BANG BANG BANG... Dead Zombies.To me that embodied the whole movie. If you can look past such obvious problems with having reality get in the way of the movie you might get a good laugh out of it. I mean after all it is a zombie movie...There are two types of zombie movies in my book the ones where you go ok here's the crazy scenario that you might have to face zombies like I Am Legend or 28 Days Later and then there is the who the heck cares it's a Zombie movie let's get goofy. This is the ladder and as such it's funny as heck.But even for the ladder it does move a little slow it's no Zombieland... So I give it a 3.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright whether or not Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies is The Asylum's attempt to cash in on the what looks to become a major picture Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter or not well I have no idea about that. But it does seem a bit strange that just prior to the major Hollywood production release of the latter movie The Asylum decided to put this on the market. That being said then it seems awfully a lot like what happened with I am Omega and the major Hollywood picture I am Legend incident.Regardless of the reasons for why Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies came into existence then I have now seen it not because I am American which I am not nor because it was with historically important American president Abraham Lincoln no but simply because it was something with zombies.Taking place during the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln and a selection of twelve secret service agents find themselves facing a threat of the living dead as they attempt to take over a ford. However the living dead is not the only enemy the Union people are facing.The story oddly enough was actually rather captivating and it managed to keep me interested right up to the very end. The storyline is a bit out there when you think about it but then again isn't anything with zombies that? But that is not what I mean. What I meant was taking a historically important figure like Abraham Lincoln and have him battle zombies with a scythe? And then later on this year he will be battling vampires! But oddly enough in a comical sense then the movie actually worked out quite nicely.Having seen a bunch of previous works from The Asylum then I can honestly say that they went all in this time guns blazing and digging deep into their pockets. This movie is such a major step up the ladder productionwise for The Asylum and just looking at the movie on the screen is a testament to them suiting up and stepping up to join the major league of movie production. The cinematography was great the effects were great and the people they had cast did great jobs. So it was really a refreshing touch to The Asylum's production value.As for the zombies in Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies well then they actually looked alright though there wasn't any major decay going on in them as I assume they were to be recently deceased and that worked out okay. The gore in the movie was alright as well it just enough to keep a gorehound like me interested. And again it was nice to see The Asylum step up and use better effects and CGIs for a change. However one thing did puzzle me about the zombies. They opted to stray from the mainstream zombie and had them standing about in a deathlikeslumbering trance when they weren't agitated by sound. That I found odd why would they only be attracted to sound? So they had all lost the sense of sight? But again it is a matter of personal preference I suppose. Some like Romerostyle zombies some like the fast and agile zombies as those seen in 28 Days Later and some like something else entirely.I found Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies to actually be good entertainment value. There wasn't any scares or real shock scenes in the movie which would have been nice. But still if you like zombie movies and wouldn't mind seeing a somewhat comical approach to the take on Abraham Lincoln then Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies is definitely worth checking out.As for the ending of the movie well I am not revealing anything here but there is a twist there in wait. I personally didn't really like it but it was a nice turn of events nonetheless.".

Loved the story and the way the writers worked in historical lines in the name of butt whoopin emancipate this! They had fun creating it and it showed.I think The Asylum films bring a MUCH needed levity to an industry that takes itself WAY too seriously. Every release from the big studios are on such a grand scale that the trailers themselves look like they cost a million plus. The blockbusters are so reliant on wow cgi that character developmentcreativity and story lines are somewhere in the trunk under the spare tire and jack!This isn't a masterpiece but it is fun and I laughed a lot.

I found myself drawn to some of the characters being portrayed and Bill Oberst did an excellent job as Abraham Lincoln and its a completely serviceable zombie film. Of course it has its problems. The CGI effects are incredibly cheap looking duh its The Asylum get over it and the plot is fairly simplistic. Its basically a standard zombie film which includes historical figures. If you can overlook that then you should be able to enjoy the film without much difficulty.".

I am almost certain that most of the actors were from a civil war reenactment group.About half way through with the constant historical figure's names being added I thought for sure we were going to see Fidel Castro. Come with me Mr. President if you want to survive! I am from Cuba in the distant future sent back in time to assist you. But I guess the writers didn't think of that one. Someone actually got a decent camera and found someone who didn't have the shakes from cocaine addiction. I would rank this movie's historical accuracy up there with Inglourious Basterds 2009 title. I am still pondering how that one got rated so high.Now for some spoilers since this movie events are just prior to his Gettysburg Address in July 1863 Pat Garrett born June 5 1850 would have been 13 years old. Theodore Roosevelt born October 27 1858 would have been 5 years old. General Stonewall Jackson the real one died in a sick bed from pneumonia. Obviously this was an impostor I could tell by the fake beard. The dialog was very excessive in abusing historical quotes. At one point John W. Booth quotes from Hamlet. I am certain there were a multitude of stolen lines. If don't want to pay a rental fee to view this you can currently watch it on Netflix.".

If that seems light on a plot description then you might want to stay away from this film because that's pretty much all there is. You know many people attack companies like The Asylum for not having any fresh or original ideas of their own but I've always given them a fair shot. I mean if we were in the 50s or 70s then the drivein would have been playing these types of movies each and every weekend. With that said the biggest sin any movie like this could make is to be boring and that's exactly what has happened here. I think there could have been so many interesting ideas that could have been done in regards to Lincoln going up against zombies. Just take a look at how many lives were lost in the war on Lincoln's command a film about them coming back from revenge would be interesting. The dead from the war coming back to help win it could have been interesting. What we got here is just downright boring on a number of levels but I think the film was just too silly to be taken serious and it wasn't nearly campy enough to keep you entertained. As you'd expect the CGI effects were all extremely cheap and the fake gore was just painful. The performances weren't too bad and while Oberst gave a good performance I'd say I still had a hard time believing he was really the president unlike the real movie. It is funny to note that even though this came out a month before the real movie this here actually featured several scenes that were quite similar so I don't know if that was just a coincidence or what. Either way ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES is a complete bust and not worth watching even with a free rental.".

Still there aren't that many zombies to see only towards the end we do have a horde involving children. When the zombies are being killed it doesn't become gory. The blood and beheadings are done CGI wise and some CGI is really awful. When zombies are attacking people and getting them to the ground nothing is shown like in those good old zombie flicks. No tearing apart of corpses no intestines being eaten. Of course being a low budget it all takes place in one place a socalled fort. Inside there was a lot of talking which didn't add towards the suspense. The end you could see it coming from miles away. Gore 15 Nudity 05 Effects 25 Story 25 Comedy 05".

The story tries to follow the historical facts after the Battle of Gettysburg it uses the characters that are well known through out history yet with the best will in the world having a zombie in the same roomarea as Abraham Lincoln does stretch it a bit. Having those Zombies evenly spaced over a field in a long shot makes more of a mockery especially while famous historical characters argue over who will die!The acting notwithstanding the make up when you see Stonewall Jackson's beard you will understand is really a disappointment. The zombies must have gone to 'Little Miss Messy's House Of Childhood Makeup Artists'...The music has been stolen from every B movie back to the 1950's. The camera work is straight from the pamphlet 'How to be a Movie Director in Five Easy Steps'! Where were the over the shoulder shots?Now for the good parts for every movie has them This movie tries to make a huge film with a small budget.

I have a teenager who just finished studying the Civil War in high school. Not possible for him to get it with the education he got. sigh Maybe read Killing Lincoln before reading this. It will give a lot of context to the names and locations.There was actually a scene lifted right out of Hamlet! It gave me a good 5 minutes worth of giggles. And I don't giggle.Throughout the movie the Gettysburg Address kept developing. A phrase here a paragraph there all naturally flowing from the action in the movie. I have never enjoyed an Asylum script this much.Yes the acting was stiff. A lot of the scenes were clumsily blocked and directed. The Civil War battle scenes were pretty good. Almost certainly stolen from somewhere else or they just filmed at a reenactors event. Too many people did dumb stuff. Low budget zombie film I get it.But I was completely taken by surprise by the ending. I really didn't see that one coming. Maybe I was just being a little slow.For what it is this film was about as it could be and much better than it deserved to be. Give it a chance.".

It was also fun to watch the Pres. go out and take charge and get his zombie kill skills going rather than sit in his office and give directions.The story line was good and well written.

However there are vast differences between the states of Iron Sky yesterday's onestar film and Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies not least of all the budget. That Iron Sky had just under 9.5m compared to ALVZ's budget of 150000 at least makes most of the latter's mistakes forgivable if not watchable.The lack of budget makes the anachronisms understandable it's very difficult to ensure the sets are perfectly authentic when the budget forces the use of available locations rather than custombuilt sets. Believable prosthetics also cost mucho  and so head of makeup Renonda Anderson makes the most of her greasepaint and fake blood. Her work qualifies for a C but it's a pity director Richard Shenkman didn't take Spielberg's Jaws approach of showing as little as possible so as to make the rubber shark more menacing.What is unforgivable and completely unrelated to budget is the poor and at time shocking acting from principals and background artists alike. There isn't even any consistency with the movement of the zombies and that would have instantly improved the viewing experience. There's an awful lot of hamming it up and even more instances of walk talk turn head talk facial expression talk Yes there are some godawful amateurs out there and I've received some quality hate mail from reviews and features I've published in the past highlighting them if demand is high I'll republish them on this blog sometime and the majority of Abraham Lincoln vs Zombie's cast is equal to them. Whilst there is variation in the performances the variety on offer is ham wooden awkward and dire and there are slipped accents aplenty.The exception thank goodness is Bill Oberst Jr. playing the titular character. He's not famous he isn't mindblowingly good and according to his IMDb page has worked since 2007 largely playing unnamed or singlemonikered characters in short films and individual episodes of TV series. However with 18 projects in preproduction postproduction or awaiting release Oberst Jr. must be doing something right and is quite likely to continue working for a while yet. While Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies is a dreadful film because of the ineptitude surrounding him Oberst Jr. stands head and shoulders both literally and figuratively above his fellow cast members.What else is wrong with it? How long do you have or rather how much interest do you have in it? It isn't graded properly it jars with the period the sound mix is poor the editing is lazy and the timing is mostly awful. It looks as cheap as it is but I'm giving it two stars rather than nowt because Shenkman has made the best of the shoddy materials on offer. He's only getting two stars though because he could have found better actors at the local high school and even Barbara Cartland could have written a more dramatic screenplay despite being more dead and less animated than the zombies on screen.That said Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies could turn out to be a very good calling card for Shenkman for all its stodge. Just look what A Fistful of Fingers did for Edgar Wright. Now there's a man who knows how to shoot zombies!Another film review from The Squiss.

I was well pleased with the acting and production quality of this neat little motion picture. The adding of other historical figures as characters was I thought a cool touch.

Taking time to order a meal he finds the consumption of a seafood platter to be a challenge. Just before catching his train he asks Emil a Russian film director on his way to be a judge at the Cannes Film festival to use his camcorder to record his boarding but accidentally causes Emil being left behind at the station. Bean attempts to cheer up the director's son Stepan as the train continues south but matters are made more hectic by the fact that Emil has reported his son to have been kidnapped and Bean losing his wallet and essential travel documents at a pay phone where he and Stepan attempt to contact Emil.

Either these people just don't have a sense of humour if I may be that harsh or they didn't even see the flick and just reviewed it based on the weak trailer and their own false assumptions. I on the other hand have seen this movie and I can honestly say that it blew me away. It is not only about ten times better than its weak 1997 predecessor which the film wisely ignores completely it is a genuinely great movie. It's a feelgood movie which actually makes you feel good !! and never turns into awkward sappiness. It is also absolutely hilarious and thank god unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series.The basic story is that Mr. Bean wins a ticket to Cannes where he accidentally separates a young boy from his father. Bean must help the kid find his father again. The plot is hardly the focus of the film though  it's all about Bean and the often awkward often painful and always funny situations he gets himself into.Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best and I think it's about time he gets an Academy Award. No I'm serious. If you think playing Mr. Bean is just a matter of goofing around and making stupid noises I'd like to see you do it. Atkinson has developed this character to absolute perfection and is the only one who could possibly play the lovable idiot. The overthetop body language the facial expressions and the convincing vibe you get from Bean that well the lights are on but there's nobody home  you can't bring all of this to a character if you're not a good actor. Rowan Atkinson is a genius and like most comedians he never gets the recognition he deserves.The supporting cast is good as well especially Willem Dafoe as an arthouse director with his head so far up his own ass and an ego so ridiculously huge he makes Roger Ebert look like Adam Sandler. But this is really Atkinson's show and he carries the entire movie as expected. The sight gags and physical humour aren't exactly intellectual but they are very funny and fresh most of the time and the comedy is well kind of classy. There's absolutely no toiletgrossout humour which I love by the way so it's really a mystery why the stuckup critics disliked this as much as they did  assuming they even watched it. Although the humour is pretty safe most of the time it never stops being funny and I can safely say that this is a film that the whole family can enjoy and trust me I don't often say that about movies  fun for the whole family usually translates to fun for the average twoyear old torture for the rest of humanity in my mind. It's not just kiddie stuff and the comedy is universal.It's a sweet warmhearted and very funny movie with a great soundtrack good performances a light plot and a fantastic ending. Which leads me to the question Did I and the critics watch the same movie? Perhaps Willem Dafoe's obnoxiously pretentious character hit just a little close to home for the snotty critics the film so obviously spoofed? They can have their Playbacktype films and gush praise over them all they want  I'd take this holiday over that any day.".

	schema:headline " A Slapstick Feelgood Road Comedy that Brings some Smiles and Laughter";
	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Bean is back and he's going to France on a holiday adventure. It's great to see Rowan Atkinson back on the big screen after a long time. I think the last time I saw him on screen was in 'Love Actually' not sogreat film but Atkinson was awesome. And of course he's playing the character he immortalized the goofy Mr. Bean. There are several Beanish slapstick moments set throughout the dazzling spectacular French locations. Beam also befriends a young Russian Stepan and a French actress Sabine. Together they share his adventures.Though the comedy itself doesn't rely on witty dialogues there's plenty of fresh slapstick and silly moments that made me laugh. Of course I enjoy Mr. Bean's sketches too so there is a chance that those who don't like him might not enjoy the film. I found the characters quite lovable. Emma de Caunes as Sabine is charming and pretty and child actor Max Baldry as Stepan is impressive unlike those annoying movie kids who 'beg' the audience to love them when getting on their nerve. But 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' clearly belongs to Atkinson. He's a wonderful comedian and it's great to seem him back as Mr. Bean.Cinematography and visuals do a great job by portraying the stunning locations of France. Yes because of that the film is visually impressive too. The editing seems good enough but I found the ending to be slightly choppy.Having said all that 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is much better than it's prequel. This one feels fresh and...well my summary pretty much says it all. A fun family film especially if you like the Mr. Bean Sketches.".

	schema:reviewBody "This hasn't quite been the great year for movies that I had hoped for but it has certainly been a very good year for comedies and Mr. Bean's Vacation is the best so far. It is also quite a daring film  who would have imagined a Grated live action comedy these days and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. This movie homage and I can it can be argued that it is to the great Tati films of Mon Oncle and Mr. Hulot's Holiday is Rowan Atkinson's triumphant farewell to the great character he created. It is hard to imagine any other actor living today pulling this off. Indeed Vacation comes very close to being a silent film  though I want to assure anyone wandering in from a showing of Transformers that there are explosion. Now over at the wellknown movie review site half the critics are complaining about Mr. Bean's mugging. Half the critics at that site will apparently complain about anything. But when you have a face as brilliantly expressive as Atkinson's gosh people you use it. To moan about that well it's like going to a Fred Astaire movie and complaining about the dancing.But more than that every scene works fast or slow the pacing is perfect. Silly scenes or heartfelt or both the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes! There is also a lot of feeling here. I completely bought every one of the characters and their relationships. That is great comic writing.It also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not Mr. Bean's Vacation. It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.I cannot recommend this movie enough though I wish it had been longer. Take your family to see it  it will be a long time before anyone can say that again about a contemporary comedy.".

Clearly we can notice the inspiration from Mr. Hulot's Holiday USAAll the supporting actors are very good it is just a very well cast film with great soundtrack! Also Willem Dafoe is great as the obnoxious pretentious artfilm director So please Rowan don't do the same that the main character do in Sullivan's Travels 1941. WE NEED MR. BEAN!!!".

It seems that Rowan has taken bean to a new emotional level resembling classic silent artists such as Keaton and at times Chaplin some scenes seem very reminiscent of the kid and help keep peoples attention to the story not just Beans funny movements though at times it drags slightly.

	schema:headline " Great fun but overly sentimental";
	schema:reviewBody "Rowan Atkinson had disappeared off our screens for a little while. After the critical mauling of Johnny English he sort of vanished into thin air for a while. Personally I can never understand why the critics savaged Johnny English as much as they did sure it was flawed but it was pretty funny. Now however Rowan Atkinson has returned and he's brought along his most well loved character to date. Mr Bean is back ladies and gentlemen! Now for some people this will cause great excitement for others it will cause them to groan very loudly. You see Mr Bean is an acquired taste and after seeing this movie I can still very much say that Mr Bean is an acquired taste. If you dislike Mr Bean in the first place the odds are extremely high that you will hate his latest outing. I on the other hand really like Mr Bean not love but I enjoy his sketches and the last movie was pretty funny. This movie in my eyes is a bit better despite still being overly sentimental and some comedy moments feeling a bit too forced. But this is a movie of small pleasures this doesn't deliver witty comedy in fact a lot of humour relies on either slapstick or embarrassing situations yet the comedy still feels fresh and you can't help but enjoy it all along.The first thing I'll mention is the actual storyline and the actual comedy of the movie. The storyline here works a lot better than it did in the first Bean movie. It seems more natural and like a proper Bean movie not committee driven like the first movie seemed. The story involves Bean winning a raffle and going off on a holiday to France. It's a simple story and won't be winning any awards but its what happens along the way that makes the movie so much fun. The comedy here ranges from pretty small laughs such as the tie getting caught in the baguette machine to absolutely hysterical sequences which involves Mr Bean trying to earn some money. And the comedy works like that throughout its always making you smile whether it be small little sequences that make you smile to yourself or whether you're practically rolling in the aisles this is a feel good movie and proud of it.Nevertheless the fact it is a feel good movie is also the movies largest downfall. The original Bean movie had huge problems because it was overly sentimental unfortunately it seems like they haven't learnt their lessons with this movie. Sure it starts out hilarious but the sentimentality begins to kick in around the halfway mark and sometimes it is unbearably sickly that you can't help but want to heave. Of course this is a kids movie so I can't be overly critical with the sentimentality. But I would have preferred it to have had a little less of it. We want to see Bean in funny situations not in a situation that tries to be heartwarming yet feels oddly misplaced. My other moan goes with the ending it seems rather abrupt and also a tad sickly. The sickliness of it goes with my last complaint. But the ending after a bit of a lead up just suddenly jumps on you and its over. I was the only out of the group I saw it with who felt this so perhaps that is just my feelings but in my eyes I wanted a more spread out ending.The performances of the movie are up to a pretty high standard. Atkinson doing his traditional Mr Bean routine it doesn't feel old in the movie and it still proves that the character is pretty funny. Willem Dafoe pops along for a great role and the actual child actor of the movie was surprisingly not irritating like a lot of child actors out there. Overall Mr Bean's Holiday is a great family movie that will keep the kids in hysterics and the adults very happy as well. Its not going to amaze people but in terms of fun this movie should be a family favourite.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last week i took the girlfriend to see '300' this week it was her turn to pick the film... her choice... Mr Beans Holiday. I wasn't too impressed with this but fair is fair! I couldn't remember much of the first film but wasn't expecting to be blown away or enjoy it to be frank! However i was pleasantly surprised and am not ashamed to admit i enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong this is no classic but it is a enjoyable film. The first thing i liked was the fact it wasn't set in America so i didn't have to listen to a number of Americans try to explain who this Mr Bean character was! I didn't laugh out loud but I did chuckle along at the jokes and enjoyed some of the darker aspects such as the mobile phone gags! When i saw Karel Roden pop up early on in the film i chuckled to myself as he filmed the camcorder... thinking back to the film '15 minutes' if you've seen it you'll understand what i mean This helped me loosen up and allowed me to enjoy the film. Also loved the whole Carson Clay in love with himself film moment near the end.I loved Black Adder but was only a Mr Bean fan when i was very young as an adult i have to say i'd grown out of it! This however made me reminisce and remember how good a comedian Rowan Atkinson is! The director also deserves credit too as he keeps this story nicely edited throughout and lets the adventure unfold at a nice pace. Mr Beans love interest also deserves credit for being very easy on the eye! I won't go on about this film much but basically don't just cross it off as something you'll hate. This is a loving nice and lighthearted affair though strange in places it fits itself as a film that is good enough to sit through and enjoy. So if it's a rainy day sit back relax and watch! A basic film comedy for all the family!".

	schema:headline " Bean 2 is another quality Mr. Bean adventure by the great comedy genius that is Rowan Atkinson a movie that is sure to put the smiles on our faces";
	schema:reviewBody "After a quiet last couple of years Rowan Atkinson returns to the big screen in what will probably be the last outing for Mr. Bean.Mr. Bean's Holiday sees Bean head off to the South of France after winning a prize in a savethechurch raffle where as you can imagine things don't exactly go to plan as he stumbles across problems in actually getting there. On his travels he meets the son of a Cannes Film Festival judge Baldry his father a beautiful actress de Caunes and a selfish film director Defoe. The Cannes Film Festival is used to bring the characters together at the film's end in some hilarious final scenes.Don't go into this expecting something along the lines of the original Bean movie. Bean 2 has less talking and Mr. Bean probably works better with only the odd word. Fewer characters allow for this. The movie has a feel of less like the Ultimate Disaster movie and more like an extension of one of his TV shows not completely however  it still has many differences.I am a huge fan of Mr. Bean having watched all the TV shows from a young age. No work of Atkinson as Bean has ever disappointed and this movie certainly does not either. If I am being critical I would go as far as saying that the original disaster movie was better  that had more of the feel of a feature film. This was still great however and if you really like Bean you will not stop laughing in Mr. Bean's Holiday I certainly did not.Willem Dafoe was great in the small role that he had and the kid Max Baldry wasn't too bad either whilst the performance by good looking French actress Emma de Caunes was quite good too.I guess you could put Mr. Bean in any situation and it would still be great. I know the chances of Rowan Atkinson coming back again to play Bean are low but I would be so pleased if he could make another movie or even a few more TV shows.Rowan Atkinson is pure comedy genius and Mr. Bean's Holiday is great fun for the whole family.Excellent Movie  1010.".

Like some people before me have stated people who don't like this movie should check out The Playback by Carson Clay. Unlike the last Bean movie there is no moral yarn embedded in this story just pure unadulterated Mr. Bean comedy. This includes disasters that he unwittingly causes and ones that he causes deliberately. Best of all all the humor in this movie is new you have not seen it on the show. Basically watching this movie is like watching a one and a half hour episode of the show only better. Better because the humor is high budget. Better because there are recurring gags in the film such as him saying gracias while thinking that he's speaking French. But most of all better because this time there is also a plot. You find yourself cheering on Mr. Bean. For the first time we can really connect with Atkinson's character. So did this movie pass my requirements of becoming great? Definitely it passed with flying colors.".

If you're a fan of the Indian film industry and have kept up with the news Om Shanti Om is for you. If you love entertainment to the max OSO is definitely for you! Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om spares nobody not even its makers when it comes to poking fun. OSO is a film about films it's a film in a film and above all it's made to celebrate the biggest film producing industry  The Indian Film Industry.Om Prakash is a junior artist who thrives to become a lead hero one day. He is a horrible actor and has a mother who hams more than him. Om has another dream To win over a star ShantiPriya. One circumstance leads to another which leads to Om being a witness to the death of Shanti by producer Mukesh Mehra. Om also gets killed in the incident. That same night Om is reborn as Om Kapoor. Will Om realize his pastlife? Will he avenge Shanti's death? As the tagline suggests For some dreams one lifetime is not enough.OSO has a donetodeath story. But that's not the point. The film is a parody of films and the ones working in it. Notice the spoofs on the yesteryear stars such as Manoj Kumar. A controversial scene but one can't deny it's hilarious. Not to forget spoofs on Govinda Keshtu Mukherjee and Suraj Bharjateeyaa. Of course the most memorable comic scene has to be SRK pretending to be a south Indian actor. Mind It OSO's first half is gripping and keeps the viewer alert. The drama folds the right way. The second half loses steam at times. It's not bad but unlike Farah's first film where the second half competed well with the first it stars to slow down a bit. It picks back up fortunately.The spoofs aren't less hilarious in the second half. The film pokes fun of a lot of celebs and Indian film industry issues. To start SRK being late is a spoof on himself being late to sets in real life. Not to forget the whole dardedisco song is a spoof on item numbers. The high point of the second half has to be the award ceremony. The spoof on Abhishek Bachchan is subtle yet funny. SRK doing the same roles and being nominated is remarkably funny. Not to forget Akshay KUmar's outburst at the awards is aplaudworthy and ribtickling. Subash GhaiRishi Kapoor spoof is funny too.Flaws? As mentioned the second half falters in some parts. Also SRK remembering his past so quickly seems rushed and unconvincing.The climax however is a pleasant surprise.Special Mention  The Deewangee song is a treat to the eyes. 31 stars in one song is no joke and they all look nothing short of spectacular. Special mention to the ones that caught my eye with their appearance. Dharmendra Jatendra Kajol Salman Saif Sanju Rekha etc all do well alongside Shah Rukh Khan.Farah Khan and her team of writers have put some genius into parts of the movie. The writing is witty smart and quite innovative. Dilague is first rate.VishalShekar's music is amazing. With a variety of songs in one film they do a wonderful job.Farah's direction is first rate. She handles all the moments with ease. It's not a better film than Main Hoon Na but still a good job.In 2007 3 months before OSO released SRK unleashed the actor in him and kept the star away in a movie called Chak De India. In OSO it's the opposite. OSO is a film where SRK can chill and not worry about the criticism. His performance is explosive and energetic. In this it's SRK the superstar unleashed. And kudos to him for also poking fun at himself despite being the producer of this one.Deepika makes a grand debut and I'm sure she couldn't have asked for anything else. She looks gorgeous and makes a good debut. Arjun Rampal is spectacular as the villain here. Brilliant.The supporting cast does well too which includes the lovable Shreyas Talpade the scenestealing Kirron Kher and Javed Sheikh.Overall A grand film which has one objective  Entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Reincanation Hindi cinema love betrayal are some of the themes Farah Khan's delightful and crazy comedy Om Shanti Om deals with. But frankly it never really matters. This film is simply one of the most entertaining films made in recent times. A spoof of Hindi cinema of past and recent times the film both pokes fun at it and celebrates its unique inimitable style. As the story progresses the movie becomes even more alluring. It is at times a drama at times a thriller but generally it is just a musical comedy which is not to be taken seriously.Technically the film is very impressive. Farah Khan's direction is very good. The film is extremely colourful with great costumes and fantastic glossy sets. The 1970s settings are particularly authentic and visibly wellinvested. One more aspect which helps to recreate the magic and the atmosphere of the 1970s is the wonderful soundtrack. Dhoom Taana for instance seems to have been rightly taken from a film of those times.The film contains numerous sequences which will have you floored. The Filmfare Award ceremony is one of the funniest sequences in the film. The red carpet scene with celebrities predicting the winners was very funny. The next scene which includes the ceremony and the Best Actor nominations clip was absolutely hilarious. I could not stop laughing as every nominee was unfolded and Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar's reactions when they lost were awesome. The following sequence was the afterparty which was another memorable scene. The famous Deewangee Deewangee song which has some of the bestknown actors in India dancing to its tunes from Dharmendra Mithun Chakraborty Rekha and Shabana Azmi to Salman Saif Juhi Urmila Tabu Kajol Rani and Preity was very exciting and a pleasure to watch. It was truly a moment of unity and celebration for Hindi cinema.As far as acting goes Om Shanti Om is a winner. Every actor understands the film's mood and acts accordingly. Shahrukh Khan is great as the Oms. He's simple as the first Om cool as the second Om and overall is as witty and funny as always. Deepika Padukone makes a confident debut. She is very beautiful and likable. Kirron Kher shines in another comic role as the loud mom. Shreyas Talpade delivers a noteworthy performance as Om's best friend and holds his own despite a smaller role. Arjun Rampal plays the typical villain with style.Well to sum it up Om Shanti Om is an extremely enjoyable flick which should provide a great watch for the entire family. Like Farah Khan's previous offering with Shahrukh Khan Main Hoon Na this film has a genuine sense of fun. It is the quintessence of Bollywood's uniqueness which makes us realise why and how much we love this film industry. Remember not to expect anything serious or lifeturning and you will not be disappointed.".

I've not seen Saawariya yet but I am going to.Om Shanti Om was soooo entertaining fun stylish colourful emotional and had a very interesting story which I loved to bits told in a good format. Also there is not a Bollywood film made about films.The first half gave a very good insight of the 70s because this was a rocking decade for Bollywood and I was almost going to cry at the ending of the first half. The second half was even better and reminded me of Karan Arjun. Oh yes! There is a twist in the end that will totally shock you. It was like a delicious desert after a tasty dinner.Music is excellent composed by one of my most favourite music directors Vishal  Shekhar. The best songs are Ajab Si Dardedisco Deewangi Deewangi and Main Agar Kahoon. Dardedisco is the best music video I have ever seen of the decade....no wait! the best of the century.The film was about 3 hours but all that time was worth it and there wasn't a single boring or useless scene. The best scenes are Dardedisco song of course Filmfare awards Deewangi Deewangi song because there where 30 stars and the ending. In Sajid Khan's Heyy Babyy there where 14 actresses in cameos and he is Farah Khan's brother.I've not seen Chak De India because I never got the chance but whether you liked Chak De India or not you will love Om Shanti Om and if you didn't you can beat me up with a hockey stick. Overall I loved the film it was better than I expected and has a lot of fire. If you know what I mean".

But that's not it! This movie deals with reincarnationghost70's eracomedydramarevengethrill and what not. And it is a pretty difficult job to wrap all that up in just 2 hours and 40 minutes! And honestly Farah Khan fails at it. The fact that this movie was your ideal popcorn flick and you cannot expect any sort of serious drama from it is still bearable. So was Main Hoon Na. But wrapping so many things in that time left this movie in quite a mess. You do get a variety but not enough of either of it! I actually fell asleep watching this movie. There was only a couple of instances where I laughed. Apart from that this movie is a flush down the drain. What was Farah Khan thinking? Moreover what was Shahrukh thinking? This movie could have been better if more of everything was shown. But that could have taken another 2 hours which would've been worse. Apart from this there was a lot of overacting but that can be ignored due to the nature of the script. The new actress is excellent in her work. Shahrukh was good as always. But where does the actress eventually disappear after 70 minutes into the movie? She dies OK! But so does Shahrukh! But they show Shahrukh right in the next scene but the actress is totally ignored. Then she reappears in the last 25 minutes of the movie. I'd say the actress didn't get much scope. Atmost I won't give this movie more than 3 stars. Disappointing!".

Its very simple For people who adore Srk in his regular roles will lap this one up too.For someone expecting a Kabir Khan Chak De maybe a tad disappointed.Om Shanti Om is in the league of Main hun Na in terms of cinematic sensibilities. Its just pure fun woven around a story but never getting too deep into it. Characters are a bit sketchy plots get a bit contrived and clichs abound everywhere yet this movie passes the litmus testbecause it is all about the timing too.Its a perfect package for Diwali  an entertainer and Srkthe country's' biggest brandarguablythe combo wont fail.I am not exactly delving into the story for most people know what is needed. Yes its is a bit of a tribute with a zany sense of humour to the 70's you see the bell bottoms are back the sideburns flowery shirts as the 1st half of the movie is entirely in the 70's.Srk as the bumbling and goofy Om MakhijaAnd yes its about reincarnation following the lines of Karz Srk being the victimand also Deepika. Srk is reborn as Om Kapoor now a hot cool dude and a big shot in Bollywood. It is quite predictable hereon the twists are few but well crafted. I just wished the buildup was stronger the meat in the climax was missing.Finally The movie does fit the bill of a good entertainer Paisa Vasool will be liked by young and old I wont be surprised if this does turn out to be the BO winner of the year. Songs are hummable DardEDisco being a lot of eye candyfor women. Srk will attract a lot of 'drools'.And the title song with 31 stars is fun too!The minuses being just that it could have had more substance to the characters and the climax a bit more thrilling.It seemed like it ended too soon suddenly. And also some more meat to the 'motive' of Deepika being bumped off by Arjun.RampalPerformancesIts familiar territory for Srk believe me its a role which of course was just written for him though the 2nd halfOm Kapoor seemed a bit clichd. His dying sequence compares to his previous movieswill get the audience's empathy. Deepika is pretty and emotes well not really a lot of meat in her role but shes quite effective. Kirron Kher Hams but shes still adorable she manages to do that with ease. Shreyas Talpade was an interesting choice as Srk's pal does that with consummate ease.And my award would go to Arjun Rampal a out and out 'cool negative' role very suavely done. Its one of his more noticeable performances.OSO as mentioned is predictable and yet fun it works well for people who want a 3 hr reprieve!Its not what I can call 'Miss not' but still is the best of the current lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "OM SHANTI OM tells the story of Om Shah Rukh Khan and Shanti Deepika Padukone. Om is a junior artist in the 70s. Shanti is the reigning superstar. He is her biggest fan. He is in love with her. Om dreams of being a superstar but an incident changes his life forever. Om dies in a mishap but is reborn into the present day. He attempts to discover the mystery of his demise What I liked about the film? Well almost everything Yes I admit I've sold my soul to SRK! Which is 98.35 per cent of the film! The film is more a take off on the rebirth formula than a tribute but it does brilliantly. Farah Khan has made everyone act superbly yes including Arjun Rampal!. There are so many things to watch out for so I will just list a few highlights The cameos by almost the entire industry. The fantastic oneliners from '70s Bollywood The comedy scenes throughout the movie! the digital effects ala Forrest Gump. Deepika Padukone. SRK playing a brash star brat. SRK's abs of course!. The witty vision of the filmmaker.And finally Farah Khan and SRK's and the entire film industry's bold move to do a take off on the take off because when you look at it the film is not just a take off on '70s Bollywood but also on today's filmy frenzy! With each and every film one thing is sure Shah Rukh Khan will be outstanding and in this film to he is outstanding as well. In this film Shah Rukh Khan shows His comic abilities and he is bang on target. It just goes to show his range and versatility as an actor that on one hand he is doing Chak De! India Offbeat and on other hand Om Shanti Om where he is playing to the gallery which came easily only to Shah Rukh Khan.Deepika has all it takes to be a top star  the personality the looks and yes she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as Shah Rukh Khan and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air! Arjun Rampal impresses in a negative role which suites his image. Shreyas Talpade compliments Shah Rukh Khan wonderfully. Kirron Kher in one word wonderful.The masses will love it the classes will love it too! The youth will like it too even though they may not get certain references to the Bollywood of yesteryear's. A must watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "OM SHANTI OM tells the story of Om Shah Rukh Khan and Shanti Deepika Padukone. Om is a junior artist in the 70s. Shanti is the reigning superstar. He is her biggest fan. He is in love with her. Om dreams of being a superstar but an incident changes his life forever. Om dies in a mishap but is reborn into the present day. He attempts to discover the mystery of his demise What I liked about the film? Well almost everything Yes I admit I've sold my soul to SRK! Which is 98.35 per cent of the film! The film is more a take off on the rebirth formula than a tribute but it does brilliantly. Farah Khan has made everyone act superbly yes including Arjun Rampal!. There are so many things to watch out for so I will just list a few highlights The cameos by almost the entire industry. The fantastic oneliners from '70s Bollywood The comedy scenes throughout the movie! the digital effects ala Forrest Gump. Deepika Padukone. SRK playing a brash star brat. SRK's abs of course!. The witty vision of the filmmaker.And finally Farah Khan and SRK's and the entire film industry's bold move to do a take off on the take off because when you look at it the film is not just a take off on '70s Bollywood but also on today's filmy frenzy! With each and every film one thing is sure Shah Rukh Khan will be outstanding and in this film to he is outstanding as well. In this film Shah Rukh Khan shows His comic abilities and he is bang on target. It just goes to show his range and versatility as an actor that on one hand he is doing Chak De!

The actual songs from the movie are not bad and the costumes that the main actress wears are nice but that's the only good thing I can say about this film.

I had high expectations and I would not create any suspense for you guys. But this movie was not at all what I expected. What a ripoff from Rishi Kapoor starer Karz. I don't know why people are calling this movie a laughter riot it was so boring. I actually slept during few scenes. It was such a drag. The only reason I am even giving this movie a 2 on 10 is because of the awesome cameo by Akshay Kumar and to see Mithun Da Dharmendr and ever hot Rekha do some jiggy and their patent dance movements. Oh man nothing can beat the oldies.It is no way closer to the cult comedy movies like Jaane Bhi Do Yaron Andaz Apna Apna and Hera Pheri. Its a one time visit see it and forget it movie. You do not take anything from it when you leave the theater. Not even a single quote or dialog to remember from the movie. Other than the fact that they made fun of all time superstar hall of fame Mr. Rajesh Khanna and couple of other oldies they broke all the records of being a illogical roller coaster movie. At least old Karz was believable but this one is just a headache. And the ending was even more mythical than existence of Godzilla.Well I would suggest you to still go watch it but I regret spending my 12 on this movie. Could have had cheap Taco Bell 10 times rather than spending that money on movie like this. Its not worth spending that much money on this movie. Damn should have waited for it to come on DVD.".

This Movie does not even deserve to be rated to be pretty honest. The reincarnation sounds so fictitiously fictitious. I did not have the courage to watch it in a theater and that was a wise decision. The only good thing about this movie is that its not a 3 hour movie. It is time for people to realize that we make and watch sensible movies. I am not trying to be critical or neither do I have anything against the king of Indian Cinema but lets face it his movies are monotonous and this movie is no better.".

He is exactly what a dragon should be exactly how I imagined.  Quaid does an excellent job as Bowen and did well as Draco was not really there during filming.The music in Dragonheart is one of the most memorable themes ever composed. Randy Edelman composed a great theme for this film which could probably be recognized by nearly anybody.  This is from Dragonheart!This is definitely one of the best movies ever made.  The acting is excellent CGI fits perfectly the characters are deep wellrounded and the storyline and plotline are both great.  The ending is so sad though. If you're a male make sure no one else is around while watching this movie if you're ashamed of crying in front of people.Watch this movie.  It's a great way to spend some time.".

This was early demotype DVD disc exhibiting some excellent surround sound when very few other DVDs were as audibly as good.The story begins a bit slowly but once the dragon appears it's a fun and fascinating movie to watch. A decade ago when this came out I marveled It's amazing how they can make strange creatures so lifelike. Of course FX has only gotten better and better.For me the dragon was the only endearing character in the movie. Dennis Quaid plays the good guy but he's mostly annoying in here. I think it was his fake raspy voice that was irritating. In all a fun movie.At any rate the movie is pure medieval fantasy and theology but entertaining enough for kids and adults.

In the beginning Bowen really loved the younger Einon and thats why it is quite painful to see in the first fight scene between Bowen and Einon at the waterfall that in fact Einon never believed Bowen's teachings of 'the old code' you can see the sadness and realisation in Bowen that Einon is 'bad' and was even at the beginning.Thewlis as Einonbrillactually Thewlis is one of my favourite actors because of the 'brains' he puts into his characterstake Einon for examplenot outly strong etc.but you can see that this character thinkshe's educated he knows what he is doing. You only have to look at the scene with Einon and kara in the bed chamberlook at how Thewlis plays the characterusing words the ideas of 'power' to manipulate her. Of course its a family film and he is generally a good 'badie' but luckily not a straightforward stereotypical one. I must say he gives one of the best performances in the film.Dina Meyer this was one of her first films I believe and she does wellphysically quite strong which is quite a rarity to see a female who can stand up for herself in such filmsbut also adding a good character to assist Bowen.Postlethwaite very funnyI think he's a great actor and I loved him in thisdifferent to a lot of stuff he had done especially before this filmthe character adds a comical touch to the filmbut also he just generally portrays a 'good' character.Connerygood for the voiceyou can tell the actor straight away and I think thats why he was chosenbut also I think his voice just adds something to the part.The effectsbrill esp. for their timeeven now they still stand on their own and as a viewer you can just relax and freeze reality for a while and believe that a dragon is actually talking etc. on screen.Overall a great film that will touch the hearts of manyyoung and old. This is a film to watch over and overfull of laughs fights the odd tears and of course the classic battle between Good and Evil.If you haven't seen it beforerent it relax forget everything in reality for a couple of hours and just watch this great fantasy film.".

Draco is much more human than most movie dragons if you want a scary dragon watch Dragonslayer but he is very realistic.

It's a relevant thought you see because as I browsed the reviews I came face to face with an old acquaintance  the realisation that childlike wonder and imagination are actually rare enough to be in short supply enough to justifiably call those resources scarce.I raised an eyebrow vexed as people complained about realism I've heard complaints of the improbability of a dragon's ambulatory system without ever the self awareness to realise that with a few tweaks to physics to account for a different world  one where magic exists as an institution and resource no less  along with some fixes to common misconceptions of dragons and animal biology that one could make anything probable. Clever people call this 'escapism' a retreat into a fantasy fictitious world unlike our own. Escapism goes so much further than daydreams of attractive sexual partners and fast cars.Here I see in the 'goofs' section that the dragon's wings don't generate downdraft. Who says they need to? A man in Britain created a box that could generate quantum thrust by manipulating lasers. Who's to say that a dragon's lift doesn't work the same way? Cries off realism come only from dull mundane typical minds. Not anyone who's especially brilliant would even mistake fantasy for reality in the first place. Truly if one is unable to discern that dragon's exist in the realm of the improbable so far separated from our own then they've bigger problems than 'unrealistic' dragons.The pseudointellectual of below average intelligence complains of unrealism thinking himself clever. The truly clever person possessed of a sharp mind and considerable wit finds the challenge of explaining other realities with their own physical laws fun!So to wit this is a lovely film heartwarming ingenious and with a fantabulous showing from Mr. Connery. You may like it but you should probably only watch it if you're clever enough to understand the distinctions and boundaries between reality and fantasy. Though individuals quite clever enough for that are evidently few and far between.Don't apply if you subscribe oxymoronically to 'I don't want fantasy in my fantasy only reality with the rules of that even normalised and simplified into mundanity enough that I'm able to actually understand it' Or if you're inclined to prefer batlike dragon's over their six limbed cousins because they're more realistic without being erudite enough to realise why that statement makes no sense because playing by those rules the ambulatory pressure problems created by such a large flying creature would make batlike dragons every bit as unrealistic. If either of the prior is true you're not good enough for this film. It deserves a better audience.If however that gave you a chuckle rather than fired your ire you may just be good enough for it. In which case you really should watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody "may contain potential spoilersI only recently saw Dragonheart even though its been out for almost a decade. I stumbled upon this movie quite by accident but now that I've seen it twice I'm pleased with this discovery. I'm not a fantasy or dragon lore enthusiast but I found this movie enjoyable on many levels. Sean Connery lending his voice talent to the Dragon Drako is one of the most debatable choices in this movie. I personally think it was a good choice since I laughed every time I heard his English accent coming out of a medieval creature. The result? A dragon with a bit of sophistication and class. Also unexpected is the animation quality of the dragon. I expected that dragons would be something evil and harsh but Drako ended up as an surprising character that was both funny and interesting. One scene in particular Bowen finds Drako serenading Kara by a waterfall. Upon discovery Drako is embarrassed...well...as much as a dragon could.The story line is linear and easy to understand which leaves more time for the viewer to focus on other things. Dennis Quaid and David Thewlis do a good job acting although the character that David plays the evil king is a bit dim. In fact he is outright dumb which adds to the humor of the movie. Dennis plays Bowen the disillusioned knight who manages to be gruff and tough yet also remains light hearted about his duty. The plot partially follows the classic hero's quest theme. The plot at the end of the movie turned out the way it should have. Towards the 3rd quarter of the movie I feared that some cheesy ending would take place since the movie hinted at the possibility of some silly conclusion where everyone would live happily ever after and the bad guys would get thrown in jail. Fortunately the movie took the right path and a more serious ending ensued.This ended the movie quite well and I felt satisfied.I was surprised to see so many famous actors and actresses in this movie. Most of them acted well enough although none gave any spectacular performances. Only one actor really stood out as miscast in this movie Jason Isaacs who played the evil king's side kick. After seeing too many movies where Issacs is cast as an domineering figure with composure The Tuxedo Black Hawk Down The Patriot his character in this movie was just too weak. At one point he comes out of a house half dressed and accidentally drops his shorts or medieval equivalent for a brief moment. Overall this movie was fun to watch. Drako was a surprise and offered a very refreshing portrayal of a dragon although I can't compare this movie to any other dragon movie. Drako just seems to defy a stereotype I had in my mind about dragons. The cast is solid enough and the story is one that is simple but interesting. The ending did the movie well. One thing is for sure you can't watch this movie with a serious attitude. Its lighthearted and comical with a little bit of seriousness thrown in intermittently. Acting 610Special Effects 910 for its time!Score for a fun time 8.510Overall score 710".

Who would have thought of a Dragon as having a pure heart? I was astounded at the story but equally enjoyed it as the story unfolded. It had a lot of body to the story. It was not just fluff. The story really made me feel as if I was experiencing this first hand. I found myself rooting for the dragon. When we usually think of dragons we think of them being bad. Quite the contrary this dragon is good and not only good but honorable. It was the best film I have seen of its kind. I was only sorry when it ended. I wanted more. I did notice that a sequel was made. I have watched that as well. It was very well done. High five to the writers of these tales. To the producers as well this is one great film. It is excellent and all ages will enjoy it as well. Adventure Excitement Knights fighting and a Dragon pursued for doing evil against a prince but in the end found to be that the prince who became King had the evilness in his heart to begin with. And the Dragon played by Sean Connery was never evil and observed the knights old code. Dennis Quade as the knight who protected the prince then who hunted down the dragon to kill him for what he called making the King's heart evil. The end is so unusal. This is a must see. A great film for your VHS library. You will want to see this one over and over again. Yes it is that good!".

	schema:reviewBody "My Take Special effects are the driving force of this pedestrian workmanlike Medieval adventure. DRAGONHEART is a big budget special effectsladen epic with some very neat CG the likes of those in JURASSIC PARK perhaps even better. Thanks to CGI the dragon here is no longer a clumsy puppet or a stopmotion animated character. The special effects creation here shows how fast special effects can progress over years and years of development. In terms of plot and characters DRAGONHEART is only partial developed. The characters here lack more interest and the whole plot can't make it all good in the 103 min. running time.Ironically the most interesting character in the film isn't any of the human characters. It is the character of Draco the CGI dragon which also features another great leap in special effects it's voiced by Sean Connery. Given Connery's voice the character is very interesting and screenplay gives him more interest than any of his human counterparts. His sparing with the human character Bowen played by Dennis Quaid is amusing even if his counterpart isn't exactly as interesting as he is.Other than Draco the humans aren't very fancy. The hero Bowen the dragon hunter although played finely by Quaid planting his tongue firmly in cheek the script has not much to offer to him. The villain played with a sly tongue by Brit David Thewlis is practically an interesting character but the script gives him less to do later. The great cast also includes Julie Christie Jason Isaacs Dina Meyer from STARSHIP TROOPERS and Pete Postlethwaite all pretty good. The story didn't hold my attention for the entire running time. Perhaps its my lack of interest in the story that prevents it from getting into me.DRAGONHEART isn't unwatchable not to the very least but I must say I didn't actually enjoy most of it. It has a number of fun scenes with Connery's voicing of Draco as well as some pretty neat action scenes but it ain't perfection.Rating 12 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date  powerful moving and involving. Johar seemed to have learnt a lot from the previous feedbacks he must have got for his films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija who finally proves her talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly realistic and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places but it never goes overthetop and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt kindness and inhumanity truth and untruth justice and injustice love and hate. All these antonyms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 911 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This was really tough viewing.That's where our hero Rizwan Khan is thrown. He suffers from Asperger's Syndrome he's different he's naive he takes every word literally but he is intelligent and talented and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him the world includes only two groups of people  good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always and it's easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is amazing. His relationship with the love of his life Mandira a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour romance and some wonderful songs. ShankarEhsaanLoy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as Sajda NoorEKhuda and Tera Naina Re. The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lipsync in a true Hindi film style is appreciable but I for one at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from Johar's previous films the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much more simple light and enjoyable. The later half introduces the post911 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination mindless attacks and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is brilliantly done. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself.Khan's journey in the US is extraordinary. It unfolds in several episodes each one presenting the different people he meets on his way a motel owner named Jitesh a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode however is that of Mama Jenny and her son 'Funny Hair' Joel from the rural Wilhemina Georgia which is incredibly entertaining and hearttouching. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing We Shall Overcome is one of my favourite scenes in the film. That was unforgettable.Well there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of many discussions and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his finest performances. He is phenomenal. It's amazing to see him transforming from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and playing it with such conviction. His mannerisms body language tone dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing.As expected he is totally matched by Kajol whose charismatic nature easy charm evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity maturity and strength. As Mandira she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural intense and compelling as ever playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No I'm not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes which are great but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It's one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor no matter how lengthy his character is performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan's caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan's brother Zakeer who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother's mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer's wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira's friend Sarah. Tanay Chheda is firstrate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up My Name is Khan is a fantastic film and an altogether worthy effort. It is fascinating entertaining and it may definitely make you look at certain things differently. It is well written directed and performed and is beautifully shot. Deepa Bhatia's editing and Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography are also noteworthy. Kudos to all involved. Mr and Mrs Khan rock I highly recommend you to see their story.".

A Gr8 movie.Must watch. 1010.";

	schema:headline " Rizwan Khan the world's worst salesman";
	schema:reviewBody "Mandira tells Rizwan she'll buy 6 hair products from him but he tells her he'll only sell her four because the remaining two will go to waste. He may be the world's worst salesman but he's the best human being. This is Rizwan an innocent clean hearted simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn't stupid in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won't bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan Shahrukh Khan and Mandira Kajol. However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you'll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the RizwanMandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous young love stories but he is even better in this mature realistic portrayal of love at first sight. He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit the second half begins to become more farfetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography you've got to give it to Ravi K Chandran the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye were not overpowering and used simply as a backdrop. Coming onto the extras I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless they are relatively unknown actors apart from Jimmy Shergill and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heartfelt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He's done it all and yet he can still leave us gobsmacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard ship he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan's loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy you feel happy when he is sad you feel sad when he is hurt you feel hurt and when he is confused and lost you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I'm so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had periodGo watch this film now and I promise you you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that. I myself am going to go watch it a few more times and I can't wait!".

It has India's most famous onscreen couple SRKKajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybodymostly were British fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 911 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad filmsas people sayNo movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completelyand don't forget to thank me later! ! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!This movie deserves a full 10!!Thanks and Regards!".

Hats off to Karan Johar for his marvelous direction and special accolades must be given to Shibani Bhatija for superb dialogues! But the man who deserves special kudos and a standing ovation is the king khan himself!! Forget Chak de! Forget Swades or forget anything you remember about him!! The moment you are out of the hall you wont be able to think SRK as a normal person... Funny but yeah he has acted so beautifully that you will only remember Shah Rukh as Rizwan! Yes Rizwan is his new name now!! Kajol was also good in her role even though she doesn't have a big role in the movie! Her sizzling chemistry with SRK is visible whenever the duo are together on screen.. specially in the song Tere Naina!He doesn't care what problem is he in or how famous he has become by doing those deeds which every human being should do! He only cares about a promise that he has to carry out in order to rebuild his shattered dreams of a successful life.. He loves MandiraKajol and her son very much and he is ready to do anything for them!! He never forgets anyone who helped him! All he wants is peace in the world and for every human being!!SRK is back with a bang!! My Name Is Khan will make you laugh it will make you cry and it will make you fall in love with Khan!!

	schema:reviewBody "As a middle school teacher I think there aren't many better movies for showing how 911 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad and it is definitely not flag waving but it tackles real issues and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very very popular in South Asia Africa and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama this is not it. If you want a window in to how the rest of the world lives views America and how they sometimes feel left out this is it. I have yet to have a parent a student or a fellow teacher watch it and say blah.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just back from the Mumbai Fox office after watching portions of the final edit of My Name is Khan. Fox guys were really keen whether the 16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America and as I already mentioned if marketed properly this one has potential to gross 2030 million in North America alone. Having said that being primarily a love story it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years the hype in India is inexplicable. Overall I would give it a 8.510 rating and advise everyone to celebrate Valentine's with KHAN.".

Do I need to add anything more?A number of sequences are endearing. For instance the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst  first when her son meets with a catastrophe and second when she confronts SRK  are truly shattering.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heardreadwatched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also the movie states  and states very strongly without mincing words  Not all Muslims are terrorists.There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction  exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind. With MY NAME IS KHAN Karan takes rapid strides as a storyteller.On the whole MY NAME IS KHAN is a fascinating love story has an angle of religion and a worldshaking incident as a backdrop. It not only entertains but also mesmerises enthrals and captivates the viewer in those 2.40 hours. At the same time a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a farreaching influence due to its noble theme...MUST WATCH!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched they only find the things he needs for his journey identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his although limited in some sense understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of HinduMuslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister inlaw who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad no Hindu and Muslim no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center the wife of his brother who teaches at a college the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources. I gained a better understanding of why in fact the Muslim faith tradition is one of love from Khan quoting directly from the two religious books the Hadith and the Qur'an in order to reinforce the love he showed to everyone. As a further demonstration there is the scene where he travels to Wilhelmina Georgia in order to be with and help save Mama Jenny and Funny Haired Joel.".

	schema:headline " Appreciable effort to bring a change in the society but would find it hard to convince the people who are well familiar with the works of Dustin Hoffman Sean Penn  Tom Hanks";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching this prestigious project of King Khan the most interesting revelation to make is that in MNIK the two close friends of Khan Kajol  Karan have scored well ahead of Shahrukh in all respects. In other words the movie and its emotional experience entirely belongs to Kajol for her outstanding performance and Karan for his unexpectedly hard hitting  thoughtful direction.It right away starts off with the already famous scene of Shahrukh's interrogation at the airport and then keeps on moving into a series of flashbacks. The first half has a slow pace and is more or less predictable. Still the subtle scenes between Shahrukh  Kajol are nicely written and finely executed. However the scene where Shahrukh shows Kajol the city from a hill top is quite similar to the one in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Besides this the childhood sequences of Khan's life lack the required depth and could have been much better.The real action starts post intermission which also leads to major glitches in the screenplay. The sequences where Shahrukh is travelling through various places meeting variety of people is a bit lengthy also highly inspired from Tom Hank's Forrest Gump. Actually as the main emphasis shifts onto the theme of meeting the President the film takes an unexpected turn and goes over the top to some extent. The unnecessary focus on media coverage and political references takes away the emotional essence of the story making the viewer a little uninterested.To be precise there are three strong merits in MNIK.1. One is the amazingly natural and highly expressive performance by Kajol. In fact I would like to rate Kajol's emotional scene with her son as one of best ever tragedy scenes in Hindi Films till date. The sequence reminded me of an equally great hospital scene of Sharaabi.2. Second is the director Karan Johar who surprisingly returns with a more realistic dark and controversial subject completely in contrast with all of his previous projects.3. Third and the most important merit of the movie is its solid and hardhitting message to the world that Everyone in a particular religion or community cannot and should not be punished for the inhuman crimes committed by a few people of the same origin. Coming back to Shahrukh Khan the hard work is clearly visible and the effort is quite admirable. Shahrukh no doubt comes up with a noticeable performance as The Khan. But truly speaking there are undeniable glimpses of Dustin Hoffman  Sean Penn clearly visible in his autistic act. Khan's performance will surely impress millions of his Bollywood fans who love watching only Hindi Films. But for the movie buffs who are well familiar with Dustin Hoffman in Rainman Sean Penn in I am Sam and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Shahrukh has simply done a good job. He visibly tries hard to move away from all the above references and does come up with a fine performance. But the impact of all the above three names in their respective roles is so huge that it unintentionally leads you to a comparison.In addition to this the writing also shows some major faults in the screenplay. For instance I am still not able to figure out that which HinduMuslim Riots happened in 1983 in Mumbai. Secondly in the few initial scenes it's shown that Shahrukh has a serious problem with Yellow color. Yet in the second half he is shown holding a yellow cardboard in his hand.Lastly in the final hour everything just goes on happening so easily which completely contradicts the realistic feel of the movie and lessens its final impact on the viewer. The movies also raises a question that why Karan approved of making Kurbaan on a similar subject of 911 impact on Muslims in America when he was himself making MNIK on the same subject? Apart from the impressive Kajol act Jimmy Shergil excels in his few scenes and so does Sonya Jehan who plays Jimmy's wife. Parveen Dabbas shines as a Sikh who opts for cutting his hair after 911 in order to survive the hate attacks. Both Vinay Pathak and Zareena Wahab make their presence felt in their small roles.Cinematography is great with some new unexplored locations looking fresh on screen. But I found ShankarEhsaanLoy's music lacking the melody part once again. However Karan very intelligently uses only few full length songs in the movie and rest of them are just there as a part of the background music.Summing up MNIK is surely one of those few good movies which are capable of raising a question and starting a debate. Many of the viewers might miss the regular glossy  romantic feature of a ShahrukhKaran film. But MNIK is a clear indication of changing times in Bollywood and should be taken in good spirits.It's not a perfect piece of art but a laudable effort indeed from Dharma Productions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some love stories are built on passion some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey. My Name Is Khan introduces us to the world of Rizwan Khan who mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal but his vulnerability which makes him endearable. The audience falls in love with Rizwan because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey that you no longer root for SRK and his victory but for Rizwan and his belief which makes My Name Is Khan a winner right from the opening credits.His name is Khan Rizwan Khan. Brought up in an unforgiving society Rizwan battles the alternate evils of racial profile and scornful peers with equal focus trying to make sense of the world that burns homes bullies people at school and make a false show of sympathy. He goes by the doctrine of his Ammi who teaches him that there are two classes of people in the world those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Rizwan carries forward in his love and faith painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps guides the world towards him.My Name Is Khan is appreciable because of its brilliance acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Karan Johar weaves in a tale of love faith religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 160 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system through the filtered sensibilities of a patient suffering from Asperger's Syndrome one who cannot understand the world but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Rizwan Karan succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology making his emotions pure and though provoking which touches the innermost chords of the heart moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.The story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Shibani Bathija is one of par excellence allowing the audience to blend into Rizwan through his smiles and tears  laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Bollywood.In the end My Name Is Khan becomes the experience it is because of Rizwan and Mandira essayed flawlessly by Shahrukh and Kajol. Shahrukh exudes the spirit of Rizwan in every breath and pulse of the film putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Rizwan  who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions establishing a bond that scales beyond the arclights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by Kajol whose very presence lights up the entire room with just a flashing smile. She balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Shahrukh and Kajol form the highlights of the film filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jimmy Shergil as Shahrukh's brother delivers a matured and restrained performance while Zarina Waheb as Rizwan's mother blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Tanay Chheda is exceptional as the young Rizwan in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Vinay Pathak in a dazzling cameo.There will always be movies that enchant us with their magic but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. My Name Is Khan is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes but there will never be one Rizwan Khan who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events. After 12th February 2010 the scales of humanity would mark the world before and after the release of My Name Is Khan.My Rating 55 Exceptional!!".

	schema:reviewBody "My Name Is Khan is yet another film that will put the Indian film industry on the map. And this is a new phenomenon that America will have to get used to foreign film countries shooting in the USA and examining our society. For better or worse this is how we seem to many foreigners.Shakrukh Khan creates a character in Rizwan Khan that many Americans will recognize if they've seen Being There Rainman and Forrest Gump. Bits from all those films will be found in My Name Is Khan. Khan is a Moslem citizen of India who emigrates to the USA and finds love and happiness when he weds a mother with a son from a previous marriage the wife played by Kajol and the stepson by Yurgon Makaar. She's Hindu but the different faiths don't seem to matter. Khan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and its challenge enough for him to make his way in the world without picking up on the subtle nuances of the differences of religions and why one group has to hate all the others.All this changes on September 11 2001 when some fanatical Moslems hijack some airlines and change the course of history forever crashing them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and killing a lot of innocent people including a few hundred Moslems by all counts of the victims. As in the past here and other places bad behavior by some inflicted a stigma on the group.Young Mr. Makaar is killed in a hate crime incident which changes Khan's relationship with his mother and Khan himself through a combination of circumstances gets on a terrorist watch list. Khan conceives a mission to tell the President of the United States be it George W. Bush or Barack Obama that he is not a terrorist. Both in my professional and family heritage I've got some history with these kind of events. In my former job with Crime Victims Board I had a claim involving a bias attack against a young Arab American boy the same age as Mr. Makaar. It was only when I questioned the young man and his parents I learned of the bias nature of the events. Together with the GLBT liaison with the Kings County District Attorney we went to the Bias Unit of the NYPD and got the case reclassified as a bias attack. Sad though that no one was ever arrested for the crime but it wasn't for lack of trying here. This was during the years immediately following the first Iraqi War and there was an upswing of attacks on Moslem Americans then as well.After World War I we had the Palmer Raids in which the Bill of Rights was torn up and under the Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer many suspected radicals of Jewish or Slavic origins were deported in wholesale lots. I had a grand uncle on my mother's side who had such radical politics and he missed being deported by a hair. This was after the Russian Revolution and a number of anarchist bombings including the Morgan Bank on Wall Street and a mail bomb sent to the Attorney General himself. Duly elected Socialist members of the New York State Legislature were expelled at this time. It was not a good era.In the tradition of Peter Sellers Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks Shahrukh Khan might have an Oscar or nomination at least in his future. Two Magic Kingdom regulars from their teen shows have parts in this Shane Harper of Good Luck Charlie plays one of the bashers and and Kenton Duty of Shake It Up playing the best friend who turns on Yurgon Makaar show far more acting chops in this than on the Disney Channel.There is no excuse or reason no justification at all to make war on children. If you want to fight terrorists there's a war now in Afghanistan and probably future wars for the USA unless both we get it right and certain Moslems realize they are not taking the world over for Allah. Ditto the Christians who want to win the world for Jesus. We all have to live together and secular humanism may yet save us all.And this review is dedicated to the late Liz Garro of the Kings County District Attorney's office the late John Lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived in the USA until his 90s and to Ziad AbdelDayem of Brooklyn who last I heard is a married man. All three of you made the world a better place.".

And who was the funeral for which the two boys Samier and white boy. Did something happen to the other boys Father which triggered the conversation and unease between the two Mothers? Mystified why Shahrukh Khan who was the main character of the movie is not shown in the film credits by IMDb? others have made comment about this.A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film this is much better than Slumdog and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.More films like this please! Less political overtone perhaps but never mind the melodrama have the tissues at the ready!".

	schema:headline " Overdone? Sure. But watch it for Khan!";
	schema:reviewBody "My Name is Khan has a mind blowing first half. The introduction of the protagonist and his subsequent life until the turning point of the movie will keep you glued to the seats. Character development is done while keeping amazing restraint. Everything is spelt out for the audience but it isn't exactly spoonfeeding. You instantly connect with the characters and feel set for a strong emotional journey with the KHAN which the second half promises to bring. And thats when the movie falters. The by now world famous journey itself isn't the problem it is the attempt to coat every incident within and along the way with the line of the year My Name is Khan and I am not a terrorist. And it does get so repetitive that u feel that the scriptwriter believed the audience have short term memory loss just the way another Khan had 15 months back. And whats more while many a sequences in the first half have genius written on them eg SRK's reaction to the proposal god! the movie post intermission suffers from irritating clichs suddenly we are on stereotype planet. If proper care was taken the movie could have had audience leaving the theater with tears in their eyes and a smile on their faces but alas it's an opportunity missed.Performances wise the movie is brilliant. Everyone from the extras including a presidential lookalike and a heart of gold American mom to the supporting cast Zarina Wahab is great as the smart ammi are excellent. It feels nice to see Kajol back with a strong performance. The sparkle in her eyes are so captivating and her chemistry with SRK so explosive that the good old romance of bollywood feels as if it was never lost. Yes there are certain places where her performance feels stretched but it is mostly the director's fault. As for the man himself one cannot help but admit that this is KHAN at his very best yes i have seen darr swades baazigar and chak de. He plays Rizwan Khan earnestly and with such conviction that he manages to tug at your heart strings. Even SRK haters can rejoicebecause you just cannot find Shah Rukh Khan in Rizwan Khan. It is a stunning portrayal and a glorious display of the actor's range. No RahulRaj stuff this is. U wish you can give him a hug although Rizwan hates it. What a performance! Technically the film maintains high standards the songs are good the cinematography brilliant. A mature film from KJo? yes indeed. A welcome change from the director. Watch it because whether your name is Khan or not u really don't want to miss this Khan playing the role of a lifetime.".

The overall message the film is trying to deliver is admirable but it could have been much more effectively delivered were it not packaged as a typical KJO love story. And therin lies the film's biggest flaw. A film on a subject like the one tackled in My Name is Khan should NEVER have been attempted by Karan Johar who is Bollywood's equivalent of Richard Curtis. Could you imagine Curtis directing The Lives of Others or The Counterfeiters? Of course not.A 10 out of 10 rating should only be reserved for cinematic masterpieces which MNIK certainly is NOT. This is exactly why IMDb ratings for Bollywood movies can never be taken seriously. In my opinion MNIK is a 6 out of 10 film at best. Possibly 7 for SRK  Kajol acting.".

Noble idea but then this message could have been delivered with much more impact and background research. I felt a strong sense of boredom after watching the following scenes. 1. The TV depiction of World Trade Center towers crashing not once again please yawn 2. Airport frisking scenes followed by security officials taking the unfortunate subject away for secondary questioning in a private booth. May I remind you random search happens to anyone who especially may be acting a bit strange and not all is due to colour of skin race religion or your last name. 3. The passing of the Presidential motorcade and buffoonlike security personnel. 4. The ordinary people association of all things Muslims with terrorism looks unreal. Sure there are a bunch of nutcases but not many people will bat an eyelid on seeing a hijabwoman. People tend to be more tolerant and accepting than they're given credit for. 5. Was SRK's portrayal of someone with Asperger's Syndrome authentic? He acted well but I'm not sure if that's how all autistic people behave. They do have good humour and over a period of time learn not to take words and sentences literally. I think this part was a bit overdone. The themes above had already been covered in great depth and detail by films in past few years such as the Pakistani Khuda Kay Liye New York Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay. Since these scenes are integral to the plot one could feel such a hackneyed sense of dejavu.Had this film not been made into something so easily predictable scene by scene I would have certainly rated it much higher. I really like an element of surprise to hold my attention. Maybe there's a vast audience out there that loves to watch predictable feelgood outcomes but count me out of it please. All being said the film did have several redeeming features too. The depiction of SRK's character putting his life in jeopardy to rescue a Hurricane Katrinalike hit village in the American South was a real feelgood. Kajol's boy's's desire to win back his alienated White American best friend was touching as he paid for it with his life in a ground of football bullies. On the other hand of the racial spectrum it felt good to watch SRK's scenes with impoverished AfricanAmerican characters  Mama Jay character resembled the Mammy of Gone with the Wind though. Also the resonance between the Hum Honge Kaamyab tune with its English rendition We will overcome no idea which one's the original was done nicely.".

And I do think Victor Mature is marvelous in it too with a touching wistfulness underneath all the vain posturing. Ditto the chief of police. The sets are fabulous too and so is the Bacharach music much of it deliciously cheerfully Italianate but also the wonderfully catchy main title sung by Sellers himself with the Hollies that would be Graham Nash later of Crosby Stills and Nash.There are certain things about the film that remind me of The Producers though the comedy style is not quite the same.

Just those two names prompted me to take it home.I was quite happy with what this film is.The story is solid and is what keeps this film running.  Sellers does a good job but I still enjoy his Pink Panther role as well as his roles in Dr. Sstrangelove.  Nevertheless he does well as an Italian crook and flamboyant film director.The comedy isn't too slapstick it is smart.  There are sight gags there are setups and punchlines there are oneliners not to mention spoofedthemes and pokes at other Italian film directorsproducers.I didn't exactly know what I would get with a De Sica comedy.  He did a fine job though. Federico Fabrizi sometimes looks and seems to be just like Federico Fellini.  There are some moments where Fellini's 8 12 comes to mind.A critic said that he didn't understand the ending.  At first I didn't. Think though!  Think!  This is De Sica!Take a look at this film it's a good one.".

	schema:headline " A bit uneven but it's still unique and a lot of fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Sellers is a real enigma. During his career he made many brilliant films with amazing characterizations such as DR. STRANGELOVE BEING THERE THE MOUSE THAT ROARED and many others but he also did a lot of amazingly limp films that he practically slept through THE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU and THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. AFTER THE FOX is unusual in that it isn't exactly brilliant but still is very good. As far as Sellers' performance goes he did a lovely Italian accent and his character was pretty credible though despite being the star of the film he wasn't the standout performer I think this was actually Victor Maturedoing a wonderful selfparody.The Fox is a master criminal who escapes from prison rather easily in order to keep his sister out of trouble. At first he thinks she's become a prostitute but later he finds she's become horrors and actress!! Interestingly enough his sister is played by Sellers' reallife wife Britt Ekland and his love interest in the film was played by an unknown but beautiful Italian. Once out of prison he learns about a big caper from Akim Tamiroffsmuggling in millions of dollars worth of gold into Italy. So inspired by his sister's desire to be a movie star he decides to make a fake film and use this as the cover to smuggle in the goldand this is how Victor Mature comes into the film. He plays a parody of himself but is very vain and over the hilltelling everyone he's in his thirties even though he's pushing 60! I loved how he insisted he was so young when it was so obvious he wasn'tespecially in the scene where Britt throws herself at him and runs her fingers through his haironly to have them stained black by hair dye. Plus he was so full of himself that he was gullible enough to believe he was making an art film when in fact Sellers and his gang obviously had no idea what they were doing.By the way how Sellers got all the film equipment was pretty interesting. As the film was directed by Vittorio DeSica he himself appeared in a small scene. He and his crew were filming some Egyptian epic when suddenly the wind machines turned on at full blast. When they were finally turned off all the equipmenteven DeSica's platform and cameraswere missingstolen by Sellers' gang.Throughout the film there were many cute moments but also towards the end the film did lag a bit and the ending seemed to be a bit of a letdown. I especially became bored with the chase scene and the ensuing courtroom scene. Still it was original and moderately funny with some excellent performances.By the way the film clip we see of a younger Victor Mature in an older black and white film was from EASY LIVINGone of Mature's better films. I suggest you try to find it.".

It was that long long too long series of third rate films that Sellers got involved in after his peak in the middle 1960s when only an occasional film The Wrong Box There's A Girl In My Soup reminded people of the comic and acting genius he was. In my memory the only good performance was that of Victor Mature as the aging actor who is best recalled by the public in that he is always in a role wearing a trench coat. The highpoint of Mature's performance is when he Balsam and several others are stuck in a car that is stalled on a railway track with a train bearing down on it  and Mature is screaming the most. Finally the train passes them and they are safe. Everyone is just silent and sweaty from their nearthing ordeal and Mature suddenly smiles and acts as though he could have told them not to worry.But the best line I remember deals with Sellers and fellow conman Akim Tamiroff. Sellers has to introduce Tamiroff named Mr. Okra to Mature Balsam Britt Eckland and the others on the film set. He says with great formality This is Mr. Okra...inventor of Okrascope. I am still waiting to see what Okrascope was.".

There's very little of consequence in the film and it's all very predictable plotwise but Sellers manages to salvage more than one scene with his zany improvisations on Neil Simon's funny story.Sellers plays an Italian criminal mastermind who frees himself from prison and sets about importing stolen Egyptian gold by impersonating a newwave movie director. If only I could steal enough money to become an honest man he laments as he frets about his movieobsessed sister played by Ekland.There are just a handful of really memorable scenes here that basically make the movie and all but one with Ekland unknowingly smearing Mature's hair dye all over her face primarily involve Sellers. First Sellers bursts into Mature's hotel suite in the gregarious manner of an Italian film magnate kissing Mature on both cheeks like old friends and thoroughly annoying the agent played by Martin Balsam. In another Sellers convinces the local constable Lando Buzzanca to let them operate without a permit and ends up with the guy eating out of his hand good morning! while he tears his office apart.At times when Sellers is playing the director you get a strong feeling that he's off the script and he's purposely skewering particular directors. It's all a bit weird because the contrived film Sellers is making inside the film doesn't feel all that much more arbitrary or manufactured than the one we're actually watching.".

Britt Eklund is Seller's girl friend and Akim Tamiroff is the guy who pulled off the gold heist. Maria Gracia Buccella has an unforgettable part as Tamiroff's sister and 'the bikini trap'. This woman in a bikini makes Sophia Loren look flatchested. Martin Balsam also has a good role as Mature's exasperated agent.To see what happens if the budding film director can really smuggle some gold into Italy you have to see After The Fox.

	schema:headline " I laughed! I cried!";
	schema:reviewBody "I agree with the other reviewers that this is a forgotten gem. Sellers' portrayal of Italian thief Vanucci is as funny as his Clousseau! It satirizes peoples' obsession with film beautifully from wannabe actors to starstruck townspeople to film critics. IMDbers take note! Mike Myers gave this film a nod when he used one of its bits in an Austin Powers movie instead of the contact speaking while Sellers kisses his beautiful sister Austin is preoccupied with Nathan Lane!

It satirizes peoples' obsession with film beautifully from wannabe actors to starstruck townspeople to film critics. IMDbers take note! Mike Myers gave this film a nod when he used one of its bits in an Austin Powers movie instead of the contact speaking while Sellers kisses his beautiful sister Austin is preoccupied with Nathan Lane!

But what really surprised me is Victor Mature's convincing and funny performance as an aging star who refuses to accept the pass of time and his inevitable entering into more adult roles. I always had Mature has a just standard performer who couldn't help overacting and just helped in his career by his somehow interesting screen presence. In a likable character he does very good in this picture and is one of the highlights of the film.Good for Victor in one of his last roles!".

Peter Sellers plays 'Aldo Vanucci' Italy's top criminal mastermind  known as 'The Fox'  and also a master of disguise. When his cronies visit him in jail he gives them food and magazines. Hearing that his sister Gina  Britt Ekland Sellers' wife at the time  is walking the streets of Rome he is furious and escapes by switching places with a psychiatrist. It turns out Gina is only making a movie. He wants her to go back to school but she is determined to become a movie star. She has changed her surname to the more exotic sounding 'Romantica'. A daring bullion robbery has been pulled off in Cairo and Aldo must help the thieves get the gold into Italy. He decides to trick the townspeople of Sevalio into thinking they are taking part in a movie and to this end manages to secure the services of fading Hollywood matine idol 'Tony Powell'  Victor Mature ...At times 'Fox' feels like an Italian version of one of Sellers' earlier British comedies such as 'Two Way Stretch' and 'The Wrong Arm Of The Law'. Aldo shares many similarities to 'Dodger Lane' and 'Pearly Gates'. Neil Simon's script is not bad  though not among his better efforts  but it needed a director of the calibre of Blake Edwards to make it work. Instead we have Vittorio De Sica and his heart is just not in it. As 'Vanucci' Sellers is okay but its when he gets to impersonate eccentric director 'Frederico Fabrizi'  pointing to his head he says to Tony In here is my script!  that the film really starts to becomes funny with some amusing jibes at the expense of the neorealism school of cinema  of which De Sica was a leading exponent . Giving Sellers competition in the comedy department is Mature with a highly amusing self parody as a film star who refuses to admit he is over the hill. When he brags to his agent 'Harry' that he is a youthful forty the man replies But your son is thirtyfive!. Another asset is the bouncy Burt Bacharach soundtrack. The catchy theme song was performed by Sellers  as 'Vanucci'  and 'The Hollies'. 'Fox' was not a big commercial success but now seems a decent way to kill 90 minutes even if it does end with a somewhat uninspired car chase.The best moment comes in the final scene. Vanucci is on trial  along with the townspeople of Sevalio . The film is screened to the jury. It is disjointed jumpy with jerky camera work  just like every major film on release these days . When it is over everyone who took part looks embarrassed. A wildeyed critic however proclaims it a masterpiece!".

The entire movie is one hilarious romp to the seaside and played to the max with the locals who just want to be in a movie. Of all the films Sellers has ever done this is my favorite and is a tribute to the late great Victor Mature.

	schema:headline " Fulci's Masterpiece of Pure Imagery";
	schema:reviewBody "L'AldilaThe Beyond1981 is the film that brought interest in the cinema of Lucio Fulci.  I became a big fan of his work after watching this movie. Have seen a good portion of his films since.  The opening prologue is shot in a gorgeous sepia color.  The murdertorture of Schweick represents the censorship and repression of the artist.  Anchor Bay did a excellent job in the restoration of the film for DVD.The chain whipping scene in it is a repeat of the one in Don't Torture a Duckling1972.  The chain whipping in The Beyond is much more gory. There are a couple of reasons why the chain whipping scene in Don't Torture a Duckling is more powerful and potent then in The Beyond.  The scenes take place in natural settings.  Goes for violent realism.  The death of Maciara is depressing to watch.L'Aldila1981 was part of a trilogy called the 7 gates trilogy.  This started with The Gates of Hell1980 continued with this film and was to end with The Beyond 2.  Unfortunately this trilogy would never be completed.  This is a shame because I would have loved to see that film to know if it was good as the first two movies of the trilogy.  The original intentions of The Beyond are different from the final results. This was because of budget and time restrictions.  I wonder how much better the pic might have been with a modest budget and a little more time.The make up effects is one of the film's best features.  Despite the low budget Giannetto De Rossi's effects are spectacular.  The effects are done with flair and pizazz.  Giannetto De Rossi did his best when working with Fulci.  The effects for the death of Joe the Plumber are very good.  The best effects in the film is the scene involving the young girl near the end.The cinematography is spliced with atmosphere and style.  Sergio Salvalti contributes to the film's gothic flavour.  The cinematography contains a dreamish flow that makes the film beautiful.  The score is one of my favourites for a horror film.  The score fits perfectly with the scenes in the film.  As good as anything done for Argento by Goblin.The Beyond1981 is an 'Absolute Film' where image and sound are the most important part of a film.  On the making of this Fulci once said My idea was to make an absolute film with all the horrors of the world.  Its a plotless film there's no logic to it just a succession of images. This is something that people who hate the film don't and will never understand. Many people do not like this because of its nonlinear structure.  He also said In Italy we make films based on pure themes without a plot and The Beyond like Inferno refuses conventions...people who blame the The Beyond for its lack of story don't understand that it's a film of images which must be received without any reflection.  Receiving a movie like this without any reflection is a hard thing for many film goers to do.The works of Antonin Artoud and H.P Lovecraft play a major influence on The Beyond1981.  Fulci was inspired by this controversial French artist. The ideas of Artoud are present in most of Fulci's work.  Schweick the painter bears a little resemblence to Antonin Artoud.  Artoud was the founder of The Theater of Cruelty which talked to Restore to the theater a passionate and convulsive conception of life and it is in this sense of violent rigor and extreme condensation of scenic elements that the cruelty on which it is based on must be understood.  This idea can be applied to The Cinema and this film.The comment Violence is Italian Art by Fulci is relative to the movie and the history of Italian art.  Its one of the few films where atmosphere and gore mix well together.  Has good moments of spirital horror.  The atmosphere is eerie and terrifying.  The gory set pieces are satisfying. The surreal atmosphere and bloody imagery is what makes the film a classic.The Beyond would influence many later American and Italian horror flicks. One The Evil Dead1983.  Two Hellraiser1987.  Three HellboundHellraiser 21988.  Four The Church1990. Finally Dellamorte Dellamore1996.The Beyond1981 will never be a mainstream favourite because its not for everyone.  The themes are well written by Dardano Sacchetti.  Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck are very good in the roles of the heroine and hero.  Veronica Lazar from Inferno1980 is sinister as Martha.  The director did a great job with the little resources that he had to work with. The ending will haunt your dreams for days to come.".

It even had previous of movies like 2000 Maniacs The Evil Dead and Zombie aka Zombie 2 before the movie started. To truly appreciate this movie one has to remember the era it came from. The post Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead period saw many imitations especially from Italy. However there were a handful of filmmakers that had actual imagination skills and creativity to set their pictures apart from the rest. Of the bunch Argento Bava father and son and Fulci stood quite apart from the rest each with their own talents.Fulci was perhaps the most prolific of them adding a flare of his own Art to his works. His movies each played like paint on canvas from beginning to end. The Beyond was his greatest Masterpiece combining a better plot than most of his works with the high quality level of gore Fulci was and always will be well known for.The Beyond starts with a Warlock being executed in the 1930's by a lynch mob. Little do they know that the hotel where the act takes place happens to be one of the seven doorways to hell. Flashing forward about 50 years later Liza inherets the hotel and decides to restore it. From there all hell breaks loose. The ending is as disturbing as it gets and the deaths are both unique and horrifying vintage Fulci.I remember walking to the subway station that night still thinking about what my eyes had just seen occasionally looking over my shoulder  realizing I had been genuinely scared and disturbed by a movie that at the time was about 17 years old. Man I miss the HeyDay of horror and the true masters of it!".

A New Yorker heir  Katriona MacColl Fulci's ordinary  moves an old mansionhotel in Louisiana and she wishes restore it . She investigates the weird deeds happened in a room and by basement of the old motel that is built on top of the door to the beyond. Bloody and purulent specters roam there. She is confronted with rare happenings as a worker has a lethal fall the plumber is cruelly murdered and her blind friend is bitten by a dog that breaks his neck. When she escapes to the hospital along with friendly doctor McCabe  David Wabeck  she doesn't know what a new horror is waiting there . Early rare deeds begin to happen to them as they start hearing noises rare characters and tragic killings. Quote from the book of Eibon And you will face the sea of darkness and all therein may be explored. Chilling Italian terror flick full of screams chills thrills and lots of blood and guts. Gory gruesome  pretty repellent  and ghastly gore feast in which the stumbling stiff dead are reanimated and committing astonishing murders . This is a classic excruciatingly splatter film in which the intriguetension suspense appears threatening and lurking in every room corridors  cellar  hospital  morgue and many other places . This unrelenting shockfeast packs good makeup and special effects makeup by the maestro Gianetto De Rossi. Produced on a tight budget by Fabrizio De Angelis  Fulci's usual producer and occasionally director. Eerie musical score composed and conducted by Fabio Frizzi . Usual secondary actors as Veronica Lazar  Al Cliver and of course special appearance of Lucio Fulci as librarian clerk . This genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of imagesshock is well photographed by Sergio Salvati on location in Louisiana and Italy . The motion picture is realized by one of the most controversial filmmakers of terror movies Lucio Fulci in his usual style with flaws and gaps but is professionally made because he is a skilled craftsman . He creates a strange horror thriller that manages to be both scary and skilfully made deserving its cult status . Reviewers are divided over booth the morals and talents of Fulci 19271996 who sometimes directed under the alias Louis Fuller. For some critics many of his movies are cruel and shockingly violent yet their gory surface often conceals religious social commentaries or intelligent issues. Whether he should be viewed as a cheap sensationalist or just a genius Fulci has a loyal fan base and undeniably has an important and unique influence on the terror genre  creating great works on a low budget such as proved in  The black cat  Manhattan baby Gates of Hell Island of the living dead New York ripper  among them. this is one more imaginative horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . It's just one long unrelenting gutsfeast and passable budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits . This gorefeast that tried to disguised itself under many other titles will appeal to Lucio Fulci aficionados.".

Whether he should be viewed as a cheap sensationalist or just a genius Fulci has a loyal fan base and undeniably has an important and unique influence on the terror genre  creating great works on a low budget such as proved in  The black cat  Manhattan baby Gates of Hell Island of the living dead New York ripper  among them. this is one more imaginative horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . It's just one long unrelenting gutsfeast and passable budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits . This gorefeast that tried to disguised itself under many other titles will appeal to Lucio Fulci aficionados.";

Strange and gory things start to happen and poof the hotel just happens to be over one of the 7 doors to hell. Very bloody with a slightly incoherent plot the film is a lot of fun and I suspect that no Fulci fan should be without their copy. Visually I think this is Fulci's best film that I've seen and the acting is what you'd expect. 7  10 FULCI LIVES".

If someone ranks this movie with a 1 on the other side there will be a 10 to compensate. We are speaking about a true cult movie. Acclaimed by a small number of fans worldwide a movie scorned by critics and the regular viewer. One strange case indeed.The story is a disturbing mix of elements. In the first minutes during the execution of Schweick  it is clear what kind of tale is L'aldil. Vengeance beyond the grave an apocalypse that is unavoidable. Common people trapped in the middle. One of the merits of Sarchetti's script is the character of Katriona Maccoll a real down to earth human being his partner is a curious but good man. Both of them tried to do things right but in the end that won't help . The brutality of violence is another great detail is unexpected extreme and very very graphic. And as the final touch the climatic ending. The assonant music has its logic this is disturbing terror it wouldn't be the same with newage reggae or a ballad.Lucio Fulci was an unique director. With L'aldil he tried to create an 'artaudian' study of horror. He achieved that. He used less than 90 minutes to mix ominous menaces that are beyond this world waiting their time for return and extremely gory horror. The unavoidable tragedy strikes in the form of hungry zombies. He was a demanding director he never let that their actors underestimate their roles. His use of zoomeffects are a trademark the zoom in used in a completely original way. Let's say the zoom is the hand of someone that keep your eyes open in an awful or transcendental sequence Fulci forces you to pay attention when he wants your attention. Delightful. Nowadays audiences are very comfortable watching horror movies. They expect to see some scares and then laugh with the jokes of some stupid teens avid of rave music and easy sex. Fulci in that aspect was an author beyond his time. He tried to shock people scare them revolve their stomachs those were his methods to gain the public but he NEVER underestimated the audiences he gave his 100 and made cult classics. Note for Fulci newcomers The more interesting works of this director are in the period of middle 70's to 1985.

There's the extremely effective opening sequence detailing the clich of the torchwielding villagers out to get their social outcast a painter who has delved a little too far into his own darkness and has opened a gate into Hell which describes a tortuous crucifixion scene. Then there's the way Fulci has in introducing the character of Emily who's also in the prologue reading a Satanic book called Ebion who's title seems to have Lovecraftian overtones later on in the film  first we see only her heavily cataracted eyes in two flash cuts through the point of view of a painter working on the hotel in which this story is based on later in a truly masterful sequence full of white dread where Liza Catriona MacCall is driving on a brightly lit road in one endless shot suddenly we see the car zoom towards a point in the distance and this is Emily Cinzia Monreale credited as Sarah Keller standing with her dog Dickie clearly otherworldly and foreboding a detail that causes Liza's steely composure to crack a little. That Liza doesn't seem to question as to why a blind woman would be in the middle of an expanse of what seems to be the Ponchatrain bridge is one of the many plot holes in THE BEYOND Emily's introduction into Liza is the best part of the movie. This aforementioned scene works so well because it's slow deliberate preceding a minor scare involving a painter seeing her through a window and foretells so much quiet horror. That the story later takes a hard left into absolute nonsense is its downfall because no one seems to be acting with attention to logic and the hackneyed use of the character who goes down into the cellar and asks 'Who's there? Is it you?' has been done to the death and beyond pun again intended so feeling any sympathy for the leads is secondary. But this quiet moment of foreboding is actually the one time the movie uses the ghost to a tremendous effect it's horror under the Sun.Fulci was with Mario Bava and Dario Argento masters of gore. Gore in Fulci's films had barely anything to do with plot as much as convey a pornographic view of a horrific event. He definitely loves his extremes in gore and uses it in varying degrees of success. One of the most disgusting involves a 5 minute sequence where the hotel's architect falls from the top of a ladder I kept thinking of DON'T LOOK NOW and gets his face eaten by tarantulas many of them clearly mechanical and while the viewer knows that the face is almost a cheap rendering of the actor it is cringeinducing while bringing nothing to plot but padding to an already overlong movie. One wonders what he was trying to tell here but Stephen King once said in an interview it all else fails I will resort to grossout to get the horror across.So with all this said is THE BEYOND a good movie or a terrible one? Well that depends. There have been noted critics who have wished this movie swam in its own quicklime and disappeared from the face of the Earth. There are others who think this is the Real Deal when it comes to gorgeous gore. I'm in the middle. Then again I'm just someone who loves movies good and bad. Stylistically it owes a lot to Dario Argento. Plotwise there is an idea but it goes completely nowhere with it. Characerization is all but nonexistent and to have several of them just appear for no other reason to have them later on be another statistic in the high body count this kind of movie has is lame. The dialog is cringeinducing for an entirely different reason it's the equivalent of listening to fingernails scraping over a blackboard or a fork's screeching over the surface of a bathtub. I'll leave it to the viewer because there were times when I was engrossed as in the LizameetsEmily sequence but there were one too many times when I was just stumped to see gratuitous gore and actors badly playing zombies for the sole factor to have this as a link to George Romero movies.And if anything if watching the movie becomes too cumbersome just switch on the Audio Commentary by Catriona MacCall and David Warbuck. Both especially Warbuck have some sidesplitting views on their experiences in this film.".

The hotel in this movie is filled with a good amount of atmosphere. There is a sense of dread hanging over the place. You can especially feel it when the characters venture into the basement. It's all but palatable.As for MacColl through her acting she's able to pull together the barest of story lines and create a character I could care about. It's difficult to enjoy a horror movie when you don't care about the characters. A little more insight into the MacColl's character would have been very welcome.As I stated previously the movie is not without problems. The biggest is the plot. It's all but nonexistent. The actual why's and how's of the doorway to hell opening are never really explored. We only see some of the aftermath. We know that the doorway to hell is in the basement of the hotel then why does half of the movie take place at a hospital? Furthermore the weak plot does not allow the characters to be fleshed out as much as I would have liked. I knew so little about most of the characters that I really didn't care what happened to them. The plot seems to matter little to Fulci as its main function is to string together a series of gristly set pieces. And that's always been my biggest complaint about Fulci  he throws tons of gore into his movies not to advance the storyline but for the sake of showing gore. Gore does not necessarily equal horror. I'll use the spider attack scene from The Beyond as an example. While I'll say that it certainly was gross and very nicely donebut it's not scary because it happens out of the blue to a character I know nothing about. Gore does not bother as long as it is presented within the context of the story.Overall my experience with The Beyond has made me rethink some of my thoughts of Fulci. I may need to see some of his other films that I've been putting off.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tried to enjoy this one for what it was supposed to be. Really I did. A madetobebad gorefest light on plot and lighter on characterization. A true Bmovie even if it didn't turn out to be the masterwork of the genre some people claim. I'd seen a Fulci film before'The House by the Cemetery'and been singularly unimpressed but even Fulci fans have panned that one and 'The Beyond' is widely regarded as his best work. So if nothing else I was expecting at least a step up from 'House.' No such luck.Lots of blood lots of guts and fancy for the time period special effects but not a lot of substance to either. And that's what's really wrong with this movie. When the plot and characters are already throwaways what's left when the gore fails? You see I have a hard time considering what Fulci does to be gore. For me that implies at least some level of realism and Fulci offers anything but that. I'm not even a gore hound and I find his efforts in that area to be pathetic. The warlock's wounds don't correspond to the weapons used to inflict them the splatter in other scenes is entirely inconsistent with the actual flow of blood trickling spurting trickling then suddenly OMG SPRAYING IN GUSHES... all from the same wound. Somehow a three inch nail manages to pass all the way through a woman's skull and poke out her eyeball from behind spearing it three inches out from the socket. Somehow. Fulci seems to have some kind of fixation with the stabbing of eyeballswhich would be fine if he could ever get it right. Which of course he can't. Any time Fulci gets going with one of his gory scenes I just end up laughing. I can't bring myself to take it seriously at all.In addition Fulci has NO idea how to build tension or suspense.

In reality all he manages to do is leave you so bored with the buildup that you don't care about the kill by the time he gets around to it and so bored with the kill itself by the time the character finally dies that you're long past caring about the kill's function in the story. You just wish he'd get on with it already.When you add to that the fact that Fulci can't seem to do ANYTHING original just copy scenes from other more talented directors' films 'The Beyond' features yet another 'Suspiria' rip the seeingeye dog attack and redo them poorly with his ridiculous brand of gore there's just no redeeming value to this film or any film of his that I've seen so far.One star only because 0 wasn't an option.".

	onyx:emotionText "I tried to enjoy this one for what it was supposed to be. Really I did. A madetobebad gorefest light on plot and lighter on characterization. A true Bmovie even if it didn't turn out to be the masterwork of the genre some people claim. I'd seen a Fulci film before'The House by the Cemetery'and been singularly unimpressed but even Fulci fans have panned that one and 'The Beyond' is widely regarded as his best work. So if nothing else I was expecting at least a step up from 'House.' No such luck.Lots of blood lots of guts and fancy for the time period special effects but not a lot of substance to either. And that's what's really wrong with this movie. When the plot and characters are already throwaways what's left when the gore fails? You see I have a hard time considering what Fulci does to be gore. For me that implies at least some level of realism and Fulci offers anything but that. I'm not even a gore hound and I find his efforts in that area to be pathetic. The warlock's wounds don't correspond to the weapons used to inflict them the splatter in other scenes is entirely inconsistent with the actual flow of blood trickling spurting trickling then suddenly OMG SPRAYING IN GUSHES... all from the same wound. Somehow a three inch nail manages to pass all the way through a woman's skull and poke out her eyeball from behind spearing it three inches out from the socket. Somehow. Fulci seems to have some kind of fixation with the stabbing of eyeballswhich would be fine if he could ever get it right. Which of course he can't. Any time Fulci gets going with one of his gory scenes I just end up laughing. I can't bring myself to take it seriously at all.In addition Fulci has NO idea how to build tension or suspense. He seems to think that the longer he draws out the buildup to a kill the more suspenseful it is and the longer he draws out a kill the scarier it is. In reality all he manages to do is leave you so bored with the buildup that you don't care about the kill by the time he gets around to it and so bored with the kill itself by the time the character finally dies that you're long past caring about the kill's function in the story.

	schema:headline " Disappointing Lucio Fulci trash.";
	schema:reviewBody "For years I had heard so many good things about Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND that I was simply ecstatic and overjoyed when I found an uncut copy on DVD during a recent visit to NYC. After rushing back home to watch it I was tortured literally with an hour of half of bad acting bad special effects and an extremely confusing plotline involving a stupid woman who unknowingly opens a gateway to Hell under the house she has just inherited. So far this sounds like a comedy but I assure you you will be laughing for all of the wrong reasons!While I don't exactly tune into a Lucio Fulci film for the 'acting' the work displayed in THE BEYOND is simply phenomenal. The movie starts off in the 1920s with some sort of angry town lynch mob who storm the house pitchforks and torches in hand! and bludgeon an artist to death accusing him of cursing the town. They crucify him to the wall of the basement and throw lye on his face where we get to witness extremely bad scenes of a man throwing a bowl of porridge onto a man's face as it bubbles and melts.Flash forward to the 'current day' where a woman has inherited the house along with two inept house servants and a lot of bad luck. To start the day off on the wrong foot a carpenter on scaffolding sees a blind girl through a window and 'falls off' before spitting up gallons of blood in slowmotion. We now meet a Doctor who I guess is supposed to be the 'hero' of the movie who examines the carpenter. He strikes up a friendship with the woman and together the two begin to explore the mystery and history of the house.Along the way we have some truly ridiculous scenes and moments that are never fullyexplained and this is the UNCUT version!. For example as always Lucio Fulci delivers his gore and the first victim gets his face pulled off and one of his eyeballs popped out of its socket in the basement by a 'zombie hand' that thrusts out of a wall. The dead guy is discovered by the female house servant who also discovers another dead body that has apparently been there for many years.Somehow both bodies happen to get transported to a hospital in a matter of minutes so we can witness our first laughable mystery. The wife of the man that was killed pays a visit to the morgue. After dressing him up in his funeral suit she suddenly starts screaming for no reason. We see a shot of a beaker full of acid toppling off a table on the other side of the room and the next thing you know the woman happens to be lying flat on her back directly underneath the acid so we can capture the gratuitous shot of her face 'melting' away beneath it. Uh right.Next the daughter comes into the room only to be scared off by an extremely large volume of 'frothy' blood that edges across the floor backing her into a room where she is greeted by a zombie.We cut away again to the woman driving down a highway where a blind woman and her dog appears out of nowhere. The blind woman tells her to leave the house immediately. Further confusion ensues when the guy who was killed in the beginning of the movie starts to show up at various different locations to kill off the remainder of the cast. The female house servant gets her head impaled on a nail where we get to see yet another infamous eyeball popping scene. A man whose connection with the main characters are never fully explained goes to the town library to seek out the original construction plans for the house only to be 'surprised' by a flash of lightning that appears out of nowhere and for no real reason that sends him crashing to the floor where he gets parts of his face bitten off by spiders.Some laughable special effects take place in this very scene. The face all of a sudden turns into a 'waxlike' head and only one of the spiders look real. The ones used in the background all look like one of those cheap plastic ones with pipecleaner legs that you once made in kindergarten. One of the spiders 'pull' one of the eyeballs out its socket and another stings the man's tongue. But the biggest bizarre moment does not involve the spiders but instead we get to see the floor plans of the house 'disappear' like magic ink. What was the purpose of all of that? You're probably thinking that it will be explained at the end of the film. Wrong.Somewhere in the middle of all of this the male house servant is killed although I don't recall this ever happening. He appears in a strange seance appearance involving all the dead cast members to date where they surround the blind girl who gets her throat and ear ripped off by her pooch! Ouch! Another unintentionally funny scene shows the woman who got her face 'melted' off by the jar of acid. The makeup effects are hideous. She has enough red and blue makeup on her face to resemble that of a baboon.More confusion ensues when the town suddenly 'empties' of all of its residents so that the woman and the Doctor are both running around with no one else in sight. They take refuge in the hospital where else would there be any more freshly dead bodies? where they encounter slowmoving zombies that the Doctor must insist on shooting a hundred times in the stomach. Even after he successfully slays a few by shooting them in the head he still proceeds to cluelessly shoot them in the stomach. And all of these endless bullets are coming out of a sixchamber barrel that he never refills! LOL!There is of course one surviving man who is hiding in one of the rooms. He is only there to show us why the Doctor would shoot at a glass door for no reason so a mysterious gust of wind would blow shards of glass into the room and pierce a 'waxlike' head killing the man instantly.With a mob of zombies actually upon closer examination it looks like it's the same group of six zombies who reappear continuously to make it look like that there are 'legions' of them shuffling after the Doctor and the woman they run down a stairwell and find themselves back in the basement of the house. Making their way through a hole in the wall they find themselves wandering Hell for eternity. If you ever thought Hell would look like a dark wasteland with five bodies lying around then you'll be pleased with this ending.So all of the missing plot points that you thought would be finally answered in a clever finale are never explained. We never find out why the woman could see the blind girl and where she lived but the Doctor couldn't. We never find out how the creepy male house servant dies or why he and the female servant 'came with the house'. We never find out why the missing floor plans 'disappeared' and for what reasons. That and many other unanswered plot holes left me feeling very angry for wasting my time hope and money. The gore was laughable if anything and there wasn't one scene that made me 'jump' even if it was the old scare tactic involving a hand on a shoulder during a tense moment. There was only one good scene and that was when the little girl got her head blown off. But other than that this movie was very disappointing.My Rating  2 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "OKobviously Fulci has his admirers read previous postings.  I'm not one of them.  I love horror films and graphic gore does not bother me at all. But Fulci's films are graphic gore and nothing else.  I've seen about five of his films The Gates of Hell House by the Cemetery Zombie and hate each of them for the same reasons.  The plots make no sense the characters are boring the dubbing is atrocious and gore is just rubbed in our faces for no apparent reason than to gross us out.  Like I said I don't mind graphic gore but let's have a reason for it!  I totally disagree with people calling Fulci the King of Italian horror films.  That title belongs to Dario Argento.  His movies are graphic also but there's plot characterization and they're beautifully filmed look at Suspira. Getting back to The Beyond it starts out interesting gets bogged down in the middle throws in a needlessly graphic and stupid attack by spiders and ceases to make sense totally by the end.  I was lucky enough to see a brandnew print of this in a revival cinema last year.  The basic reaction of the audience was utter silence and a few groans and boos.  People walked out talking about how much they hated the film.  Great to see that I'm not alone.  So if you're looking for graphic disgusting looonnngggg gore sequences go with Fulci.  If you want plot characterization and better direction go with Argento.".

This however was one painful watch.The Good The gore and effects were very well done for the time and still hold their own now. Credit where it's due but that's about it.The Bad The cheesy godawful music just bellows out at the most inappropriate times and then cuts off without warning. How a horrific scene is supposed to have any effect when cheesy 70's pop music blurts out of nowhere is beyond me.The acting is atrocious most of actors are Italian and are dubbed over in English this is all fine and dandy but the shock horror expressions that they pull are hilarious. Their over the top facial expressions and body movements totally distract you from everything else that's going on.The plot there isn't one. Seriously woman inherits old hotel said hotel is built over the gateway to hell lots of random people die for no real reason the end.The deaths people just lie there and get eaten or covered in acid or torn apart by zombies without even bothering to move or trying to escape.Common sense there isn't any. In one scene the 2 leads are being chased by extremely slow zombies and the male lead shoots about 10 zombies in the chest and gut to no avail. Then he shoots a couple in the head and they drop to the floor. Seems simple enough right? Hit them in the head and you kill them hit them anywhere else and it's a wasted bullet. So why oh why does this bumbling idiot waste the next 20 or so bullets shooting the zombies in the chest and shoulder? The blind woman she has to be the most annoying actress ever. In one scene she thinks someone is in her living room and she backs into a corner and she screams and shouts...And screams and shouts...And shouts and screams...And so on and so forth for a good 5 minutes no no go away leave me alone she wails constantly over and over for 5 solid minutes it completely did my head in and was totally unnecessary.The scares there aren't any there is nothing scary about this film at all sure there's a decent amount of gore in the film but none of it is scary or even unnerving. The music acting and shoddy camera work see to that.As I said I love early 80's horror films The deadly spawn Phenomena Demons I spit on your grave The burning to name but a few but The Beyond is a big pile of steaming crap. One reviewer on here wrote If you haven't seen The Beyond you are not a real horror buff Well my friend I have seen The Beyond and if you can call this Horror then you have my sympathies. Quite simply put it is rubbish even for an early 80's film.My vote is 3 for the gore effects alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I like horror films and have nothing against blood gore  violence if it has any meaning to the film. But most of the gore in this film has no meaning at all it just seems that Fulci was obsessed with overexaggerated scenes of blood  guts. For example the scene where a man falls from a ladder in the library. If it was some other director the man would have simply fallen and died when he hit the floor. But thats not enough for Fulci! After the fall the man is attacked by spiders who shred his face into a bloody mess! Really what does that have to do with the rest of the film? Overall I think Fulci is way overrated. The reason i hunted down some of his movies they are not too easy to get hold of in Sweden. Especially uncut was that I had seen on the Internet that many horrorfans consider him one of the greatest horrordirectors. I now have seen New York Ripper Zombie House By The Cemetary and this one and I find all of them to be plain garbage. It seems to me that Fulci was without any talent whatsoever. This movie is not scary not funny it is just ludicrous. The only way you can get something out of watching this is if you like to watch bad films like Plan 9 From Outer Space or if think it is fun to watch lots of fakelooking gore.".

For example when the guy falls in the records room and the spiders come for him why did they use real and fake spiders at the same time? It's laughable. Why was there an opened bottle of acid in the autopsy room and why did the lady just fall down and sit there while acid poured on her face?I watched this movie with a group of friends late last night and we were shocked by how bad it was. The viewing turned into an episode of MST3K everybody was ripping it. I've seen Fulci's Zombi and The City of the Living Dead and all I can say about this director is that he is completely overrated. His films do not hold up over time they aren't frightening and they certainly aren't entertaining. I can't believe that Rolling Thunder helped rerelease this schlock. When you consider the other horror films that were coming out in the states around this time like Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing it really shames Fulci. The Beyond is lowbudget gorespoliation that might have been freaky in say 1973 but in 1981 it was passe and in 2004 it is comedy. Take it from me avoid this at all costs. Where do I go for a refund?".

He is more concerned with creating a series of sequences meant to scare you. Horrify you. And hopefully even gross you out. This fits Fulci perfectly but also is not a bad way to describe Italian horror in general. Fulci freely admits the film has no logic and is plotless. I love the smile Catriona MacColl flashes as David Warbeck tries to put a bullet in the front of a pistol while in the elevator. Clearly anyone who knows how to use a gun would not load it this way. But also Fulci could have cut the film a second earlier and avoided the momentary smile that appears in an otherwise tense and terrifying scene.Any diehard horror fan or fan of Italian horror must see this film. It is a true classic regardless of the fact it may be overlooked by some horror historians Italian horror has always taken a backseat to American or British horror and even among Italian films Fulci takes a backseat to Argento.

Lucio Fulci the socalled King of Italian Horror has some hangup about piercing eyeballs and we are there to share his gory glory. One woman has her eye pushed out by a nail from the back of the head. One man has a chard of window glass stuck in his eye. Another man has a tarantula pierce his eye. One other guy has his gouged out and so on and so on. I don't mind some gore here and there truth be told I am no great fan of it at all. I subscribe to that belief that horror can be more effective when not seen but imagined. Forget that with Fulci and I knew that going into The Beyond. Of all his films that I have seen  Zombie The Gates of Hell Manhattan Baby and The Black Cat  The Beyond is easily the worst as it is nothing more than an exercise in shock shock for the sake of shock and void of any real storytelling. Fulci at his best has some flashes of brilliance but lacks the creativity to combine story and plot and characterization with his gory graphics. The Beyond lacks even his most minimal attention to story and characters. This film is nothing more than an excuse to see guts ripped eyes gouged and people mutilated before your very eyes. I am indeed sorry that I require more than that in a horror film. I was never scared I was just sick to my stomach that this film satisfies other viewer's needs. Did I like anything about the film? Like the dog ripping out a blind woman's throat? An overflowing beaker of acid washing over a woman's face repeatedly? The inexplicable prologue to the film that tells us almost nothing at all? No. Forget Fulci and see Dario Argento's work. he is the Master of Italian Horror. His films are very graphic and gory but always tell a story and delve into characters and who they are. He also inheriting his palette for the eye from Mario Bavawho I think IS the Grandmaster of Italian Horror paints a film with his camera lens. Fulci's film here only connects one brutal death to another with barely a word of dialog thrown in the mixture. Why this film is so popular is quite BEYOND me  at least I wish it were.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a girl who inherits a hotel in Louisiana where years before all of the guests suddenly disappeared not long after a wizard was killed in the basement. The woman begins renovations and in the process unleashes a terrible evil and one of the seven doors to hell.As many of people have said about Lucio Fulci he never let plot get in the way of him making a movie. This is the best example of that it has almost no plot. Basically a series of set pieces arranged in order to have a loose dream logic this is a movie that makes no sense whats so ever. What ever happens happens to get us to the next thing. The warlock from the start warns the people who lynch him that he's the only one keeping them safe. He is in effect the good guy keeping the gate closed. Later his resurrected corpse proves to be the villain killing everyone off and raising the rest of the dead. It makes no real sense then again very little including the carnivorous spiders in the library makes any sense.I'm one of those people who wonder at the horror fans who LOVE Fulci's work. Don't get me wrong I do think he was a good director I like his westerns however I wonder why outside of his set pieces people rave about his horror films. Yes I'm a fan of Zombie and I like City of the Living Dead but many of his other horror films this one included leave me shaking my head and hitting the fast forward button. No doubt he was one of the movers and shakers in the Italian horror cycle of the early 1980's but it was because of his splatter and not because of his genius at crafting a horror story. I do accept that there is often a dream logic that carries things along but at the same time Fulci often abandons it to the next eye gouge opportunity. While his over all output as a director argues against it his horror output for the most partsees him in hack territory. Genius of the gross out set piece? Absolutely. Director of scary horror films? Not really.This is not a good movie. And even if you could convince me it was I'll never say its a great one. Certainly it has some really cool scenesmost of the deaths are intriguing to look at but thats about all. The plot as I said is close to non existent and uses a good number of standard Italian horror ploys gate ways to hell zombies gore weird women electronic music...oh do I have to go on? This film is a turkey. Its for gorehounds alone.For those looking for the full uncut version I could be wrong but I think the Diamond Entertainment release under the name Seven Doors of Death is the complete film. Its run time of just over 84 minutes is less than the full running time but longer than the cut US version of the same name certainly all the gore seems intact. If this was sourced from a PAL original the film would be complete.".

	schema:headline " Bizarre gore drenched splatter Euro horror from Lucio Fulci.";
	schema:reviewBody "Louisiana 1927. A group of men storm a local hotel on the edge of a swamp and burst into a painters named Schweick Antoine SaintJohn room who they believe is a warlock. They drag him down to the basement Schweick warns them that the hotel was built over one of the seven gateways to hell and that only he can protect them from it. They ignore him and brutally beat him and crucify him. Skip forward to 1981. New Yorker Lisa Merril Katherine MacColl inherits the now abandoned and run down hotel and two creepy helpers the housekeeper Martha Veronica Lazar and a general handyman Arthur Gianpaolo Saccarola. She decides to repair the place and re open it. Unfortunately thing start to turn sour almost immediately one of the painters falls off his second floor scaffolding. The local plumber Joe Giovanni De Nava finds Schweick's rotted corpse behind a wall in the flooded basement Schweick then gouges Joe's eye out. And Lisa is warned by a blind woman Emily Sarah Keller that she is in great danger and must leave. Dr. John McCabe David Warbeck and his assistant Dr. Harris Al Cliver examine both Joe's and Schweick's corpses. Interested McCabe becomes involved with Lisa and they both start to investigate the strange events. Soon they realize the gateway to hell under the hotel has been opened and zombies are appearing everywhere. Thats the best I can sum the plot up what plot there is in this film anyway.Directed by Lucio Fulci this was the third of his zombie quartet starting with Zombie Flesh Eaters 1979 City of the Living Dead 1980 this and finally the House by the Cemetery 1981. I think their all a bit overrated but decent solid horror all the same. Acting is OK and Katherine MacColl makes an attractive damsel in distress. David Warbeck is OK as the hero and I liked Jill Maria Pia Marsala as the freaky possessed kid. The rest of the cast are just there to be killed in various gore soaked ways nothing more. Antoine SaintJohn in the opening sequence is chain whipped crucified and has acid thrown into his face all in graphic detail. People have their eyes poked out more faces are melted with acid a great scene where a woman has her throat torn out and her ear bitten off by her dog loads of rotting zombies appear guys are impaled with shards of glass and little girl Jill has the top of her head blown off. Fulci and special effects man Giannetteo De Rossi don't shy away from the red stuff thats for sure. For the most part the make up effects are impressive the best being when Jill gets shot in the face the worst is when Martin Avery Michele Mirabella is attacked by spiders. Not only do the spiders make a squeaking noise for some reason but the fake spiders look awful as does the fake head which they bite and pull apart Martin's tongue being bitten looks good though just a shame about the rest of the scene. It has nice clear crisp and colourful photography by Sergio Salvati. It's main draw back is the script credited to Fulci Dardando Sacchetti and Giorgio Mariuzzo it's bizarre surreal and doesn't really make any sense which is a problem. There are also big lapses in logic like the end where Warbeck discovers the only way to kill the zombies is to shoot them in the head but he still insists on shooting them anywhere but their heads. Overall I liked it it's stylishly made and features plenty of blood gore and violence. I just wish the story was a little clearer and things didn't just happen for no apparent reason. Certainly worth watching if your a gorehound or horror fan. Make sure you watch one of the various uncut widescreen DVD's that are available the only way to appreciate it properly in my opinion. Recommended.".

Cary Grant was playing Cary Grant by this time and no one could do it better. And Grace Kelly what eyecandy! The snappy dialog with the sexual innuendo was done perfectly. And huge kudos to Brigitte Auber who was gorgeous and very good. An interesting aside was that Grant's character while pretending to be someone else claimed to have been an American circus acrobat which Grant sort of was early in life albeit English not American. Grant with his accent could really never be mistaken for an American even though he usually played one. Also it was a little eerie to see Grace Kelly driving so fast on those French Riviera cliffside roads in light of what happened to her later. Of course she obviously wasn't doing so they were using backprojection Anyway this film is a must for fans of Hitchcock Kelly or Grant. Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "With the magnificent setting of the French Riviera To Catch a Thief is beautiful to look at. Alfred Hitchcock the absolute master of suspense appears to be having a lot of fun with this playful account of the rich and famous in their playground. The film is greatly enhanced by the magnificent photography of Robert Burke whose camera does wonders to show us that beautiful part of France.The film begins with a teasing sequence where one sees a black cat running wildly on the roofs of villas and later on hysterical ladies are seen screaming when they realize they have been burglarized. The police links John Robie to the robberies since it appears it's his own modus operandi. In order to fool the authorities that are following him John boards a bus full of ordinary people bringing things to the market and we catch a glimpse of Hitchcock himself sitting in the back of the bus next to John. This is the amazing opening for this film which shows a lighter Hitchcock out for a good time.We then meet the rich Stevens mother and daughter who are vacationing at the posh Carlton Hotel in Cannes. The insurance agent Hughson introduces Robie to them. Hughson wants the Stevens women to be careful with their jewelry at least have them keep their gems in the hotel's safe which they will not hear of. This seems to be an excuse for bringing together John and Frances a beautiful and elegant woman who makes a point to show how much she hates having even a conversation with Robie who will display all his charm and ultimately win her over.The best asset in the film is the elegant and ravishing Grace Kelly at the height of her beauty. Ms. Kelly was one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the screen. In a way it seems almost as though this film was prophetic in what would happen in her life. First becoming the fairy tale princess of Monaco and later on to die in the same highway one sees her racing her car. Ms. Kelly dressed by the incomparable Edith Head shows an innate elegance and a great flair to carry clothes in such a wonderful manner.Cary Grant as John Robie was at his best portraying the debonair former jewelry thief a man with a past that had not committed a robbery for many years now but whose fame preceded him everywhere. Mr. Grant and Ms. Kelly make a great romantic couple whenever we see them. Mr. Hitchcock got a lot out of these two actors and in the process gives his fan something to care for.John Williams is excellent as the insurance agent trying to protect his clients. Mr. Williams was a superb actor who almost seems not to be acting at all. The same can be said for the chic Jessie Royce Landis who always showed she was a smart and elegant actress.While this is a film so different from most of his other films Mr. Hitchcock shows a great affinity for comedy in it. This proved to be a pause in his distinguished career to amuse his public. How well he succeeded!".

	schema:headline " Languid but beautiful romantic thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This is probably Hitchcock's most beautiful movie. Grace Kelly is well but of course decorously displayed in delicate and perfectly fitted summer dresses and evening gowns designed by Edith Head that show off her exquisite arms and shoulders while accentuating her elegant neck and jaw lineand as she turns for the camera the graceful line of her back. Opposite her is one of Hollywood's most dashing leading men the incomparable Cary Grant.The cinematography by longtime Hitchcock collaborator Robert Burks was shot on location in the French Riviera. The style is daylight clear and sparkling bright as the dream of a princess to be always focused without a hint of darkness anywhere. Even the scenes shot at night on the rooftops seem to glow. The houses on the hills overlooking Princess Grace's future home and the narrow cobble stone roads with the lowlying stone walls suggest a refined and elegant lifestyle to come. Even though she drives too fast one is not worried that she might crash...Cary Grant is John Robie who fought with the French resistance during WWII and then became a jewel thief dubbed The Cat for his ability to slink quietly in the night over roof tops and to steal into the bedrooms of the rich and take their jewels without waking them. As the movie opens he is retired from his life of crime and living comfortably in a villa in the hills above Nice. The complications begin immediately as the police arrive at his villa to question him about some recent catlike jewel robberies. Robie is innocent of course we are led to believe and to prove his innocence he is motivated to find the real thief.Grace Kelly plays Frances Stevens the slightly naughty nouveau riche daughter of the widow of a Texasstyle oil millionaire. She is used to having men fall all over themselves trying to court her but Robie seems uninterested and this excites her fancy and she goes after him. It is interesting to note that by this time Cary Grant 51 when the film was released had become such a heart throb that directors liked to have the women who were always noticeably younger Kelly was 26 chase after him. Audrey Hepburn does as much in Charade 1963. One notes that here as in Charade the women kiss Cary Grant first not the other way around. Here it is nicely done as the previously demure Frances takes a surprising initiative at the door of her hotel suite.The story itself is rather bland and predictable reminding me of a James Bond flick from say the sixties as though toned down for an audience of old maids. Notable in supporting roles are Brigitte Auber as the athletic Danielle Foussard John Williams as the British insurance agent and Jessie Royce Landis as Frances Stevens' mother. Hitch makes his de rigueur appearance as a passenger on the minibus that Robie takes to get away from the gendarmes early in the film.See this for Grace Kelly whose cool and playful demeanor and statuesque beauty form the heart of this somewhat languid romantic thriller.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

But there's someone out there who's using all his old cat burglar tricks and putting him in one big jackpot. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but Cary ain't flattered. With the French Surete and the English insurance company breathing down his neck he'd better find out who the culprit is and fast.He's got one ally John Williams of the insurance company who has a sense it ain't really Cary. He's also got to contend with spoiled rich girl Grace Kelly who's taken a fancy to him. How much help she is is a dubious proposition.Unlike a lot of Alfred Hitchcock films this one doesn't have all that much mystery to it. In fact early on you should be able to figure out who's stealing Cary's tricks. But the color photography which won an Oscar of the French Riviera is breathtaking and Cary Grant and Grace Kelly play the whole thing with such style that you really don't care.My favorite in the film is Jessie Royce Landis who is Kelly's mother. She's rich but remembers when she was poor. She takes to Cary and sticks with him when Grace has doubts and gives her quite a lecture on men. She knows her subject well.Sadly life imitated art in this one. Grace Kelly met her future husband Prince Rainier on the set and on the road where she takes Cary Grant for a speeding car ride is the same one she had the automobile accident that took her life a generation later.But don't dwell on the morbid here. Appreciate To Catch A Thief for the fine entertainment it is.".

Witness her first surprise kiss with Cary Grant and his reaction. This is priceless acting and one of the reasons Grant is considered one of the greatest actors in movie history. John Williams is also excellent as the very British insurance agent and Jesse Royce Landis who played Grant's mother in North by Northwest  is also on hand for a number of fine moments.

	schema:reviewBody "John Robie is a retired cat burglar living on the French Riviera. When there are a string of diamond robberies in the area with his modus operandi he's the number one suspect and must go into hiding to try and force the real culprit out into the open.A confession  I really dislike this movie. It has some interesting scenes the Cote D'Azur locales are very glamorous and picturesque and there are some glimpses of Hitchcock's brilliance but for the most part I just find it dull. For the master of suspense it's almost completely lacking in suspense. The plot is weak  the kickstarter is when John runs from the police but why bother  he's innocent and they have no evidence. If it's really a love story instead it's not a very good one  he's selfish and cynical and Francie is spoiled and immature. And the identity of Le Chat is pretty obvious it has to be one of John's old gang and only two of them are developed as characters one of whom is a badly dubbed old man who could hardly climb anything. Compare this with one of Hitch's other doublehunt movies say The 39 Steps where the innocent man premise is handled with much more plausibility the romance is charming and quirky and the twist at the end is craftily disguised and extremely satisfying. Most surprisingly for Hitchcock humour and thrills are minimal  the scene where Foussard dies is a flub a bunch of static shots and then a confusing badly lit struggle of someone we've hardly met falling off a cliff we didn't know was there. And while Landis and Williams raise the occasional smile there are almost no jokes. I suppose the suave romantic banter is supposed to replace them but it's not very funny if like me you don't care for the characters. The only chuckle involves an errant chicken but since it's in a scene where Francie drives her sports car recklessly round the twisting Monaco hills it's quite upsetting to watch Kelly crashed her car and died in almost the exact same spot in 1982. Are we supposed to admire John a selfconfessed unapologetic burglar who conspicuously enjoys the high life he's gotten from his crimes ? Don't get me wrong I like flawed heroes but I find nothing heroic about a snooty criminal who only cares about himself and his own liberty. I also always get a bit creeped out by love stories where the woman is half the age of the man. The movie also has two big liabilities for me  the photography and the music. Cameraman Robert Burks won an Oscar for this film which astonishes me since of the twelve movies he made with Hitchcock I'd say this one has the blandest photography  it's flat and static. There is an enormous difference between lavish glamorous colour photography and good movie photography. Just about anyone can do the former provided you have the resources and that's all this movie is  a series of exclusive resorts grand buildings and posh people in expensive suits and frocks most of which have dated badly. In a Moving Picture the emphasis should always be on the adjective  Burks was an outstanding talent but please see his stunning photography in Rear Window Vertigo or The Birds where the camera actually tells the story and adds immensely to the atmosphere as opposed to just sitting back and recording a pile of talky scenes. There are occasional flashes  like the moment where Kelly's head is all in shadow in the big seduction scene  which feel Hitchcockian and original but these are few and far between. Similarly the score by Lyn Murray a man is staid and forgettable  it could be slapped on any movie of the period and fit reasonably well. For his next film the brilliant and hilarious The Trouble With Harry Hitch employed Bernard Herrmann as composer and right from the very first second the music is sublime original funny scary and complements the images perfectly whilst simultaneously having a character all of its own. Okay so I don't like To Catch A Thief and perhaps some of my criticisms are unfair. I'm sure most people would say don't be such a killjoy it's so chic and elegant such a treasure of fifties haute couture a timepiece of Monte Carlo history a classic of romantic badinage from an age when Movie Stars really were royalty. It may be all of those things but I don't watch movies to marvel at expensive things I can't have  I watch them to see exciting stories and meet interesting characters I can identify and empathise with. Hitchcock's movies usually do that for me and then some but this one is cold and lifeless like the sparkly diamonds the characters all revolve around. A bore.".

I suppose the suave romantic banter is supposed to replace them but it's not very funny if like me you don't care for the characters. The only chuckle involves an errant chicken but since it's in a scene where Francie drives her sports car recklessly round the twisting Monaco hills it's quite upsetting to watch Kelly crashed her car and died in almost the exact same spot in 1982. Are we supposed to admire John a selfconfessed unapologetic burglar who conspicuously enjoys the high life he's gotten from his crimes ? Don't get me wrong I like flawed heroes but I find nothing heroic about a snooty criminal who only cares about himself and his own liberty. I also always get a bit creeped out by love stories where the woman is half the age of the man. The movie also has two big liabilities for me  the photography and the music. Cameraman Robert Burks won an Oscar for this film which astonishes me since of the twelve movies he made with Hitchcock I'd say this one has the blandest photography  it's flat and static. There is an enormous difference between lavish glamorous colour photography and good movie photography. Just about anyone can do the former provided you have the resources and that's all this movie is  a series of exclusive resorts grand buildings and posh people in expensive suits and frocks most of which have dated badly. In a Moving Picture the emphasis should always be on the adjective  Burks was an outstanding talent but please see his stunning photography in Rear Window Vertigo or The Birds where the camera actually tells the story and adds immensely to the atmosphere as opposed to just sitting back and recording a pile of talky scenes. There are occasional flashes  like the moment where Kelly's head is all in shadow in the big seduction scene  which feel Hitchcockian and original but these are few and far between. Similarly the score by Lyn Murray a man is staid and forgettable  it could be slapped on any movie of the period and fit reasonably well. For his next film the brilliant and hilarious The Trouble With Harry Hitch employed Bernard Herrmann as composer and right from the very first second the music is sublime original funny scary and complements the images perfectly whilst simultaneously having a character all of its own. Okay so I don't like To Catch A Thief and perhaps some of my criticisms are unfair. I'm sure most people would say don't be such a killjoy it's so chic and elegant such a treasure of fifties haute couture a timepiece of Monte Carlo history a classic of romantic badinage from an age when Movie Stars really were royalty. It may be all of those things but I don't watch movies to marvel at expensive things I can't have  I watch them to see exciting stories and meet interesting characters I can identify and empathise with. Hitchcock's movies usually do that for me and then some but this one is cold and lifeless like the sparkly diamonds the characters all revolve around. A bore.";

	schema:headline " Good movie overshadowed by other masterpieces";
	schema:reviewBody "I was mightily impressed by this new to me Hitchcock film. To Catch a Thief starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly was a delightful romp that seems to be overshadowed by Hitchcock's other masterpieces.Set on the French Riviera it stars Cary Grant as a retired jewel thief and French resistance hero. When the robberies start happening again the authorities immediately think of him. So Grant has to go out and clear his own name by catching the real thief.Grant is electric on the screen. I was never really a Cary Grant fan but under close scrutiny recently of watching Notorious North by Northwest and now To Catch a Thief I must say that I like him. He's personable and yet haughty and arrogant. I wonder what it was like to meet him. And then Grace Kelly ah Grace! delivered the best performance I've seen her in  I must find other movies with her.I must say that it kept me guessing throughout the movie. I caught myself saying that Grant was still committing the burglaries even though he was making us think otherwise.

I kept asking why this one wasn't shown as often as the others like Vertigo Rear Window or Psycho. I still don't have much of a reason. This was very entertaining. Hitchcock directed another spectacular show. I wouldn't say it was one of his best but when you are in that elite company it would be extremely hard to be.Good movie.

	onyx:emotionText "I was mightily impressed by this new to me Hitchcock film. To Catch a Thief starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly was a delightful romp that seems to be overshadowed by Hitchcock's other masterpieces.Set on the French Riviera it stars Cary Grant as a retired jewel thief and French resistance hero. When the robberies start happening again the authorities immediately think of him. So Grant has to go out and clear his own name by catching the real thief.Grant is electric on the screen. I was never really a Cary Grant fan but under close scrutiny recently of watching Notorious North by Northwest and now To Catch a Thief I must say that I like him. He's personable and yet haughty and arrogant. I wonder what it was like to meet him. And then Grace Kelly ah Grace! delivered the best performance I've seen her in  I must find other movies with her.I must say that it kept me guessing throughout the movie. I caught myself saying that Grant was still committing the burglaries even though he was making us think otherwise.

	schema:reviewBody "To Catch a Thief may have been Alfred Hitchcock's only film that bordered on escapism. Whereas most of his movies were all about suspense and camera angle this one is mostly about aesthetics at least as far as I could tell.Cary Grant plays John Robie an excat burglar now living in retirement in Nice France. When a series of robberies starts to plague the city the police try to question John but he gets away. While hiding in the city he meets exquisite American heiress Frances Stevens Grace Kelly pretty as always who's more interested in him than he is in her. From there we start to become intrigued about which of the various characters is doing what.One of the undeniable aspects in this movie is how it makes use of Grace Kelly's incomparable beauty no matter from which angle they film her she and her clothes always light up the screen. But there's something else that I notice about the movie the similarities to Charade. The obvious point is that both films star Cary Grant and happen in France. But also Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn were both born in 1929 and in their respective roles in these movies they play women involved with men who may or may not be what they seem.Maybe I'm the only person who thinks that. Anyway To Catch a Thief is more about showing off Grace Kelly than about suspense or camera angles. But don't get me wrong she was one hot babe. Too bad she got killed in a car wreck in fact TCAT has a scene where she's driving dangerously through the hills above Nice a premonition?.One scene that I really liked was when John is hiding in a boat and athletic Danielle Foussard Brigitte Auber is at the helm. When a plane flies overhead John tells Danielle to get rid of them by acting pretty. She promptly pulls back her dress a little bit. He quickly reminds her Not that pretty! We're trying to get rid of them!".

Robie claims to be reformed but the police suspect otherwise. As the police seem so intent on following him instead of looking for the real crook Robie decides to track down the thief himself. He soon meets and begins a romance with Frances Stevens Grace Kelly whose mother happens to have her own collection of valuable gems. But when Frances' mother's jewels are stolen she naturally suspects Robie. Robie must convince Frances of his innocence and with her help finally unmask the real catburglar.To Catch a Thief may not have Hitchcock's most suspenseful or intricate plot but it's certainly one of Hitch's best looking films. Everything is simply beautiful. The French Riviera locations are amazing. Odd craggy points that lead to the crystal blue ocean are filmed like works of art. It looks better than any travelogue you're likely to see. The old unique characterfilled buildings make for stunning backdrops to the unfolding story. And has there ever been a better looking onscreen couple than Grant and Kelly? I doubt it. These two can make the most mundane of scenes look like a million dollars.As for the plot it's not overly difficult to figure out who the real burglar is. The movie all but slaps you in the face with the answer. But the fun comes in watching Grant and Kelly get to the final conclusion. The final showdown between the police Robie and the catburglar is great. Other highlights for me included the swimming scene the boat scene and the picnic scene. Unfortunately I've always felt there were few instances where To Catch a Thief drags a bit. There are a number of scenes where cars drive back and forth along twisting mountainous roads. And while the scenery is breathtaking a bit more intrigue might have been a plus. Grant and Kelly's charm however is generally enough to offset these moments.Overall it may not be Hitch's best but I've always enjoyed revisiting To Catch a Thief.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's most devoted fans might find this film to be too light but in my opinion it's one of his very best films a joyous romp in the South of France with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. The great location photography enhances the mood of the film perfectly and helps make this a really classy piece of escapist fun like Tourneur's Out of the Past Welles' Lady from Shanghai and his own Notorious a lot of the film's appeal is from seeing beautiful and exotic people in a beautiful and exotic setting trying to figure out how to stay alive in a situation where noone and nothing seems familiar or trustworthy. Just as in most exotic noir films the main character John Robie the cat burglar Grant has a mysterious criminal past which makes the female protagonist uncertain about whether to trust him. However this film stays away from the dark side of the caper genre by clueing the audience in very early as to the protagonist's innocence thus making the female protagonist the more interesting character as far as motives and judgments.For me the main reason to watch this film is always Grant so suave and selfdeprecating as the oncenotorious cat burglar. Since as I said we know he's innocent what's interesting about his character is the way he reacts to the fact that so many other people think he's guilty. Robie seems to actually enjoy being implicated except insofar as he values his freedom and his lifestyle very highly. This film is built on irony and the greatest irony of all is that in the end Robie finds a woman Kelly to whom he will willingly accept the loss of both he will now welcome a motherinlaw to his paradise villa. Now in a lot of Grant's 50s60s movies we see the female protagonist actually seducing Grant but it was never handled as well as in this film. That's because the element of seduction coincides in so many convincingly ironic ways with his other motivations. 2 scenes in particular stand out in this regard to me. The first is the scene with Kelly driving reluctant passenger Grant at very high speeds on the edges of cliffs as cops chase them. This time it is not his own ingenuity that will save him and it's interesting how Kelly slowly plays her cards until she throws out her joker and completely trumps him  she knows his true identity. This scene is reminiscent of the one in Notorious where Grant is driven by a drunken Ingrid Bergman or for that matter the one in NxNW where he's driven by a drunken.. Cary Grant!. Hitch seems to revel in placing the ultimate leading man in dangerous and humiliating circumstances  it's essential to the development of the character that he be humbled just a bit by Kelly just as she will later be humbled to discover that he was not the thief she thought he was.It's the juicy irony of that situation that really makes the developing romantic relationship work  Kelly's character thinks that she understands Grant and she is chasing him just like he's chasing the real thief. In the first place she aggressively kisses him before he really speaks to her an element lifted for Donen's derivative Charade so she's already chasing him in a sense just because she's so fascinated by his seemingly unique ability to ignore her. Then in the second really important love scene the fireworks scene Kelly thinks she has him all figured out  you've been staring at them all night she says referring to her jewels even though Robie was probably staring at her more shall we say uniquely feminine features in that particular region. As Hitchcock keeps us guessing about what each lover truly desires in the other he gives this romance great depth and verity by engaging our own desire to be close to these fascinating intelligent characters and by enticing us with the irony of their conflicting motives.OK another thing  this is Grace Kelly at her best. Compared to most of her other performances this is truly astounding confident work. I can't forget the look in her eyes as she tours the villa with Grant  totally convincing and yet somehow haunting a young woman in love but not sure exactly what she's getting into. Every time I see a bad Kelly movie I pick this one up again to remind myself of just how much a director can do to bring out the most in an actor. Even Grant is better than usual here perfectly mixing his comedic and dramatic personae for really the first time as far as I'm aware. In Suspicion he and Hitch toyed with and deconstructed his normal screen persona  but this film is tome even more impressive and enjoyable because it took that persona and instead of contradicting it Suspicion or simply undermining it i.e. Hawks' Male War Bride they exaggerated it and played more subtly with the sexual element of the catch and the question of who exactly catches who  and more importantly and amusingly why.I'll leave it to others to discuss all the other solid performances the director's techniques etc. All of it is true but this film is really all about Grant and Kelly's characters in danger and in love the film asks is there a difference? and having the time of their lives. It's an intelligent suspenseful romantic movie with two exciting lead actors beautiful locations well photographed gorgeous costumes that enhance character and plot e.g. Grant's slave boy costume in the grand ball all captured by one of the world's best directors at the peak of his abilities. And I do mean captured. This is a rare beast and should be appreciated as such and not for what people might wish it was trying to be.".

As a result of his bravery he was paroled and although he now claims to be living an honest existence the recent burglaries have all the hallmarks of his style. Robie has to clear his name of suspicion and expose the real Cat as the press have nicknamed the burglar. The theme of a man unjustly accused or suspected of a crime was a common one with Hitchcock. Along the way he finds time to flirt with Danielle the attractive daughter of a local waiter and to carry on a more serious romance with Frances Stephens a glamorous American oil heiress.Hitchcock is not perhaps a director whom one would normally associate with visual beauty but as another reviewer has pointed out this is perhaps his most visually beautiful film with plenty of touristbrochure shots of the Riviera. The film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and was nominated for two others Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. For the two main roles he used two of his favourite actors Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. In both cases it was their third Hitchcock film Grant would later go on to make a fourth North by Northwest. Kelly was one of the most beautiful Hollywood stars of all time and Hitchcock catches her at her loveliest in this film her beauty shown to its best advantage by some sumptuous costumes. Her verbal duels with Grant are one of the major features of the film they sometimes turn into threeway contests when Danielle played by Brigitte Auber joins in. Auber incidentally seems miscast. The exchanges between the two women suggest that Danielle is considerably younger than Frances probably only a teenager. Auber in fact was a year older than Kelly.This is possibly Hitchcock's most lighthearted film apart from his few ventures into pure comedy such as Mr and Mrs Smith. If one had to categorise it it would probably be as a comedyromancethriller. Although Hitchcock made a few other films along similar lines notably North by Northwest To Catch a Thief contains a greater element of comedy and a lesser element of thrills. There are no great setpiece suspense scenes comparable to the cropduster and Mount Rushmore sequences in the later movie indeed there is very little suspense at all except in the scene at the end where Robie confronts the Cat on the rooftops. The film to which it perhaps bears the greatest resemblance is Charade which also starred Cary Grant and an iconic beauty of the screen in that case Audrey Hepburn in a French setting. It was of course not directed by Hitchcock but Stanley Donen had clearly absorbed elements of his style. Like Charade To Catch a Thief is highly enjoyable as a light glossy romantic comedy but lacks the tension and psychological depth of Hitchcock's best work. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The Far Country 1954Anthony Mann and Jimmy Stewart made a few movies together and one is a cool black and white affair but this is one of his searing Technicolor productions. It almost has a comic flair even as the world is cut and splintered in the first twenty minutes until the real story beginscattle driving in Alaska. Stewart of course plays a congenial sort but his character Jeff Webster has a history of killing a couple men and having a little vengeance in his heart and when he is coerced into this new job you know it isn't going to go smoothly.This is an odd story told with an odd tilt to it and that's a good thing overall. And it's set in Alaska near the Yukon which gives it more of a frontierprospecting feel than a standard Western. In addition to Walter Brennan who is his usual quirky best the leading woman is Ruth Roman who had a career something short of stardom and she plays a tough but elegant frontier woman well. And there is a perky younger women a French actress named Corinne Calvet a kind of tomboy who has the hots for Webster. It doesn't quite work but it's fun and it's part of the series of conflicts all operating at the same time.There are some small flaws you have to overlook like the day for night that is more day than night which is only emphasized by some brilliant night filming at the end of the movie night for night done to perfection. But there is a bigger tension that keeps things really interesting too. Two extremes of women after one singular guythat's enough for any movie. And there is the sheriff and judge and powermonger in town who is ruthless with a laugh and cackle and he makes a great villain.I'm not interested in movies for their scenery but it's worth noticing the amazing mountain country that is the setting here. There are also the standard moments that don't really add to the plot but to the moodsome barroom singing some riding through the scenery. But what really makes the movie is Stewart's role as an individualist a man who is looking after himself first and last. Brennan acts as his conscience reminding him to be a good guy and Stewart to his credit listens.Heroics come slowly in a Mann Western. You suspect Webster is a good person deep down but his goodness has a slow coming out. And in a way even by the end the ambiguity is thereit's the good townspeople who rise up and get their justice. A good movie a very good Western.".

	schema:headline " fairly good";
	schema:reviewBody "The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford never made that many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine but then very few films western or otherwise are. Each of the five films of Mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see. Bend Far Man of the West Furies Winchester 73 and yep six Naked Spur. Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring lapses. Yet so does Red River which is still the single greatest western ever made. So perfection isn't everything. But The Far Country has huge huge holes. It's mawkish and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a one man course in cinematography. It is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film. It is almost never in the wrong place never. The Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man. He is absolutely amazing look at him in Bend Far Winchester and Man from Laramie in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from Dachau in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you wince and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it. But that was Mann's territory look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper while not being quite as convincing as Stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as Mann. What a great great director. See every western he ever made. They are his real monuments even if all are scetchy. But so what. When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone period.Thanks Anthony.".

The Far Country is the only one out of all five StewartMann westerns that is often overlooked. Stewart yet again puts a new look on the everpresent personalities he had in the five StewartMann westerns. Jeff Webster Stewart is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. Ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. This displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick Ben Tatum played by Walter Brennan since Tatum is the one that gave it to him. Mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five StewartMann westerns. He displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption. The story is that Jeff and Ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of Dawson along with gold partners Calvet and Flippen and nogood but beautiful Roman and her hired men. They are unable to leave because crooked sheriff Mr. Gannon McIntire and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through Skagway which is Gannon's town. But eventually McIntire comes to them but not to collect Stewart andor his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. What is McIntire there for? He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. People are killed. A sheriff for Dawson is considered needed and Calvet elects Stewart because he is good with a gun. Stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out. He also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed. So Flippen is elected instead. A miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of Gannon's men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named Madden who carries two guns played by Wilke. Flippen attempts to arrest Madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk. A man named Yukon replaces Flippen. Stewart and Tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by Gannon's men. Tatum is killed and Stewart is wounded. Stewart finally realizes that he must do something or Gannon will take over Dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like Skagway. The audience also realizes what Stewart must do. Another thing that the audience realizes is that Stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and Gannon. If Stewart leaves Gannon would take over the town. If Stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. This is where a great scene occurs. Stewart walks into his cabin. He has a sling on his arm. For a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up Stewart is in the background just inside the door. He stares at it for a few seconds. He tosses the sling away. The sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor. This is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. He comes into his new life of helping people when they need help. What ends the film is a gunsblazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feelgood feeling that everything will be alright.".

	schema:headline " Jimmy Stewart brings law to the Klondike";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history particularly the disservice done to the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon.I'll leave it to Pierre Berton noted historian born and raised in Dawson City Yukon and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush Klondike The Last Great Gold Rush 18961899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie The American idea of an untamed frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns was continued in The Far Country another story about a cowboy from the American west  Wyoming this time  driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns  that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is empty.Where is the constable? asks Brennan.Up on the Pelly River. Trouble with the Chilkats someone replies. He's got a real tough job that constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time. The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route into the Yukon and they brooked no nonsense. They collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community. In Dawson the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.In such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. No man has yet taken a gun away from me said the American. Well I'm taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.In 1898 the big year of the stampede there wasn't a serious crime  let alone a murder  in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith the Denver confidence man was remarkable. But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any law which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway  he is called Gannon in the picture  can easily control. In real life one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant.in the movie the lone Mountie says Yes I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it.Then why aren't there more of you?Because yesterday this was a wilderness. We didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands. Now that you're here we'll protect you.When?There'll be a post established here in Dawson early in May.What happens between now and May? You going to be here to keep order?Part of the time.What about the rest of the time?Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in. Have him act as marshalThe movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. His astonishing suggestion  that an American town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence  is accepted. Naturally they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others get shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own. He pins on the tin star and he and the bully Gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax.To anybody with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north this bald retelling of the story passes rational belief. excerpt from Hollywood's Canada by Pierre Berton 1975.".

The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns  that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is empty.Where is the constable? asks Brennan.Up on the Pelly River. Trouble with the Chilkats someone replies. He's got a real tough job that constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time. The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route into the Yukon and they brooked no nonsense. They collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community. In Dawson the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.In such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. No man has yet taken a gun away from me said the American. Well I'm taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.In 1898 the big year of the stampede there wasn't a serious crime  let alone a murder  in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith the Denver confidence man was remarkable. But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any law which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway  he is called Gannon in the picture  can easily control. In real life one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant.in the movie the lone Mountie says Yes I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it.Then why aren't there more of you?Because yesterday this was a wilderness. We didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands. Now that you're here we'll protect you.When?There'll be a post established here in Dawson early in May.What happens between now and May? You going to be here to keep order?Part of the time.What about the rest of the time?Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in. Have him act as marshalThe movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. His astonishing suggestion  that an American town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence  is accepted. Naturally they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others get shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own. He pins on the tin star and he and the bully Gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax.To anybody with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north this bald retelling of the story passes rational belief. excerpt from Hollywood's Canada by Pierre Berton 1975.";

When the story moves to Dawson that is when I feel Anthony Mann who used the outdoor locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. James Stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Mann is excellent directing the shootouts but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white like it was with the greens in The Naked Spur and the browns in The Man From Laramie. Like all of the MannStewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character which is more complex.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is such a fantastic movie a Western about a selfconcerned man Jimmy Stewart going up to the Klondike for gold. On the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska John McIntire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the States. The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire's town. Ruth Roman for instance who has come with Stewart and his two companions Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen who plays Stewart's best friend builds a saloon a Hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the town's restaurant and hangout place out of business. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up too. In 1953 Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 99.9 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur The Far Country boasts beautiful onlocation cinematography. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 Rear Window. I suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. Still Stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to those I've mentioned the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I ought to single out Walter Brennen as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. The screenplay is very well written and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Stewart vs. the hanging judge  good one!";
	schema:reviewBody "The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle.  He hooks up in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum Walter Brennan and Rube Morris Jay C. Flippen that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip north.But first he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy manipulative Ronda Castle Ruth Roman who believes Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future.  That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier and justifiable killing of a trail hand.Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon John McIntire who runs the town of Skagway Alaska.  Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town.  He fines Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for the time being.  In the meantime Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies.  But this is just a ruse so Jeff Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle back.  Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach.After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold.  But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck up in the Klondike himself.  That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims.  Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang.They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth.  Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save Judge Gannon from his just due.  The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that.  First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best gunman Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie.  Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms.  Then Jeff kills Gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk.  Revenge has spoken.This is another riproaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE.  Why the Universal DVD uses a panandscan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses is beyond me.  You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels.  So if you like wellwritten 50s westerns then this one's an Alist keeper.      8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff WebsterJimmy Stewart and Ronda CastleRuth Roman. She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. Gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from Skagway to Dawson. But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile Rene a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Yet she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson. Along with Ronda she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim. Walter Brennan as Ben serves as Jeff's long time sidekick. He doesn't have a meaty role but serves to soften Jeff's hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff.John McIntireas Sheriff Gannon makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. Evidently he sees something of himself in Jeff repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith who spent his last years in Skagway as one of the premier con men of his times.Jeff is the quintessential antihero a lonerexcept for companion Ben who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect he closely resemble's Burt Lancaster's character in Vera Cruz for example. Thus Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson. Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive. Then Jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself. He changes from antihero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon's gang from Dawson. In this respect he differs from Lancaster's character who never reformsBut is Jeff truly changed or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff. Although she is clearly characterized as a bad girl Jeff has a checkered recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon. Ironically soon after Jeff changes from antihero to hero Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon's impending ambush. She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herselfhis supposedly just abandoned creed!.It's clear that Corine Calvert as Renee just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda in Jeff's mind. Yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. Her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. I'm also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.He's not her father.Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon's gang. If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk before Jeff did the same to him. And how did Jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. And why weren't most of Ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon's gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. Allinall a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. No doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway.".

	schema:headline " The best Western movie I've ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Now admittedly I'm no ardent student of the genre. As a matter of fact I've tended always to shy away from Westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as America's primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the Injuns the big gunfight or Hey let's form a posse! In other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality. And yes I HAVE seen at least some of the socalled greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment  including Stagecoach Rio Bravo My Darling Clementine and of course the infamous but profoundly dull Clint EastwoodSergio Leone teamups in the '60s.But when I saw this movie on TV  as part of a commemorative Jimmy Stewart weekend upon his death  I finally GOT IT I understood at least in theory what the Western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation aside from just action and thrills. It is the pushpull between lawlessness and order the American West represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed. Respectable folk could get hurt out there. Which of course meant that perhaps  just perhaps  it wasn't meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land. In such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and freespirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it manifested itself on the Eastern seaboard and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just IS NOT RIGHT. Catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder IN THE MAIN CHARACTER HIMSELF  is I believe after seeing this movie the highest and truest goal of any Western. Sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and let's not even get started talking about the Indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in between.Not in this one. Jimmy Stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the Alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold. He is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by Walter Brennan perhaps the Western clich character to end them all  but nevertheless enjoyable here as always  and no one else. Pointedly they are out for themselves and while Stewart displays his patented charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we? we are left with little doubt that his is basically a selfcentered selfinterested character none of his Gosh or Oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through. Or rather it has to be EARNED by the end of the picture in the way I described above. He must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail. This town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff Mr. Gannon played by John McIntire in one of the best bad guy performances I've ever seen. He comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with Stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy  so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force. Further by establishing a type of breezy if necessarily guarded camaraderie between McIntire and Stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are  and so how far a moral distance Stewart must walk by the end of the film.I won't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes  see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous Alaskan scenery  filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up. What's key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time  although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky. Definitely one of the greatest performances I've seen from Stewart showing he could play the renegade the man's man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door. If anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown  like say Eastwood or John Wayne  and more a threedimensional personage. His relationship with Brennan is wellplayed understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of George and Lenny from Of Mice and Men  an altogether different type of western.I certainly have more Westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which I will necessarily judge all the others. It deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart  in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a I trust only myself attitude which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he as Jeff Webster kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute we never are clear about it  either they wanted to leave the cattle drive or they tried to steal the cattle. He meets his match in Skagway the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a socalled law man named Gannon John McIntyre who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the Gold Rush Jefferson Soapy Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging  so as a penalty fine the herd is confiscated to be sold later for Gannon's profit. Stewart is partner with Ben Walter Brennan  who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean. They are also joined by Rube Morris Jay C. Flippen and also meet two women the sophisticated Rhonda Castle Ruth Roman and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon Corinne Calvert. Rhonda works closely with Gannon but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However she has a similar I only trust myself attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He Ben and Rube go but at night while the others are asleep they go back and steal back their cattle.

	onyx:emotionText "Anthony Mann's westerns with Jimmy Stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with John Ford and Howard Hawks as the best film director in that genre. He certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy Stewart  in Mann's films there is an edge to Jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of Stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. Here it is a I trust only myself attitude which leads to one complication after another. Even before the film properly begins he as Jeff Webster kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute we never are clear about it  either they wanted to leave the cattle drive or they tried to steal the cattle. He meets his match in Skagway the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to Dawson. Skagway's boss is a socalled law man named Gannon John McIntyre who reminds one of the real boss of Skagway in the Gold Rush Jefferson Soapy Smith and Judge Roy Bean. The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as Gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. Stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging  so as a penalty fine the herd is confiscated to be sold later for Gannon's profit. Stewart is partner with Ben Walter Brennan  who oddly enough won his last Oscar playing Judge Roy Bean. They are also joined by Rube Morris Jay C. Flippen and also meet two women the sophisticated Rhonda Castle Ruth Roman and the friendly and helpful Renee Vallon Corinne Calvert. Rhonda works closely with Gannon but had helped Jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in Seattle. However she has a similar I only trust myself attitude to Jeff. She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson. He Ben and Rube go but at night while the others are asleep they go back and steal back their cattle. Renee follows and warns them that Gannon and his associates are following. Jeff holds off Gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the Canadian border although Gannon points out that since Jeff has to return by way of Skagway Gannon can wait until he does to hang him.The reunited party of Rhonda and Jeff split over the trail to take to Dawson Jeff opting for a longer and safer route.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Anthony Mann The Far Country is no masterpiece but it does maintain a great story about a selfish young cattleman named Jeff Webster wonderfully portrayed by James Stewart. Jeff has an elderly more likable sidekick named Ben Tatum Walter Brennan and their friendship is both loyal and resentful. Jeff's most memorable line occurs when he tells Ben I don't need other people. I don't need help. I can take care of me. This is quite the opposite of say Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd character from Harvey 1950. By the end of the film Jeff learns about the importance of helping others as he helps the struggling Canadian boom town of Dawson rid itself of a crooked lawman from Skagway Alaska named Mr. Gannon John McIntire who has been deviously forcing the Dawson inhabitants off of their gold claims. Up until that climactic point Gannon seems to be the most jovial character in the story based on a reallife Klondike con artist named Soapy Smith. The Far Country boasts an excellent cast Stewart McIntyre Brennan Ruth Roman Corinne Calvet and Jay C. Flippen are all top notch. And the beautiful scenery of snow and icy mountain terrain which one author called frightening is indeed unforgiving and hazardous as Jeff drives his herd from Skagway to Dawson.Here are some of my favorite moments from The Far Country. In the opening scene Jeff reveals himself as the killer of two men while on a long trip to deliver his cattle to a ferryboat he gives two other men their guns back and says Alright now you've been waiting for five hundred miles. Go ahead and use 'em! Although he seizes Jeff's cattle because of a minor infraction Mr. Gannon takes an immediate liking to Jeff assuring him I'm gonna like you. I'm gonna hang you but I'm gonna like you. The pretty young FrenchCanadian girl Renee Vallon Calvet nurses Jeff back to health after several of Gannon's henchmen wound him but she displays her jealousy when the more worldly selfcentered Ronda Castle Roman steps in and takes over where Renee left off.When I first saw The Far Country I found the selfishness of Stewart's character very hard to take and I was not convinced of his reformation at the end. Indeed Jeff Webster is not very likable and does not display a lot of personality but rest assured he does eliminate his selfish ways and team up with the townspeople of Dawson in order to do away with Mr. Gannon and his men.".

Her comedy and her pathos are equally moving and her beauty isn't spoiled by chemotherapyinduced hair loss. Rachel Griffiths whom you may remember from the hilarious Australian comedy Muriel's Wedding is the model who left Rickman for his wife on the eve of his triumph in hairdressing hence his present low state. Either of these ladies could have carried the movie. To have both of them is a treat of excess.Rickman is more believable as a barber than a high style hairdresser. Still he pulls it off because he's Rickman. Much has been made of Josh Hartnett and his murderous accent. In reality it's hardly noticeable. Get over it.Bill Nighy is fantastic as the unscrupulous London artiste pulling out all the stops to win the Championship for an unprecedented third time using his daughter the insanely beautiful Rachel Leigh Cook as his model. Rosemary Harris the perfectly cast Aunt Mae of Spiderman fame is powerful as the elderly Daisy confidante and model for Richardson and her team.The unseen treasure of this movie and the genius behind it is writer Simon Beaufoy. Beaufoy grew up in Keighley the setting of Blow Dry. Until more recently he was probably best known for also writing the hilarious and inspired The Full Monty. As he developed as a writer he later gave us the Oscar nominated 127 Hours and Oscar winning Slumdog Millionaire.There is a scene at the very end when Rickman reveals his ultimate creation that has to be seen to be believed. I still gasp every time I see it and it reinforces for me a notion of beauty that transcends everything from age to gender. And don't miss the end credit sequence. It's hilarious.Too many movie viewers think being cynical makes them appear more intelligent or more profound so they slam gems like this for their lighthearted humor. Nonsense. This is a funny 10 out of 10 and if you don't own it log off right now and go get it. You won't be sorry.".

	schema:headline " Make sure your hairdresser hasn't seen this film before you make your appointment!";
	schema:reviewBody "A welcome break from the usual gratuitous violence of the average modern film this is a colourful fantasy with some excellent performances from British stalwarts.  The wonderful Alan Rickman plays Phil the deserted and disappointed husband of Shelley played poignantly by Natasha Richardson. Phil owns a small barber's shop in the Yorkshire town of Keighley but in the past he has been a champion in UK hairdressing.  However life's traumas have reduced him to giving up any thought of ambitions on the public hairdressing stage.  When former rival hairdresser Raymond Bill Nighy arrives in Phil's home town for the national hairdressing championships the scene is set for a dramatic confrontation and by the end of the competition many people's lives have altered.  Warren Clarke gives a bravura performance as the town's mayor who gradually metamorphoses from a boring local official to an ever more ebullient show host.  The requisite romance is provided with a touch of the RomeoandJuliets.  This will probably be considered a woman's film' but every hairdresser in Britain of either sex will want to see it.  Overall although the progression of the plot is fairly predictable if you can leave your critical faculties at home for the evening it could be an enjoyable fairy story.".

The wonderful Alan Rickman plays Phil the deserted and disappointed husband of Shelley played poignantly by Natasha Richardson. Phil owns a small barber's shop in the Yorkshire town of Keighley but in the past he has been a champion in UK hairdressing.  However life's traumas have reduced him to giving up any thought of ambitions on the public hairdressing stage.  When former rival hairdresser Raymond Bill Nighy arrives in Phil's home town for the national hairdressing championships the scene is set for a dramatic confrontation and by the end of the competition many people's lives have altered.  Warren Clarke gives a bravura performance as the town's mayor who gradually metamorphoses from a boring local official to an ever more ebullient show host.  The requisite romance is provided with a touch of the RomeoandJuliets.  This will probably be considered a woman's film' but every hairdresser in Britain of either sex will want to see it.  Overall although the progression of the plot is fairly predictable if you can leave your critical faculties at home for the evening it could be an enjoyable fairy story.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kieghley is a small Yorkshire village far from the fumes of the tour bus. Mayor Tony overjoyed by his town's choice as host for the Year 2000 British Hairdressing Championship announces this grand coup to a lukewarm response by the small group of townsfolk who bother to show up for his meeting. Young Brian AllenJosh Hartnett however is very excited. Full of expectations he approaches his father Phil AllenAlan Rickman proprietor of the local barber shop where Brian works as well. Brian's reminder to his dad that Phil has already twice won this championship is met with a low growl of parental hostility. Phil flatly refuses to discuss it much less enter. Blocks away Shelley AllenNatasha Richardson walks the short distance to the local hospital for her doctor's appointment. Here quite unexpectedly this light little film delivers a heart punch. Watch Richardson's beautiful performance as the doctor reveals the cancer she's been battling is back. As he begins dispassionately discussing her treatment options she forces him to make it personal by completing his speech with brutally honest cynicism Your last two treatments have failed so its probably trying to tell you summit there.... He urges her to consider another round of chemotherapy but they both know she won't go through it again.Richardson perfectly captures the dignity and agony of a bright intelligent woman who facing the fact she is dying decides not to pursue a hopeless situation. Her exchange with DaisyRosemary Harris a terminally ill inpatient at the hospital is acerbically poignant. You get the sense that she's suspected this for quite some time and now it's time to prepare to leave this life and set her affairs in order. To Shelley the British Hairdressing Championship seems an ideal way to reconcile many old wrongs. An accomplished hairdresser she owns the local beauty shop living upstairs with her partner Sandra. Ten years before she and husband Phil had competed for their third championship title with Sandra as their model. On the eve of competition she and Sandra left Phil to enter into their lesbian relationship. Phil never forgave either one of them. Although just blocks from one another he hasn't spoken to her or Sandra for years. Brian remained with his father after the breakup and Shelley's relationship with him is at best awkward and strained.Now however she desperately wants to change all that while there is still time. She wants the old team back together again for one last go. But how? Brian likes the idea but turns her down. He has issues with his mum. Sandra thinks the whole thing is mad and hates Phil as much as he hates her. Phil wants no part of it whatsoever. His sense of betrayal and deeply abiding hurt are palpable. It seems impossible. Resolute she enters her salon A Cut Above into the competition anyway to the delight of Mayor Tony who hypes the entry in an effort to foster local interest. The contestants arrive with their glittering entourages. These include the infamous Raymond RobertsonBill Nighy with his unscrupulous assistant Louis Hugh Bonneville and his daughter ChristinaRachel Leigh Cook over from America on holiday.The hotel is full and Robertson is forced to lodge with a local sheep farmer. David Bradley Argus Filch of Harry Potter is terrific as Noah the dour farmer. He doesn't say much but shows his sense of humor over his dead relative's hairstyle and sympathy towards Christina for having a git like Ray as her father. Bill Nighy as Raymond Robertson is excellent. Arrogant ruthlessly competitive nothing is as important as victory including his daughter. Prior to the start of competition he simply cannot resist the temptation to visit Phil's shop and gloat over the fall from grace of his former rival. The meeting sparks a heated confrontation between Brian who witnessed the exchange and his father. Angry at Phil's handling of the situation and his refusal to enter and show Ray up Brian defies Phil and informs Shelley he will cut for her in the championship. Although pleased Shelley knows they still really don't stand a chance in the final part The Total Look without Phil. Although his legendary signature event Phil adamantly wants no part of it.That's enough synopsis to be going on with I think. Watch especially the subplots. Mayor Tony's hilarious transformation from pompous small town official into glittering event presenter. The rally of the townsfolk behind their local team. Brian's funeral fiasco. Christina's Technicolor sheep. The amazing Daisy in Evening Hair. Sandra and Phil in a bathtub on a hill. Rachel Griffiths performance as Shelley's lesbian lover Sandra is rich with detailed emotion. Her unresolved conflict with Phil her insecurity at being only the fcking girlfriend her reaction to the awful reality that the person she loves beyond reason is truly dying. And gloriously her radiant Total Look which has to be seen to be appreciated. Well. A little more in depth than I had planned but that's the overall feeling you get from Blow Dry. More than expected. More than planned. It works on so many levels. The lighthearted silliness of the British Hairdressing Competition of all things. The reunion of two childhood friends Brian and Christina who rediscover each other as attractive adults of the opposite sex. The study of a man who must come to terms with the lesbian lifestyle of his wife whom deep inside he still loves. And the moving portrait throughout it all of a dying woman's last attempt to recapture former glory and engineer the reconciliation of all those whom she most loves.Buy this film. Treasure it. And when somebody asks you how you felt after you've watched it you can honestly turn to them and say Never better love never better.".

	schema:headline " Great film with laughably misguided marketing.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film probably four or five times and I love it more each time. I sought out Blow Dry because I love Bill Nighy Alan Rickman and the late great Natasha Richardson ... but it took me ages to find the DVD because it had these two random American kids on the cover.I was puzzled because Richardson Rickman and Nighy had obviously been relegated to subplot which seemed incredible but I watched it anyway. In the event the marketing became only more baffling. I can only assume that the publicists played on Josh Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook for the American market but in doing so they must have put off an awful lot of people like me  and surely Richardson at least carried plenty of weight in the US? And Nighy and Rickman are hardly unknowns!Anyway now that I've found it in spite of the marketing people totally missing the point I can review it. Blow Dry is whimsical gentle and funny  and I mean that in the best possible way. It's a British comedy in the best tradition understated warm and centred solidly in the very ordinary lives of very ordinary people.Bill Nighy is predictably surreal and steals every scene he's in but handles his role as the devious dastardly but ultimately vulnerable and really quite likable villain of the piece very well. Alan Rickman struggles a little to portray his character's bitterness and hostility at first but as the character warms up he comes into his own. Given his character's back story it must have been something of a task both for Rickman and for the writers to avoid making him utterly pitiable but they managed it and Phil comes out the hero still hurting but beginning to move forward with life in totally nonpathetic fashion.The screen belongs though to Natasha Richardson. The relationship between Shelley played by Richardson and Sandra is brilliant totally convincing but not in any way more of an issue than it should be. There's a brief moment of surprise when you realise they're a couple but it's written and played so well that you very quickly accept it and it becomes simply part of the story. Richardson's balancing act between pathos and comedy is finelytuned and very admirable the fact that she's dying is never forgotten but neither is it allowed to overshadow the plot or stifle the comedy. For one of the best examples I have ever seen of good simple writing skilfully delivered watch Richardson's scene with the doctor in which her character learns she is terminal it should not be possible to be that sad and yet funny at the same time!My one complaint with this film is the casting of Josh Hartnett as Phil and Shelley's son Brian. Rachael Leigh Cook is nondescript and suffers from being on the same screen as Bill Nighy but at least they just let her be American even if she was a strange choice in the first place. Josh Hartnett meanwhile should never have been allowed anywhere near this film and all the linecutting in the world and you get the impression they cut as much as they could get away with can't prevent him from ruining what should have been some of the finest scenes in the film. The scene about halfway through in which Richardson's character reveals to Phil and Brian that she has cancer and is dying should have been a deeply moving showcase for the talents of Richardson and Rickman but the viewer is thrown completely out of the moment by Hartnett's utterly appalling trampling of the Yorkshire accent  which in spite of its awfulness still seems to have been absorbing enough to prevent him from actually acting at the same time.Aside from this utterly bewildering casting choice Blow Dry is a fantastic film  I could rave about it even longer but your time would be better spent just watching it.".

He has always been one of my favorites and I had not seen this one yet.In typical British movie comedy style they take a silly premise a British hairdressing competition in the small town of Keighley and build a story around it. Interestingly it also features two American actors the cast.Alan Rickman is Phil Allen who runs a haircutting shop with his son Josh Hartnett as Brian Allen. It seems some years earlier about 10 years his wife Natasha Richardson also now deceased much too young as Shelley Allen left them to be with her lesbian girlfriend Rachel Griffiths as Sandra and they run a shop together. Their story is complicated by Shelly being treated for cancer.The issue comes up that for either group to have a chance in the competition for their small town to compete they must figure out a way to work together. Phil has not spoken to either of them since the split he is still bitter but the son seems more willing to forgive and move on.Then pretty 20ish Rachael Leigh Cook another of my personal favorites shows up as Christina Robertson daughter of one of the men competing in the event. She lives in the USA with her mother but Brian remembers her from when they were very young and it seems he had a secret hope she would someday return. From that stems the budding love.This is a fun movie which has some serious messages embedded anyone who like the British style of humor should like this movie.".

It starts as a Mystery when Martha's husband commits suicide for unknown reasons and without leaving a note. We accompany Martha on her first days after the shock while she tries to backtrack his motives. She finds out that everything she thought she knew about him was untrue. His job his recent PhD his new assignment in Marseille that starts the story all prove to be lied. His professor who was said to have recommended him for his new assignment only remembers him from an exam three years ago. She even puts posters on bulletin boards around the institute where he was supposed to work but all tracks run dead. A full mystery remains. So far so good.During her research she meets Alexander working on the same institute as her late husband. He attracts her attention due to a specific gesture she thought familiar. She invites him home that same day and in her bed but he leaves. She follows him around attends his lectures and soon treats him as a substitute husband. Understandable but what happens next defies my logic. It starts when a former friend of Alexander points out a striking likeness between him and Martha's late husband as appearing on the posters distributed by Martha. A second interruption in my logic happened when Marseille turns up again this time as a new assignment for Alexander.All in all the first half of the film was brilliant especially due to Martha's acting when put through a broad collection of emotions while experiencing the change away from a seemingly happy couple via hearing of his suicide and later when researching for the truth. Scenes were kept relatively short but long enough to make clear what was going on. This kept the story line streaming letting us wonder all the time what would happen next.I love mysteries where the solution is not obvious upfront and where the development can scatter in any direction. This film seemed to be one in that category but then the logical flow broke on a few occasions. Maybe I did not pay attention and missed a few clues but the abrupt ending finished it for me. I could have given a very high score for the plot and the acting but I have to subtract many points for loosing my grip on the story. When this happens I blame the film makers and not primarily myself. In my opinion this could easily be avoided with some relatively minor changes. Pity for all the fine ingredients that were ready to be picked up.".

She meets him... But how? The circumstances are not clear given that she is looking for the traces of her husband at the School of Medicine and she runs into a professor of history.

	schema:reviewBody "ber uns das All or Above Us Only Sky is an 85minute movie from 2011 so this one is already over 5 years old. The writer and director is Jan Schomburg a relatively young filmmaker who had his 40th anniversary recently and who is mostly known for his collaborations with Maria Schrader. But in this film here the main character is played by Sandra Hller a young German actress who is making big waves now for her performance as the title character's daughter in the potential Oscar winner Toni Erdmann by Maren Ade. But back to this one here. It is the story of a woman who thinks she is in a seemingly good relationship but things take a turn for the worse totally surprising to her and her world crumbles quickly as a consequence. In her desperation she meets a lecturer who may help her out of her misery or get her even deeper inside. Watch for yourself.I personally enjoyed the watch here. While I am not always a fan of Hller's approach there is no denying she has a certain aura that makes her characters very watchable for sure. And she succeeds for quite a while because of that also in this film we have here. I think that the story gets a bit worse the longer the film runs especially when the second half begins and Friedrich enters the picture. But his performance again makes up for the flaws in the script and also the problems I had with his character which is why the film is a constantly convincing watch from start to finish. At easily under 90 minutes it is of course also pretty essential and there are hardly no pointless scenes at all. If you like the ending and how much will be an entirely subjective perception I'm sure. I thought it was okay but I did not like it as much as I hoped I would. Another strength about the film is its realism. Of course with the cast I never had a feeling I was watching actors but also the story feels pretty authentic because of the writing but also because the approach the actors gave it. It's a successful outcome and a nice little relationship drama movie carried forward by a strong Sandra Hller. I think you should check it out.".

The version I saw was entitled The Executors and ran for 100 minutes and as far as I'm aware it is the most complete edition of the film in circulation. Other editions include Sicilian Cross Gli Esecutori and Street People. Under any title it is not a good film..... in fact it is one of the worst examples of Italian profiteering movie making.The film is similar to The French Connection. It deals with drug peddlars in San Francisco. In order to smuggle their latest consignment in the US they have used a wooden crucifix sent as a gift to the Californian fishermen from the island of Sicily. This enrages the local godfather who sends his nephew Moore to catch the culprits. Moore enlists the aid of his harddriving buddy Stacy Keach and eventually tracks down the villains but the truth affects him more personally and emotively than he could have foreseen.The film is full of under developed moments. There's a great opportunity for a classic car chase but the sequence is badly editted and makes little sense. The final showdown could have packed a real wallop but it fizzles out without generating anything of note. The best scene involves Keach wrecking a car but even then it isn't a great scene... merely a mediocre scene in a movie full of bad scenes.Moore gives an OK performance and Keach is pretty good in his usual casual way. The foreign actors are embarrassingly dubbed and look foolish as a result. All in all this film is for Roger Moore completists onlyas anybody else will certainly find it a hard slog.".

Ulysses then teams up with his racecar driving buddy Charlie Keach. Charlie checks out all the seedy haunts and dives of San Francisco while Ulysses goes to Sicily for answers. When back together in SF all hell breaks loose as a series of double crosses and emotional flashbacks reveal the horrible truth.Maybe it's the presence of its two major stars but this mafia yarn is pretty restrained. It's not nearly as sleazyviolent as it could have been or should have been. It seems that in the wake of The French Connection 1971 and The Godfather 1972 among others all the many writers and directors involved in this project one of which was Ernest Tidyman of Shaft 1971 and French Connection fame tried to mash it all up and hoped Roger Moore would be the glue that held it all together. Sadly that plan was as halfbaked as the movie itself.Not to say that Street People is all that bad. There are some funny stereotypes an enjoyable 70's atmosphere nice San Francisco locations Roger Moore is charming as the half British half Sicilian cousin and Stacy Keach looks like he's having fun. Keach gets off some great dialogue not the least of which is I'm gonna spread the word that you're a turkey deluxe! Keach pretty much steals the show with his relaxed funloving performance. The highlight of the movie the car testdrive scene succeeds mainly because of him. There's an impressive car chase towards the end and some slowmotion emotional flashbacks with Bacalov's score at the climax of the film and presumably the directors were at the last minute aiming for a Sergio Leonelike experience. It would have been better if it was all more cohesive.Released by American International Pictures the original AIP in the U.S. and released on video here on Vestron Street People may be worth seeing for the chemistry of Moore and Keach or for people that have seen a lot of 70's drivein mafia flicks and want to see something else but for casual viewers it does leave something to be desired.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

About this I can say nothing but I can imagine that a bad dubbing can mess something or all here. Well the German Dubbing is very good both protagonists have the well known sync voices Roger Moore for example from his James Bond films. Both act as buddies and complement each other excellently just Keach's role brings loose the film excellently and humorously. The music is better than the beats from other Italian films of the 70s. Also the production and the existing budget is higher. I often read 'low budget film' but as mentioned before compare it to the standard Italian classic flick and not with an James Bond Production. The two auto action scenes are very well implemented also the filming sites was wellconsidered. Surely we have here no top film belonging to the IMDb Top 250 but in my opinion synonymous not the superfluous film which is only waste of time. It is a solid versatile action tiller who can be given a chance. In German its called Abrechnung in San Francisco meaning Last billing in SF which suits much better than Street People.

	schema:reviewBody "El Sabor de la venganza 1963 is perhaps the best of the PreLeone eurowesterns one of the best Spanish westerns and Joaquin Marchent's best western. Genre fans looking for something similar to the Dollar's films often overlook and underrate what is a very well made bwestern that foreshadows the later Gothic family westerns like El Pistolero dell'Ave Maria 1969.El Sabor de la venganza at first glance appears to have more in common with American westerns than later eurowesterns that it at first seems have been more completely translated by the filmmakers to their own historical and cultural perspectives. Ortolani's score is certainly based on American examples and is not nearly as inventive as that in other eurowesterns. Also though the movie doesn't have the same sly ironies that the genre is well known for it's sincere enjoyment and indulgence in western conventions is very much in line with the selfconsciousness of the genre. The long quasidocumentary rodeo sequence in the middle of the movie complete with a Rio Bravo 1959style cowboy song sung over it is a great example of this. This sequence following a well put together montage about the brothers each living their separate lives may annoy some viewers but I think that it provides a good bridge between the two halves of the movie streamlining and focusing attention on the pivotal moments in the plot.In terms of translations the dynamics of the family and the vendetta that arises out of the father's death are very interesting. Each of the three Walker brothers  Jeff Richard Harrison Chet Claudio Undari and Brad Miguel Palenzuela  follow divergent paths when seeking out revenge for the father's murder. One becomes a federal lawman another an outlaw and the oldest inherits the family ranch. The relationship between the brothers each motivated by the mother's pronouncement of vendetta seems to have an accent very foreign to the American genre. This is a Spanish family maybe derived from sometime in the past and not the typical film representation of a Anglo pioneer family. The extreme tensions and conflicting obligations motivated by an early tragedy were a dominant theme in later eurowesterns. There is always an element of confused identities either of protagonist or of the perpetrators. There is one effective scene in which Chet almost recreates the murder of his father with himself as the wouldbe murderer pointing to a violence and vengeance that could reproduce itself indefinitely. This view of revenge as a contagion turns up in other westerns by Spanish writers and directors such as Julio Buch's El Hombre que mat a Billy el Nio 1967. That movie ends with Billy's surrender of his guns followed by his assassination. Unlike the historical figure Garrett becomes that of a man trying to prevent the tragedy produced by a world of political oppression and corruption which pulled Billy into a spiral of violence from claiming more bewildered victims. This movie's finale can be understood in the same way with Jeff as the Garrett to ChetBilly. This movie brings to mind other vendetta westerns such as Robert Hossien's Une corde un Colt 1969 or Pasqule Squitieri's Vendetta  un piatto che si serve freddo 1971.The focus on the canons and dunes of Allmeria brings to mind very similar scenes from later movies as do the brilliant white Spanish pueblos against the deep blue of the sky.Finally the combinations of closeups and long shots is particularly effective giving what is otherwise a good bmovie a sense of scale that it otherwise would lack.Note I am reviewing the letterboxed subtitled version that played on SBS in Australia. I suspect that the poor quality that this movie has been released in the past explains the lack of interest in and appreciation of this movie.Top spaghetti western list httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849907Average SWs httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849889For fanatics only bottom of the barrel httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849890".

This movie brings to mind other vendetta westerns such as Robert Hossien's Une corde un Colt 1969 or Pasqule Squitieri's Vendetta  un piatto che si serve freddo 1971.The focus on the canons and dunes of Allmeria brings to mind very similar scenes from later movies as do the brilliant white Spanish pueblos against the deep blue of the sky.Finally the combinations of closeups and long shots is particularly effective giving what is otherwise a good bmovie a sense of scale that it otherwise would lack.Note I am reviewing the letterboxed subtitled version that played on SBS in Australia. I suspect that the poor quality that this movie has been released in the past explains the lack of interest in and appreciation of this movie.Top spaghetti western list httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849907Average SWs httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849889For fanatics only bottom of the barrel httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849890";

	schema:headline " One of the best and first Paella Western filmed in Spain with spectacular outdoors from Almeria";
	schema:reviewBody "Good Iberian Western well realized by the best Paella Western director  Joaquin Romero Marchent . A farmer family is attacked by a trio of outlaws and it results in father's murder . The mother Gloria Milland teaches his three children to carry out a relentless revenge . One time grownup the three unequal brothers Richard Harrison  Robert Hundar  Miguel Palenzuela seek revenge for the murder of their father . Each of them goes a divergent paths  Richard Harrison becomes a law enforcement  Robert Hundar turns into a gunslinger and Miguel Palenzuela as a good family father . They follow different ways when seeking out vendetta for the dad's killing . Enjoyable ChorizoSpaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation  it doesn't follow the Sergio Leone wake and being proceeded in American style . This interesting Iberian western contains a story full of vengeance  good dramatic pace and slick direction . This one has a historical interest  being the first shot in Almeria  subsequently there was filmed a lot of Westerns during the 60s and early 70s . This is a classical western before Leone's style  it is an ordinary example of American western though it is partly Spanish and partly Italian . Interesting screenplay by the same director and his brother Rafael Marchent  it results to be a trilling as well as very sad western with great fatalism . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  good feeling  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . It's an intelligent western with spectacular outdoors and breathtaking confrontation among protagonists  three different brothers  Richard Harrison  Robert Hundar and Miguel Palenzuela against the heartless enemies such as Jose Truchado  Luis Induni  Aldo Sambrell  and of course  the ordinary nasty Jose Luis Martin . Acceptable action sequences with spectacularly exciting shootouts along with rodeos and roundup . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious American Spaghetti actor Richard Harrison is good in his usual tough role  and Robert Hundar pseudonym of Claudio Undari a Sicilian actor specialized in western films is magnificent as his violent brother . Fantastic performance by the always great Fernando Sancho in a likable role  subsequently he would play similar characters  furthermore the slimy menacing outlaw played by Aldo Sambrell  here in his ordinary role as bandit and in a cruelly baddie character . There appears as secondaries the habitual in SpanishItalian Western such as Francisco Sanz  Rufino Ingls  Gaspar 'Indio' Gonzlez  Luis Induni  Rafael Vaquero  Emilio Rodriguez  Alfonso Rojas  Jose Riesgo and many others . Furthermore  Carlos Romero Marchent who always appears as a young secondary in films of his brothers Joaquin and Rafael Romero Marchent . The musician Riz Ortalani composes a nice soundtrack  well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it's full of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background and with agreeable leitmotif . Very nice cinematography  though being necessary a perfect remastering  filmed by cameraman Rafael Pacheco on locations in Tabernas and desert of Almeria  as usual  including good sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia who carried out the most Production Design on Western shot in Spain .The movie titled Three Ruthless Ones or Gunfight at High Noon or Sons of Vengeance or 3 Implacables was well produced by Centauro FilmsJoaquin Marchent and PEAAlberto Grimaldi  previously to produce his successful trilogy of dollarsSergio Leone . The motion picture was professionally directed and in traditional style by recently deceased Joaquin Luis Romero Marchent 19212012 at his best . He was an expert writer and director of good Western . His first film was El Coyote and the sequel titled Revenge of Coyote shot in Mexico . After that  he filmed The shadow of Zorro and Revenge of Zorro. He went go directing Western as  Riding to death   Adventures in the West  Three good men Sabor Venganza  and the most popular and violent Condenados a Vivir . Plus  he wrote for his brother Rafael Romero the followings Western  Manos Torpes Ocaso un Pistolero and Garringo . Rating  Above average  a nice Paella Western that has its entertaining moments.".

One of my first questions Who is that playing Mother Gin Sling? I know it is not Marlene Dietrich but who? Answer actress Ona Munson aka Belle Watling from Gone With The Wind. I NEVER would have guessed. All sorts of familiar faces showed up in familiar and not so familiar roles. Like the croupier from Casablanca presiding over a much more sinister roulette table. The visuals get you first. Images of a well of depravity leading to ruin and despair yet glamorous all the way. I liked the characterizations too. Walter Houston was excellent and believable as the straight businessman. Gene Tierney did an amazing transformation from decisive strong and elegant socialite to needy pathetically transparent and out of control young woman. Ona Munson played an impressive dragon lady. Victor Mature's gigolo was appropriately jaded and manipulative. It is a hypnotic and sensuous morality tale about the lure of sex gambling drugs alcohol and money and the danger of addiction to any of these to one's inner spirit. It also illustrates the high price of revenge especially misplaced revenge. A respectable film from the man who directed The Blue Angel.This film has an allure and a power that is hard to define.

	schema:headline " Certainly among the most beautiful films ever";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most beautiful films ever made. Von Sternberg had a strange and painterly way of composing a frame when he shot his films. In earlier films the scenes abounded in detail and often had layers that would stretch back into the distance or simply add complexity and a sense of the tumult of the living all around. In this film he seemed to change his focus to the glamorous portrait and brought to life some of the most stunning shots of actors I have ever seen.If you wish to see the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney at its height that this is the film to see it.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the most beautiful films ever made. Von Sternberg had a strange and painterly way of composing a frame when he shot his films. In earlier films the scenes abounded in detail and often had layers that would stretch back into the distance or simply add complexity and a sense of the tumult of the living all around. In this film he seemed to change his focus to the glamorous portrait and brought to life some of the most stunning shots of actors I have ever seen.If you wish to see the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney at its height that this is the film to see it. She's so willful and spoiled suggesting the nymphomaniac that nobody could suggest any other way thanks to the censorship. Everyone in the film seems to licking their lips in anticipation of some decadent delight that will be happening off screen.

We are introduced in a world of desperate corruption every sense of honesty or nobility is dead. It is typical that Mother Gin Sling's casino the den of every meanness is intended to be closed not for moral but for business reasons. There is a clever mixture of tragedy and grotesque. Ona Munson is extraordinary as Mother Gin Sling she apparently knows shameful secrets of the whole cosmopolitan mob which throngs her casino she has everyone into her claws. Her makeup and Chinese robes are magnificent her fixed cruel smile is really scaring. Victor Mature is great in the role of the indifferent overlazy Dr. Omar. He is probably blackmailed by Mother Gin Sling like any other character in the movie yet he seems to do evil just as an entertaining game just to win his bore not by coercion. Gene Tierney is Poppy the spoiled rich scornful girl just too apt to sink in a pit of corruption with no possible coming back. A due remark we are always so stunned by Gene's incredible beauty that we find it difficult to realize her great talent. Here at the age of twentyone she gives a fully mature performance. Also Walter Huston and all the supporting actors make beautiful jobs. Actually the acting is always on the verge of grotesque this is clearly an artistic choice by von Sternberg. If we can find a fault in The Shanghai Gesture is that the finale is a bit abrupt. Nonetheless it is a great film deservedly a cultmovie in the history of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Mother' Gin Sling Ona Munson runs a very successful gambling house in Shanghai. Through her doors pass a wide variety of individuals from every exotic corner of the globe. One such individual is a spoiled young woman who goes by the name of Smith Gene Tierney with a penchant for gambling and drink. It's not long before Smith is up to her eyeballs in IOUs and well on her way to becoming a complete lush. Coinciding with these events a wealthy man named Sir Charteris Walter Huston arrives in Shanghai. Part of his business deal involves the land that 'Mother' Gin Sling's establishment sits on. 'Mother' Gin Sling believes she may have previously met Sir Charteris but under a different name and in far different circumstances. To save her business 'Mother' Gin Sling puts two and two together to connect Smith with Sir Charteris and lets the chips fall where they may.Many of the people who care about and enjoy older films like The Shanghai Gesture will no doubt pickup the film because of Gene Tierney  the biggest star in the cast. But they'll quickly discover that The Shanghai Gesture is so much more than Tierney. The movie features a wonderful ensemble cast playing a group of highly eccentric characters. To begin with there's Ona Munson as 'Mother' Gin Sling. Maybe it's the costuming and maybe it's the attitude but I bought her performance. Next there's Victor Mature as Dr. Omar the Arab gigolo. He's the kind of fellow best described as slimy. Two of my favorite characters in The Shanghai Gesture are Eric Blore as Ceasar the English bookkeeper to 'Mother' Gin Sling and Clyde Filmore as 'Mother' Gin Sling's flunky Percival Montgomery Howe. Mix in an American showgirl a Russian barkeeper a rickshaw driver of questionable origin and about a halfdozen others and you've got quite an eclectic and entertaining group of actors and characters.As much fun as the people in the film are at its core The Shanghai Gesture is a terribly tragic and sad story. Most of the people who come to 'Mother' Gin Sling's place do so because they have to not because they want to. Whether it's Smith looking for her next gambling fix or those who do her bidding like Dixe the American showgirl they come because 'Mother' Gin Sling holds something over their heads. Nobody seems to really want to be there. Deep down most of these people seem miserable. The ending of The Shanghai Gesture takes the bleakness from just beneath the surface and thrusts it into the light of day. I won't give it away but I will say that there are no winners in The Shanghai Gesture. Everyone comes out a loser.Finally one of the most impressive aspects of The Shanghai Gesture is the set design. Instead of a seedy backalley sort of gambling joint 'Mother' Gin Sling's place is like an Art Deco shrine. I'm continually amazed at the care and money that went into these sets found in films from the 30s and 40s. Today much of it would be done with computer effects. So when I see something like the fourstory circular gambling house in The Shanghai Gesture I can't help be amazed.".

Here is a story full of clichs about the East and about the decadence of Shanghai in particular. Part of the fun of watching this film is trying to guess what was left out. There was a Broadway version of Shanghai Gesture in the 1920s and the protagonist's name in the play Mother Goddamn is so wonderfully evocative of her character. The film's Mother Gin Sling doesn't tell her backstory in the same way.It's obvious that Victor Mature's character is giving Gene Tierney's character more than sex and booze. He is one of those doctors who is an easy source of drugs to the idle rich. Although I think Mature is somewhat miscast as the insidious Persian physician too robust too American he does well and those supercilious smoldering looks he gives are entirely appropriate to the situation. Gene Tierney gives a noholdsbarred performance as the girl gone wrong a spoiled rude petulant baby who is in sharp contrast to the socalled floozy of the story who is by far her superior in every way except economically.Ona Munson is wonderful as the amoral Mother Gin Sling. Actually the first time I saw the film I missed the beginning and I thought the character was being played by Gloria Swanson. I suppose Swanson could have done it equally as well but probably would have turned down such an unsavory role.My favorite character is Mike Mazurki as Mother Gin Sling's strongman. Mazurki was a sometime wrestleractor who usually played big dumb gangsters or big dumb policemen. He is very good here as the menacing presence and looks strong and manly without a shirt and no doubt without Pilates.A totally involving window onto how people thought about each other in the past.".

	schema:reviewBody "This masterwork  unleashed on a bewildered American public shortly after Pearl Harbor  is without doubt one of the most lurid corrupt and depraved motion pictures ever produced in Old Hollywood  and there is not a curse word or a nude scene to be found! This movie seems to exude a hallucinatory atmosphere reeking of opium smoke stained silk and halffinished cocktails. You will literally not believe what you are seeing  and that's not a bad thing. An independent production THE SHANGHAI GESTURE took over 15 years to make it from Broadway to the big screen. The hit play's themes of sexual depravity prostitution greed and drug addiction of course could not be presented in a direct fashion due to the Production Code and various scripts kicked around for a decade before Austrian producer Arnold Pressburger acquired the rights and hired his friend Josef Von Sternberg to direct. A legend thanks to his discovery of Marlene Dietrich the fabled director of THE BLUE ANGEL had fallen on hard times by 1940  he had not completed a film in several years had suffered a nervous breakdown and had expended the bulk of his fortune to help about 30 members of his extended family flee the Third Reich for Switzerland. Sternberg's autocratic mannerisms and insistence on absolute control did nothing to make him more employable. THE SHANGHAI GESTURE was to be Sternberg's last major Hollywood production. The budget for this film was far less than what he had once enjoyed at Paramount but despite this limitation Sternberg infuses every frame with his unique look as well as giving us one of the most astonishing crane shots in the history of the cinema. This film also contains some of the most gorgeous closeups ever and the massive casino set is justly revered. This is a movie you watch in blackandwhite but remember in color  it is THAT beautiful note the review below where the writer discusses the gold mirrored screens and black lacquer of Mother's dining room. The plot revolves around the degradation of Victoria Charteris aka Poppy Smith at the hands of the sinister Mother Gin Sling owner of the most luxurious gambling den in Shanghai. Mother seeks to destroy Poppy as vengeance against Poppy's father Sir Guy who has ordered the closure of Mother's casino but in the end she gets more than she bargained for...A very young and celestially beautiful Gene Tierney handles Poppy's transformation from sophisticated femme du monde to coarse drunken slut with aplomb while Ona Munson turns in the performance of her life as Mother. Kudos also must go to Victor Mature who reeks of sleaze and sex as his Dr. Omar leads Poppy down the primrose path...To those who decry this film as racist please bear in mind that Sternberg had traveled frequently in East Asia in the 1930s was a connoisseur of Chinese art and knew exactly what he was doing. This movie depicts a pleasure and moneymad European colonial society in a state of total moral bankruptcy a world on the verge of complete collapse from its own inner rot and decay and it cannot be a coincidence that European colonialism in Asia was destroyed by the Japanese within weeks of this film's release. Sternberg is very careful to depict the colonials as the racist ignorant fools that they for the most part were note the scene where the etiolated casino moneycounter uses pidgin despite the fact that the Chinese man to whom he speaks is obviously fluent in the King's English and in Shanghai corruption is a way of life for all regardless of race or nationality. This film is in fact a tale of revenge against the European occupier and his exploitations. Sternberg was a master of indirection and implication and every line here has two and sometimes three meanings. You will find it very hard to believe that this was actually made in 1941 and you will wonder how it got past the censors. Years ahead of its time this should be considered the first true noir and deserves to be much more widely known than it is. A dreamlike masterwork like nothing you have ever seen you will not be able to stop watching this once you begin. Remember Mother Gin Sling's casino never closes...".

	schema:headline " Exotic decadence of original toned down by censors but still great fun";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1941 Von Sternberg movie is a real curiosity. The outlandish characters and perverse storyline of the original 1920's Broadway play could never have been filmed in Hollywood at the time. But the movie has a strange dreamlike atmosphere that fascinates in its own right.Ona Munson as Mother Gin Sling has a grand imperious manner and a sly wicked grin that suggests colorful depths of depravity. There are a couple of scenes where her makeup and hair remind one of Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily Munster with the same mix of beauty and creepiness. Phyllis Brooks is great as a hardboiled chorus girl with a manner that suggests Mae West. The star performers are Gene Tierney as the spoiled brat daughter of British businessman Walter Huston and the sleazy predatory pimplike Doctor Omar played by Victor Mature.The teasing innuendoladen conversation between them at the bar has a strange quality that verges on camp and yet is surprisingly sexual. There is a dreamy balletlike quality to the sequence where two of her admirers seem to literally pirouette away from her as the lascivious Mature moves in on her. The tone of the film ranges between a kind of selfmockery and winking at the audience to pure melodrama. The long uncomfortable scene of the Chinese New Year dinner party builds to a level of intensity that is riveting. Mother Gin Sling holds her guests and the audience spellbound with her impassioned speech about her past life of prostitution and degradation. This scene rises above any possible campiness to a level of such emotional power that one cannot help but be caught up in it. Her speech and her guests' reactions to it transcend the melodrama to something verging on genuine tragedy. This is a strange compelling film that deserves to be seen by more viewers. It has a peculiar atmosphere all its own something absolutely unique in American movies. The sets the bizarre supporting characters the wild music the offbeat and unexpected humor the powerful undercurrents of sexuality that keep coming through in spite of Hayes office censorship all add up to an unforgettable haunting movie. See it as camp if you must but see it.".

Filmed just before Pearl Harbour attack that may have spoiled the public's liking of Oriental themes that year.Digitally restored will save it for the future decor lighting music and art direction. Bravo.I noticed how there are dramatic pauses facial expressions and reactions that are thoughtfully used instead of using dialog. That's expensive as film is flying thru the camera. Yet it creates its own dramatic tension that is beyond mere words. Silent film technique using the eyes shadowed faces long interludes of feelings before your senses.Munson is the star and when she enters the Casino scene for the first time the music announces her exotic power presence and mystery. God whose THAT WOMAN? What an entrance. She is not a person she is a Goddess a Creature from another world. Let's talk about making this film into a Broadway Musical get Sondheim to write the music and words? It could happen...haThe costumes the music the lighting the camera movement the sets all grab you by the throat and pull you in deep. Spellbound?The set was up for an Oscar and you can understand why. In 1941 cameras like in Citizen Kane never moved like that before say like the long shot when you come down from the Chandlelers into the center pit of the Casino. It is an unbroken long pan for the camera. Rare.Mother Gin Sling's dinning room with the gold figured screens the black Chinese table and chairs the entrance opens within the screens and makes a grand entrance for all the guests waiters etc. This film is great with Chinese food and Green tea chop chop...Poppy's lipstick changes from dark perfect mask to the dinning room scene where the lipstick is transparent perhaps metallic gold to match the gown but I noticed the change.Wondered why the mouth was focused differently? Poppy looked more Oriental in the dinning room scene reflective of her mother's likeness.Munson was perfect though sometimes I heard a MidWestern twang in her voice like a Truck Stop Hash Joint waitress.Exotic makeup was fabulous and her gowns were extremely well designed and enveloped her with POWER. Why Mother kills the daughter I don't understand? Was it an accident or did Mother Gin Sling want to kill her?An accident I can live with out right murder seems misplaced. Dad perhaps should have been shot. Huston and Munson played well with each other and their emotional debts were resolved. And then.... Mother Gin Sling seems truly surprised that Poppy is her daughter and takes responsibility for handling the daughter problem. I was left with the idea that Huston would help Mother Gin Sling to get out of trouble with his money and status. Who knows they might even get back together.Legally they are STILL MARRIED by the way and with the ChinaTown like politics it could come out well for all involved. I liked Mother Gin Sling and wanted her to not be charged for murder. Maybe they could make a sequel ha.I trade in the weaknesses of others she says.This was probably made as a B picture and yet the production was first class and over the top. Well directed but over produced the critics might say. But Hell it was fun any way right?It worked for me and I was so pleased to see it tonight on TCM. I taped it and I am glad it made it onto DVD.They must have had fun making this film. Again I come back to the sets as the main focus of the film. The actors needed such a set up to play out their stories. Bravo Von Sternberg. VSS".

	schema:reviewBody "More weird than exotic it's like waking up and finding Ming The Merciless in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Then too Mother Gin Sling's head should be featured in Architectural Digest since it resembles nothing less than the Manhattan skyline. And how wacky is it finding all those central European types hiding out in Shanghai as Chinese of one racial blend or another. No wonder the Chinese consulate complained. Only wacko Hollywood could turn a semipornographic play into a trip to bizarroland and put a visual artist like von Sternberg in charge.For example catch that great opening boomshot of the casino interior where patrons swarm like bees over a hive. Or the surging street crowds that seem to suck the life out of the very air. I think Sternberg could take an empty room and make it visually interesting. No doubt about it the Austrian director lifts the eye at the same time he depresses the brain. What the heck for example did he tell Gene Tierney that turned her from a Miss Manners in one scene into a raging nympho the next. I guess that was supposed to be because of Victor Mature's overwhelming magnetism even though he lounges around like a wellfed garden slug. No doubt about it the celebrated director preferred postures to people.Still where else could a passing stranger buy a girlinabasket instead of the usual chicken. That scene alone is worth all the other nuttiness like telling us the girls are just pretend. Yeah sure. I'll bet the Chinese consulate didn't think so. Even so you can't blame the screenplay for having more holes than grandma's sieve. This is incendiary material for the Production Code 40's brothels hookers opium dens babies out of wedlock.

	onyx:emotionText "More weird than exotic it's like waking up and finding Ming The Merciless in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Then too Mother Gin Sling's head should be featured in Architectural Digest since it resembles nothing less than the Manhattan skyline. And how wacky is it finding all those central European types hiding out in Shanghai as Chinese of one racial blend or another. No wonder the Chinese consulate complained. Only wacko Hollywood could turn a semipornographic play into a trip to bizarroland and put a visual artist like von Sternberg in charge.For example catch that great opening boomshot of the casino interior where patrons swarm like bees over a hive. Or the surging street crowds that seem to suck the life out of the very air. I think Sternberg could take an empty room and make it visually interesting. No doubt about it the Austrian director lifts the eye at the same time he depresses the brain. What the heck for example did he tell Gene Tierney that turned her from a Miss Manners in one scene into a raging nympho the next. I guess that was supposed to be because of Victor Mature's overwhelming magnetism even though he lounges around like a wellfed garden slug. No doubt about it the celebrated director preferred postures to people.Still where else could a passing stranger buy a girlinabasket instead of the usual chicken. That scene alone is worth all the other nuttiness like telling us the girls are just pretend. Yeah sure. I'll bet the Chinese consulate didn't think so. Even so you can't blame the screenplay for having more holes than grandma's sieve. This is incendiary material for the Production Code 40's brothels hookers opium dens babies out of wedlock. How else could enterprising producers get this on screen without a trip to bizzaroland. The straight laced Walter Huston must have thought he'd wandered into the wrong sound stage.Any way you cut it it's a weird oneofakind half camp half brilliance so don't miss it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Odd flowers come to mind. The Shanghai Gesture seems like another of Josef von Sternberg's ripely fetid orchids fascinating to observe but which can leave a nasty smell in your nose if you take a sniff. No perhaps it's like a pitcher plant from the Discovery Channel cut open so we can watch a fly slide down into a sweet smelling pool of liquid and then be slowly digested while it struggles for life. Wow that purple prose is almost as good as some of what von Sternberg comes up with. He might have been a master of mise en scene whatever that catchall phrase may mean but his movies can be so ripe lush and oblivious to what makes a good movie that in some perverse way at least a handful of his films are still interesting. The Scarlet Empress for example is so over the top with such a sly and amusingly lewd performance by Marlene Dietrich that even Criterion has blessed it. The Shanghai Gesture is not all that good but it is so seriously fervid so stuffed with oozing melodrama and contains so many fascinating performances some excellent and some not that the movie just keeps striding through its 99 minutes. We're in Shanghai in the International Settlement. Mother Gin Sling a dragon lady who rose from poverty and enslaved prostitution now owns the most elegant the largest and the richest casino in town. She's a powerful woman. She knows everything that needs knowing about the important foreign men in Shanghai who come to be flattered and gamble at her establishment. She knows quite a bit about their wives too. Sir Guy Charteris however who is new to Shanghai is buying up property to turn into a rich new development and that will include Mother Gin Sling's establishment. Charteris has a lovely young daughter just out of finishing school. She's beautiful impulsive spoiled and is used to her father's money. She loves the idea of dark thrills. She's soon to become a pawn between Mother Gin Sling and Charteris who doesn't realize that long ago the young Chinese girl he married and lost was...yes Mother Gin Sling. 'Mother' will get her revenge on this man all right but Charteris has a secret of his own. You'll never guess of course. It all comes together at an elegant Chinese New Year's dinner party hosted by 'Mother' with firecrackers going off outside in the streets girls in basket cages hoisted up outside her window to be bid on by eager rickshaw drivers and cold revenge served up as the main course The quality of the movie is as variable as the acting. Walter Huston as Charteris is excellent. He was a commanding actor and always interesting to watch. He might be remembered by most nowadays as the old coot Howard smarter than them all in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre but watch him in Dodsworth. As Sam Dodsworth he's touching and unforgettable. Ona Munson as the vengeancedriven hardened Mother Gin Sling however is just caricature. At times her line reading sounds like Mae West was playing the part. Sternberg gives her a lacquered hairdo that would make Medusa envious. As the smooth Doctor Omar one of Mother Gin Sling's many corrupt employees Victor Mature does a surprisingly good job. With his fleshy lips sleepy eyes and wearing evening clothes he looks the part. He has to contend with some silly lines to say a ridiculous fez to wear and what appears to be a silk bed sheet tossed around his shoulders. Gene Tierney beautiful carefully photographed stunning to see simply can't act. She manages as the spoiled Victoria Charteris but as the corrupted Poppy Smith even when she's trying her best she just can't handle the part. The secondary actors range from awkward obvious portrayals to the fine work of Eric Blore as a genuinely offensive sycophant who belongs to 'Mother' Albert Basserman as an aged and worldly commissioner and Mike Mazurki as a big big Chinese coolee who does with sullen pleasure what 'Mother' tells him to. To give some sympathy to Sternberg the Hollywood Code required him to make Victoria's downfall the result of being led by Doctor Omar to gambling and liquor. This makes her degradation at the hands of Mother Gin Sling seem a little lightweight. In the play of course Omar led her to sex and opium. Still you can't beat the last scene in the movie. The secrets have been exposed a shooting has taken place the 'best' people in Shanghai have fled 'Mother's' party and the fireworks are exploding. Amidst all this the sweaty barechested Mazurki turns to Sir Guy as they stand in the crowded street and asks Likee Chinee New Year?".

And in the few cases where there are Asian main characters they are clearly played by American actorssuch as Ona Munson in completely ridiculous garb and Mike Mazurki! This WAS the norm for the 1930s and 40sand even continued into the 50s and 60s with Tony Randall and 6'7 Christopher Lee of all people playing Chinese men...how this sort of casting was never a major issue is beyond meit certainly would not be acceptable to have white actors playing black characters. Plus there were some fine Asian actors that would have loved the work! In addition to this bizarro casting wasn't enough Victor Mature plays a guy who sports a fez and capeand is called 'Omar'! Wowonly in Hollywood!It's pretty obvious that this film was originally a play as just about everything occurs in a gambling den in Shanghai. The way scenes are presented has this stagy feel. But the original play was MUCH more racy and tons of the plot needed to be changed to meet the demands of the Production Code. For instance in the play the setting was a brothel! So they had to sanitize the script in order to get approval to show this movie in American theaters.If you think about it this setting is very much like 1942's Casablancaittoo is set in a gambling den and bar. Its patrons are very multinational and there is a strong undercurrent of vice. But there is a style dialog and a great ensemble cast in Casablanca that puts it in a completely different league than The Shanghai Gesture. The film finds Tierney in the gambling den and the seemingly nice Mature prods her to try her hand at gambling. At first she wins big and wants to cash in her chips and leave but he convinces her to continue. Not only does she lose all her money and jewelry but has been extended lots of creditand there appears to be no way she can ever repay the loans. Obviously Mature has pushed her into this situation so that she will owe her soul and body to the proprietress 'Mother Gin Sling' Munson. And yet oddly Tierney throws herself at Mature! What a dummy!Later after throwing a ridiculous tempertantrum Tierney goes to see her fatherthe man who thinks he's going to shut down the 'gambling house' and deport its owner. Now however Tierney's debt makes this seem doubtful. How all this is worked out at a kooky dinner party is something you can find out for yourself...if you really care! Frankly I stopped caring only about halfway through this silly film.Now let's talk about Mother Gin Sling. I probably am not allowed to use the name the play originally used for herIMDb doesn't allow swearing in the reviews. You really have to see her to believe itshe looks like something out of a scifi filmlike the original Flash Gordon or The Fifth Element! Her hair and silly makeup just have to be seen to believed. And she looks laughable...and about as Asian as a taco! As for Tierney this film is early in her career so I guess we can't blame her too much for her bad acting particulary at around the 60 minute markreally really bad acting. She goes from a cool and sexy lady to a totally annoying child who makes you want to backhand hershe was THAT annoying and her performance that shallow! Frankly it was embarrassing to watch her and I am amazed that I was able to keep watching...though I am a glutton for punishment!To put it bluntly a pretty stupid film without a lot to recommend it. Perhaps the big confrontation scene between Munson and Walter Huston might provide some decent entertainment...but I doubt it.".

The 100 minutes unfolded like a druginduced haze the alluring scent of an opiate hanging thickly in the air. Somehow the film's plot  whatever it may have been about  seemed totally and utterly inconsequential with director Josef von Sternberg placing additional almost superfluous importance on the development of mood. Indeed aside from atmosphere there's little else to keep you watching the film the characters are sleazy and grotesque the sort you'd expect to find at a seedy casino its employees imbued with the mock dignity of one who deals exclusively in exploiting the weaknesses of lesser men. A good cast  Walter Huston Gene Tierney Victor Mature Eric Blore  is not exactly wasted on such poorlydeveloped characters but one gets the sense that even they are not exactly sure what they're doing in this place. But if the film is a failure then it's a genuinely fascinating one.'Mother' Gin Sling Ona Munson in unflattering Oriental makeup is the mysterious and ruthless owner of a Shanghai casino where desperate men come night or day to gamble their lives and fortunes. Employee Doctor Omar Victor Mature does his best to charm the beautiful girls who come his way in one night snagging both smarttalking American Dixie Phyllis Brooks and conceited richgirl Poppy Gene Tierney. When threatened with closure by wealthy entrepreneur Sir Guy Charteris Walter Huston Gin Sling springs into action using her enormous influence to rebuff the challenge. 'The Shanghai Gesture' is sometimes categorised as film noir. Certainly other noir pictures like 'Macao 1952' which Josef von Sternberg directed until he was replaced by Nicholas Ray utilised a similarly exotic Asian setting so the nonAmerican locale doesn't immediately preclude it from consideration. In some ways it fits the bill every character in the film has a weakness  something to hide  through which they can be manipulated a shady past that has come back to haunt them.Despite being restricted by the provisions of the Production Code 'The Shanghai Gesture' is one of the sleaziest films of its era leaving a bitter uneasy taste in the mouth despite impeccable production values. Hollywood's interpretation of Eastern cultural values was evidently unflattering and every Asian character is utterly devoid of morals with particularly prominence given to the proudly misogynistic attitudes of one Chinese employee who likes to brag of his polygyny. A shocking history of sex slavery is exposed with New Year's Eve guests treated to a recreation of these ghastly practices or at least we're told that it is merely a recreation. But it isn't only the Chinese whose immorality is exposed and even the seemingly upright Sir Guy betrays a suspect past doomed finally to suffer for his alleged sins. Walter Huston is excellent as always bringing conviction to a film in which everybody else seems uncertain of their roles. Gene Tierney perhaps her most ravishing performance outside 'Laura 1944' isn't particularly convincing but her falseness does strangely work given the desperate phoniness of her character.".

This extravagant unhinged twisted and sometimes terrible film is my Guilty Pleasure a confession I honor by giving it a higher rating than it probably deserves. When this bizarre film was made Hollywood still under the yoke of a stringent production code could not tackle many taboo subjects and thus director Josef Von Sternberg could only hint at them. The brothel for instance where the original Broadway play was set becomes a gambling den although girls in bamboo cages are dangled outside! Any hints of drug use were forbidden so Gene Tierney's opiumaddled spoiled monster of a daughter is named Poppy as in Opium and the owner of the casino formerly Mother GD is now called Mother Gin Sling...and so on. Most of America was flocking to see Mickey Rooney in The Hardy Family series a happy product from MGM. Shanghai Gesture is hardly mainstream.This strange film was not made at a major studio but produced by Arnold Pressburger who did manage to sign an amazing assemblage of major character actors to enact a plot of ultimate revenge. There's Victor Mature hiding in his capacious burnoose sleazy in a fez playing Dr. Omar seducer of the innocent or Ona Munson remembered by some viewers as goodhearted bordello gal Belle Watling in Gone With The Wind sporting a series of Hollywood's most outrageous wigs. And there's Walter Huston with a gimpy arm and even acting instructor Maria Ouspenskaya wordless as The Amah.The sets alone are worth the viewing from the initial shot of Madame Gin Sling's gambling den a Deco vortex of gambling activity sucking you into an absurd plot loaded with illogical coincidence. This frenzied Asian Fantasy which has little to do with reality and everything to do with OutOfControl Style can be great fun and is sometimes admirable for the right reasons. You likee Chinee New Year? says Mike Mazurki usually seen in films as a twobit gangster here a shirtless bouncer who has seldom been better! One caveat Criterion needs to get their hands on this one and turn out a decent printthe DVD quality is at best mediocre! But I want my Shanghai Gesture anyway!".

There's Victor Mature hiding in his capacious burnoose sleazy in a fez playing Dr. Omar seducer of the innocent or Ona Munson remembered by some viewers as goodhearted bordello gal Belle Watling in Gone With The Wind sporting a series of Hollywood's most outrageous wigs. And there's Walter Huston with a gimpy arm and even acting instructor Maria Ouspenskaya wordless as The Amah.The sets alone are worth the viewing from the initial shot of Madame Gin Sling's gambling den a Deco vortex of gambling activity sucking you into an absurd plot loaded with illogical coincidence. This frenzied Asian Fantasy which has little to do with reality and everything to do with OutOfControl Style can be great fun and is sometimes admirable for the right reasons. You likee Chinee New Year? says Mike Mazurki usually seen in films as a twobit gangster here a shirtless bouncer who has seldom been better! One caveat Criterion needs to get their hands on this one and turn out a decent printthe DVD quality is at best mediocre! But I want my Shanghai Gesture anyway!";

Several parts of the film simply just do not make coherent sense and von Sternberg as has been noted by film critic Tony Rayns seems to be more interested in the luxurious set of the casino and trying to make Tierney look as beautiful as possible with the aid of his marvellous cinematographer Paul Ivano anyway rather than tell a exciting good story. The actors under the circumstances perform remarkably well Victor Mature playing an Arab is as preposterous as John Wayne as Genghis Kahn but it works unbelievably though it may seem and gives the best performance of the motion picture. The young Gene Tierney while not at the height of her acting prowess yet is still vivid and Walter Huston likewise not in his finest surrounds gives a solid piece of acting and a host of well know faces pop up through at the movie Maria Ouspenskaya Eric Blore and Mike Mazurki all make appearances. An over blown delight like Duel in the Sun 1946 which von Sternberg also had an uncredited hand in that is so fun despite or because of its flaws it is truly one of a kind.".

Some of the witty dialogue is absolutely priceless. I'm not familiar with the writings of Gogol who wrote the original story of Viy but if you're a fan of Tolstoy's short stories The Imp and the Crust or Guy de Maupassant The Devil or maybe the lighter side of Poe Never Bet the Devil Your Head then this'll be right up your alley.And of course it'll scare the socks off your arse.The camera illusions in this movie are absolutely 1st class. Don't be put off by the fact that it had a low budget by Hollywood standards. The minimalist approach really brought out the director's creativity in this case. Like an old 1940s Jean Cocteau film the special effects are timeless in their simplicity and they will hold up for the next 50 years long after CGI has gone the way of the dodo and not a moment too soon.".

The scenery is both sumptuous and foreboding so good in fact that you wish you were there. The film is lovingly shot and the special effects are certainly aboveaverage with Aleksandr Ptushko'salso director of some of the best Russian fantasy films seen by me style all over them. Another outstanding element is the music it sets the atmosphere of the film brilliantly at times lyrical and others surreal. Some have remarked about the influence of composers like Mussorgsky Prokoviev and Rachmaninov and it's definitely there the scoring of the creepy and surreal moments in particular have a very Mussorgskylike wonderful weirdness. The dialogue is witty and thoughtprovoking the Tolstoy and Poe comparisons remarked in a previous review are apt as well. The story engages throughout the fantasy gives a real sense of wonder the sense of adventure is exciting at least and the horror elements are appropriately creepy and unsettling. The characters are ones you have seen before but they really help to carry the film fit in the atmosphere very well have personality and all serve a point in some way to the story. All the characters are enthusiastically performed sometimes with a tendency to be a tad overtheatrical but this is not uncommon for RussianSoviet fantasy and especially from the 60s and it doesn't hurt things in any shape or form. To conclude Viy is excellent and well worth watching if not quite a personal favourite. 810 Bethany Cox".

Don't believe it unless you are one of those who rate movie horror by the numbers of mutilations and amounts of blood.Based on a little known and lesser story by Nikolai Gogol the film actually improves the original with effectively creepy music where appropriate and with special effects that were very good for a movie made nearly forty years ago. The carefully faithful adaptation concerns a seminary student on holiday who is propositioned by a hag who turns out to be a witch. She rides him through the air like a broomstick and when they land he beats her off with a club only to discover that near death she has transformed into a beautiful young woman the daughter of a Cossack chieftain. Her father sends to the seminary for the student because his daughter requested that only he be summoned to read the prayer for the dead three consecutive nights over her corpse. What happens in the locked chapel until dawn during those nights is what the story is about.It is as scary as most of the Hammer films of the same era only with Gogol's trademark senseofhumor. Hammer would have made the witch more grotesque and the young dead woman sexier. The only letdown is that Viy's appearance at the end of the movie is not very scary and even somewhat comical. But he's only on screen a few seconds. The creatures that crawl out of the walls ahead of Viy are as grotesque as anything to be found in films of that time and make the leadup to Viy's arrival very suspenseful".

	schema:reviewBody "Viy is based on the same story written by Nikolai Gogol that inspired Mario Bava's masterpiece Black Sunday. While the films have some similarities for example a witch and a fairytale atmosphere the two really aren't much alike. Black Sunday went more for the straight horror and was a better film for it. Viy is more of a religious themed film and the witch plot line offers more in the way of the faith of the lead character than actual horror. The film has a massive amount of cult value mostly due to the fact that it's not much like any other movie in terms of its style. The music and atmosphere combine to give it an otherworldly feel and this helps massively where the plot is concerned. The basis of the film follows a man of God who must spend three days and three nights presiding over the corpse of a young girl who also happens to be the local witch. Being dead isn't much of a hindrance to the witch as she bombards our hero with black magic. With only his faith to protect him will he be able to last three nights with her corpse? The first half of the movie is really rather dull as not a lot happens and it seems to mostly be a setup for the latter section. The plot does pick up as the film goes on but the film is never massively engaging and that is its main downfall. However the cinematography is great and Viy has a very vibrant feel throughout. Black Sunday had a similar vibrant feel and this film gives the viewer an idea of what Bava's film might have looked like in colour. The scenes that take place inside the church are the movie's main strongpoint thus making it a shame that there aren't more of them. These scenes look great and brilliantly offset the gentle tone of the rest of the film. The climax delivers the best part of the movie and the special effects there while obviously cheap look stunning and brilliantly suit the style of the film. Russia isn't very well known for its film industry and this was one of the first horror films produced in the Soviet Union. Modern flick Night Watch has given the Russian film industry a new lease of life recently and this film like most other classics is set for a remake. Oh well...I recommend Viy mainly to fans of arthouse cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vij is a masterpiece of Russian cinema and a masterpiece of 60s horror. Having said that it is perhaps a film that may not appeal to the gorehound variety of horror fan. Not only does it not possess any gore but it plays for much of its length like a bucolic Russian fairy tale. The scary scenes when they come are in the last 20 minutes or so. What makes Vij so wonderful are the lovingly shot scenes of rural Russia. The faces of all the peasants are shown in frequent closeup ruddy jovial deeply lined with characterful wrinkles bluegray eyes twinkling. The camera is used to great effect in closeups blurry shots spinning around our hero zooming in and out and those loving shots of farm houses and livestock. It often has a dreamlike character and certain supernatural scenes are extremely surreal and effective. The blend of lighthearted comedy and echoes of folklore and a nearreligiosity at times is also extremely effective. The lead does an excellent job as Khoma and his cohort of minders are equally good. Our deceased witch is a picture of beauty and reminds one of Snow White such is her rosycheeked fairytale beauty.I could go on and on about what makes this film so wonderful. I'll suffice to comment on one more feature. The music by Karen Khatchaturian nephew of the great Aram Khatchaturian he of the Sabre Dance and the Onedin Line theme music is very effective and draws on the sounds of several other Russian greats. One reviewer here mentioned both Prokofiev and Rachmaninov. I thought the exact same thing in the same scenes. There is an overall Prokofevian sound to the music and the choral numbers bring to mind Rachmaninov's AllNight Vigil most likely intentionally. The music in the demon scenes draws on Mussorgsky's Nite on Bald Mountain with its eerie string scratchings again most likely intentionally. These are wonderful and evocative sources for Khatchaturian to draw from.In summation this is a cinematic masterpiece and is a must for fans of Russian cinema or classic cinema in general. Horror fans who can enjoy say Nosferatu The Cabinet of Dr Caligari Black Sunday Carnival of Souls or other early greats will no doubt want to seek this out. Vij is one of the early greats of the genre which it also transcends.".

The final terror in the crypt sequence full of vampires werewolves ambulatory skeletons flying harpies and midget gargoyles is a truly creepy denoument. The only quibble is that when the title VIJ creature shows up  its the least effective monster in the scene! Apparently there may soon be a video release as well as the aforementioned tour of PTUSHKO titles THE STONE FLOWER THE NEW GULLIVER and RUSLAN I LUDMILLA. Worth a look....".

Bava's film rightly placed the witch at the center of the narrative amazingly almost without her ever emerging from the family crypt! whereas this film  and one assumes the original text  makes the frankly boring seminarian hero its protagonist. At just 72 minutes the movie certainly does not overstay its welcome  but it also somewhat exposes the essentially thin plot line a young man is helped by an old lady but he understandably snubs her unwarranted advances however he allows her to ride him piggyback!only for them to slowly rise off the ground revealing her to be a witch. Back on firm land the aspiring cleric beats up the woman who turns to her true form of a young girl  after which the boy flees the scene. As soon as he reports back to the seminary he is told to travel to the estate of a prominent local family to pray over the body of their dying daughter when he arrives it transpires not only that the afflicted party is the witch herself who expressly asked for him to be there! but that she had succumbed to her wounds. Tradition now binds him to make a 3night vigil over her corpse but her plan is to exact revenge by tormenting him with assorted supernatural occurrences that inevitably lead to his own demise which proves justasbaffling to outsiders especially as he seems to be getting old before his time!The film looks very handsome in colour and the striking special effects work by artistic director Aleksandr Ptushko are at once charming and sinister still these are mainly relegated to the final night  as the first two go by a bit too quickly serving only for the revivified girl to repeatedly attempt in breaking the chalkdrawn circle inside which the young man has managed to attain sanctuary once using the coffin itself as a battering ram!. The parade of grotesques at the end include the brieflyseen titular creature which is not averse to being used as comedy relief  since the Vij asks its acolytes to fold out its overgrown ears because they are obstructing its field of vision i.e. their intended prey! Unsurprisingly the movie is Russian to the bone  so that we get much carousing singing drinking and camaraderie throughout  which tends to deflect attention from the otherwise nicely handled genre trappingsand brings me back to the notion that sometimes foreignmade versions of any given tale can have a better chance of externalizing its core themes.".

Unsurprisingly the movie is Russian to the bone  so that we get much carousing singing drinking and camaraderie throughout  which tends to deflect attention from the otherwise nicely handled genre trappingsand brings me back to the notion that sometimes foreignmade versions of any given tale can have a better chance of externalizing its core themes.";

In the transition to feature film this means that events get spread out quite a bit even as events that happen to the other seminary students than our main hero are streamlined out and therefore the film especially in its first half is rather slow moving.

Gogol's story was also characterized by a sort of ambiguity of tone that was part of his effectiveness as a writer and that is not really completely maintained. Things become broader  the old lady in the farmhouse at the start is obviously decrepit and witch like for instance and yes the ghostly scenes at the end are more horrorlike. These sequences where the dead body in the church rises and summons demons are really very effective and thrilling though sometimes showing budget limitations and its no surprise they end up among the most memorable elements. Leonid Kuravlyov plays the lead as so hapless and dim that he's often not easy to believe in scenes that are not supposed to be funny  except these ones. In all an imperfect but worthseeing adaptation of a Gogol story that would be very difficult to adapt in any circumstances  and the better for the horror film influence that several appropriate scenes show.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first horror movie made in Soviet Russia. Apparently the only reason the censors allowed it is because it's based off of a short story by respected author Gogol. Who based it on a folk tale he totally made up. The period setting probably didn't hurt any either. I'm not a scholar of Soviet film but it's not surprising to see that this is more influenced by European art cinema instead of anything like what American studios were producing at the time.Viy takes place in the 1800s and revolves around a young pastor in training. One of the surprising things is how rowdy and disorganized parish school is. Despite training to become men of the cloth the students still drink and party. It's those desires that get our protagonist in trouble. Khoma Brutus Leonid Kuravlyov seeks shelter in an old woman's barn. She hits on Khoma and when he rejects her the old woman jumps on his back and rides him across the night sky. This is the first use of oldfashioned but charmingly surreal special effects. Kuravlyov ends up beating the old woman to death. Before dying she transforms into a beautiful young girl. The next day the student is summoned to reside over a young woman's body for three nights. It of course ends up being the girl he met previously. While watching her corpse weird stuff starts to happen. And that's when the movie gets really good.Brutus is warned by the townsfolk that the girl was a witch. Her father's insistence that he stays and fulfills his daughter's last request is oddly adamant. There's nothing wrong with these daylight scenes. The director shoots with a lot of vigor. Kuravlyov is easy to like. An early scene of the student getting drunk employs the wonky incamera effects that you'll see more of later.The night scenes are when the movie comes alive. Khoma is smart enough to drawl a circle of protection as soon as he's locked in with the witch's dead body. The first night the body gets up moves around attempts to seduce him out of the circle. The second night the coffin rises into the air and flies around in a wonderfully offcenter effect. None of that compares to the last act when the witch gets serious. The witch summons ghosts vampires werewolves and all sorts of demons. In the film's signature moment green skinned monsters of all type crawled out of the walls. Skeletons ghoulishly dance around. You can clearly see the wires and yet somehow that just adds to the effect. The odd phantoms with three pig noses or eyes were eyes shouldn't be exist in their own gravity moving according to their own rules. The monsters surround the circle determined to freak our hero out. It's not until the title monster a huge demon with giant lids covering his allseeing eyes is summoned that stuff goes badly for the protagonist.The rest was just buildup to this fantastic overload of phantasmagoric images. Rightfully the movie peaks here. Good triumphs kind of and the movie wraps up on a decidedly ambiguous note. How you feel about the character's fate is squarely up to the audience even if the filmmaker's meant this to be a fable about faith. Viy feels like a fairy tale from another time full of culturespecific creatures with specific rules. For someone who likes crazy looking doityourself special effects and weird obscure folklore this is exactly the kind of movie I like. It's an easy recommend for horror fans willing to venture out of their comfort zone.".

	schema:headline " More Gothic fairy tale than straight horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "Viy is more Gothic fairy tale than a straight horror film due to its close adaptation of the original short story by 19thcentury Ukrainian  Russian author Nikolai Gogol. Yet the film itself has the look of many horror movies made in the West at the same time with lots of colour some excellent photography and a staged look to the sets. What makes this movie different from contemporary horror films is that the story is steeped in the culture of the people and time from whom and which Gogol was inspired to write his story. The setting is in rural Ukraine some time in the 1300s or 1400s. An Orthodox seminary breaks up for holidays and the students walk to their homes three of them decide to take a shortcut across some fields but get lost. One student Khoma Leonid Kravulyov stays at a farmhouse and meets an old witch there who tries to ride him like a horse he beats her severely and runs away home. Later he is contacted by his seminary to be told that he must say prayers for a Cossack chieftain's dying daughter Natalia Varley. He is forced to travel to the village where the chieftain and his family live and discovers that the girl is not only now dead but may be the incarnation of the old witch. The chieftain compels Khoma to stay in the village and say prayers for three nights for the girl who specifically requested the young man's presence before her death. During his stay Khoma gets drunk acts stupid and tries to escape but the chieftain and his servants make sure that every night for three nights running Khoma is in the dilapidated church next to the young woman's bier reading and chanting prayers.The first half of the film builds steadily to the moment when Khoma's threenight ordeal begins there isn't much to attract people looking only for horror but for parents and children watching together the scenes of past peasant and religious life in a faraway country will be of interest. The character of Khoma is clearly established he's young and not particularly devout and he likes to drink and have a good time with the other seminary students. By the time he starts his night watch viewers already have a clue his faith in God is shaky and there's a good chance he won't last the three nights. Apart from Khoma everyone else plays support but the film is all about a test of one fallible man's character and faith when surrounded by evil. Kravulyov perhaps looks too healthy and robust to play a fragile naive youth but his portrayal of Khoma as perhaps not too bright and very out of his depth in the real world away from the shelter of the seminary is very good.And what evil there is in the second half of the film  the special effects might not be great by the standards of horror films made outside the Soviet Union and eastern Europe in the 1960s but they're adequate for Viy the girl's coffin flies through the air in circles giant hands emerge from the walls and floors and deformed creatures literally crawl out of the woodwork to menace Khoma. They cannot breach the circle of chalk he has drawn around himself so they call for Viy the biggest and most evil demon of all to break through the magic protection sustained by Khoma's rapidly fading courage and confidence. Some of the acting probably needs to be more overdone the demon makeup and costuming are at once hokey and scary and Viy does look like a laughable carnival freak but the demon attack on Khoma is truly frightening though not at all gory. The animated skeletons and a closeup of a cute bristling monster weasel are major highlights. The filming method used in the horror scenes is outstanding with the camera continuously circling around Khoma or the flying coffin to create a sensation of delirious fear dizziness and helplessness.Apart from the use of special effects and the constantly rotating camera during the night watch scenes the cinematography isn't very remarkable though it does show the colour and flavour of rural Ukrainian life of several hundred years ago very well. The aerial riding scene is good with aerial photographs of lakes and forests whizzing by in the background behind the witch and Khoma to suggest the couple's speedy flight. Viewers will note a sexual subtext to the story the witch's ride can be read as a metaphor for seduction or rape and the chieftain himself suspects Khoma of having had sexual relations with his daughter. He knows Khoma is poor and tempts him with the promise of a thousand gold coins in payment if the young man can sit through the three nights with the girl's corpse so the nightwatch is as much a test of his selfcontrol and honesty as it is a test of his religious faith. Perhaps if the filmmakers had deviated from the original short story during the horror scenes and allowed the witch to try to seduce Khoma and tempt him with pleasure mixed with terror the film might have become an artistic work in its own right that appeals to all audiences and not simply a retelling of a story with fairytale elements.There aren't many horror films that mix horror with dark fantasy folktale elements and an examination of human nature and superstitious cultures and put them all in a world that's at once ordinary yet fantastic enough that witches vampires demons and werewolves can live there and Viy remains a good example of what's possible with that kind of fusion.".

They are slow in its build up and the punchline always seems to be missing to its jokes. Lets say it's the type of movie Wes Anderson would probably make if he was born in the Soviet Union 30 years earlier. And no Wes Anderson movies and his comedy also really aren't my favorite so there you go! No it's not like anything about this movie is truly bad but the movie as a whole is not really that much special either. To be honest it's far too simplistic far that and the one thing that the movie still has going for it is its great visual style.It's quite an unique movie really. When you think about comedy you of course don't think about a Soviet Union movie from the '60's. It's a quite unexpected movie and unique in its sort that mostly keeps doing its own thing and is maintaining its own style throughout. It's not my thing really but I can still really appreciate the movie because of that.It's simply a really well made film that has some unexpected visual surprises in it. I never really got a horrorvibe from the movie but I more got a sort of dark fairytale feeling. It's a comedy with some dark moments in it and witches and other creatures are often appearing. The movie uses some good early effects and some nice camerawork.But I still do wish there was some more to the story. The movie is only 77 minutes short which is all due to the fact that it's a very simplistically written little movie. I do wish some more was happening in the story at times and the movie went a bit deeper and more into detail with certain characters or storyelements. It does feel like the movie was being too lazy at times or perhaps they simply were in a real rush to finish this movie which is more likely to be the case.Nothing that impressive but the movie is some good simple fun!710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

They are slow in its build up and the punchline always seems to be missing to its jokes. Lets say it's the type of movie Wes Anderson would probably make if he was born in the Soviet Union 30 years earlier. And no Wes Anderson movies and his comedy also really aren't my favorite so there you go!

I believe it is simply impossible to take the side of any other character. I've never read the original book but I suppose the film is a very well made screening.

The little party includes a wine merchant and a factory owner together with their wives a count and a countess two nuns and an old bachelor even war does not discourage these nine French patriots from their journey.Since they left Rouen in a hurry at dawn there was no time for breakfast and without any provisions for the trip the travelers soon get hungry and cranky. They are joined by Frau Bouledesuif played by Frau Elizabeth Rousset  who has suffered an accident on the road with her cart. The wine merchant immediately recognizes her as a member of the world's oldest profession a hussy as they call her. The travelers scorn her until she produces food enough for a week. That makes them quickly forget their prejudices.They all stop at a hotel to rest but a Prussian officer who demands their papers also recognizes Frau Bouledesuif and insists that she become his mistress. Since our heroine hates Prussians she refuses but the officer tells her the entourage will be not allowed to continue on their journey unless she changes her mind.Pyshka was the first film directed by Herr Mikhail Romm in the late year  regarding silent films  of 1934 based on Herr Guy de Maupassant's novel the film is a splendid and ironic portrait of how supposedly strong convictions can be ignored or betrayed when other powerful earthy and selfish interests appear.It is a sharp study about hypocrisy. Herr Romm brilliantly shows these human contradictions and betrayed principles and depicts in detailed closeups the peculiar personalities of the different travelers in their close quarters a small wagon and a hotel. This is not a very easy task but it is accomplished thanks to excellent actors beautiful art direction and splendid cinematography. The final irony is that strong convictions like honor and patriotism can fall by the wayside when human weaknesses such as hunger or greed rear their heads.. The travelers are hypocrites in spite of their pious beliefs and only Frau Bouldesuif is honest. She will suffer for her sincerity because her companions are pursuing their own interests and will forget and despise her again once their aims have been accomplished.Pyshka is a great film about hypocrisy and selfishness and a brilliant adaptation of Herr Maupassant's literary work thanks to Herr Romm and the brilliant cinematography ja wohl!.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must join such peculiar frenchified little party.".

Indeed something is amiss at this isolated island fortress as he discovers that his nemesis Han Shih Kien is the host of the tournament and is also the leader of the same gang that murdered his sister. Soon enough Lee together with two other martial artists Roper John Saxon and Williams Jim Kelly go to work kicking a everywhere until the final showdown with the murderous onehanded villain Han in the classic Hall of Mirrors fight sequence.Enter the Dragon a joint AmericanChinese production was intended to be Bruce Lee's introduction to Western audiences but due to his tragic death just weeks before the film's American release we will never know what he would have been capable of here in the states. Even more tragically his son Brandon Lee would experience a similar fate just like his father only 20 years later with The Crow.There are so many classic fight scenes which I can watch over and over without them ever becoming boring. Many of them still hold up very well especially by 2004's standards where fight scenes are mostly digitally enhanced or involve wire or Matrixfu to make up for lack of actual stunt work plus one has to remember that this film was made in 1973 in the days before wirework would become dominant in today's martial arts cinema. The Cavern Fight is probably my favorite fight sequence of all time in any martial arts movie. Many of the fights in this movie more specially the ones where Lee is involved have a surreal feeling to them. He brings a kind of grace to his action scenes that have yet to be topped by any actor alive today. Lee even brings many of his own personal philosophies to this film which makes much sense and perhaps help to understand some of the more philosophical elements to the story. But more than anything this was Bruce Lee's entre to Americans many people including myself were introduced to martial arts cinema through Enter the Dragon.There are also several cameos made by future martial arts stars that would eventually reach stardom most notably Jackie Chan as a henchman during the Cavern Fight sequence who has his neck broken by Lee and Sammo Hung as Lee's sparring partner in the opening fight sequence.I could go on and on about what makes this movie immortal but I feel I should let you see what makes it great. Bruce Lee was forever immortalized with this film and it will be cherished and praised forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long held to be the granddaddy of all martial arts films Enter the Dragon was recently re released on DVD with the full treatment  digital restoration a few short scenes added back in and interviews with all of the surviving cast plus some extras about the film and a few interviews with Bruce Lee. Most of you have probably already seen it as it's thirty years old but even though the film is almost absurdly steeped in the 70s it still holds up remarkably well. Aside from dangerously wide lapels and some corny erarelated dialogue most notably delivered by Jim Kelly the film's only African American. Enter the Dragon still delivers the same powerful punch it did three decades ago.Of course back then it was merely the best martial arts film. Now however it is the chief testament to the grace and skill of Bruce Lee and the only one of his four films that he had any sort of creative control over  and you can see the difference between this and his Hong Kong films easily.Lee does a Tony Danza and plays Mr. Lee a shaolin warrior who is recruited by a foreign government it's assumed to be the English but is never explicitly stated to infiltrate the island of a megalomaniac martial artist named Han Kien Shih who holds tournaments to find the best martial artists in the world. And because that's not enough motivation it's also revealed that Han's bodyguard Oharra Robert Wall killed Bruce's sister three years ago. So like every Lee movie there is a personal vendetta involved and like every Lee film Bruce's character asks forgiveness from his family for the deadly violence he is about to unleash. Along for the ride are gamblaholic Roper John Saxon and ghetto survivor Williams Kelly.The plot seems like a contrivance now but that was before it was copied to death in the last three decades. It's actually a plausible and somewhat clever excuse to show people what they came to see  Bruce Lee repeatedly kicking butt. From the opening fight scene against Sammo Hung through the fabulous finale where Lee singlehandedly takes on half the island the movie is a joy to watch on the physical level. It's the world's greatest martial artist at his peak in a showcase perfectly designed for him. It was an ideal if unintentional shrine to the man.Lee is not merely content to let us watch him bash people though some of his philosophy penetrates the movie which is probably the real reason why Enter the Dragon has stayed so fresh so long. Lee talks about spirituality with a young charge and even gives us an amusing and illustrative lesson in his 'art of fighting without fighting'  which is the credo of any real warrior. Lee also shows us the flip side the showoffs and powerhungry who are only in it for the physical and material advantage. He takes care to show us how debased they are before dispatching them however.While Saxon and the rest of the cast are perfectly acceptable Jim Kelly overdoes it a bit but oddly that fits the film Lee is terrific in this piece. Bruce Lee was a riveting performer and nowhere is that better demonstrated than in this movie. It's a testament to his legacy that three decades later no one has come close to his skill and people are still stealing ideas from him Kill Bill etc.. It gives one pause while watching Enter the Dragon to think of just what Bruce Lee could have accomplished had he lived.I suppose those who don't like martial arts wouldn't care for this film but I've seen it convert even unbelievers before. Lee is that good and that charismatic that you can't help but be drawn to him. Certainly his greatest film is worth checking out again on this spiffy new re release. Even if you're not the biggest martial arts fan how often do you get to check out a legend at the top of his game?".

Its merit lies purely in the action content.  If you were to ask any learned martial artist I'm sure that 9 out of 10 would tell you that the fight sequences are unparalleled even today.  The fluidity of Lee is astounding.  Unlike most martial arts films of that time the fighting is very realistic and has a somewhat visceral quality.  There is also the use of traditional Oriental weapons nunchaku escrima sticks etc.. although the British censors in their wisdom have seen fit the cut the nunchaku sequence and I'm afraid like any censored movie it just isn't the same watching when you know you aren't getting the full monty so to speak.Still on the whole one of my personal favourites and a must see for any action or seventies film fan.

	schema:headline " 'Enter The Dragon' is essential viewing for all 1970s buffs!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Enter The Dragon' was a massive part of my childhood back in the 1970s. As a preteen Bruce Lee was just about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. Maybe only Bond Sean Connery Bond! and Charlton Heston as 'The Omega Man' came close. Like 'The Omega Man' this movie is one that I find difficult to be objective about. The plot is simplistic the acting is variable but the action and the LOOK of it make it an all time classic. Let's face it this is a kung fu movie and what the audience wants is exciting fight scenes. 'Enter The Dragon' has them and then some! I'm not sure whether I'd describe it as the greatest martial arts movie ever made as many people do but it's certainly one of the most entertaining I've ever seen. The only other one I've seen that comes close is 'Iron Monkey' but as good as it was it obviously didn't have the one thing that makes this movie legendary  Bruce Lee. Lee is without a doubt the greatest ku fu fighter to step in front of a movie camera. Handsome and charismatic this movie was to be his introduction to mainstream Hollywood audiences. He died unexpectedly just weeks before it premiered in America. It seems certain that he would have become a superstar bigger than Jackie Chan who incidentally has a brief cameo here is today. Whenever Lee is on the screen you can't take your eyes off him  he's that good. You don't need any other reason to watch this movie than Bruce Lee but having John Saxon 'Planet Of Blood' 'Tenebrae' costar is an added treat and Jim Kelly is super cool. After the enormous success of 'Enter The Dragon' director Robert Clouse made 'Black Belt Jones' with him another 70s kung fu classic but Kelly never really fulfilled his potential and instead made cheesy but fun bgrade vehicles like 'Black Samurai' and 'Black Belt Jones 2'. I also love Han the tongueincheek 'Dr No' inspired villain played by Kien Shih. 'Enter The Dragon' is essential viewing for all 1970s buffs. It had a major impact on pop culture and it's still great wonderful to watch thirty years after it was originally released. To say I highly recommend this movie is an understatement!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a child one of my first and best friends was a strange boy who worshiped the ground Bruce Lee walked on  cutting his hair taking Jiu Jitsu and Hapkido lessons and often stalking around with that intense animal fury that only Lee could create all over his 7 year old face. My friend took a lot of abuse for this and other odd behaviors with dignity that his hero would have applauded. Unfortunately Mr. Lee passed from this world very young leaving a legend and a pair of shoes that have never really been filled. For most Americans this is the only Hollywood film worthy of mention with his name in the cast. Don't get me wrong I love Jackie Chan and Jet Li and even the few Chow Yun Fat roles involving martial arts but each of these actors have their own very big personalities and  at least in the case of Chan  have built their own unique legend. Unlike his successors what Lee excelled at was the intense physicality and drama of his performance. He worked every muscle of his body in every beautifully choreographed fight scene of Enter The Dragon and made art out of violence in ways that today's Hollywood gun violence schlockdirectors can only dream of. And Enter the Dragon is one of his most stunning vehicles.The pseudoTaoisms are kept to a minimum and concentrated near the beginning of this film. Lee enters a martial arts tournament to avenge the murder of his sister and to defend the honor of the Shao Lin Temple where he helps to train young martial artists. John Saxon a downonhis luck playboy and brigand is the closest thing to a costar and comes to the tournament hoping for a solution to his financial problems. The tournament is hosted by a massmurdering heroin manufacturer who hides his production facilities literally beneath a martial arts school using the instructors and students in the school as an army of body guards. Kien Shih is absolutely compelling as the evil Han even if his fight scenes are at times a bit less convincing than the master Lee's. Lee and Shih are the performance highlights of the film. Though Saxon does a passable job his performance is a bit fibrous at times.Worth seeing for the sets and settings alone this film is driven well by its fast pace simple but engaging story line and the sheer talent of Bruce Lee. Of course there are the usual problems of the martial arts genre  villains whose sense of honor for the most part only applies to lifethreatening situations fighting wouldbe heroes the lack of any weapons besides fists and unused knives unnecessary nude scenes  it is very easy to overlook these problems and just enjoy the film.Highly recommended.".

His near perfect physique leading man good looks and innate charisma transcended the derivative script and gave it a timeless quality. Having read the original draft of Enter the Dragon originally titled Blood and Steel The final film is a far cry from it.  He turned major monologues into short but memorable phrases like It is like a finger pointing away to the moon. Very few people then and now could utter those words and be taken seriously. It was Bruce Lee not writer Michael Allin who gave the movie it's spiritual core and it was Bruce Lee not directed Robert Clouse who gave it its sense of cinematic style. Proof of this lies in the fact that both Allin and Clouse were never able to reproduce the quality or success of Enter the Dragon before or after Bruce Lee. Bruce borrowed heavily from Clint Eastwood's persona and gave it his own unique twist. After all these years Enter the Dragon stands alone in the genre and stands as one of Hollywood's most profitable feature films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enter The Dragon of 1973 is not only essential for Bruce Lee fans but a mustsee for every lover of cultcinema for a variety of reasons. While director Robert Clouse's stylish and violent Martial Arts extravaganza is not necessarily the greatest Bruce Lee flick it is his most famous and most influential film both due to the fact that it was his first Americanproduced film and the first Americanproduced Martial Arts film ever and mainly because it was the last film the Master appeared in before his untimely death. More precisely Enter The Dragon had its world premiere only six days after the great Martial Arts icon had passed away on July 20th 1973. The film's cultstatus even excels its level of fame  the iconic picture of Bruce Lee with bleeding scratches on his chest must be one of the most widely known movie stills ever and is immediately recognized even by people who have never seen the film and don't know its title. This film basically was the kickoff to the popularity of Martial Arts films in the Western World but even apart from the fact how influential it was this is a great film to watch. In its style it somehow resembles funky and incomparably more violent Marial Arts version of the older James Bond films  sexy ladies and eccentric villains come along with stylish and ultraviolent unarmed battle on a beautiful remote island.Kung Fu expert Lee Bruce Lee is applied to attend a tournament on a remote island owned by the mysterious Han Kien Shih. Besides engaging in fights Lee is to infiltrate the villainous Han's evil crime syndicate. But love of justice is not Lee's sole motivation to come to the island as one of Han's henchmen is responsible for his sister's death... Lee is not the only kung fuexpert participating in the tournament of course. Several other great fighters have arrived most memorably the crafty Roper played by none other than the great John Saxon and the supercool Williams played by Jim Kelly basically THE black Martial Artist who went on to make another film with director Clouse Black Belt Jones the following year. And then there are more familiar faces for Martial Arts fans such as the monstrouslylooking Bolo Yeung and the scarfaced Robert Wall. Angela Mao Ahna Capri and a bunch of other foxy ladies provide most welcome female eyecandy inbetween the fights. The martial arts sequences are stylish violent and in one word amazing. Bruce Lee himself did the choreography of the fights  I don't suppose I need to say any more. All that is accompanied by a funky soundtrack and the typical awesome 70s feeling that my fellow fans of cultcinema love so much. This is an absolute mustsee for Martial Arts and Cultcinema fans and I also highly recommend it to anybody else. I know the following statement is nothing new or original but it sure is to the point Bruce Lee was THE MAN and always will be and not an entire army of Jet Lis and Jackie Chans can ever replace him!".

Two friends Roper and Williams also arrive at the island for a MA tournament. Throughout the movie they get into numerous fights and manage to take down Han's empire.The movie has some excellently choreographed fight scenes and exceptional acting on Lee's part. What detracts from the movie's glory however is the miscast John Saxon as Roper. He wasn't right for the role and you could tell he only had minimal skills. While I would love to give this 1010 I just can't. Saxon is mainly what detracts from it but the final fight with Han was disappointing as well.Stiil despite all it's flaws it is a must see for any avid Martial Artist.".

He was and is the best martial artist ever to grace the silver screen. I respect Sonny Chiba's Street Fighter style and fierceness however Bruce had grace poise and an intensity in his art and acting that made the hairs on my arms stand on end when he appeared on screen. Needless to say he had sex appeal and maintained it even when he was in the throes of beating the chi life force out of some idiot who believed incorrectly that he could whoop Lee in a fight.Enter The Dragon was a film which I believe showcased every ounce of Bruce's talents including his use of English for the first time in his films!

Lee decides he can not only help rid the world of a vicious crimelord but avenge the death of his sister a sort of 'kill two birds with one stone' situation which he can't refuse. Lee travels to Hong Kong  then onto Han's private island where the tournament is held  he runs his criminal empire with the intention of bringing him down...This Chinese American coproduction was directed by Robert Clouse  is generally regarded as a classic personally I don't think it's deserving of such an accolade but it ain't a bad film. The script by Michael Allin felt like a James Bond flick to me a secret undercover guy sent in to stop some crime lord who owns his own private island with a secret underground base he has interchangeable metal hands just like Joseph Wiseman in Dr. No 1963  he also carries around  strokes a fluffy white cat just like Blofeld in the Bond films! The main bad guy also has a few henchmen including one with a distinctive scar. I suppose the main difference is that Enter the Dragon is far more violent than any Bond film with Bruce Lee's martial arts skills defeating all on comers. In fact it gets pretty boring in the sense that Lee literally kicks  punches everyone out with one hit  noone can even hit him once. It becomes a precession where you know Lee is going to knock everyone out the only interest is how he does it either with a punch a kick or a pair of nunchucks. I don't really like martial arts films that much  if I want a spy thriller I'll watch a James Bond film  to me Enter the Dragon is some strange mixture of the two which provides decent entertainment  is quite fun but ultimately didn't do much for me. Also how did anyone know that Lee's sister had committed suicide? The only other person in the room was Han's bodyguard Oharra  since Lee's sister killed herself how did anyone else find out? The guy who told Lee was knocked out earlier on by Oharra answers on a postcard please...Director Clouse does alright but it's Bruce Lee who is credited with the fight direction  choreography the fights look good  are pretty violent  if your a fan of Lee then you will love this. The climax set in a room of mirrors according to the IMDb over 8000 mirrors were used is quite a disorientating  imaginative sequence. Enter the Dragon was one of only two American films Bruce Lee appeared in which used his real voice sadly Lee died in Hong Kong three weeks before the films premiere. The film was shot without sound  all dialogue  sound effects were added in post production it's very noticeable as well. For all you foot fetishists there is a trampling scene of a barefoot woman standing  walking on a mans back.With a supposed budget of about 850000 this didn't have a huge budget by any stretch of the imagination it's reasonably well made although the fact it's dubbed throughout is painfully obvious. The acting is OK but I find it hard to take actor John Saxon as a martial arts expert seriously.Enter the Dragon is an OK film it passes 100 odd minutes painlessly enough. I didn't think it was as good as it's lofty reputation suggested but I liked it all the same. I guess I'm just not a fan of very one sided martial arts fights there's just not enough vulnerability for Lee's character. Good but not brilliant.".

Jim Kelly has great abs though his best moment comes when he is beaten to death with a metal hand. Kien Shih is a classic sneering archcriminal and does more of his own fighting than your average Blofeld he is hampered however by a couple of silly prosthetics one of which looks like a chunk of plywood with a toupee. This movie also has four more breasts than any Bond flick though they're used as set dressing not particularly for titillation. Nobody watches a grudgematch martial arts tournament movie for the chicks. Which is one of the reasons I don't watch too many of them.An entirely enjoyable stupid movie best taken while inebriated. Maybe the best Bruce Lee movie... but then Bruce Lee movies only ever suck slightly less than any other kung fu movies. Most of which can hardly be called good. You really have to like the sound of fabric rippling through the air and blows that all sound like slaps. The best part is watching Bruce creep around in people's footsteps without their noticing  a marvelous athlete he is as believable in motion as anybody who ever stepped in front of a camera.".

You know it't the type of movie in which one of the villains has an huge scar on his face and the other had a prosthetic hand. Yet Enter the Dragon is a totally brilliant movie which is because of more than one reason. Everything works out so well and blends in perfectly with each other. It's delicious pulp!Material arts movies just never have been the most subtle greatly written or most original movies around. Just think about those JeanClaude Van Damme and Chuck Norris type of movies. I mean basically every movie is always the same. This movie is not much different were it not that this was one of the first real international material arts genre movie and therefor the movie is also genre redefining. It set the standards for the material arts movie genre and its story has been used in many different form and shape ever since. These days its mostly used in comical movies actually.Guess this movie can be best described as material arts meeting James Bond. The story and characters definitely show similarities to the James Bond genre but that does not mean that this movie is just a simple ripoff. It has enough class and style of its own and I wouldn't had mind seeing this turn into a long running series of movies starring Bruce Lee. That was impossible of course unfortunately.The story is incredibly simple and it's actually also a hard one to believe. I mean really why would a martial artist ever agree on becoming a spy and infiltrate a criminal organization under the cover of a tournament. However as the movie progresses you just stop caring really about the story and what the movie is all about. You just take it for what it is good quality entertainment with Bruce Lee in top form! It's such a waste he died at such an early age even weeks before the Hong Kong premiere of this movie. He had the looks the skills but also certainly the right acting abilities for these type of movies to become an huge international action hero movie star.All of the other actors aren't much special. It's not hard to see why none of them ever had a sparkling acting career however it's also due to the simple dialog and bad at times laughable dubbing that their performance don't quite come across as anything strong or impressive although Kien Shih does a good job playing the main villain that's deliciously simple and evil! As a matter of fact it also seems that the movie could had been without halve of its characters. I mean exactly what do Roper and Williams add? And what was the point of having Mei Ling in the movie?The fight sequences are really brilliantly choreographed by Bruce Lee himself. Every fight on its self forms a highlight of the movie with of course the well known end fight in the mirrorroom as the ultimate highlight.Simply the best of the best that the genre has to offer!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Every fight on its self forms a highlight of the movie with of course the well known end fight in the mirrorroom as the ultimate highlight.Simply the best of the best that the genre has to offer!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

Directed by FEAST OF SATAN'S Jose Marie Elorietta before Spaghetti Westerns had become a bonafide genre FURY OF THE APACHES straddles the divide between Cowboy Movies and the Spaghetti approach by having the minimum story necessary to explain what is happening and let the action speak for itself. Even The Duke probably would have liked this nasty violent and immensely entertaining film that manages to NOT rip off FISTFUL OF DOLLARS though mostly because it wasn't a hit yet when this was made.THE PLOT A group of disparate Ark type humans find themselves barricaded in an old Mission turned stagecoach station in frontier era Arizona after a young hotheaded idiot mistakenly shoots  kills the chief of the local Apache tribe. Oops! The Injuns surround the makeshift fort the arrows  bullets fly personal conflicts turn deadly and it is only a matter of time before the savages spill over the walls and hack everyone to death in an orgy of genocidal fury. THE END.Seriously though this film has what most of the great Spaghetti entries lack which is a genuine human story. Frank Latimore an actor I am otherwise unfamiliar with was well chosen to play the wrongfully disgraced former Army officer now paroled and working the station with all of the cynicism of Bogie. And by Jove if fate hasn't sent the crooked judge who arranged for his misfortune into his very arms complete with a fortune in hard cash and a pretty young wife to be Liz Moreno who is so gorgeous it almost makes you want to cry who it turns out hates the bastard as well. Add a couple of excons one of them played by Spaghetti legend Aldo Sambrell insane as always who want to slit everyone's throats and make off with the goods and THEN throw a thousand heavily armed Indian braves at them and by golly you can kiss 90 minutes of your life goodbye. The film moves at a breakneck pace complete with an ending that is oddly evocative of THE ROAD WARRIOR which is probably the point since George Miller doubtlessly grew up on the FORT APACHE type Cowboys Vs Indians thrillers that no doubt also inspired Elorietta  company.FURY OF THE APACHES is also interesting in that it is one of the few Euro Westerns filmed in Spain by an Italian  Spanish crew to directly involve Native Americans. One of the things that always struck me as odd about Spaghetti Westerns is how they seemed to forget that there were Natives here before the Gringos and the Pistoleros both but other than a few comic relief moments and Sergio Corbucci's painful antifun NAVAJO JOE there really aren't too many examples of Native Americans playing a big role in Spaghetti fare. A lot of that has to do with the simple logistics of how the films were made If you're shooting in Spain you tend to use Spaniards as extras and so we'd usually watch stories about Gringos encountering swarthy Mexican banditos and curvy cantina Senoritas. This time it's just good old Cowboys  Indians though it is too bad that all we see of the Apaches are the kind of pop up target bad guys that the Bugs played in STARSHIP TROOPERS. And yes I bet Paul Verhoeven saw this movie also at some point.I wouldn't dare give away the ending though I can confirm that fans of Elorietta's slanted twist on story convention will not be disappointed by how he dishes out the goods Everyone gets what they had coming in the end with even the young idiot provided an ample chance to redeem himself and save the others. Excellent musical score by Fernando Garca Morcillo some good carnage and an interesting ensemble cast that really doesn't have a standout performance but no weak spots either. SEEK IT OUT Something Weird Video has a VHS release of the film you can order off their website.Another excellent example too of how the great Eurohorror directors all plied their wares in the other genres before making their Gothic Classics Jose Elorietta may be better known for his horror shockers but this is easily my favorite of his films and I love Gothic Eurohorror.

Instead it feels very much like an updating of the John Ford classic STAGECOACH mixed with Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO featuring a bunch of characters fending off a frenzied mob of Apache Indians who are more than a little upset about the sudden death of their leader at the hands of one of the group.On paper FURY OF THE APACHES sounds decent enough although it's the type of film let down by the lack of budget and expertise that makes it a lacklustre experience throughout. It's a noisy production sure with a lot of action scenes but fewer of them are entertaining than you'd expect and the end result is all too familiar and much the same as any number of Ameircan Bmovie westerns. The only time this film really rises above the norm is during a speeding stagecoach chase which is well staged given the constraints.".

The first was Northwest Passage which MGM gave the A treatment with Spencer Tracy. And then there was this film adaption of Captain Caution which takes place in the opening weeks of the War of 1812.Roberts's novels are long and complex and I got the feeling that a lot of character development was sacrificed for action. Certainly the action sequences were well done and Victor Mature in one of his earliest films made a dashing hero. And the film got an Oscar nomination for Best Sound recording.Yet things seemed to move a little too quick. MGM when dong Northwest Passage wisely decided the novel was too long to make an entire film out of it. They concentrated on the first part about Roger's Rangers and their contribution to the French and Indian War. There were plans for a sequel but they eventually came to naught. But they had a complete film in just what they used.I got the feeling in Captain Caution that they tried to get the whole book in and did a slipshod job in adapting it. It's not a bad film but it could have been a whole lot better.Louise Platt was fresh from her triumph in Stagecoach and plays the lady owner of an American merchant vessel that gets attacked by a British navy frigate. The Americans don't know they're at war and get attacked by surprise. Louise's father Robert Barrat is killed and she develops an understandable case of anglophobia. And she's put out quite a bit that her intended Victor Mature isn't all fired up to turn their merchant vessel into a privateer. She gravitates towards the villainous Bruce Cabot who has his own ideas and they don't necessarily mesh with Louise's.Alan Ladd has a small bit role as an American who was impressed into the British Navy. That was done quite a bit right before the War of 1812. He's a prisoner because he resisted the idea. I'm sure the folks at Paramount must have noticed this part because two years later Ladd made his break out film for Paramount in This Gun for Hire.I look at Captain Caution and wonder what might have happened if it had been done at MGM the way Northwest Passage was done.".

The daughter who also takes her fathers place on the ship and makes some unwise alliances is played by Louise Platt  bestknown as the childbearing snob in John Fords STAGECOACH 1939  and while being fairly decent in the role she evidently lacks the charisma and magnetism of a Maureen OHara who would later make that kind of part her own.The film whose director would later also helm the Douglas Fairbanks Jr. vehicle SINBAD THE SAILOR 1947 itself while generally fastpaced and entertaining is clearly below the standard of the far classier stuff Errol Flynn was concurrently filming at Warner Bros. still it strives to rise above these Bmovie origins by packing as much action as it possibly can into the trim 85minutes runningtime  including a gladiatorial bout between Mature and a hulking laughing brute aboard an English ship for the amusement of the aristocrats actually serving as cover for an escape attempt below deck and many energetic fistfights between sailors and pirates of opposing nations.The characters are mostly caricatures  a duplicitous first mate a stuttering stooge a mandolinplaying immigrant a womanizing Frenchman and his shrewish wife a constantly grumbling old seahand etc.  but the cast is interesting enough Bruce Cabot Leo Carillo Roscoe Ates Aubrey Mather and even a bearded Alan Ladd as a rabblerousing prisoner to keep one watching nonetheless. The condition of the print was understandably hardly optimal given the films age and status with the hissfilled soundtrack and some wobbly images being particular liabilities however as long as films of this vintage dont appear on DVD though TCM USA does occasionally screen such unassuming but undeniably fun fare Ill take any option thats available to me.".

Corunna then decides to make Dan jealous and becomes close to Lehrman SladeBruce Cabot who is a man that is selfcentered and only cares about his own future and disregards anyone else on the ship. Leo CarrilloLucien Argandeau gives a great supporting role as a first mate to Daniel Marvin. There is plenty of cannons going off and ships colliding with each other and plenty of swords flashing. If you look real close you will see a very young Alan Ladd playing a very minor role but Hollywood was watching him and his next role would be This Gun for Hire. Nice entertaining 1940 Class film.".

After all the idea of a film set during the War of 1812 was intriguingthis is a subject rarely talked about in movies. However after a short time it became obvious that the film was high on the anachronism factorin other words having people behaving totally uncharacteristically from that time period. The notion of a lady sea captain setting off to attack and punish the British just never would have or could have happened in 1812. While this was silly it still didn't mean the film couldn't have been exciting. Unfortunately even if you ignore this plot problem about a half hour into the film it also became amazingly dull and talky. Instead of an Errol Flynnstyle adventure film it just all ground to an almost complete halt. Sure it picked up for the rousing conclusion but by then I had really lost interest and just wanted the whole thing to end due to poor writing. Plus in this conclusion it made fighting in a naval battle look FUN! This fun element is pretty stupid as well as a bit disturbingand further evidence it is a mediocre film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Richard Wallace coproduced this action adventure seafaring film with Grover Jones who based his screenplay on the Kenneth Roberts novel. Executive producer Hal Roach was evidently trying to capitalize on Warner Bros. successful Errol Flynn pirate films like The Sea Hawk 1940 which had been released earlier in the year. Unfortunately he didn't have the lead nor character actors to rise above its B programmer status though Elmer Raguse did receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Recording. The cast includes Victor Mature Louise Platt Leo Carrillo Bruce Cabot Robert Barrat Vivienne Osborne Roscoe Ates who plays a stuttering crewman and Alan Ladd among others.The time period is August 1812 when war rages between England and the United States with France involved in the mix. Mature plays Dan Marvin who'd been rescued as a boy by American Captain Dorman Barrat on his ship the Olive Branch. Marvin had therefore grown up with Dorman's daughter Corunna Platt. Now that both are of age they're on the brink of consummating their relationship with an adult romance but each is a little too feisty and neither is willing to relinquish any 'power' to the other. In fact Corunna is so strong willed that she dubs Dan Captain Caution when he'd rightly surrenders the ship to the British after her father was killed she vows revenge as a privateer. The Olive Branch had been at sea so long no one aboard even knew that there was a war going on. Three of the prisoners aboard the English ship are Frenchman Lucien Argandeau Carillo his wife Victorine Osborne and another American Lehrman Slade Cabot who had been a prisoner about Argandeau's ship the Formidable for slave trading before the British had commandeered it.With help from the ladies who are given quarters above decks by the British the prisoners below decks get some small arms knives and a pistol which enables them to join the action when an American ship attacks them the British are overwhelmed and their ship is sunk. The freed Olive Branch is then commanded by Corunna assisted by Slade who has charmed his way into her confidence. Victorine comforts Dan who Corunna  Slade has made stay a prisoner. Mrs. Argandeau and her husband Lucien are on the outs because of his affairs with other women. Meanwhile Dan has 'adopted' the English drummer boy Travers Clifford Severn he'd saved during the conflict. Of course Slade is untrustworthy and once they make port in France he crosses the channel back to England where he blackmails another slave trader into capturing the Olive Branch for his own purposes.Again Dan and Lucien find themselves imprisoned in the bowels of a British ship. This time with the help of Newton Ladd who ends up killing the corrupt captain and several others who'd been treated like slaves 'forced' to operate the ship they're able to escape re attack their captors and rescue the Olive Branch for a finally grateful Corunna. A shirtless Mature was called into action as a gladiator to fight a large brute in order to distract the crew such that the other American prisoners could swim to a nearby ship to escape. Naturally Corunna no longer thinks her nickname fits Dan and they embrace before the closing credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Western Union is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region 2 in England. This  being a blessing in some ways  is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region 1 release. It beggars belief! It simply doesn't make sense!Produced by Fox in 1941 Western Union was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's The Return Of Frank James and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid Rancho Notorious. Lang was no Ford or Hawks but with Western Union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence here is merely cosmetic.It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An actor who never really distinguished himself  except perhaps with Crossfire 1947 Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was TV's Marcus Welby MD in the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91.Western Union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by  and irritatingly so some would say  by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor.Altogether though a spanking good western albeit on Region 2 but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH!Footnote Interestingly the associate producer on Western Union was Harry Joe Brown who later with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest westerns in the fifties.".

Western Union tells the story of the people who were bringing the telegraph to the west. They all knew the Morse Code and we even learn that the word O.K. originated from them. Robert Young is the tenderfoot and Randolph Scott the tough man of the west. They both fall in love with Virginia Gilmore the sister of the boss Dean Jaggger. Scott is a former outlaw who is working for the company and has an inner conflict between his friendship to his old pals and his loyalty to Jagger. The same plot showed up in another Scott movie Santa Fe. Fritz Lang did two unconventional westerns The Return of Frank James and Rancho Notorious but this western which can be considered conventional is the best of the three. The first scene with Scott running away from a posse and passing through a herd of buffaloes is spectacular. The shootout at the end is very impressive. This film did not age specially if you compare it with other westerns Scott made in those years.".

	schema:reviewBody "A spectacular and mighty adventure during the Civil War when America's destiny rode in the saddle bags of adventurers and hardworking laborers installing the poles and cable . The Western Union feats were similarly developed to Pony Express that was a mail service delivering messages  newspapers  mail  and small packages from St. Joseph  Missouri  across the Great Plains  over the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada to Sacramento  California  by horseback  and hardy riders  using a series of relay stations and it reduced the time for messages . It became from April 3  1860 to October 1861  the West's most direct means of eastwest communication before the telegraph was established and being vital for tying the new state of California with the rest of the United States . Later on  Pony Express was replaced by the telegraph  and Western Union quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the American West . Pony Express  stagecoach and freight company Wells Fargo provided secure US mail service until the construction of telegraph lines proceeded by Western Union. It was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the Frontier times . This movie concerns Vance Shaw Randolph Scott gives up outlawing  he meets Edward Creighton Dean Jagger who leads the construction of the Western Union to unite East with West  the latter hires Vance and a tenderfoot Eastern surveyor as well as engineer from Harvard  Richard Blake Robert Young . Both of whom become romantically involved with the Edward's sister Viginia Gilmore . Meanwhile  some outlaws Barton MacLane attempting to prevent the company connecting the line and robbing the Western Union cattle masked of Indians Ogalaya .This traditional Western of the founding of telegraph routes westward contains thrills  rousing action  frontier adventure  shootouts  Indian attacks and exuberant outdoors . This vintage epic Western turns out to be a throughly entertaining picture that will appeal to Western fans . Big budget Western by Darryl F Zanuck's 20th Century Fox  and even studio publicity noted that Fox contract star Henry Fonda though uncredited had served as technical adviser on the film due to his experience as a young man working as a lineman . Dealing with the political machinations and fights that accompanied the construction of the glamorous Western Union route from Omaha  Nebraska  to Salt Lake City  Utah  in which brave riders battling hostile Indians  cutthroats attempting on robbing  firing  astute bandits and many other things . Screenwriter Robert Carson utilized the title  but not the screenplay  of a Zane Grey novel . The main protagonists result to known players  such as Randolph Scott as a Western reformed outlaw  Robert Young as an obstinate surveyor and Dean Jagger as manager . Support cast is frankly magnificent  such as  John Carradine  Chill Wills  Barton MacLane  Slim Summerville  Charles Middleton and the ordinary Indians  Chief John Big Tree  Chief Thundercloud  Iron Eyes Cody  Jay Silverheels . The film displays a brilliant cinematography by expert cameraman Edward Cronjager in rich Technicolor . In addition  thrilling and evocative musical score by David Buttolph . The motion picture produced by Harry Joe Brown and Darryl F Zanuck was compellingly directed by Fritz Lang and with great enthusiasm . This was Lang's second Western  following his favorite The return of Frank James . The German Fritz showed himself a master of the most American of genres  yet made only one more Western  Rancho Notorious. As Lang directed masterfully all kind of genres as Noir cinema as Big heat  Scarlet Street and Beyond a reasonable doubt  Epic as Nibelungs suspense as Secret beyond the door  Clash by night and Lang's trilogy about Nazi time as Cloak and dagger Man hunt and Hangmen also die and of course  SciFi with the classic Metropolis. Rating Western Union  Better than average . Well worth watching .".

Given his career history until he reached America in studio bound mono films it is a surprise that his Westerns were so successful in conventional terms. But they were. Even the least remarkable 'The Return of Frank James' is worth a viewing. Like that film here too the colour cinematography is glorious the leads sympathetic the story exciting and involving.Many of Lang's characteristic themes are here fate guiltinnocence crime and cruelty amongst them. Western fans will relish the strong part given to veteran heavy Barton MacLane as Scott's brother Jack Slade even though the resemblance is hardly striking  the sneering MacLane's face in close up daubed in war paint is a real sight to behold a highlight of the film..More unusually for Lang is the use of a comic sub plot as Herman the cook struggles against the vicissitudes of his employment. Even today this tale of woe remains amusing making one regret perhaps that the director didn't go down this route more often. Lightly handled too is the romance triangle. Scott and Young make an excellent pairing in this context and again the scenes are lightly amusing. This sort of play is more reminiscent of another German emigre Lubitsch than the more severe Lang.SPOILERThe most shocking incident in the film is undoubtedly the death of Vince Shaw at the hands of his brother. Even those like myself who have seen the film several times still hope against memory that in fact Jack Slade meets his deserved end at the receiving end of his brother's bullets. To see Scott die on screen is profoundly upsettling even though his demise is as the Hollywood code demanded avenged shortly afterwards by the grim Blake. But for long seconds as the burly villain prods Scott's body as Scott's flaxen hair flaps lifelessly we feel that the world is really out of joint.This death both inevitable and feared is a typical Lang touch  as Scott's character has been ultimately fighting against fate through the film. In fact much of the time we have been aware of a paradox one which is at the heart of the story ScottShaw is presented to us as a man of action and mystery. In fact his relationship to his brother paralyses him in every sphere except that of love. The hand that grips around Sue's locket can easily remind one of the destiny that closes on men. Ultimately Vince Shaw is as much trapped in a hostile universe as is Herman the Cook but his fall is much the greater.".

	schema:headline " Grand Western with Lang's touches and there.";
	schema:reviewBody "I doubt if the real story of the development of Western Union would ever have gained a real audience. Instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and disliked of the great Robber Barons Jay Gould. Gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant  and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival Vanderbilt's. But this while interesting is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. At least that is how audiences would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived into the modern era and invested in Hollywood he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by Indians spurred on by one Jack Slade Barton MacLane. Slade a desperado is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires Edward Creighton Dean Jagger Creighton's associate Richard Blake Robert Young and a quasilawman Vance Shaw Randolph Scott who is Slade's brother. Blake an Easterner with little understanding of the West is romancing Creighton's sister Sue Virginia Gilmore but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. But he does become a close friend of Shaw especially in trying to confront Slade.Slade was a real Western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he did not have any involvement in stirring up Indians against railroads or telegraph companies. However MacLane makes him a memorably evil and totally vicious type. His killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind  and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. But Lang is responsible for that as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young who gets a little splattered. Then there is an Indian attack which we watch from the ground level. At the conclusion Young suddenly gets splattered again but it's not brown but red that covers him. He looks up at the pole's top and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him.It is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching.".

Had he lived into the modern era and invested in Hollywood he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by Indians spurred on by one Jack Slade Barton MacLane. Slade a desperado is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires Edward Creighton Dean Jagger Creighton's associate Richard Blake Robert Young and a quasilawman Vance Shaw Randolph Scott who is Slade's brother. Blake an Easterner with little understanding of the West is romancing Creighton's sister Sue Virginia Gilmore but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. But he does become a close friend of Shaw especially in trying to confront Slade.Slade was a real Western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he did not have any involvement in stirring up Indians against railroads or telegraph companies. However MacLane makes him a memorably evil and totally vicious type. His killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind  and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. But Lang is responsible for that as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young who gets a little splattered. Then there is an Indian attack which we watch from the ground level. At the conclusion Young suddenly gets splattered again but it's not brown but red that covers him. He looks up at the pole's top and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him.It is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching.";

Vance Shaw Randolph Scott is on horseback and being pursued we know not why  he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton Dean Jagger and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that Creighton is in a bad way decides to fix him up first. This is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief clipped dialog  in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization then disappears.Cut to a few weeks or months later with Creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge but Creighton wants him anyway repaying a debt and sensing something quality. Also hired is a tenderfoot son of a benefactor of the project but atypically the Easterner Richard Blake Robert Young is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting broncobusting sequence. Both of the hires vie for Creighton's sister Sue Virginia Gilmore who  again not typically  seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. The camaraderie between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of Howard Hawks' Red River or Only Angels Have Wings than most Lang  but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter and doesn't alter our pleasure  if it does perhaps change our expectations  as the more usual Langian themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. Shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward attacks mount on the crew and Shaw has to wrestle with what if anything he is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade Barton MacLane leader of the outlaws.Beautifully shot in early Technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily Lang's best western and one of his very best films conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can get a shave you can feel like a new man but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.Genius.".

Both maintain that Mr. Hogsett had nothing to do with the sets for Western Union and that they were in fact designed by Ihnen under Day's general supervision. COMMENT A really memorable western which fully justifies its high reputation. Spectacularly produced with action aplenty agreeably acted superlatively photographed with lots of forceful Lang touches in direction. From the opening credits underlined by Buttolph's stirring score through the opening shot of the buffalo with Scott or at least his double hard riding into their midst the pace hardly ever lets up until the final unexpected fadeout. Aided by marvelous color photography the clever script which actually owes little but its title to the Zane Grey novel introduces at least six or seven rousing action episodes. All built around some particularly daring stuntwork. Good to see Robert Young doing a fair bit of his own riding but most impressive of all is Dean Jagger caught making his own leap from an overturning wagon. Of course Jagger aside from this action spot is much his usual limp blanket but at least he isn't in the movie all that much. Also slightly on the negative side of the cast roster is Virginia Gilmore a little too postcard pretty in my opinion to be wholly believable. Lack of credibility is certainly not a charge that can be leveled against Randolph Scott who is every inch your typically laconic torntwixtloveandduty western hero. Unlike Gilmore Scott really looks the part. Young is effective too. Slim Summerville is along for comic relief. Whilst some of his antics are a trifle forced we like Slim anyway. A bearded and unrecognizable were it not for his distinctively rich voice Victor Kilian makes a surprisingly effective stooge.Led by John Carradine made up to look like the Henry Hull character in Return of Frank James many of our favorite character actors can be spotted along the way including the here illfated Chill Wills in a straighter part than usual Francis Ford as the stage driver with whom Summerville tries to escape James Flavin as a member of the bank holdup posse Russell Hicks as a governor reduced to horse holder George Chandler as the victim of an Indian attack. Best of all is Barton MacLane as the notorious Jack Slade whose humor is strained by his kinship with our hero. In an interview with Peter Bogdanovich Lang remarked that audiences tend to remember the visual aspects of a film rather than the dialogue.

	schema:headline " Epic treatment of construction of transcontinental telegraph line.";
	schema:reviewBody "Obviously intended to be an epic western based on the Zane Gray novel of the same title. A rare for the times Technicolor western it concerns the trials of the telegraph line construction crew in dealing with 2 sets of antagonists 1an outlaw gang working for the Confederacy as well as for itself often dressed as Indians 2 real IndiansLakota Sioux who sometimes object to the building of the line through what they consider their hunting grounds. In contrast historically construction apparently went smoothly being completed in only 3 summer months. However the line was constructed out of Chicago instead of Missouri to hopefully avoid interference from Confederate sympathizers and in the years after it was built there was occasional sabotage by Native Americans. Also strangely historically construction toward the east and west BEGAN rather than ended at Salt Lake City not at Omaha as dramatized. This is in contrast to the first transcontinental railway. This was a rudimentary single iron wire system. Near the end of the decade a multiwired system was constructed along the path of the transcontinental railway presumably using the railway to haul equipment and provide shelter for the workmen thus making construction much easier.Robert Young was a curious choice as firstbilled. Clearly it's much more Randy Scott's picture. Perhaps this was because Young's character wasn't tainted with a history of outlawry as was Scott's and because he survives to the end of the film whereas Scott's character doesn't. In any case Young seemed rather out of place in a western usually playing aristocratic urbane characters. Although Scott sometimes played urbane characters mainly in the '30s he was also a wellestablished western character. Dean Jagger as Creighton serves as the chief engineer and office boss to Scott's main role as field boss and trouble shooter. Scott opens the film a lone rider with a posse on his tail some distance away riding through a bison herdlooks dangerous before discovering an injured Creighton whom he helps get to a stage outpost to rest up. Veteran comedian Slim Summerville serves as the unlucky and reluctant Cookie whose culinary efforts sometimes are destroyed by bumpy wagon rides invading Indians etc..

Of course this project took years instead of a few summer months to finish. Sometimes these two films get confused in people's minds because of the rather similar subject and common word union in their 2 word title.

	onyx:emotionText "Obviously intended to be an epic western based on the Zane Gray novel of the same title. A rare for the times Technicolor western it concerns the trials of the telegraph line construction crew in dealing with 2 sets of antagonists 1an outlaw gang working for the Confederacy as well as for itself often dressed as Indians 2 real IndiansLakota Sioux who sometimes object to the building of the line through what they consider their hunting grounds. In contrast historically construction apparently went smoothly being completed in only 3 summer months. However the line was constructed out of Chicago instead of Missouri to hopefully avoid interference from Confederate sympathizers and in the years after it was built there was occasional sabotage by Native Americans. Also strangely historically construction toward the east and west BEGAN rather than ended at Salt Lake City not at Omaha as dramatized. This is in contrast to the first transcontinental railway. This was a rudimentary single iron wire system. Near the end of the decade a multiwired system was constructed along the path of the transcontinental railway presumably using the railway to haul equipment and provide shelter for the workmen thus making construction much easier.Robert Young was a curious choice as firstbilled. Clearly it's much more Randy Scott's picture. Perhaps this was because Young's character wasn't tainted with a history of outlawry as was Scott's and because he survives to the end of the film whereas Scott's character doesn't. In any case Young seemed rather out of place in a western usually playing aristocratic urbane characters. Although Scott sometimes played urbane characters mainly in the '30s he was also a wellestablished western character. Dean Jagger as Creighton serves as the chief engineer and office boss to Scott's main role as field boss and trouble shooter. Scott opens the film a lone rider with a posse on his tail some distance away riding through a bison herdlooks dangerous before discovering an injured Creighton whom he helps get to a stage outpost to rest up. Veteran comedian Slim Summerville serves as the unlucky and reluctant Cookie whose culinary efforts sometimes are destroyed by bumpy wagon rides invading Indians etc..

Robert Young plays the man in charge of the mission and he hires an outlaw Randolph Scott to keep enemies off. You'd think someone like Lang wouldn't be too good at making a film about the Old West but with this Jesse James and its sequel he makes for some rather entertaining films which certainly stand out in his career. The entire film pretty much works due to the performances with Young and Scott doing great work together. Scott steals the film whenever he's on the screen but Dean Jagger John Carradine and Virginia Gilmore are also very good. You could complain about how the Indians are portrayed but I won't do that because the film is entertaining for these reasons. There's one scene where a drunken Indian looks for whiskey which is so incredibly bad that it's hilarious. The big fire scene is excellent as is the big battle with the Indians.".

	schema:headline " cutesy movie with a bad monster but little violence";
	schema:reviewBody "This was sort of a cute movie nothing too great.It starts off with a precredits sequence of people getting dragged into their closets or walking into their closets only to be attacked by something. We don't see the attack since the camera takes a side view of the open closet door and we hear screaming and cartoonish monster eating noises as clothing is tossed out of the closet. John Carradine has a small role as one of these people and blind man violently smashing his cane around his apartment looking for his guide dog who the monster hung on the closet door.We then meet a reporter who looks a lot like Superman's alterego Clark Kent complete with big blackrimmed Clark Kent eyeglasses. He's named Richard Clark. He got his job at the paper through nepotism and only does obituaries but her wants something more. The lead reporter Scoop gives him a threeweek old story about the people dying in their closets as a laugh.Clark befriends a young boy at the police station while waiting to talk to the chief there. The boy is a bespectacled small version of himself perhaps. He's doing some kind of experiment recording all different kinds of sounds while his mother  a teacher at the local college where some of the deaths occurred  talks to the chief explaining how the bite marks found on the victims are somewhat consistent with snake bites. Clark angers the bespectacled mother by having let the boy have a chocolate bar. Everyone including the mother calls the boy The Professor.Clark also meets an Albert Einsteinlooking Nobel Prizawinning professor at the college and gives him a claw he found at one of the crime scenes. We also see that the mother becomes speechlessly motionlessly smitten with Clark every time he takes his glasses off.They soon see the monster who starts coming out of closets. There are elements of Alien and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to the monster and their attempts to communicate with it.This movie could be appropriate for children although be forewarned that there is a brief topless scene. A bit surprising for a PGrated movie but not altogether without precedent. Baby Secret of the Lost Legend 1985 had a lot more. The scene it occurs in is one early in the movie and comically spoofs the shower scene in Hitchcock's Psycho.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was sort of a cute movie nothing too great.It starts off with a precredits sequence of people getting dragged into their closets or walking into their closets only to be attacked by something. We don't see the attack since the camera takes a side view of the open closet door and we hear screaming and cartoonish monster eating noises as clothing is tossed out of the closet. John Carradine has a small role as one of these people and blind man violently smashing his cane around his apartment looking for his guide dog who the monster hung on the closet door.We then meet a reporter who looks a lot like Superman's alterego Clark Kent complete with big blackrimmed Clark Kent eyeglasses. He's named Richard Clark. He got his job at the paper through nepotism and only does obituaries but her wants something more. The lead reporter Scoop gives him a threeweek old story about the people dying in their closets as a laugh.Clark befriends a young boy at the police station while waiting to talk to the chief there. The boy is a bespectacled small version of himself perhaps. He's doing some kind of experiment recording all different kinds of sounds while his mother  a teacher at the local college where some of the deaths occurred  talks to the chief explaining how the bite marks found on the victims are somewhat consistent with snake bites. Clark angers the bespectacled mother by having let the boy have a chocolate bar. Everyone including the mother calls the boy The Professor.Clark also meets an Albert Einsteinlooking Nobel Prizawinning professor at the college and gives him a claw he found at one of the crime scenes. We also see that the mother becomes speechlessly motionlessly smitten with Clark every time he takes his glasses off.They soon see the monster who starts coming out of closets. There are elements of Alien and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to the monster and their attempts to communicate with it.This movie could be appropriate for children although be forewarned that there is a brief topless scene.

The film kicks off with a few mysterious murders and it's not long before the horrible closet monster is revealed. The monster itself is an extremely camp creation and is sure to leave most audience members in stitches  not usually the desired effect for a monster but the film is obviously intended to be tongue in cheek and the monster is actually a very original creation. I really wasn't expecting anything at all decent from this film but in fairness to it it's actually quite decent. There's nothing particularly clever about it though the idea of the monster 'recharging' in closets is nice in that it seems to be a hamfisted way of explaining the whole closet monster idea. The characters and plot line surrounding the monster are interesting and entertaining and Monster in the Closet is at least a decent way to waste ninety minutes or so.".

In the end you can't feel but sorry for his demise. A la Godzilla! This movie should be watched for it's cult status and for nostalgic reasons. Don't expect cool fx makeup plot or even score.

There is a funny shower scene with a nude Stella Stevens that is worth watching.  To me it was the highlight of the movie.  It was also interesting to see a young Paul Walker of Fast and Furious fame as a nerdy kid named Professor. 2 stars out of 4 and that is only because of the shower scene.".

Instead this silly Troma film concentrates on what the studio specialises in dumb comedy and even dumber horror with a smattering of topless female nudity courtesy of middleaged MILF Stella Stevens. It's all extremely daft the gags weak and the monster a hilarious zgrade rubber creation with an Alienlike extendable mandible but it's reasonably undemanding fun for those who enjoy schlock.From a technical standpoint the film does rise above the usual Troma output with smart editing and plenty of impressive fluid camera movement including what I believe to be Louma crane shots so much so that I was surprised to see that director Bob Dahlin didn't go onto bigger and better things on the contrary this was his only ever movie as director. The film also benefits from a cast of familiar faces that includes Donald Moffat Claude Akins John Carradine and Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas in her movie debut.4.5 rounded up to 5 for managing to show Stella Stevens in the shower not once but three times!".

Bertolt Brecht Bierbichler is about to leave his lakeside house among the tall birches in Brandenburg to return to Berlin for the upcoming theater season. Most of the women in his life are there his wife Helene Weigel Bleibtreu his daughter Barbara his old lover Ruth Berlau his latest flame the actress Kthe Reichel and sensuous Isot Kilian whose affections and body he shares with the rebel political activist Wolfgang Harich. The friends and lovers swim write eat drink and philosophize about art politics and life as the Stasi lurks all the while on the sidelines waiting. The serenity of the country on this summer day stands in marked contrast to the storm of jealousy and egomania betrayal and dashed hopes at whose center Brecht is trapped struggling to make plans for a future that fate will end only days later. A brilliant ensemble cast and music by John Cale complement this fascinating portrait ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film overall especially in its portrayal of Brecht's efforts to keep harmony within the little harem he'd created for himself. Nonetheless I have some objections to the political overtones of the film. The film unfortunately reinforces the old anticommunist clich of life in the DDR 'East Germany' as a nightmarish existence under a police state and we are introduced to that idea early on when the Stasi the DDR's FBI come knocking at the door to inquire about one of Brecht's guests Wolfgang Harich. And it certainly comes as no surprise to anyone that the Brechts' summer vacation ends with Harich's arrestmoreover there's the suggestion that in politics Brecht's soontoend life came down to just that turning a blind eye to the oppressive character of the DDR.There's a bit of historical distortion here however. Harich was active in the SED the DDR's Communist Party for a number of years and known to be in opposition to the existing leadership as he attempted to articulate and rally support for a 'third path' between capitalism and bureaucratic socialism a socalled 'humane socialism.' He was not arrested by the Stasi at the end of the summer of 1956 but rather in November of that year. What's the dif? Well in the fall of 1956 there occurred the uprising in Hungary which eventually took on virulently antiSoviet overtones with the consequence that it was interpreted by all the regimes in the 'socialist' bloc as lifethreatening. In other words Harich's arrest was not so much evidence of the DDR's inability to tolerate dissenting ideas as it was a measure of the state of international geopolitical tensions at that time don't forget similar things had gone on in the US with the anticommunist witch hunts. In fact Harich after his release from prison in 1964 went on to publish and teach in the DDR he continued to argue for German reunification under socialist auspices and for greater attention to environmental concerns under socialism he traveled to the West and always returned to the DDR though opportunities to 'defect' were not lacking and after the collapse of the DDR refused to testify against those who had imprisoned him in 1956. He remained a lifelong proponent of a socialist society and economy in which the human values of friendship and community solidarity and equality health and environment culture and enlightenment would hold sway over the commercialization of all aspects of life that is our fate under capitalism. And he firmly believed that however warped the socialism of the DDR had been in the past it contained the seeds for evolving in the right direction.I also find objectionable the suggestion that Brecht himself was complicit in the DDR's oppressiveness at least to the extent that he failed to publicly denounce Ulbrecht the DDR's leader at the time and his regime. I think it fair to say that someone who objected to many aspects of the DDR regime but still wished to hold on to his influence with the leaders would necessarily walk a dangerous tightrope and it is no easy matter to judge whether Brecht would have served the cause of humane socialism better had he spoken out more forcefully against Ulbrecht's regime though obviously that would make for better cinema.".

Most of the audience including myself were less concerned about the film's historic accuracy than its portrayal of Brecht's hareem and the tensions that seem to always accompany such an arrangement. Brecht's poetry plays a role but the politics seemed to be there just to set up tension between the two male leads. I thought the periodic shots of different members of the family swimming was an interesting way of showing escape. The device of setting the movie in a single day with the chiming clock to mark time was also effective. The violent end of the story which you are set up for in the first few minutes was very jarring nonetheless.".

People who know Brecht's biography and his work recognize that the director succeeded in rendering even small details as perfect as possible. When I saw that Sepp Bierbichler plays Brecht I thought that's not possible. However he surprised once more with his versatility. Monica Bleibtreu as Helene Weigel is simply incredibly good. Besides the main roles the hitherto unknown actress Margit Rogall in the role of Brecht's collaborator Ruth Berlau is miraculous.Besides offering a great cast the film deals with a Brecht who has lost hope in the New Germany called DDR  or GDR in English  but has not the force anymore to protest. So he is widely adjusted and swallows his resignation as an inner emigration into himself. As one knows Brecht died already with 58 from a heart attack. Partially one gets the impression that the director focused specifically Brechtconnoisseurs as audience although this is not a necessary condition to understand the movie. For example when Ruth Berlau jumps out of her seat crying that Brecht's daughter wanted to burn her  Berlau died in the Charit Hospital in Berlin from a fire that she caused by her cigarette  and this is exactly what she is doing in the movie. Or we see Brecht very uncomfortably sitting in his chair trying to but not succeeding in writing  Brecht used to write standing on specially high desks. Shortly before Brecht leaves his summer residence in Buckow young GDRpioneers are reciting for him one of his famous lovepoems from Baal  at that time Brecht may have known that with the summer also his lifetime has gone.".

	schema:headline " Larissa Shepitko's Ultimate Statement?";
	schema:reviewBody "PROSHCHANIE S MATYOROY presents two speculative and unanswerable questions 1. How much of this film is from the mind of and therefore is the work of Larisa Shepitko and 2. What insight as to the possible direction of Shepitko's further career can be projected outward from this.PROSHCHANIE S MATYOROY or FAREWELL was adapted from a novel which makes it doubly difficult to discern the Shepitko touch. The story concerns an island whose community must abandon it because a new dam is being built to create a vast deep lake which will inundate the island. I was about to write 'forever' but recently a town buried when the Colorado River was damned to create a lake decades ago has recently come out of its Brigadoon like slumber due to a decade long drought.Ecology is definitely the message of the film but as it was a 70s film but the scientific urgency was not so much an issue as the spiritual cultural and social meanings of man's mastery of nature. There is a Lawrencian connection between nature and the life force. And the priests in this nature worship were the witches of old who communicated with nature and bore the responsibility of being a bridge between people and nature. This is not just tree hugging but full blown nature intercourse. In this case the disaster is somewhat literal as Man becomes the King of Nature.The future the postMatyora era is first symbolized by the astounding ugliness of a passing barge it's discordant and synthetic appearance contrasted with the harmoniousness of the island's nature. The fact that the dam is to provide electricity is emphasized by the hypnotizing image of a flickering and rolling BW TV with a pop show of surpassingly vulgarity and artificiality interrupted by an appearance of cosmonauts in space broadcasting from what seems to be a very crowded studio apartment.Previously the island's culture had been expressed as the community celebrated events connected to the passing of the seasons and of the crop cycles. These celebrations are lusty without being bawdy stemming from their origins in fertility and fecundity. This is straight out of Lawrence.When the tree cutters arrive at the beginning of the picture they are dressed in modern industrial garb but resemble the invading Mongol's Golden Hord. The great central image of the film is one great tree at the center of the island. Its girth and hardness defeats the tree cutters. They attempt to bulldoze it and finally try to burn it. That fails. This is another Shepitko concordance with the work of Tarkowsky whose last film's last image was a burning tree.The islanders have no choice in the matter. They must evacuate the island and as the waters rise those closest to the shore leave. The houses some of whose intricate detail and exquisite design would make the readers of the Sunday Times hearts flutter are burned. One wants to say 'unceremoniously'. The last to leave is the high priestess of the nature cult. Before she leaves she spends the entire night laboriously and ruthlessly scrubbing her house in every nook and cranny and even whitewashing the chimney. Masses of flowers are brought in until they fill every corner and bower. Then she walks out and walks away as the men' burn her house. This is her farewell.The islanders are collected a development being built for them. They are going to live in apartment blocks the noisy streets filled with motorbikes the sense of existing in a world and not on a world now lost forever. That is what the film is about a lost world perhaps one of many lost worlds being drowned by what passes for progress taking with them cultures communities skills a rich earthy spirituality and a harmony with nature. In exchange for a prefabricated hell complete with gimcrack culture and official atheism which we now see was merely the obverse of contemporary evangelism based on material greed sexual fear and the superstition that if one loudly and publicly believes in God that all one's inside straights will be filled.Though similar in theme to WILD RIVER 1960 FAREWELL differs greatly as the American film takes the legalistic and personal view while Shepitko examines the spiritual. In the light of the present ecological crisis it is FAREWELL which retains its relevancy because it questions the ultimate benefit of destroying nature for some progress of questionable or even dubious value.The film that FAREWELL most resembles is Michael Powell's EDGE OF THE WORLD 1937. It's an interesting contrast between culturs. The fertility ritual on this stark Hebridean isle is climbing the sheer cliffs a dour and individual rite as opposed to the communal celebration of music and feast on Matyora.The word constantly repeated throughout the film seems to be Hawatchit!  'enough'?. That might have been the title of the far more serious film that Shepiyko might make today. The 'what' and 'why' of what we are doing not only to the environment but to the cultural and spiritual life on this planet are answered by a big really big  ENOUGH! Whatever Shepitko surely wouldn't have been toting the party line for another decade and post Soviet might have found her even more vociferously disdainful of the corruption and material excesses of the new order. Shepitko might even be more in trouble in the Russia of the oligarchs and gangsters for whom despoiling the environment is merely a cash transaction. The Clinton administration rejected Kyoto because it would effect the US economy. Imagine what the murderous crew running things in Russia would do if environmentalism effected their money supply? Then again that is speculative and unanswerable. Shepitko always avoided glib opportunism for deeper truth. Her few works can only be a sad evidence to the great artist we have lost and to remind us of the great works of art we'll never know.".

In this case the disaster is somewhat literal as Man becomes the King of Nature.The future the postMatyora era is first symbolized by the astounding ugliness of a passing barge it's discordant and synthetic appearance contrasted with the harmoniousness of the island's nature. The fact that the dam is to provide electricity is emphasized by the hypnotizing image of a flickering and rolling BW TV with a pop show of surpassingly vulgarity and artificiality interrupted by an appearance of cosmonauts in space broadcasting from what seems to be a very crowded studio apartment.Previously the island's culture had been expressed as the community celebrated events connected to the passing of the seasons and of the crop cycles. These celebrations are lusty without being bawdy stemming from their origins in fertility and fecundity. This is straight out of Lawrence.When the tree cutters arrive at the beginning of the picture they are dressed in modern industrial garb but resemble the invading Mongol's Golden Hord. The great central image of the film is one great tree at the center of the island. Its girth and hardness defeats the tree cutters. They attempt to bulldoze it and finally try to burn it. That fails. This is another Shepitko concordance with the work of Tarkowsky whose last film's last image was a burning tree.The islanders have no choice in the matter. They must evacuate the island and as the waters rise those closest to the shore leave. The houses some of whose intricate detail and exquisite design would make the readers of the Sunday Times hearts flutter are burned. One wants to say 'unceremoniously'. The last to leave is the high priestess of the nature cult. Before she leaves she spends the entire night laboriously and ruthlessly scrubbing her house in every nook and cranny and even whitewashing the chimney. Masses of flowers are brought in until they fill every corner and bower. Then she walks out and walks away as the men' burn her house. This is her farewell.The islanders are collected a development being built for them. They are going to live in apartment blocks the noisy streets filled with motorbikes the sense of existing in a world and not on a world now lost forever. That is what the film is about a lost world perhaps one of many lost worlds being drowned by what passes for progress taking with them cultures communities skills a rich earthy spirituality and a harmony with nature. In exchange for a prefabricated hell complete with gimcrack culture and official atheism which we now see was merely the obverse of contemporary evangelism based on material greed sexual fear and the superstition that if one loudly and publicly believes in God that all one's inside straights will be filled.Though similar in theme to WILD RIVER 1960 FAREWELL differs greatly as the American film takes the legalistic and personal view while Shepitko examines the spiritual. In the light of the present ecological crisis it is FAREWELL which retains its relevancy because it questions the ultimate benefit of destroying nature for some progress of questionable or even dubious value.The film that FAREWELL most resembles is Michael Powell's EDGE OF THE WORLD 1937. It's an interesting contrast between culturs. The fertility ritual on this stark Hebridean isle is climbing the sheer cliffs a dour and individual rite as opposed to the communal celebration of music and feast on Matyora.The word constantly repeated throughout the film seems to be Hawatchit!  'enough'?. That might have been the title of the far more serious film that Shepiyko might make today. The 'what' and 'why' of what we are doing not only to the environment but to the cultural and spiritual life on this planet are answered by a big really big  ENOUGH! Whatever Shepitko surely wouldn't have been toting the party line for another decade and post Soviet might have found her even more vociferously disdainful of the corruption and material excesses of the new order. Shepitko might even be more in trouble in the Russia of the oligarchs and gangsters for whom despoiling the environment is merely a cash transaction. The Clinton administration rejected Kyoto because it would effect the US economy. Imagine what the murderous crew running things in Russia would do if environmentalism effected their money supply? Then again that is speculative and unanswerable. Shepitko always avoided glib opportunism for deeper truth. Her few works can only be a sad evidence to the great artist we have lost and to remind us of the great works of art we'll never know.";

Also Micheal has captured the eyes of a Columbia student who works at a nearby record store who is very persistent.

	schema:headline " Three people  two relationships";
	schema:reviewBody "Bill Sherwood made one film in his short life. Fortunately for us it was this one Parting Glances. This brilliant overachieving little film is about three people and two relationships. Michael is at the center of both. Michael and Robert are going to part in 24 hours after being together for more than five years. There is a mystery surrounding why. They are still very much in love share a healthy and beautiful amount of intimacy during the 48 hours this film spans have a great home together and receive loving support from numerous and various friends and coworkers. So why is Robert moving to Africa for two years to work for the World Health Organization? The answer it turns out is complex. Enter Nick the doe eyed voluptuous lipped silky haired exboyfriend of Michael played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi.Without spoiling the skillful and overwhelmingly human unfolding of this riddle let me just say that Nick and Michael shared a youthful past that is heartbreaking because sometime in the near future only one of them will still be around. They were once a couple. But it was at a time in their lives when at least one of them wasn't ready to settle down. They enjoyed mischief carelessness and each other at a time when everything was new and the world had no boundaries. Their lives during that time is shown in pieces as flashbacks. The flashbacks are the thoughts memories and overpowering feelings that they carry with them still. They appear in dreams while napping. Or when Michael looks at a photo series of boardwalks on Fire Island a place where they literally spent their youth. There are many very subtle but very moving and revealing moments in this film. None more than when Nick Steve Buscemi sits on Michael's lap looks him straight in the eye and as he draws his fingers over his lips mouths the words I love you. And your heart drops into your stomach...But Nick and Michael haven't been together for more than five years because Michael and Robert are a firmly established couple and seemingly happy. So why the split? That's the crux of this film. This film is about the complexities of love and relationships. Love tests the limits of everyone who goes near it. Some can handle it. Some struggle. Robert is struggling and he wants a break because things have become predictable. Ever heard that one before? Of course it's BS but how the truth is parsed out over 90 minutes is what makes Parting Glances a wonderful film that aims at the heart and hits a bullseye. This film was made before the internet existed before computers cell phones texting Grinder apps laptops modems halogen light bulbs and even CD's. When this film was made people still spoke on land line phones with rotary dials played vinyl records on a turntable to hear music used pay phones and the yellow pages. And to see Africa on a map you had to open a World Atlas book that was the size of a breakfast table. And yet it is a very modern film. And it endures today because of its humanity which will outlive anything we invent next. At our core we still want our hearts to be touched and this film does that. In a scene that takes place in a stairwell there is a conversation between Nick who has seen it all and a young gay man who is seeing it all for the first time. The polarity in that scene and between these two lives a young man who is staring down the end of his young life and a younger who man who is staring wild eyed into the future is unforgettable. And it is just one of many unforgettable moments in this powerful little film.It is impossible to overstate two things. One is the incredible talent of Bill Sherwood who wrote directed edited and scored this film. God bless him he had something he wanted to say before he left this world in his thirties and he said it. Parting Glances is one of the best films ever made that deals with the complexities and ordinariness of people who are incidentally gay. The other is Steve Buscemi who's previous film roles immediately prior to Parting Glances was Dead Pimp in No Picnic 1986. I haven't seen No Picnic but it kinda sounds like he didn't even have a line in it. In this film however he owns the role of Nick with a half past give a crap attitude that masks his fear over the loss he knows he's about to experience. He is sweet touching charming desirable and a smart ass. It is a Steve Buscemi that we never saw again. But his talent can't be missed and this role is unlike anything he did after. Watch this film. I saw it for the first time in the mid 80's and have come back to it again and again over the years. It has aged very well. Its basic humanity and story about love will never die. And maybe that was why Bill Sherwood gave us this treasure. So that we would never forget what this is all supposed to be about. Spoiler alert stop reading if you haven't seen it yet. It all ends well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Parting Glances was made in 1984 and had a somewhat limited release in 1986 and is without a doubt a powerful and important film in the genre that is gay cinema. It was one of the very first American films to feature the then relatively new disease of HIVAIDS at a time when much was still unknown about the disease and prejudice against it was at its highest. Bill Sherwood the writer and director passed away from an AIDS related complication in 1990 Parting Glances was his first and last film.The main aspect of the story focuses on a New York gay couple Robert and Michael in their twenties. Robert is heading off on an incredibly long assignment for the World Health Organisation to deepest darkest and most isolated Africa Michael his partner is staying behind. The film is set out over the two days prior to Robert's departure with some scenes taking place at an amusing farewell party hosted by the couple's friend Joan. Some other scenes take place at a dinner party thrown by Richard's unconventional boss and there is a whole bulk with Nick an old friend and exlover of Michael's who happens to be living with AIDS.The script is fun witty exciting and interesting some of the lines given to the character of Nick are so sharp they cut the dialogue like acid through skin they really are that potent. There are many different character types populating the movie especially at the party scenes which show off New York's society rather well and make you hanker for a live in Manhattan in the early eighties.Parting Glances was one of the first movies to deal with the subject of AIDS in such a frank direct and honest way which for the time was a real revelation. It did not gloss over nor shy away from the implications or the savagery associated with the disease at a time when everything like it was still new. There are some deeply searching moments not least when Nick talks of the decadent and hedonistic days back in the freedom of the seventies creeping into the early eighties. This low budget but important film was made on a budget of a couple of dollars over 40000 which in movie terms is not even the shell on a peanut. The shooting was completed in a whirlwind seven days which is remarkable to say the least you'd certainly not think it was made that quickly when you watch it. I am fond of this movie it may seem a little dated at first but then we are going back almost thirty years since it was made so it is bound to show some signs of age. Yet through an exceptionally shrewd script and some talented acting the complexities and nuances of the human relationships shine on the screen yes even now after all this time they still have the power to move. I would suggest a couple of viewings are required to get the full impact of this film to the innocent virginal viewer otherwise you might not catch some of the intriguingly witty throw away lines peppering the dialogue.

	onyx:emotionText "Parting Glances was made in 1984 and had a somewhat limited release in 1986 and is without a doubt a powerful and important film in the genre that is gay cinema. It was one of the very first American films to feature the then relatively new disease of HIVAIDS at a time when much was still unknown about the disease and prejudice against it was at its highest. Bill Sherwood the writer and director passed away from an AIDS related complication in 1990 Parting Glances was his first and last film.The main aspect of the story focuses on a New York gay couple Robert and Michael in their twenties. Robert is heading off on an incredibly long assignment for the World Health Organisation to deepest darkest and most isolated Africa Michael his partner is staying behind. The film is set out over the two days prior to Robert's departure with some scenes taking place at an amusing farewell party hosted by the couple's friend Joan. Some other scenes take place at a dinner party thrown by Richard's unconventional boss and there is a whole bulk with Nick an old friend and exlover of Michael's who happens to be living with AIDS.The script is fun witty exciting and interesting some of the lines given to the character of Nick are so sharp they cut the dialogue like acid through skin they really are that potent.

The ending was not expected and made Steve Buscemi's character look like a guy with a lot of class. Casting was great and the acting was like I was watching a normal group of people dealing with AIDS. And guess what none of the main characters die in the movie.

It simply presents the characters on the screen as people dealing with their lives careers and relationships as best they could in the early dark days of the AIDS pandemic. I suppose it would hard for me to describe to a younger viewer how much of a revelation this was to us in 1986.While it certainly lacks the rough edgy quality of The New Queer Cinema works that followed a few short years later it is their clear cultural and cinematic antecedent.Screening this film for the first time in over a decade last week it hardly seems dated where some of the movies that followed seem locked in a specific time and place.As much as things have changed in the 25 years since I'd dragged so many friends to the theater about a dozen times to see Parting Glances so much has stayed the same... except that I am still alive and so many of those friends have since perished.While I might be accused of seeing the film through a nostalgic haze I am certain in my opinion that in terms of gay cinema Parting Glances represents a turning point as important as Welles' Citizen Kane or Godard's Breathless.

	schema:reviewBody "Forget about Making Love Cruising and Partners. Parting Glances is where real gay filmmakers began putting their ideas onto screen much like writers had been doing on stage for years. Parting Glances is set in Manhattan where two lovers Richard Ganoung and John Bolger prepare to part while Bolger goes overseas on a long business venture. Ganoung's exlover Steve Buscemi in his breakout role is HIV positive and possibly dying and Bolger knows that he risks loosing Ganoung while he's gone. A group of their friends hosted by The Drew Carey Show's Kathy Kinney as far from Mimi here as she can be show up for a surprise farewell party in her SoHo apartment and like the party of Boys in the Band and those in gay cult classics Auntie Mame and Breakfast at Tiffany's will be unforgettable.It is here where the audience meets all sorts of gay prototypes from a former priest still to shy to fully accept his homosexuality the cute twink record store clerk with a crush on Ganoung the wealthy but overweight queen who seems to buy companionship and the various artistic types both straight and gay who interject some minor conflicts into the proceedings. There's also a visit to a Chelsea Club where the music of Bronski Beat is heard in the background to give the film a true 80's feel.The film has some very slow moments particularly a dinner party with Bolger's boss and his wife which are important in setting up various plot elements but once you get to Kinney's party its all set to go. Kinney is unforgettable her warmhearted pal so comfortable that you long to have her in your own circle. I can say having met Ms. Kinney that this is very close to her own personality rather than the obnoxious overly mascara'd Mimi.

Their revenge against the portly queen in one of the final scenes is hysterical even if it is a bit cruel spirited... This film for me had a very special meaning in the mid 1980's as it gave me the courage to open up to myself the truth of my own sexuality and I'm sure it had the same influence on others afraid to come out during the early years of HIV. The issue is strongly dealt with through Ganoung's character who vows to fight Washington while dealing with his knowledge that Buscemi might succumb to AIDS eventually.

	onyx:emotionText "Forget about Making Love Cruising and Partners. Parting Glances is where real gay filmmakers began putting their ideas onto screen much like writers had been doing on stage for years. Parting Glances is set in Manhattan where two lovers Richard Ganoung and John Bolger prepare to part while Bolger goes overseas on a long business venture. Ganoung's exlover Steve Buscemi in his breakout role is HIV positive and possibly dying and Bolger knows that he risks loosing Ganoung while he's gone. A group of their friends hosted by The Drew Carey Show's Kathy Kinney as far from Mimi here as she can be show up for a surprise farewell party in her SoHo apartment and like the party of Boys in the Band and those in gay cult classics Auntie Mame and Breakfast at Tiffany's will be unforgettable.It is here where the audience meets all sorts of gay prototypes from a former priest still to shy to fully accept his homosexuality the cute twink record store clerk with a crush on Ganoung the wealthy but overweight queen who seems to buy companionship and the various artistic types both straight and gay who interject some minor conflicts into the proceedings. There's also a visit to a Chelsea Club where the music of Bronski Beat is heard in the background to give the film a true 80's feel.The film has some very slow moments particularly a dinner party with Bolger's boss and his wife which are important in setting up various plot elements but once you get to Kinney's party its all set to go. Kinney is unforgettable her warmhearted pal so comfortable that you long to have her in your own circle. I can say having met Ms. Kinney that this is very close to her own personality rather than the obnoxious overly mascara'd Mimi.

The vignettes that Klapisch has painted for this movie are full of bittersweet humor and energy. For example the scenes where they're deciding what party to join what demonstrations be part of what organizations to form trying to get into the feminists group. If we form a club we'd let you in. It shows young adults on the brink of adulthood yet still able to fight the urge for responsibility at least for a little while. It very much informs the viewer of later Klapisch works like L'auberge Espagnole and Les Poupees Russes. Klapsich is particularly adept at honing in on one character while at the same time the painting the periphery characters with the same multidimesional brush.It is both a sad and happy film at the end and very much true to life.

	schema:reviewBody "Basically Cdric Klapisch's second long feature movie had known a genesis like Duel 1971 by Steven Spielberg. It was to be shot for the television and broadcast on the FrancoGerman channel Arte. But it was eventually exploited in the French theaters. This film partly autobiographic brings out a deep nostalgia through the realist vision on which it focuses. It's the story of a bunch of friends who are gathered for the waiting of Sophie's childbirth and they especially remember their memories when they were in high school teachers girls drugs demonstrations etc... They were inseparable and motivated by a strong thirst for living.The movie is constructed like a long and vibrant flashback momentarily interrupted by sequences of the present moment. To understand the whole movie let's quote the director's opinion about his work the action takes place in 1975 a year of transition between the seventies and the eighties between a collectivist and individualistic time. If we don't really feel the individualist side on another hand the collectivist feeling is very evident. In 1975 society is divided in several faces including 2 significant ones. There are the ones who try to conserve a hippy attitude and the others aware of the economic problems of their time and decided to fight them notably through demonstrations where solidarity was a strong asset rise of unemployment. It is precisely these economic difficulties at the time considered as not important but which later in the eighties were to rise sharply making the society enter an individualistic sphere with the evaporation of solidarity. Grard Jugnot will clearly show it in his film une poque formidable 1991. But this transition is also made at the level of the main characters' mentality. They are presented as carefree and rowdy teenagers who will become conscientious grownups the baccalaurat is a sort of frontier between these two worlds.What makes le pril jeune so enthralling is that it is mostly filled with dialogs as straight as a die which often cleave through the air revealing Klapisch's great ease with his topic. Sketching his characters with a touch of irony and tenderness he is supported by a group of young actors all remarkable and we are really under the impression that they fully blossom in their respective roles. I watched a documentary about the film in which the actors have excellent memories about the shooting. Besides thanks to le pril jeune Klapisch made a name for Romain Duris who was to become Klapisch's favorite actors Vincent Elbaz and Elodie Bouchez and he contributed in launching their careers in French cinema. In another extent it would be unfair to neglect the rest of the cast just outstanding because most of the secondary characters escape from a tempting caricature the headmaster the teachers.It is also useful to add that Klpaisch brilliantly uses his camera to shot sequences of the present moment when the friends are in the hospital he sticks it in front of them and nearly doesn't move it. Whereas in the long flashback his camera is constantly moving. Then humor is well present throughout the movie but it doesn't stop it from ending on a dramatic note since we learn Tomasi's death due to the drug. Moreover we leave the projection with a little of melancholy as if disillusions had eventually prevailed over hopes even if the very last shot shows us the four friends running with frenzy in the street.Klapisch moves up a rung in comparison with his previous movie riens du tout 1992 and signs here a movie that enchants us. This joy which treats the eyes is all the more intense as the director's forthcoming movies un air de famille 1996 l'auberge espagnole 2002 will be equal to the hopes. At last le pril jeune should revive good old youth memories to the ones who were students in the seventies.".

There's a naturalness that comes across supremely easily he is never patronising to either his audience or his actors and he's keen to show all aspects from the good and happy to really quite dark and bad.Klapisch regular lead man Romain Duris here plays Tomasi whose friends gather as their pregnant friend Sophie's about to go into labour at the Paris maternity unit. Minus Tomasi though as we're already told that he died just one month prior from an overdose and as they wait they look back over and reminisce all the years when they met at school.We're talking about the 1970s and so all the fashions and music are here. Klapisch always seems to include sex scenes and here we get quite trippy drugtaking too. All five of our characters were active in some rebellious pursuit or another and in the days of political activism we see them fight for their causes. There's all the excitable antics of youth showing off exploring the opposite sex and much else including living in a communal squat.Despite this film being almost unknown  look at the number of reviews here and on IMDb  this is a very well made and satisfying film with a sparkling script. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you can just watch it as it is without pretence or need of justification. Unlike some French drama that can be 'charming' there's no room for whimsy here. And not too exaggerated like many US youth films but believable and thus satisfying. And because it's another culture to our own endlessly fascinating too.".

Minus Tomasi though as we're already told that he died just one month prior from an overdose and as they wait they look back over and reminisce all the years when they met at school.We're talking about the 1970s and so all the fashions and music are here. Klapisch always seems to include sex scenes and here we get quite trippy drugtaking too. All five of our characters were active in some rebellious pursuit or another and in the days of political activism we see them fight for their causes. There's all the excitable antics of youth showing off exploring the opposite sex and much else including living in a communal squat.Despite this film being almost unknown  look at the number of reviews here and on IMDb  this is a very well made and satisfying film with a sparkling script. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you can just watch it as it is without pretence or need of justification. Unlike some French drama that can be 'charming' there's no room for whimsy here. And not too exaggerated like many US youth films but believable and thus satisfying. And because it's another culture to our own endlessly fascinating too.";

While many viewers find this 138 minute film boring and plot less there is a flavor here that could only be captured by this team.Shanghai 1936. While the disruptions in global existence created by World War I have created fearful evacuees of many countries to the old city of Shanghai those migrs survive by any means possible. Todd Jackson Ralph Fiennes is an American diplomat who lost his wife daughter and eyesight in an accident and lives his blind existence visiting the music bars for solace. His dream is to own a musicdanceentertainment club and his fortune is changed by winning at horse racing. He encounters Countess Sofia Belinskya Natasha Richardson a woman of Russian royalty who has fled Russia with the fall of the Czars with her daughter Katya Madeleine Daly and her aunts Princess Vera Belinskya Vanessa Redgrave and Olga Belinskya Lynn Redgrave and Greshenka Madeleine Potter who live in a tiny loathsome apartment and are dependent entirely upon Sofia's income as a dance hostess in a seedy club. In their building lives Mr. Feinstein Allan Corduner and his Jewish family who likewise have sought asylum in Shanghai and who proffers kindness to Sofia's plight.Jackson's winnings afford him the luxury of opening 'The White Countess' club at the encouragement of his Japanese friend Mr. Matsuda Hiroyuki Sanada and realizing Sofia's dignity and needs Jackson makes Sofia the sophisticated hostess of his club. The dance of preWorld War II grows from a distant echo into a reality with the insidious growth in numbers of Japanese soldiers and soon the truth of the Japanese imperialism intentions becomes evident. The migrs begin to escape Shanghai and in the midst of Sofia's family's escape to Hong Kong her aunts make it known that Sofia must stay in Shanghai her work as a dance hall hostess would smear their reputation as they return to a position of royalty! Jackson and Feinstein intervene to prevent Sofia's loss of her daughter and the slowly evolving relationship between Jackson and Sofia is clarified.There is plenty of plot for the active mind in this story and in the style of Merchant Ivory productions the story unfolds gradually layer upon layer in a study of atmosphere embroidered by words. The setting is stunningly beautiful to see and the unfolding of the story is as painfully slow as the life of displaced people in a foreign city can be. Times change moods alter events metamorphose and at the end of the film the events of the story are well braided. Natasha Richardson is radiant as Sofia a woman of style who graciously does what it takes to survive. The Redgrave sisters exude the embarrassment of being bereft of their regal breeding in the squalor of Shanghai. Fiennes is a broken man with so much pride that he fears vulnerability. Sanada embodies the elegance and grace with which the Japanese adroitly usurped China into their Great Plan.Yes the film could use some editing but one can understand why editor John David Allen would have had difficulty in cutting the beauty of the cinematography of Christopher Doyle and YiuFai Lai capturing the costumes of John Bright and the sets of Andrew Sanders and Qi Bian. This film is more an atmosphere than story and requires the viewer to submit to the manner of relating the tale. But in the end it is a beautiful work and sadly the last of a series of great films by an incomparable team. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I had an opportunity to see this movie at a screening. The White Countess is not scheduled to open in theaters until December so it was a very early screening. I am saying this because I have a little bit of doubt that what I saw was the final cut.Based on a screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro The Saddest Music in the World and the original novel for the movie Remains of the Day and featuring a magnificent cast including Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave in addition to Fiennes and Richardson this last MerchantIvory film Ismail Merchant died this year has bred a great expectation in movie lovers' hearts. I regret to say what I saw was not the best of MerchantIvory.It is Shanghai in 1930s where all different sorts of Europeans and Americans established their ways of living inside the ancient Chinese city. The story is about an American middleaged man who lives in a world inside his head blind to the world around him. Jackson Ralph Fiennes is a former American diplomat who lost his vision. Yes and yesin both physical and psychological sense. He had buried his wife and a son after a house fire and a few years after that lost his only surviving child in a terrorist bombing incidence that also took away his sight. It is no surprise that the man is in a bitter despair. He becomes a man of lost faith. In his darkness Jackson obstinately clings to and cultivates a rather esoteric idealcreating a perfect nightclub. When Jackson meets Sofia Belinsky Natasha Richardson a Russian Countess who is forced to work dishonorable jobs to support her dead husband's family and her daughter he immediately sees in his head a perfect centerpiece for his dream club.One thing that is extraordinary about this movie is the beautiful acting performance. Fiennes often called the best internal actor of his generation gives a stunningly exquisite performance as the blind man who resides in a world inside his mindtake just an example of the shadow of disappointment casting down on the lonely man's face when his new friend Matsuda bids him good night after a long night's conversation about nightclubs in Shanghai. It somehow makes cinematic sense that a person who cannot see other people's faces inadvertently reveals his soul with most minute movements of eyes and facial muscles. Although Fiennes' delicate features and willow physique do not quite conjure up the image of Humphrey Bogart to which the Jackson character curiously alludes Fiennes makes a perfect bar owner in the style of Rick Blaine Casablanca meets Oscar Hopkins played by Fiennes in Oscar and Lucinda.Richardson wonderfully materializes the perfect combination of the erotic and the tragic and gives a heartbreaking performance as the aristocratic woman fallen to the reality of a horrid and abject life and a mother who is going to do anything to save her child's future.And sohere I am facing the unpleasant task of talking about the restit is pity that the director James Ivory lets these actors stand there bare and alone. Hardly any cinematic device is utilized to foreground the emotion or romance of this couple. The result is quite devastating. The romance sparkles moment by moment through the wonderful work of these two talented actors but those moments do not connect well with each other lost and found and lost again. Some scenes seem to need more editing work. For example the horse race scene looks like a raw material from a dailyvery awkward. For the lack of romantic fire the screenplay is partly at fault in its meagerness. Although it contains an abundance of intriguing metaphors and keen observations on human lives the screenplay does lack somethingbe it suave packaging of romance or absorbing dialog. But ultimately I blame the director for not coming up with solutions to make the whole thing work better.I normally love Ivory films. I don't know why this one did not work for me. Perhaps Ivory is not a man for romantic materials. Or perhaps the death of his partner Merchant took its toll on this film. In any case if what I saw last night was the final version Fiennes and Richardson might not be able to be rescued from this movie during this Oscar season.".

	schema:headline " A fine Fiennes and two generations of Redgraves.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is Shangai sometime before WWII. Ralph Fiennes is a blind American Jackson who was once a diplomat but is now from what little the movie will reveal to us a consultant to an American business known only as the Company. It becomes quickly obvious that he is jaded and disillusioned and becoming a nuisance to his firm as he sleeps through meetings drinks too much and is plainly irascible.Natasha Richardson plays a Russian woman Sofia who lives with a family that has fallen on bad times in a cramped apartment. At night she dresses up and goes to a nightclub where she makes her living as an up scale B girl. She has a daughter but the rest of the family seems to want to keep them apart as if the mother is tainted. We slowly pick up that they view her job with distaste and while living solely off her earnings want to keep themselves and her daughter away from any of the embarrassment of her job rubbing off on them. The sister in law seems especially possessive of the child possibly because he reminds her of her dead brother. To all of this Sofia is strangely passive.We then find out that the family is an aristocratic family forced to leave Russia trying to get to Hong Kong where presumably the British and other Russian expatriots will welcome them for what they were and not for what they have become. Natasha is a countess of the group that were known as white Russians those who opposed the communists.Fiennes finds out her secret and is intrigued. He has a dream to open a special nightclub where Natasha can hold court as a hostess. He puts all of his money on a horse race and wins and opens the club.The relationship between the two is proper and at Fiennes insistence distant. He makes it clear he wants to know nothing of her private life and wishes to share none of his own. He is not only physically blind but wants to turn his back on the realities of the world hoping to create the world of his choosing  inside his own head. With a mysterious Japanese mentor he creates the world that is outside his club inside it by filling it with people of the same diversity as are about to clash on the outside. He picks his women like an aficionado his bouncers like a coach his musicians according to his own esoteric tastes.As a World war is looming we know his private dream world will be shattered. Will the couple's relationship bloom before it is too late? The catalyst is the daughter who as a child sees straight to the heart of the matter. If her mother's boss is so nice why does she ignore him in public? But neither is willing to let go of the past that haunts them and so they allow the child to slowly entangle them.Then the Japanese attack and the Countess's family decides to skip to Hong Kong on a boat with the 300 that they have pressured her to get from Fiennes. They don't care what she has to do to get it and they'll look down on her for doing it anyway but they'll be safe. Then the real perfidy of her motherinlaws intent becomes clear. The countess has to stay behind because if they are to get back into society she would be a mill stone around their necks. Worse they will take her daughter with them.Ralph Fiennes is the American whose guilt has shattered him.

	onyx:emotionText "It is Shangai sometime before WWII. Ralph Fiennes is a blind American Jackson who was once a diplomat but is now from what little the movie will reveal to us a consultant to an American business known only as the Company. It becomes quickly obvious that he is jaded and disillusioned and becoming a nuisance to his firm as he sleeps through meetings drinks too much and is plainly irascible.Natasha Richardson plays a Russian woman Sofia who lives with a family that has fallen on bad times in a cramped apartment. At night she dresses up and goes to a nightclub where she makes her living as an up scale B girl. She has a daughter but the rest of the family seems to want to keep them apart as if the mother is tainted. We slowly pick up that they view her job with distaste and while living solely off her earnings want to keep themselves and her daughter away from any of the embarrassment of her job rubbing off on them. The sister in law seems especially possessive of the child possibly because he reminds her of her dead brother. To all of this Sofia is strangely passive.We then find out that the family is an aristocratic family forced to leave Russia trying to get to Hong Kong where presumably the British and other Russian expatriots will welcome them for what they were and not for what they have become. Natasha is a countess of the group that were known as white Russians those who opposed the communists.Fiennes finds out her secret and is intrigued. He has a dream to open a special nightclub where Natasha can hold court as a hostess. He puts all of his money on a horse race and wins and opens the club.The relationship between the two is proper and at Fiennes insistence distant. He makes it clear he wants to know nothing of her private life and wishes to share none of his own. He is not only physically blind but wants to turn his back on the realities of the world hoping to create the world of his choosing  inside his own head. With a mysterious Japanese mentor he creates the world that is outside his club inside it by filling it with people of the same diversity as are about to clash on the outside. He picks his women like an aficionado his bouncers like a coach his musicians according to his own esoteric tastes.As a World war is looming we know his private dream world will be shattered. Will the couple's relationship bloom before it is too late? The catalyst is the daughter who as a child sees straight to the heart of the matter. If her mother's boss is so nice why does she ignore him in public? But neither is willing to let go of the past that haunts them and so they allow the child to slowly entangle them.Then the Japanese attack and the Countess's family decides to skip to Hong Kong on a boat with the 300 that they have pressured her to get from Fiennes. They don't care what she has to do to get it and they'll look down on her for doing it anyway but they'll be safe. Then the real perfidy of her motherinlaws intent becomes clear. The countess has to stay behind because if they are to get back into society she would be a mill stone around their necks. Worse they will take her daughter with them.Ralph Fiennes is the American whose guilt has shattered him. The two Redgrave sisters Vanessa and Lynn do excellent work at creating a dysfunctional morally vapid family that Natasha Vanessas daughter cow tows too. It's nice to see Liam Neeson's wife back in acting as she really is the center piece of the movie. The movie's pace is slow and nuance is everything.

The White Countess is one of my favorite films of 2005. And I have to admit I'm not much of a MerchantIvory fan but this one was truly exceptional.".

	schema:reviewBody "It took the last 30 minutes for me to fully appreciate this film. That's because the first 105 minutes are very very slow. If it weren't for the wonderfully rich visuals I might not have stuck with this story. Obviously I'm glad I did because the story snapped out of its doldrums and at the same time wrapped up everything nicely leaving the viewer at least me very satisfied. But  a warning  as mentioned you must have a lot of patience to make it to that rewarding conclusion.I just marveled at the cinematography the great sets the muted and beautiful colors that seem to be the trademark of these magnificentlyfilmed Merchant and Ivory movies. I am speaking of course of James Ivory and Ismail Merchant director and producer respectively. That's a team that will sorely missed by we fans of their films. Merchant died recently making this the last of their collaborations. That collaboration includes writer Kazuo Ishiguro who wrote this movie. These three guys all worked on The Remains Of The Day one of my alltime favorite movies and books.This Ishiguro story is set in midtolate '30s in Shanghai. Ralph Fiennes plays a blind American Todd Jackson an exdiplomat who wants to get away from politics and run the nightclub of his dreams. He has the whole place mapped out in his head. Natasha Richardson Countess Sofia Belinskya is a highclass escortservicetype woman working in a lowerclass bar who unselfishly sacrifices her dignity to help support her unappreciative family. Todd and Sofia meet one day in that bar he is extremely impressed with her and later hires her to run his new place called The White Countess once it's opened. Along the way Todd meets a Japanese man Mr. Matsuda who we find out isn't the altogether nice guy we thought he was as it's revealed trouble always follows him. In the end this drama comes to life as the Japanese overrun the city and everyone flees for their life. Sofia's family tries to leave without her. The countess desperately goes after them because that family includes her precious young daughter. Fiennes realizes at the last minute he doesn't want to live life without Sofia and she he tries to find her among all the chaos. It's a very suspenseful ending.In you enjoy classylooking films character that you wind up caring about and a drama that is rewarding this is a film not to miss. I'm afraid it didn't get much notice at least not like the other MerchantIvory films which is a shame. The last I saw this was mixed in with garbage films selling for 2 at the video store. What a shame!This is an underrated underpublicized and beautiful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The dreams of two unlikely strangers form the basis for this sophisticated drama  one of a world that has been lost and the other of a world that has yet to be found.Snowflakes fall mysteriously in a grand ballroom somewhere in Russia echoed in the mind of a beautiful girl in a slum district of Shanghai 1936. Natasha Richardson is a countess fleeing the Bolshevik revolution making a living any way she can to support her family. This means working in shady dance halls as a taxidancer and presumably occasionally as a prostitute. Her five family members all older except for a young daughter loathe the shame she brings on them but have no other means of support.Ralph Fiennes is a disillusioned US diplomat. He has helped the formation of the League of Nations is a successful business man and a hero Chinese nationalists but has seen all the best efforts to have people live in peace come to nought. Shanghai is full of political tensions  just before the SinoJapanese war. Fiennes finds solace drinking in lowlife bars and avoiding what he sees as the hypocrisy of those that hold him in such high regard.A vast amount of talent has been poured into this film it is the final collaboration of Merchant and Ivory Ismael Merchant died shortly before final production the screenplay is by the award winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro who worked with them on Remains of the Day the other crew are top notch and the cast also includes both Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave. Yet there is no easy conclusion when asking if it is a major triumph.The film has a pervading sense of the unexplained which continues for its whole length over two hours so piecing it together is not easy. The politics of the time and place are probably not familiar to most audiences and the bewildering array of nationalities does not help. Ishiguru's talent is for transcending the material content and taking us into the world of ideas but it needs most of our concentration to accept the material idea of Shanghai 1936 which although painstakingly recreated often feels like a film set inhabited by a wellknown English cast. Not surprisingly there may be little energy left over for more cerebral imaginings. Fiennes is an American Richardson and the Redgraves are Russian  even before we meet the Jewish neighbour the French Consul a Japanese nightlife connoisseur  and none of the main characters or actors are Chinese. But then the ideas are not particularly Chinese either  Shanghai is nothing more than Ishiguro's canvas.Prising out the dreams gives us some clues. Richardson Sofia is no tartwithaheart. Their Jewish neighbour also a refugee has fled such horrors that mere verbal insults the worst he has to suffer in Shanghai fall off him like a deaf man. But Sofia's family are less selfassured. They dream of a decent existence but Sofia has the greatest moral fibre in spite of her job. She receives the respects of a Russian Prince  now working as a porter. She warns Fiennes Jackson  who is also blind  of a hidden danger and gains his lasting respect.Jackson has noticed that in the dance halls there are no politics. He longs for a nightclub where people of any political persuasion can relax and mingle freely. Like Sofia he is tarnished by all the rules of the real world but his aspirations are higher than his outward lifestyle and the 'bigger picture' of those that would judge him.Early in the film Sofia says to a coworker All of us here have to fall in love from time to time to feed our children yet the film turns many ideas of 'love' on their head before it reaches its thankfully emotionally resounding climax. Equally ironically Jackson speaks of the vague promise of an intimate encounter in an ideal nightclub when the reality is that merely the vague dream of any intimacy of feeling is the most either he or Sofia feel they could even hope for.As a meditation on the commonality of death and sex of the impotent struggle of goodness and taste against the wars that mankind seems addicted to The White Countess has much to offer. The image of Fiennes in overcoat and bowtie calmly pouring brandy as the bombs fall around him sticks in the mind like the scream of a child. Director James Ivory could have underscored such moments to much greater effect than allowing them to be swallowed in a complex story and an unfamiliar period of history. Fiennes' character seeks some political tension that stops short of violence but his character  and the film  often lack that very quality.What seems at first like instant noodles badly reheated holds more sustenance than most will sadly give this film credit for and if it is a triumph for the Merchant Ivory  Isuguro team it is one like its characters and their dreams so heavily flawed that the aficionados who draw anything from it may well be accused of an overactive imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry to say that despite the incredible pedigree of everyone concerned this film was disappointing. It is beautifully shot and designed with all the elegance and taste that one comes to expect from MerchantIvory and of course the literary sensibility seems even more marked due to the scripting by Kazuo Ishiguro.But the film is lifeless. It has plenty of aesthetic style but it has no momentum or vigor. The very accomplished performances by a truly wonderful cast are somewhat wasted when the pace is so glacial and the overall sense of filmmaking seems so stodgy and fatigued.I am reminded of how frustrating I found years ago MerchantIvory's adaptation of Ishiguro's REMAINS OF THE DAY to be despite again a stellar cast. I know there are people who would disagree strongly with me but all the fascinating tragic interior sense of the butler's thoughts that made the book so absorbing and moving could not be communicated in a motion picture no matter how talented an actor Anthony Hopkins is so we wound up spending a couple of hours looking at a great actor nearly expressionless as he worked so hard to make his proper and repressed character neither register any emotions on his face nor express any in what he said.Here again we have the same problem. There are huge emotions under the surface here but because of the foreground sense of repression and because of the cooltothepointofleisurelyandmoribund filmmaking style we wind up watching Ralph Fiennes do his own version of Hopkins' sorry I can't say or feel or show anything because my character is supposed to be so repressed act.Granted these are essential trademark issues in Ishiguro's work. But it seems that without the vivid interior turmoil so eloquently expressed in his prose to help illuminate the character's stoicism the result on screen is just....bland. Natasha Richardson fares much much better since her character need not be as repressed. And her performance is stunning. And John Wood makes the most out of what is essentially a TWOLINE role!!.Actually the whole Russian family is handled as a tourdeforce by the acting ensemble and probably would have been enough to really put this picture overthetop had not the fatally inexpressive scenes of Jackson and Matsuda ballasted the work into such a torpor. Some of this heaviness is admittedly inherent in Ishiguro's script but I sense the very same words could have been imbued with the same gravity without nearly the somnambulent wooziness Ivory has made out of them.I am an unabashed fan of MerchantIvory's work and am saddened by the recent death of Ismail Merchant. The team of MerchantIvoryRuth Prawer JhabvalaRichard Robbins has created some real cinematic milestones. Two of the Forster adaptations are masterpieces and many of the Indian films are rare gems. So I'm not one of those who find this dynasty to be too artsy or whatever other criticisms have been leveled at them by impatient filmgoers. Yet impatience is indeed what I ultimately felt with this plodding execution. It was a frustrating experience not the least because I could see how close Ivory was to achieving what he must have wanted to achieve and how hard everyone must have worked to create that sense of Shanghai on the eve of its tragic invasion by the Japanese. It has all the elements of a great epic but fails to become one due almost completely to the weirdly anemic sense of passionless momentumless drearily uninspired filmmaking.".

It was a frustrating experience not the least because I could see how close Ivory was to achieving what he must have wanted to achieve and how hard everyone must have worked to create that sense of Shanghai on the eve of its tragic invasion by the Japanese. It has all the elements of a great epic but fails to become one due almost completely to the weirdly anemic sense of passionless momentumless drearily uninspired filmmaking.";

I like the formula I like their style and I like the source material they choose. I think the parts are very well played. Ralph Fiennes and Natasha Richardson are both excellent. I have seen both accused of blandness which I can't understand. The tiniest facial movement a twitch of the mouth a brief look a strained smile can be more telling than hours of dialogue. Their relationship is a slow burner they are both contending with the upkeep of a happy public persona while struggling with private lives that are anything but easy  she is a dancer who has to charm clients to pay for the keep of her dead husband's ungrateful fallen aristocratic family and to care for her daughter and he is an ex diplomat who has lost his family and his sight.The pace is slow  but I doubt it would work faster. The characters and the day to day troubles of their lives would be lost. If you are a fan of this type of story and the Merchant Ivory films then you will enjoy this gentle romance that is not overly sentimental. There is nothing huge and flashy about it  they are just people. And that is where the strength lies not in special effects dancing and fabulous costumes although they are there but in the people who you feel a genuine sympathy for and can relate to. I take my hat off to the actors director and producer et al. Rest in peace Ismail Merchant a sad loss.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there ever was a film with the right elements in it this was it. After all James Ivory was directing and the screen play by Kazuo Ishiguro who had worked with the director before to much better results in The Remains of the Day. Alas this film has a flat feeling in sharp contrast with the other films by Mr. Ivory.We are taken to the Shanghai of the thirties which was a city with a large international community. Among them the story finds the impoverished Russian aristocrats that are living in need. Horror of horrors Countess Sofia is forced to work in a dive often frequented by low life characters. Although it's left to our imagination could this poor aristocrat be also one of those women?It is there where Todd Jackson a blind American with a lot of influence in the right circles meets Sofia and decides to ask her to be the hostess for the new night club he wants to start. Into this picture walks a Japanese business man Mr. Matsuda who befriends Jackson. Matsuda has a hidden agenda as he wants to mix different groups of opposing sides at night spot.The Japanese invasion puts an end to Jackson's dreams. At the same time Sofia is able to get the needed amount of money for she and the family to go to Hong Kong. The only problem is that Olga the family matriarch has another idea in mind Sofia must stay behind! The problem with the film is that there is not enough tension or passion in these people on the screen. In a way this movie doesn't convince us these characters are real.The mostly English cast does what it can but they have done much better before. The magnificent Vanessa Redgrave has nothing to do which is the ultimate sin of the movie. Ralph Fiennes' Jackson is not one of the best roles he's ever played. For that matter Natasha Richardson with the phony Russian accent doesn't add anything to the story.In a way the movie feels empty. We can't even imagine an IvoryMerchant production this shabby before. Maybe the problem lies with the untimely death of Mr. Merchant. The film needed some editing and trimming because with a running time of 138 minutes is just too long.".

They don't make them like this anymore at any rate not often.";

Natasha Richardson the White Countess Sofia is in a pitiful situation forced to support herself and her daughter and four ungrateful inlaws by working as a taxi dancer with occasional deeper descents. Todd Jackson who had been a diplomat and is now just a figurehead in some international business has been tragically blinded in an accident that killed his child. He has a vision in his head of a place of entertainment for which he needs a focus or centerpiece. When he meets the countess he realizes she is exactly that centerpiece. He opens the club which frankly to me did not look markedly different from the club in which he first meets Sofia. both clubs have stage acts that are almost reminiscent of cirque du soleil. Since they appeared to have no cover charge I did wonder how much the drinks were what with the girls the acts etc. At the very beginning of the film Mr. Jackson also meets Mr. Masuda. They have a very restrained supportive and ultimately destiny changing relationship which is perfectly understandable. The acting was great. Ralph Finnes was very appealing. Natasha Richardson looks like a real woman albeit a beautiful one I did wonder about the Russian accented English since the characters were not supposed to be speaking English what language it was. . .who knows? I also thought the setup of the migrs housing was rather strange with a whole separate room for Sofia's making up but no bed for her. Oh well these are carping points in a movie that delivers very nicely a picture of a world long gone happily and sadly at the same time.".

I belong to this neglected market sector in this era dominated by fastpaced action SFX and horror movies for 20something male moviegoers.So I suppose I am not a majority for the movie studios business but I am glad I can find something like this film from time to time. I noticed the slow pace of the storytelling when I first watched it but the second time around I was paying more attention to the details of the relationships among the various characters and their emotions as well as the beautiful cinematography so the slow pace did not bother me  or rather it gave me time to enjoy the subtleties.It is a bit of a cheat to use children to stir the emotions among parents and I was totally trapped by this scheme. Natasha Richardson's expressions of the emotions to her daughter made me cry even for the first time but at the second time it also hit me that her suppressed behavior to Jackson Ralph Fiennes was to protect her daughter and it made the human relations more fascinating  and sad  in this story.Another example is the relationships between Jackson and Matsuda. I did not quite understand the emotional subtleties between these two men other than that they share the same interest the first time around. Then at the second time I could read Matsuda's expressions more closely and it made me understand more what he was up to.The same thing for the depiction of the relationships between Sofia Richardson and her family too. Overall I got an impression that the film depicts the human relationships in classic and graceful manner. I like the ending too and that leaves a good aftertaste. I certainly don't mind watching it for the third time.".

	schema:reviewBody "For someone whose family went through this it was a very emotional film to watch. My greatgrandparents and grandparents lived in Shanghai from the about the twenties to the early fifties. Watching this and imagining my family having to go through similar issues made it hard to watch for me.It meant a lot to get a glimpse of what Shanghai might've been like in those years what living there as a refuge was like being driven out by the communists having to flee to yet another country. This was something they did not like to speak of so I did not have much knowledge of it. On the other side of my family my greatgrandmother could not get a visa along with my grandparents and their kids so she stayed behind and died in France so I also understand the heartbreak of leaving one behind.Which brings me to my one problem with the film is the way the family treated Sofia. Yes they were probably too proud willing to live off her but not work themselves very judgemental of her ashamed of her  but I can not imagine them purposefully leaving someone behind! It would have made more sense if the French consulate who was pursuing Sofia would refuse to give her a visa in retaliation for his snub.There will be many thing probably lost on most people. For example the movie title plays on her name means WHITE and from czarist Russians being referred to as white Russians. Those who understand Russian will get more from the background dialogue and the caberet acts. Those descended from white Russians may recognize that certain nostalgia and a certain deluded belief that they could recreate their lost world or the belief that when the communists were defeated everything would go back to life pre1917. A struggle to hold onto as much of the culture way of life and religion seemed to be very prevalent. Unfortunately the antisemitism may also ring true having already been prevalent in Russian and exacerbated by the revolution. I think others will also enjoy it. The sets costumes general misenscene seems very realistic. It has exceptionally fine actors Ralph Fiennes Natasha Richardson and Hiroyuki Sanada and others. I would say it's worth a watch for most people  though they may not get as much out of the film as a Russian descendant it's still quite good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three young couples vie to win a magazine contest by holding their 'themed' weddings in public with the winners being awarded a first prize of a brand new home. Step forward the three couples nudists Michael and Joanna tennismad Josef and Meredith and Hollywood musical fans Matt and Samantha.The fun comes for us as as viewers as we join the flyon the wall documentary team that follows all three couples as the wedding organisers and their respective families try to get the weddings together in time for the contest.This is a showcase of modern British comedy talent. Jimmy Carr Felicity Montagu Stephen Mangan Martin Freeman Jessica Stevenson and Alison Steadman all do their bit.

I'm not a sucker for romantic comedies or comedies in general I don't tend to laugh out loud in them so I knew I was in for a good time when I'd laughed a great deal in the first five minutes.

The basic plot line is Confetti magazine is running a competition for the most outthere wedding the prize being a house. Various entrants apply and the film follows the three selected finalists during their preparations for the big day. Shot so as to appear in the style of a flyonthewall documentary the film never left me feeling like it was contrived and the characterisations were just superbly believable throughout.The casting couldn't really have been any better some truly fantastic performances from Martin Freeman Justin Webb from BBC 2's The Smoking Room and Channel 4's Peep Show and Olivia Colman also from Peep Show and also BBC2's Look Around You  to name but a few.

Fortunately though I was pleasantly surprised. The film contained the cream of the British comedy crop  actors from Spaced The Office Peep Show Green Wing etc etc and was suitably hilarious. It follows three couples who are chosen to compete for the title of 'most original wedding' for Confetti magazine. The winner gets a half million pound house. Jessica Stevenson and Martin Freeman make for the nicest and most realistic couple in the film and their wedding contains the most colourful characters.. notably Jessica's character Sam's sister a dancer who tries to take over the wedding's choreography their theme is old MGM musicals to the couple's obvious annoyance. It was odd seeing the pairing of peep show's Jez and Sophie in the film and i didn't know if i'd be able to shrug off the feeling that Mark would be getting jealous...the feeling passed. These two were brilliant playing the couple who had chosen a naturist wedding. The Green Wing's Stephen Mangan and Man Stroke Woman's Meredith MacNeill were also hilarious as the couple having a tennis themed wedding  along with a host of marital issues. The showstealers in the film though had to be the wedding planners. Both gave mesmerising performances and were utterly fabulous. The film's dialogue was apparently improvised and it shows in the realistic reactions of the characters particularly these two. They alone were worth going to see the film for. Even if the rest had been terrible. Which it wasn't.And finally...the true test of the film's greatness... I actually didn't hate Jimmy Carr in it. Wonderful. And also some kind of miracle...The film's not out yet but i recommend anyone who gets the wonderful quirky British comedies of the last few years to seriously give this one a go when it's released.

	schema:reviewBody "There are few things so stressful in life as planning and executing a wedding. When that morass of charged emotions runs headlong into a contest held by Confetti Magazine for the most original wedding things are bound to get messy.Three couples are chosen for their unique wedding ideas Matt Martin Freeman and Sam Jessica Stevenson want a Hollywood musical style Josef Stephen Mangan and Isabelle Meredith MacNeill vie for a tennis theme while Michael Robert Webb and Joanna Olivia Colman are naturalists and want their nuptials to be done in the nude. Trying to wrangle these three disparate couples into some kind of order are wedding planners Archie Heron Vincent Franklin and Gregory Hough Jason Watkins who seem to be channeling Corky St. Clair...In fact shot as a documentary this British ensemble piece is sure to be justly compared to Christopher Guest's mockumentaries WAITING FOR GUFFMAN A MIGHTY WIND et cetera. Director Debbie Isitt does a fair job of aping Guest though she doesn't know when to go from documentary handheld to a smoother choreographed camera and relies too much on nondiegetic music.Clearly too Isitt is aware of the weaknesses to the storyline. Two of the three couples are off screen for long stretches and our villainous couple think Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock from BEST IN SHOW is mishandled in the finale. Even when they're not working with the best material how many jokes about a nudist wedding can there be? the cast does a terrific job keeping the film afloat. Besotted with faces familiar to anglophile TVfilm viewers CONFETTI is an amusing farce.".

When that morass of charged emotions runs headlong into a contest held by Confetti Magazine for the most original wedding things are bound to get messy.Three couples are chosen for their unique wedding ideas Matt Martin Freeman and Sam Jessica Stevenson want a Hollywood musical style Josef Stephen Mangan and Isabelle Meredith MacNeill vie for a tennis theme while Michael Robert Webb and Joanna Olivia Colman are naturalists and want their nuptials to be done in the nude. Trying to wrangle these three disparate couples into some kind of order are wedding planners Archie Heron Vincent Franklin and Gregory Hough Jason Watkins who seem to be channeling Corky St. Clair...In fact shot as a documentary this British ensemble piece is sure to be justly compared to Christopher Guest's mockumentaries WAITING FOR GUFFMAN A MIGHTY WIND et cetera. Director Debbie Isitt does a fair job of aping Guest though she doesn't know when to go from documentary handheld to a smoother choreographed camera and relies too much on nondiegetic music.Clearly too Isitt is aware of the weaknesses to the storyline. Two of the three couples are off screen for long stretches and our villainous couple think Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock from BEST IN SHOW is mishandled in the finale. Even when they're not working with the best material how many jokes about a nudist wedding can there be? the cast does a terrific job keeping the film afloat. Besotted with faces familiar to anglophile TVfilm viewers CONFETTI is an amusing farce.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Confetti' is a funny and charming British mockumentary but it sure as hell isn't onpar with mockumentaries like 'Spinal Tap' and 'Best in Show'. 'Confetti' is about a fashion bridal magazine called 'Confetti'. The two executives of the magazine Jimmy Carr and Felicity Montagu form a contest involving three different couples seeing who can put on the most original wedding. They choose Matt and Sam Martin Freeman and Jessica Hynes two tonedeaf theater enthusiasts whose theme is Broadway Musicals  Josef and Isabelle Stephen Mangan and Meredith MacNeill two wannabe protennis players whose theme is no big surprise tennis  and Michael and Joanna Robert Webb and Olivia Colman two nudists whose theme is a naturist wedding. With the help of two flamboyantly gay wedding planners Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins the three couples set on a trek to plan their weddings and perhaps win the Confetti magazine most original wedding contest.'Confetti' is an interesting concept but disappointing in that they could have done so much more with it. The beginning is very funny and the ending sequence is flatout hilarious but there are so many inbetween moments in 'Confetti' that aren't very funny and drag out. The actors are all very talented and funny especially Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins who are constant scenestealers as the bitchygay wedding planners. Some of the time I was confused in what I was watching  a comedy or a drama. In some instances it becomes too sentimental to be funny which is usually not a good route to take when making a mockumentary. Satire is a very hard thing to accomplish well in a movie and 'Confetti' hits and misses but luckily for the viewers it hits more than it misses. Grade B".

There's a flimsy storyline about three couples getting their insane dream weddings and the preparations that lead to the wedding but this appears to be nothing more than a narrative thread so they could decide what order to have the jokes in. Secondly all the couples only have one joke. Admittedly for two out of the three couples it is a funny joke but it wears thin towards the end and could easily have been trimmed to make the film lighter. However one couple Josef and Isabelle are just relentlessly annoying their story falling flat. Finally all the actors appear to be playing their sitcom roles. Martin Freeman plays his character as at least a relative of Tim from the office. Steven Mangan is Guy from Green Wing. The guys from Peep show are their characters Jimmy Carr is Jimmy Carr. Only Jessica Stevenson is allowed to make a new character from herself nowhere near to Daisy from Spaced which would've made an interesting addition to the film. But whilst I love Green Wing The Office and Peep Show it doesn't mean I want to see these characters merely transferred to film. However despite these criticisms the film is funny with scenes that had me laughing loudly in the cinema. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as good as it could've been with more work more jokes and original characters.".

Trouble is this isn't anywhere nearly as funny or believable as the misadventures of David Brent despite a large ensemble cast really trying their best.Confetti is a spoof documentary following the efforts of Confetti magazine to run a competition for the most originally themed wedding of the year the prize being a house and a frontcover photoshoot. Trouble is the three couples they have picked all raise issues with the competition's organiser Antoni Jimmy Carr. For the Tennisthemed wedding Josef and Isabelle Steven Mangan and Meredith MacNeill seem more obsessed with winning than actually getting married. For Matt and Sam Martin Freeman and Jessica Stevenson rehearsals for their Musicalthemed wedding are marred by family disputes and choreographer trouble. And as for the Naturist wedding of Michael and Joanna Robert Webb and Olivia Colman... well it appears as though Confetti magazine isn't prepared to have naked people on the front cover just yet.There is so much potential here for comedy gold that it's actually distressing that so much of it goes to waste. Because each scene is improvised there and then the whole film feels messy and cluttered with dialogue that may be very funny but you missed it because someone else was talking. I also found it very hard to sympathise with anyone but the two camp wedding planners Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins because a they're much funnier than the others and b they're much more likable comedic stereotypes though they are. Nothing about Confetti feels genuine so you never really buy into the concept of these six nutters having the wedding of their dreams and hopefully nobody elses!. And to be honest it's also obvious who is going to win the thing at the end which is a real shame because with our interest flagging that was the only reason my Better Half and I kept watching.I don't think Spinal Tap have anything to worry about just yet but Confetti really could have been great instead of the plodding wastedopportunity that it is. It's slow uninteresting and largely unfunny though they are one or two gentles laughs to be found if you look hard enough. The actors all try their best but not having a script really separates the wheat from the chaff. Carr is razorsharp and genuinely funny but Mangan betrays his comic career on TV by overacting like his life depended on it. With a stronger supporting cast and tighter scripting this could have been a real gem instead of the lump of coal that it is. Confetti drags its feet towards its conclusion and chances are you would have lost interest in proceedings anyway. Do what me and the missus are going to do  fly to St Lucia and get married on a beach. Just pray that this isn't the inflight movie!".

It is a refreshingly new idea for a film. i can only compare it to lock stock and two smoking barrels in that it was a new style of English film that people were not sure about until they actually had seen it. After they had seen the film they could talk about nothing else. This will be a master film for others to copy the idea and i'm sure they will. As with all films the ending is the best but actually not getting bored before you get there is the key and with all the funny parts in this film you sure don't get bored.This film will bring out a number of emotions out in all who watch it from extreme laughter to overwhelming tears. so i would recommend you all watch this film but don't forget the hankies.".

Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins as ace wedding planners Heron and Hough nearly steal the show with subtly played roles that have a real emotional impact. Ably supported by Ron Cook and Alison Steadman this film has a British edge but is accessible to anyone especially those who have ever attended a real wedding.This film deserves to be a real success and the director is a talent to be watched if you like this I suggest you look out for her earlier feature Nasty Neighbours.Debbie Isitt has constructed a film that is both funny and touching and I recommend that you seek it out on its UK cinema release on May 5th.".

The back biting bitchiness and frustration triggers some fantastic scenes and i fear that a lot of people are going to see a lot of themselves in this film.The comedy comes from some fantastic performances from the absolute top notch comedy actors currently working in the UK. It feels incredibly real and according to the information provided was largely improvisational but don't let that deter you  i haven't laughed out loud so much at a cinema EVER and although i fear some of the humour may be lost on our American cousins any fans of the office green wing peep show and numerous others will really enjoy this film and certainly any one that has organised a wedding will relish the reality that it embraces and will bring back some nightmares of their own.A must see film and a shoein for the Bafta award if not Oscar next year you read it here first.".

The three shortlisted couples are assigned a pair of wedding planners who help them develop a distinctive theme for their nuptials. One couple choose a tennis theme another a Busby Berkley muscial theme and the other couple choose to be true to themselves and choose naturism.The film sees the development of the wedding plans over several weeks and culminates in the big day itself when all three marriages are celebrated there and then at a classic awards ceremony complete with celebrity guests quaffing champagne at round tables while a panel of judges decide who wins the prize  a dream house.The film has so many wellknown faces from British comedy it is hard to know who to mention first. Jimmy Carr does a marvellous job as the organiser of the competition and Steven Mangan portrays a typically aggressive and touchy competitor. Martin Freeman provides an able depiction foil to Alison's Steadman's overdefensive motherinlaw to be. My favourite couple were Robert Webb and Olivia Colman who bravely have to perform much of the film naked. Webb's character is an unabashed militant naturist who tends to rip off his clothes wherever the fancy takes him but his fiance is more modest and seems to view the approaching wedding with a sense of dread.This film was totally enjoyable from start to end and in my view deserves a high score  not for its intellectual challenge but for its good humour and great acting from its cast who all have a track record for producing hilarious comedy.".

If I see that tag on another film poster I'll perform unholy acts on the person of the adman responsible.I was initially reluctant to see this film as I generally find Jimmy Car about as amusing as a car crash and the presence of that many sitcom actors is rarely a good thing.This is an amiable if predictable movie. It has a few very funny moments but tries too hard to emulate the model of 'Best In Show' and other such satires. There's a little too much attempt to have some of the characters here be funny or say funny things rather than rely on the observed comic discomfort which make good mockumentaries genuinely rib tickling. There are attempts at this approach with the central couple of the three represented  played by Jessica Stevenson and Martin Freeman  creating conflicts with Stevenson's pushy sister and domineering mother. Largely though this is ignored with the others. The annoying selfabsorbed Tennis players become tedious very quickly and Isitt seem increasingly strained to manufacture moments where they are not simply being unpleasant for the sake of being unpleasant.Surprisingly it's Vincent Franlkin and Stephen Mangan  as the gay weddingplanners working with the three couples who provide the heart of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't write reviews much in fact I haven't done so since David Lynch's Lost Highway back in the 90's but having just seen ABSENTIA I felt obligated to share my thoughts.This is an amazing horrorthriller. I cannot fathom how a director working on a minuscule budget can produce a film of this quality. The writing photography and direction are absolutely firstclass. The film generates a remarkably claustrophobic atmosphere and the actors albeit amateur give incredible and heartfelt performances.The film tells the story of two sisters Tricia heavily pregnant and the other Callie who is returning from an extended trip. The main plot involves the disappearance of the Trisha's husband seven years prior. She is just starting to heal working to declare him legally dead and looking towards the birth of her child. Then things change.To give anything else away would be unforgivable but let's just say that Tricia's husband is not the only person to go missing in the neighborhood in recent times. Don't worry about that statement...this is not some dopey clichd serial killer film this is something completely different. It's a mystery. Is the husband dead or alive and what is the meaning of the unusual things that Callie begins to see inside the nearby freeway underpass ? The film is hard to classify into a specific genre. It's part horror part thriller part scifi and utterly engrossing.If you enjoy thrillers give this film a go. Forget the fact that it was made on a dime.. every aspect of it from the story acting right through to a wonderful soundtrack guarantees you will have a great time with it.I'm hoping that the director Mike Flanagan gets noticed in a big way as a result of Absentia and someone throws him a team and a budget. If he can make a film this good on a tiny budget I can only imagine what he could do with more money.".

I cannot fathom how a director working on a minuscule budget can produce a film of this quality. The writing photography and direction are absolutely firstclass. The film generates a remarkably claustrophobic atmosphere and the actors albeit amateur give incredible and heartfelt performances.The film tells the story of two sisters Tricia heavily pregnant and the other Callie who is returning from an extended trip.

Well maybe I do understand if you watch this horror with the expectations that you get a fast paced gore filled typical horror movie you will be disappointed. Absentia is a slow one and it basically has no real gore. So just skip it if that's what you are going for and save this little gem the downrates which it really doesn't deserve.Now that having sad Absentia has something different to offer. It's not per say in the storyline itself which when you read it doesn't seem too original. What it's got to offer is mainly in the mood. The soundtrack which is relatively minimum really adds to the claustrophobic and depressing atmosphere. The acting is well done realistic and believable and the characters are well worked out and take the plot to a higher level. There are some weird things in the plot that make you wonder what is really going on. It gives the perfect sense of mystery never fully explaining it but definitely enough to leave you satisfied. I found Absentia more of an experience though it doesn't come short to the story at all. Things may or may not make sense and you might wonder a couple of times how much comes to perception and how much of it is really happening it doesn't take anything away from the story or from the mood. It only adds to it.I was a bit reluctant when I put the DVD into my player but all my doubts faded away within the first minutes. The movie is perfectly shot everything just works really really well. I am very pleasantly surprised and think it certainly belongs to one of the best horror movies of 2011.The only bad thing I have to say about it is that a few times I found it hard to follow the dialogue mumbling and had to rewind to listen to it again. Watch it if you get the chance and if you like horror which crawls deeply under your skin. Do not watch it if you want action and gore.".

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing our good friend James DePaolo over at CinemaHeadCheese.com giving this some damn good comments I figured it would be something worth checking out. I've been in need of a good horror movie to really get into my head and one from 2011 couldn't sound any better. Absentia is that movie. It's one of the movies I will remember 10 months from now when I start making my Best of 2011 list. The year has just started but if the past years have taught me anything it is that great movies are rare.The movie takes its time to explain the background story to you early in the movie by having our lead character Tricia put up missing person posters. Gradually from that we also find out that he has been gone for 7 years. And then we have Callie her sister. Callie moved away 5 years ago but has just gotten back in town and is gonna live with Tricia. Tricia has just accepted that her husband is actually gone and won't be coming back when she all of the sudden starts seeing him everywhere. A therapist explains this to her by saying that it's her mind processing the acceptance. But when Callie is out jogging one day she meets a strange man in a tunnel who she later finds out is another missing person. One of many in the neighborhood.There is a lot going on in the movie but it always takes the time to make sure you follow the events. Even though many things are unexplained and hard to grasp it's so perfectly thoughtout that you never feel cheated instead you keep your mind working constantly to connect everything. And this is what makes the movie so great there are so many levels of things. By the time the movie ended I couldn't even decide what I thought was going on in the movie I literally had three different solutions to the whole film. Which one is the right one I don't know. And I don't care I love it this way.It's a movie that works in the most simple of ways and it never goes overthetop. Unlike most supernatural  psychological horror movies out there this works strictly with the atmosphere the story the mood and the emotions and it couldn't possibly do a better job. The actors are all terrific and they all help us sell this story.If I had to be really picky about something it would have to be some of the jump scares. Not because they are jump scares which we all know are cheap ways to scare because they are carefully placed and all that but the sound is often what sells them and here they weren't as effective as they could've been. But it gives the scares a more subtle tone which helps building the atmosphere yet again so it's really a doubleedged sword.Absentia is an important movie it shows what good thinking can do compared to good effects. It puts you into the misery of our characters and has you constantly trying to figure out what is really going on. There was not a second of this movie that I thought dragged on even though things sometimes move slowly. There is nothing better than a slow movie that really has you hooked because only then can it really get you to feel and care for the characters and Absentia manages to do just that. A must see!More reviews at FilmBizarro.com".

Her younger sister Callie comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him dead in absentia. As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances it becomes clear that Daniel's presumed death might be anything but natural. The ancient force at work in the tunnel might have set its sights on Callie and Tricia... and Daniel might be suffering a fate far worse than death in its grasp. Absentia is a great psychological horror film that will leave you guessing about what was real and what was not. It is a very well done lowbudget flick superbly acted original and sinister.Absentia is a strangely original movie. I really liked all of the psychological aspects of it. Flanagan surprises us with a bunch of unexpected scares and some relentless drama. Also the acting was quite good. The film does not feel hampered by its extremely low budget 75000 US all of the scares have quality. It is impressive how well this film is directed. The performances were great and I cared about the characters. If you are a horror fan you should not miss this hidden gem. It is amazing what Flanagan can do with a microbudget. In spite of a kinda boring musical score I still loved Absentia. It is one of the most thoughtprovoking horror films I have seen it deals with a very moving story that is painfully sad. The ending leaves some questions but it makes the film even more debatable. B".

Tricia's Courtney Bell  husband has been missing for seven years and her rehabbed sister Callie  Katie Parker has moved in with her at the same time the State is  issuing a Death Certificate for the missing Daniel Morgan Peter  Brown. Tricia is pregnant and looking to finally put the seven years  of grief and speculation as to what might have happened behind her when  she begins to have visions of her husband  visions that are terrifying  and downright spooky.  With the encouragement of her sister Callie Tricia goes on a date with  an investigator on her husband's case. But she gets no further than a  few steps from the house when Daniel mysteriously appears on the  street  pale and disoriented. Questions abound. Where has he been? Was  he molested or injured in any way? And who kept him and fed him all  these years stomach contents reveal a grotesque discovery? Daniel is  unable to either respond or unwilling to assist in the investigation.  But it is clear he has been through a traumatic experience that left  him almost dead.  Meanwhile Callie meets a strange and helpless man in a tunnel she uses  as part of her jogging route. The man seems confused and surprised that  Callie can see him. When Daniel miraculously returns after seven years  Callie begins to piece together a strange puzzle of disappearances in  the area that include the man she saw in the tunnel the day earlier and  others who have gone missing over the past 100 years. A frightening  conversation with Daniel later reveals even more horrifying details. A  story of a creature that lives in the walls that kidnaps and keeps its  victims under the city is presented by Daniel just before he is again  captured by the unknown entity. It is then up to Callie and Tricia to  try and rationalize the events of the last 24hours while struggling  with the sanity of the situation that reveals itself to be  supernatural.  Absentia is one of those rare independent films that jumps out and  grabs you. The performances by Parker and Bell hit the bull'seye and  it is their relationship that drives the first half of the film.  Daniel's appearance takes Absentia in an unexpected direction and it is  a direction full of incredible unseen possibilities with a few good  jolts thrown in for good measure.  There was rarely a hint of the usual 'Iknewthatwascoming' that is  so rampant in screeners' thought processes while watching a modern day  thrillerhorror. Every scene and every note brought the audience  further down the rabbit hole and nothing was clear or easily  spelledout for a remedial or simpleton viewer.  All the above makes Absentia one of the best horror films of the 2011  year. It was brilliantly acted while it methodically unfolded a complex  story that leaves much to the imagination. In short it was eerie  ingenious creepy and brilliant.".

For those who expect perfection you'll be hard to please with this one.I've read some negative reviews and many of them seem to be harping on how the lead actress is pregnant when her husband has been missing for 7 years or whether the events that transpired are supposed to be mere hallucinations of her younger drugaddicted sister. These things are definitely clarified in the movie so if you find yourself being bothered by such trivial matters you probably weren't paying attention.The scaryhorrifying moments are good some of them did send shivers up my spine. The possibilities of what caused the horrific events are explained and it's a phenomena that is in fact discussed in the real world. So its not entirely a senseless fantasy.Yes there are moments that seem unexplained but again with enough attention paid you'll be able to figure out why this character was doing that or why that character said this. In a way this movie reminds me of Rosemary's Baby in that much is left up to your imagination no inyourface creatures and gore. BUT this is definitely MUCH BETTER than Rosemary's Baby as just the right amount is revealed to terrify while just the right amount is left a mystery for added suspense and thrill.In my opinion it worked. I'd give this a 6 only because the soundtrack of the movie bothered me a little. But it deserves a 6.5. I mean Rosemary's Baby annoyed the crap out of me for too much was left unknown and unseen. Yet that's got a whopping 810. Give this movie a shot.".

What happens is that some giant insect living in the 4th dimension is hanging out in some damn tunnel and kidnapping people. It feeds them some animals but I guess there is no showers there because they have to wear the same clothes for years and years. Oh and you can trade with the big spider insect thing. If you bring it a puppy or some watches or something it might give you back your loved one worse for the wear.Horror film lovers are so desperate for entertainment that just because this film is not out of focus and has a minimum of suspense to sustain it they forgive the most banal acting and absurd premise.

	schema:reviewBody "I almost never write movie reviews but this one deserves the attention.There may be a little wooden acting in places and perhaps the background relationships take up a little more space than most horror fans would like.But make no mistake the soul of this movie is cosmic horror. It could have been written by Thomas Ligotti. The story is utterly horrifying not because of some expertlyrendered CGI monstrosity but because of the total vulnerability of the characters. They don't know anywhere near enough about what is happening to safeguard themselves and it isn't death that they face  it is implied to be something far more sinister.This movie is refreshingly iconoclastic. In this depiction of the world there isn't some convenient deus ex machina to rescue the people who we might feel deserve mercy. It isn't enough that they are good people it isn't enough that they are loved or that they have faith in a benevolent power. Nothing is sacred. Everyone is a candidate for the utmost suffering and depravity simply because that is the way the cosmos happens to be.There will be a large number of people who do not like this movie. My father is one of them and I think his attitude neatly sums up the expectations of many horror fans. Now don't get me wrong  I love my dad but when it comes to movies he is a bit of a dick.I watched this movie with him. At the end I was stunned in horrified silence. His closing comment was Well that was a load of crap  you hardly got to see the monster!.Unfortunately this attitude is not uncommon. I marvel that people could find a horror movie which shows them everything relying on no sense of ambiguity or implication whatsoever to be entertaining. Anne Radcliffe once wrote They must be men of very cold imaginations for whom certainty is more terrible than surmise. I could not agree more. Don't give me monsters  give me superbly crafted storytelling implication and strategically placed ambiguity.I'm not saying there is no room in this world for monster movies. It's just that for me personally if I see a film that opens with showing the entity in question my interest is immediately and irretrievably lost. My imagination needs ambiguity to sustain interest. Absentia accommodates this requirement almost perfectly.This movie is brooding nihilistic horror par excellence. Enjoy.".

On one hand it is a very neat idea with pretty good acting that keeps you interested. On the other hand it is also a good half hour movie that is stretched out and some parts are very repetitive and boring. There are some movies where nothing seems to happen that are a struggle to get through and there are some where you keep watching and your not sure why. This one is the later.

You don't get to think that a lot in horror films. The first half has some generic scary scenes  I wish it wasn't just a man with white makeup making a scary face because it's been overdone. It's not haunting. But good overall pacing. However instead of really turning the second half into something quite scary or chilling the explanation for what's going on falls flat. Without ruining the story when the reveal happens it's just not scary whatsoever. One of the characters goes on a little rant to explain it all to her sister and it's quite comical not sure if that was intentional or not but it came across as silly. Instead of leaving some ambiguity at the end everything is beat over our head again and again and it feels too forced. I think if some things were pulled back a tad and executed slightly differently this film would have been more successful. The acting was good no complaints there and the use of the tunnel imagery was nice. Some comical scenes between the cop and the sisters were chuckle worthy as well. Overall not bad. But unfortunately not the hyped up film I was expecting. Taking into consideration that this is an independent horror film I would give it 610. But as a film overall I'll stick with the 5.".

The money would have been better spent on Addams Family reruns. I did not feel so much as a tinge of fear or suspense as I watched characters who were completely contrived engage in shallow and meaningless dialogue about nonsensical gobbledygook all in the service of a plot that went absolutely nowhere and fell laughably short of the depth the screenwriters so desperately wanted to give it. I'm a fan of a many different horror genres but the only genre this one belonged to is called caca. Save yourself the trouble and go watch some Addams Family reruns instead.".

There was just nothing to it  a 10 minute short would have been better and would have covered the little plot that was there. The music was bland as was the direction. It was not pretentious or striving to be artistic except maybe with the ending just vanilla without any flavoring. If you like watching several scenes of someone jogging that has nothing to do with the story this is your film. If you like having no character you even care about this is your film.".

Detractors are a very loud minority and I can only assume that the film's misleading and unfortunate cover art has mobilized a loud and angry group of viewers who feel cheated by the reality of what the film is. They've been cheated out of the explicit exploitative Bhorror film the art sells and instead are given a thoughtful meditative quiet slowburn of a supernatural drama that is an inspiring example of nobudget independent filmmaking that seems entirely wasted on some viewers. It is a shame and the film's rating on this site is not an accurate representation of its quality. Not by far.I'm glad I researched the film before I watched it as the critical reviews are just about unanimously glowing and help create appropriate expectations but frankly I wouldn't have picked it up at all were it not for the powerfully persuasive wordofmouth from reputable critics and the very long list of film festival awards and acceptances. I never would have picked it up based on the covert art and imagine the type of viewer that would will certainly have a hard time.The story is simple and understated  a young woman is coming to terms with finally declaring her missing husband dead. She's pregnant so has clearly begun to try to move on but still is haunted both by his memory and by increasingly disturbing visions of her husband that also intrude into her waking hours. Her younger sister comes to stay with her and notices something strange about a pedestrian foot tunnel nearby.I won't ruin the rest. The acting is unreasonably good for a cast of complete unknowns. The production values are exceptional especially if you realize that the filmmaker had no equipment no lights and no crew to work with. People have complained about the music but I found it entrancing. And no YOU DO NOT SEE THE MONSTER. I have read reviews where people screamed this fact in frustration but it is what sets this film apart. This is a mature gorgeously crafted indie film that reminds of movies like SESSION 9 or RETRIBUTION. It is not explicit it is goreless there is no nudity it features realistic body types and it relies on dialog and silence to tell its simple contained story. It is a film festival movie. It is at its heart a quiet drama. If that appeals to you you will LOVE this gem. If not you will find yourself frustrated. I understand how that frustration can lead to negative reviews but those reviews are not a fair representation of the quality of this film. That they're SO angry so violently abusive to this film well ... that further demonstrates the type of person that this film is NOT for.Highest recommendation.".

I kept hanging in there just hoping at some point the movie would grab my interest. This movie was so bad I was almost mad that I paid money to rent it when in essence I should have been paid to sit through such boredom on a rainy Saturday evening! A good suspenseful movie makes the viewers hold to their chairs and leaves room for imagination. While watching Absentia we could tell each other what was going occur next before it happened on the screen. Most reviews of movies are pretty much dead on but the reviews I read prior to renting this lame movie could not have been more off. Quite disappointingto say the very least.

And the script was okay but still sometimes it all took a bit too long or some scene's did reappear like the praying in the bed room or the yoga stuff. But you kept looking due the acting. I can't say that they did it bad. Katie Parker Callie and Courtney Bell Tricia did well and were believable and had to say so many lines here because there's a lot of talking going on. Even as there isn't any red stuff in it or effects it's them who made it watchable. And they are just in the business so a big cheer to them both. At the end you are still full of unsolved questions and not everything is explained but it's worth looking at. This flick shows that a flick full of blah blah isn't always struggle to get through. Not exactly my kind of horror but I'm sure due the situations that you surely knew such a place read tunnel in your neighborhood that looks creepy. Gore 15 Nudity 05 Effects 15 Story 35 Comedy 05".

Tricia is at the point now after all this time that they can declare Daniel legally dead. But Tricia is not so sure if he really is dead. She has been seeing visions of him. While Tricia has moved on with her life to some degree she still questions what happened that night. Callie goes for a jog one day and goes through a tunnel that changes everything.This is the film Paranormal Activity wanted to be. This film was well written and with a great bunch of actors. Absentia has so much to brag about. It had some great jump moments. It had a subplot that really added to the film. I was mad when this film ended. I wanted at least 30 more minutes. I loved this film that much. The running time was a little over 90 minutes but you get so into the story that the time flies by so fast. I did not want to talk about what happens with the tunnel.As a fan I would have been mad to read about a film I would like to see and a critic just tell me everything about it the twists and the end. The 2011 end of the year top ten is a long way off but this film will be on it. I know right now it is playing some festivals and circuits. This is a good old fashioned thought provoking dramahorror. There is a tiny bit of blood no nudity and some harsh language but not too much. A film a family can watch together and not be worried about the content being too adult which is a breath of fresh air sometimes. I recommend everyone see this movie now.".

From Turkish Star Trek and Star Wars to Turkish Superman to Turkish Young Frankenstein. I was not prepared for a mostly green Spiderman with a red hood and giant untrimmed eyebrows.This isn't your Marvel Spiderman though. Turkish Spiderman is leader of a gang. His whole racket involves smuggling artifacts from Turkey to the US selling them cheaply to dealers and then buying them back with fake money. The opening scene is of Spidey and his gang building a hole in the sand dropping some woman in a night gown into it and then pushing a boat the motor is on propeller spinning into her face. The Spider as he is called in Turkey has no powers whatsoever. He knows movie martial arts is quite the escape artist and tends to sneak up on people. His primary weapons include a 2inch knife a shower head shishkabobing people and a complicated torture device involving hamsters. Welcome to Turkey !!Aytekin Akkaya is Turkish Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America minus a shield which would have cost extra. You may remember him from Turkish Star Wars. Sadly I cannot forget seeing his shirtless performance as he bounced around on the screen. His partners include a luchidore who stores everything in the crotch of his tights and a female secretarial assistant who does most of the undercover work. Their mission is to stop the Green menace thank you Jonas.This is truly an exercise in Turkish 70's film making. Turkish movies often remind me of the old movie serials Flash Gordon Batman and Robinetc. They seem to be made on the cheap poorly edited poorly acted and done very quickly often with little regard for intellectual property the music seems to be from a James Bond movie. It is as if this is Turkey's attempt at mimicking the exploitation movies coming out of the US andor the martial arts movies coming out of Asia. Exploitation is definitely what this movie is going for. It has all the elements for grindhouse a striptease with pasties graphic violence shower scenes in underwear crappy disco music sex and alcohol. Well what did you expect Turkey is a much different place? What was tame for us was probably raunchy for them. Context people context.As with all the 70's Turkish movies I have seen I cannot take them seriously. I find them quite amusing along with the lingering misogynistic undertones seems like more women died in this movie than men. There also seems to be a lot of time spent in showing running driving and chasing. If you have never seen a Turkish movie try to get one with the appropriate subtitles. Understanding the dialog will only help you slightly as the plots and edits are complicated not to mention the cultural differences. I have seen Turkish movies without the subtitles and I can tell you it gets pretty confusing Turkish Star Wars I'm looking at you.These movies would have been prime candidates for MST3k. If only that were still possible. Maybe in an alternate universe. Until then make mine a double whiskey. It's for the pain.".

	schema:headline " Spidey Sense Tingling Because This Weird Movie Sucks!";
	schema:reviewBody "This funky Turkish interpretation of graphic novel lore has SpiderMan as an ultra mean bad guy running a gang of thugs in Istanbul on the wrong side of town. He has none of his Spider powers which I guess is why he is so angry but makes up for some of it via his ruthlessness and a peculiar ability to come from the dead  multiple times.In fact SpiderMan while noticeably less agile looks as though he has let himself go a bit and is a tad flabby What we in Canada refer to as Molson Muscle. His costume has some noticeable signs of wear and tear as well and his bushy eyebrows peak out of eye slits in his mask.Could it be that the makers of this film got their accounts of SpiderMan's exploits only from the slanderous accounts provided by that yellow journalism scandalsheet the Daily Bugle? If they read the comics they would know that SpiderManPeter Parker would never use his powers for evil. What would his Aunt May think of him? Worse what would the spirit of his Uncle Ben think? Clearly this baddie is just some dude who ordered an illfitting cheap imitation SpiderMan costume and couldn't get his money back.A rather improbable team up of Captain America Akkaya and Santo Selekman the wrestlersuperhero track the Spider Gang to Turkey after SpiderMan's counterfeiting scheme in Mexico leaves a trail of angry people on both sides of the law. Cap's famous shield evidently didn't clear Turkish customs as we don't see it. But his girlfriend Julia came with him to help.This film is so spectacularly wrong on so many levels as to show the value of copyright protection as preservation of artistic integrity more than proper assignment of royalties. Turkey then under the control of a military junta in a chaotic struggle with terrorist groups and engaged in a brutal suppression of leftist elements offered no such copyright protection to products of comic book heroism or Western entertainment.Like the Turkish version of Star Wars and Star Trek the staging of a ripoff like this utterly defies logic. Why not just dub or subtitle the SpiderMan cartoon and Santo movies into Turkish? Or better yet why just make a completely original set of characters with Turkish identities? There is lowgrade production value and then there is nograde production value. What is shown here is beyond what Hollywood producers would deem incredibly cheap though the cast soldiers on even with the various continuity errors and other goofs. It doesn't look like they were given a safe working environment to shoot under but really what does that even mean when the Turkish government was rounding up people  very much including artists and locking them up for even being suspected of having leftist sympathies? In one scene where Captain America rescues Julia from the baddies at the Spider gang's safehouse we see a pretty silly action sequence. Hanging from conveniently placed acrobat rings Cap attempts to heelkick one of the baddies behind him but the stunt guys must have messed up the timing because he misses. The thug falls anyway and from the angle of the shot it looks as though the villainous henchman has been knocked unconscious by a devastating explosive fart to the face from the hero.Captain America's subsequent fight with SpiderMan betrays the fact that Cap is for whatever reason a lot more acrobatic than Spidey. El Santo is by contrast to SpiderMan in considerably better shape than we have seen him and unlike the real Santo generally goes unmasked. Santo in the Mexican movies he was hero of was never seen in public without his mask.The comedic possibilities offered in Santo's time on screen are rife as he infiltrates a dogo serving as a front for the Spider Gang discovers incriminating papers in a back office and stuffs them in his tights in a manner which looks as though he has done it to make his crotch bulge look bigger.Unintentional humor throughout offers countless openings for snide oneliners and sarcasm.

	onyx:emotionText "This funky Turkish interpretation of graphic novel lore has SpiderMan as an ultra mean bad guy running a gang of thugs in Istanbul on the wrong side of town. He has none of his Spider powers which I guess is why he is so angry but makes up for some of it via his ruthlessness and a peculiar ability to come from the dead  multiple times.In fact SpiderMan while noticeably less agile looks as though he has let himself go a bit and is a tad flabby What we in Canada refer to as Molson Muscle. His costume has some noticeable signs of wear and tear as well and his bushy eyebrows peak out of eye slits in his mask.Could it be that the makers of this film got their accounts of SpiderMan's exploits only from the slanderous accounts provided by that yellow journalism scandalsheet the Daily Bugle? If they read the comics they would know that SpiderManPeter Parker would never use his powers for evil. What would his Aunt May think of him? Worse what would the spirit of his Uncle Ben think? Clearly this baddie is just some dude who ordered an illfitting cheap imitation SpiderMan costume and couldn't get his money back.A rather improbable team up of Captain America Akkaya and Santo Selekman the wrestlersuperhero track the Spider Gang to Turkey after SpiderMan's counterfeiting scheme in Mexico leaves a trail of angry people on both sides of the law. Cap's famous shield evidently didn't clear Turkish customs as we don't see it. But his girlfriend Julia came with him to help.This film is so spectacularly wrong on so many levels as to show the value of copyright protection as preservation of artistic integrity more than proper assignment of royalties. Turkey then under the control of a military junta in a chaotic struggle with terrorist groups and engaged in a brutal suppression of leftist elements offered no such copyright protection to products of comic book heroism or Western entertainment.Like the Turkish version of Star Wars and Star Trek the staging of a ripoff like this utterly defies logic. Why not just dub or subtitle the SpiderMan cartoon and Santo movies into Turkish? Or better yet why just make a completely original set of characters with Turkish identities? There is lowgrade production value and then there is nograde production value. What is shown here is beyond what Hollywood producers would deem incredibly cheap though the cast soldiers on even with the various continuity errors and other goofs. It doesn't look like they were given a safe working environment to shoot under but really what does that even mean when the Turkish government was rounding up people  very much including artists and locking them up for even being suspected of having leftist sympathies? In one scene where Captain America rescues Julia from the baddies at the Spider gang's safehouse we see a pretty silly action sequence. Hanging from conveniently placed acrobat rings Cap attempts to heelkick one of the baddies behind him but the stunt guys must have messed up the timing because he misses. The thug falls anyway and from the angle of the shot it looks as though the villainous henchman has been knocked unconscious by a devastating explosive fart to the face from the hero.Captain America's subsequent fight with SpiderMan betrays the fact that Cap is for whatever reason a lot more acrobatic than Spidey. El Santo is by contrast to SpiderMan in considerably better shape than we have seen him and unlike the real Santo generally goes unmasked. Santo in the Mexican movies he was hero of was never seen in public without his mask.The comedic possibilities offered in Santo's time on screen are rife as he infiltrates a dogo serving as a front for the Spider Gang discovers incriminating papers in a back office and stuffs them in his tights in a manner which looks as though he has done it to make his crotch bulge look bigger.Unintentional humor throughout offers countless openings for snide oneliners and sarcasm. But no one needs to say anything as this Turkish ripoff lampoons itself so perfectly.";

In a poorly designed costume with no eye pieces to cover his actual eyes. The one thing that makes this SpiderMan look unusual is his large eye lashes. I don't think Spider Man has ever been depicted that way in any comic from my knowledge. Anyways Spider Man is causing crime in Turkey so Captain America and Santosyes as in the wrestler came to Turkey to defeat him.Not a lot to say about it other than it's unusual and low budget. Every the opening of the movie was low budget. The one thing I'd love to know is does SpiderMan have a good reputation in Turkey or is this how people see Spider Man in Turkey. I don't know that answer for sure. Cause I wonder if the Director or writer of this movie have anything against SpiderMan. No one knows for sure so all I could do is speculate that the director and writer hated him so much they decided to make a movie to show every one in Turkey how horrible he is. But why's Captain America portray as good and not Spider Man. They're from the same comic company. While Santos was thrown in cause he's a big celebrity in the country of Turkey.For die hard SpiderMan fans this is a laugh riot and to non fans of SpiderMan this is still funny to watch.".

Santo is a secret agent who rarely wears his mask and puts things directly into his pants pockets by damned. And Captain America doesn't have a shield smokes and brings his girlfriend Julia along.Just strap yourself in  3 Giant Men is a ride into insanity the kind of world that Sergeant Joe Friday worried about when kids in the 60's started doing LSD and jumping out of windows.Istanbul! The Spider's Gang  led by SpiderMan  are taking over. They cut the head off of a woman with a boat propeller to start the movie off right.The film then kicks into the craziest title sequence ever  they basically filmed a board of photographs pulling out on image after image with the type for each credit simply vinyl type on a board.Julia Captain America's girlfriend is captured but is able to send a distress call to Cap who rescues her but can't catch SpiderMan after a battle through a graveyard. Captain America is played by Aytekin Akkaya who was Ali in Dnyay Kurtaran Adam better known as Turkish Star Wars and Ukan in Yor the Hunter from the Future.I'd like to inform all of you right now that SpiderMan has the biggestt eyebrows you've ever seen. He can also die and come back to life with no lasting damage for some reason. He also gets his men to drop off what I can only refer to as minitents near mafia bases emerging from them to kill other gangs.Meanwhile Santo infiltrates a dojo known for counterfeiting. Santo's fight style is to basically no sellkicks to the face and do rolls and judo. So you know nothing at all like he real Santo. He also likes to look right at the camera whenever he is film. I could watch Santo fight karate men for hours and hours of my life. Santo gets captured but escapes with the evidence. He and Cap raid a hideout while SpiderMan kills a woman in the shower.Spidey calls out the dude who let Santo escape punishing him by putting a tube over his head and letting two guinea pigs EAT HIS FACE. Sorry to scream this movie this movie is just one shock after the other. Spidey tops it off by watching couple shower ! killing them by stabbing them together ala Jason Vorhees to Jeff and Sandra in Friday the 13th Part 2 !! and then stealing a statue that has no importance toward the rest of the movie !!!.Yes. If you are keeping score SpiderMan has two different shower based kill scenes in this movie. If you like your Peter Parker murderous then this flick is for you. But wait what would make this movie better? If you answered watching SpiderMan have sex while surrounded by frightening puppets then you are on the same wavelength as the insane people who made this movie. You should really speak to someone or be on one of this lists where you have to announce yourself to all of your neighbors when you move.Santo and Captain America then battle SpiderMan again where we find out that there are four Spideys several of which die horribly. After some undercover work at a club  the same club we keep seeing with a girl in shadow spinning boob tassles  SpiderMan's goons kidnap our heroes. They fight one another but it's all a clever ruse as they kill almost all of the gang members including SpiderMan's girlfriend who is not Mary Jane Watson Gwen Stacy Felicia Hardy Betty Brant Carlie Cooper or Liz Allen.There's a battle that doesn't stop until every SpiderMan is dead. Spideys get knocked off ladders their necks broken and crushed by presses. It's an orgy of Spider destruction highlighted by Captain America's trademark offense one footed dropkicks  face slaps and punches to the belly.But just as Cap is about to leave town he sees one more Spidey. However it's just a kid in a mask. I don't know if it's possible to love a movie as much as I love 3 Giant Men. Today's superhero movies fail to capture the majesty of this film. It answers the big questions the ones no one had the guts to ask or care about. Cap punching Spider in the breadbasket? It's in there. Santo powerbombing goons and then putting them into submission holds in a nightclub? Yes. Wacky asides with comical music? Yes. A Cap that smokes and wears a leisure suit? Evet.3 Giant Men comes in at 78 minutes of what I can only imagine being in a coma and pumped full of iowaska would feel like. Everyone knows all about Japanese SpiderMan Takuya Yamashiro they do right? but laughing killing giant eyebrow having Turkish SpiderMan? He is the greatest villain ever in the best superhero movie ever made.".

The one thing I didn't expect this movie to do is make such a popular character... nothing like him. 3 Dev Adam or Three Giant Men or Turkish SpiderMan as fans refer to it as. I'm not gonna address much of the plot because it's a foreign film. It's not that I don't like foreign films In fact I love Felidae I just don't speak Turkey so I can't get much out of it. So the 3 Dev Adam in this are SpiderMan Captain America and Santo. But this time SpiderMan is a sinister assassin who... is trying to take over the world I guess? Wow Jonah Jameson was right about this one he really is a menace. It's up to Santo and Cap to foil his evil plans. Now I know it's the seventies but even then this movie was pretty strange. Though I got to appreciate it because of how funny it is. In a sex scene it cuts to some guy laughing and playing with... gnomes? Can someone please explain to me what the h is going on?? At least the music is good pretty catchy for the 70s. The quality is okay for a 70s movie but the SpiderMan costume is pretty silly it looks far from what the cover of the movie shows it as. There's a bit of blood not too much but some of the killings are pretty shocking including one where a white rat eats a man's face off barely shown or SpiderMan gets his head crushed but I digress. I'd rate this PG13 for blood and brief sexuality not too inappropriate. I personally rate this 7 stars out of 10 it's not a masterpiece by any means but it does provide some enjoyment whether or not you can figure out what the actors are saying.".

	schema:headline " God wouldn't be amused";
	schema:reviewBody "3faltig or Dreifaltig is a GermanAustrian coproduction from 2010 and this is one of the more recent but not most recent film efforts by Harald Sicheritz an Austrian filmmaker born in Sweden who has been among the most prolific and successful of his country for several decades now. He is the director here as well as one of the several writers. Another would be Christian Tramitz who is a colead in this film and still known to many today for his collaborations with Michael Herbig. Tramitz' colead is German poster boy if you can still call him at that age Matthias Schweighfer perhaps Germany's most overrated actor of them all as he basically singlehandedly destroyed the German comedy genre for over a decade now. He is the one that makes Ulmen and Schweiger still look talented. Anyway back to this awardnominated work we have here. You could call it a divine comedy as references about God and Jesus are dominant in here from start to finish. But it's really all for the laughs and the way one character tries to keep another one happy by introducing him to strip shows for example says all about the film's approach. It is not trying to make a dramatic statement. The cast includes several big names from Austria thanks to Sicheritz such as his longtime collaborator Roland Dringer but also the likes of Alfred Dorfer and Adele Neuhauser for example. But it also includes Michael Schweighfer for example and it always says a lot about a film when a lead character gets his family mates in as Matthias did in many other films too for example with his mother Gitta. Anyway all in all I think that Sicheritzh proves with this work that he still has it. There are some genuinely funny moments in here and even if you could argue if it is enough for a 1.5hour film these moments somehow make it work at times and justify this film being made. Sadly the casting has the one big flaw I already mentioned early on and there are more than one example when Schweighfer really shows once again he is not lead actor material and while other actors like Tramitz elevate the material at times because they have genuine comedic talent Schweighfer does the opposite. One example the line about having a djvu relatively late in the film. For me this casting was a negative dealbreaker which is why I don't recommend it overall. Quite a shame as there was the potential for much more.".

But than slowly things began to sink in and suddenly I felt exposed to an entire world that had been constructed very carefully  it felt if you had gone to a party where you did not know anybody and than slowly started to figure out people and connections between them. The overall mood was quite melancholic  but also very human and in its observation of a life standing still quite desperate. Interestingly I went with a group of friends after the film people had quite different opinions on it  taking into account that not many words seem to be spoken during the film it did keep us busy talking all evening. What I liked most was the very finely crafted performances of the cast  especially the unspoken desires the life underneath our skin seemed so transparent. In that sense it did in a way remind me of that Russian author Chechow but that might be a very big comparison. If you ever have the chance to get hold of it I can only recommend it  that by the way is the true great thing about seeing films at Edinburgh you just run into things you would not expect and you go home enriched and provoked and not only dully entertained.".

Nothing of any importance is said by any character and the only lines they manage to utter seem like stock samples that are only in there to prevent it from being a silent film.

	schema:reviewBody "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spiderman film so he quit and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.First off Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spiderman Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spiderman does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this with no reason! And there is still about an hour left so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy who is never seen afterwords that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard a point that doesn't amount to anything except the lizard finding out who spiderman is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords and as of right now there are only 10 people infected so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie don't waste your time with this movie even Spiderman 3 was better than this so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy at least those movies had effort put into them.".

Don't watch this movie don't waste your time with this movie even Spiderman 3 was better than this so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy at least those movies had effort put into them.";

	schema:headline " The Amazingly Unnecessary Spiderman";
	schema:reviewBody "With the success of the first XMen movie in 2000 Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy Tobey Maguire gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way then Rami provided the icing on the cake a faithful smart wellacted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned though underrated third episode.Which brings us to what we have here while not a beat for beat remake you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker Andrew Garfield sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactivegenetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes SpiderMan. Meanwhile a doctor Rhys Ifans working at the same facility is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation he injects himself with an untested selfgenerating lizard vaccine and becomes a half manhalf lizard thing. SpiderMan is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy Emma Stone is the damsel in distresslove interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals has good effects a scary and menacing villain some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that SpiderMan is a menace to the public is more clearly defined especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer it's just that it's so pointless. We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been SpiderMan 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel  in their infinite wisdom  just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version Parker being picked on getting advice from his sagelike uncle Martin Sheen being bitten getting his powersclimbing walls and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original then the short answer is as good as Andrew Garfield is Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better on occasion Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity  especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask why does this movie exist?And there are holes there's a massive lizard running around wreaking havoc yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at SpiderMan  despite the fact that he saved a child in a surprise surprise rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part the citizens of the city once again  in a bit taken from Rami's movie unite to help SpiderMan cross the city using tower cranes  despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck even the villain is initially a dogooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius  again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins 2005 in that it's slightly darker tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins SpiderMan doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's SpiderMan the result is what you have here. Additionally the introduction of the web shooters while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea they're not. In certain situations they can work well provided for example enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002 go watch it instead. If you have seen it then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen this movie will seem rather halfhearted and senseless for those under eighteen this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes it's a movie that will divide opinions primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad or a badly made flick by any means just a pointless one.".

Here your uncle dies and what you see is 2 mins of drama about him. They really did not expand the characters and that led to my disappointment. This really isn't the spiderman I wanted to see full of questioning thoughts and hardship. This guy was crying one minute and kissing the girl in another. Did I even mention that the suit did not fully fit him? Did I mention that Peter became a super scientists in 5 mins after he start reading 2 books and a couple of documents that do not make sense? Since when kids study genetics in school so deeply? TobeyMan's story deeper and more interesting. You could see the bright side of having super powers and the dark of constantly having the responsibility to hide your identity and take care of the closest. The new Spidey did little effort to hide his id. I could actually say that he was waving his mask the entire movie...If you were happy with Tobeyman stick with him!".

Well sure enough it is.Warning spoilers ahead.The reasons that this film isn't good are simple Most of the action scenes take place at night and are visually uninteresting as the CGI and night sky don't make good bedfellows. There is one action scene at day in which you can actually see what's going on and its in a high school that clearly isn't anywhere within a three mile radius of New York.We all understand how they shoot interiors in Culver City.. But the last spiderman films seamlessly blended shoots from Chicago New York Los Angeles without the audience ever noticing. This film does not in fact the only attempt to make the high school look like New York is a lame sign.This film's story has been done before you've seen it before and with the exception of the Osbournes and the color of the love interests hair there is not much new to this story.Dennis Leary is great as is Martin Sheen but they're both killed off. Martin Sheen is killed off in the beginning of this boring movie making it more painful as he was one of the only reliefs.Aunt May is written so poorly that she has nothing to do in this movie. She sits at home and watches TV and screams at Peter when she sees him. Not exactly a challenging role for the great Sally Field.There was little care that went into the quality of this film and the attempts at making it dark are just flat out Corny such as the cannibal rat which is pure comedy and comes out of nowhere to 'shock' the audience.There seems to be no conflict between Peter and his girlfriend at the end of the story which one would logically want to assume that she holds out some contempt for spiderman as Harry did in the original spiderman after Spiderman played a hand in his death. Spiderman did play a hand in the Captain's death yet the daughter doesn't seem to mind that Peter was there when he was murdered.This film had great visual effects obscured by the night time setting and slow down camera techniques. Other than that it's a music video and it pulls NO surprises. You have already seen this film if you've seen the extended trailer or the 2002 Green Goblin movie.The chemistry between the two leads is lame with Andrew Garfield who is wonderful in other films and stage productions giving a few moments of overacting that take away Peter's humanity and spell the word HAM with it. Also they appear to be improvising in some of their scenes the result is two young MEGARICH people trying to imagine what blue collared kids from Queen's social customs would be like and let me tell you they FAIL in a telling and Inauthentic way.This movie does not have you believe in the setting or characters at all.

	schema:reviewBody "Only five years after the universallyhated SpiderMan 3not me though Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is actionpacked has a great cast and a rather fun villain in The Lizard but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave SpiderMan a name for himself.Marc Webb's film explores the origins of SpiderMan and also unlike the trilogy we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain Gwen Stacy.The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew GarfieldEmma Stone pairing is not as good as the MaguireDunst pairing but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary Martin Sheen and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.Overall this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves is this a necessary reboot? Honestly I would rather have seen a SpiderMan 4 but who's to complain. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. But hey I was entertained and that is all what matters. I rate this film 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Spiderman since childhood. In fact he has been my favorite superhero. I liked Spiderman 1 2 and 3 watched Spiderman 3 twice despite many reviewers bashing it.So it's natural I was waiting eagerly for The Amazing Spiderman. I was more eager because this movie was rebooting the Spiderman franchise with new cast that included Indian actor Irfan Khan and it was getting released in India before US! Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment. It was like they didn't make a Spiderman movie but a caricatureremake or a spoof of it. Bad script confused and weak characters bad direction and bad editing are some of the major flaws. Story was too bland no spice no excitement.The important scenes where Peter gets bitten or hones his skills or makes his suit have been hurried and short while the irrelevant scenes have been dragged.Spiderman gets beaten defeated injured repeatedly. In fact the audience was laughing hard on the repeated scenes of him coming home all thrashed and bruised and his aunt talking to him about it. He keeps removing his mask for just anybody and that's not very Spidermanlike.Most action scenes were nonthrilling. In a scene where Spiderman rescues a boy from a falling and burning car he wastes almost 5 minutes trying to convince Jack the boy to be brave climb up and hold his hand. He even gives the boy his mask but the boy doesn't follow him. So in the end he has to throw his spiderthread to pull Jack up. He could have done that already and spared us of that boredom.It was just an example. Most encounters between the lizardman and Spiderman were equally boring dragged and nonsensical.There were a lot of loose ends and missing links in the story. Like the story of Peter's parents was never shown but the characters kept mentioning it. Dr. Ratha talks about some Mr. Osbourne but neither the man nor his story was shown. Maybe they're keeping it for the sequel but the confusion totally spoiled this movie. A lot of inconsistencies were there too. Sometimes things stick to Peter's hands and break by little force sometimes they don't.The romance between PeterSpiderman and Gwen looked lukewarm and forced. The scene where the burglar kills Peter's uncle looked awkward and disconnected like many other scenes.Andrew Garfield didn't look much convincing either as nerdy Peter Parker or as Spiderman. He was good in The Social Network but a disappointment in this movie. In many bodycloseup shots he was bending forward apparently to hide his penisline from showing in the tightsuit. That made the already weak Spiderman look even weaker. Since when have Hollywood actors become this bashful?Irfan Khan appeared in just 3 short scenes. He was more like an extra. But the audience welcomed him with a bout of whistling!Everyone seemed to be waiting anxiously for the movie to end which ends after further boring you for some time after the defeat of the villain. So much I wish they had made Spiderman 4 with Tobey Maguire instead of this disaster.I might as well watch Rajnikant's Robot now".

I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't killed just defeated and put in prison giving him a second chance. However I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producerswriters wanted something to write a future film on. I think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles. Garfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see that in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe it was geared toward a younger audience unlike the Dark Knight. The fact that Spiderman is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes.

But what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.Heart soul good soundtrack excellent score acting chemistry heroism humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original SpiderMan movies  and yeah even 3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious J. Johan Jameson. Shame.I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker a love interest the bullies the Aunt  Uncle the spider bite the transformation and the first tryouts. Without anyone and I guess me now spoiling that we all knew that was coming. But what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.And pleasePLEASE do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before The Untold Story was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's allbut irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.What the movie is trying to tell us is that SpiderMan is a hero that he loves Gwen Stacy and that despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact it showed so much and yet so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given halfass explanations.Don't get me wrong I didn't fullon hate on The Amazing SpiderMan. Of the approximately 20 minutes of 136 of screen time Spidey was on the screen he lookeddecent albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield SpiderMan's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10yearold original? Yes except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh and as much as I love Emma Stone her character Gwen Stacy first introduced in SpiderMan 3 was so lifeless you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again of the 136 minutes 40 were good but that did not outweigh the bad3D effects or 96 other slowpaced unoriginal and uninspiring minutes.".

I also got a question here would a halfarm person lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the PeterGwen romanceit was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I honestly couldn't care less.And besidesthere are only repeated references of that matter and no actual clues to followanother cheat sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting bitten by the spider since the movie is a reboot and then on the lizard matter. Comparing with the original SpidermanSam Raimi's at this point is inevitable. The question is raised is there anything more they could possibly tweakalter? Couldn't they stick to the comic plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no actual impact on himjust a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much I say let Ben live in this one flick!Connors is underdevelopedso his motives are not clearlizard wants to turn everybody like himself although able to talk with fantastic pronunciation!!!and be sane.I don't get if there is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizardthe film doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard talk to him only complicates things more.The directorin order to promote this filmboasted that this film uses very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is extensive use of cgi it's actually also very bad.I can't comment further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his own.What gives it away is motioncolors are OK. Gravital issues also occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really heavyHulkGodzillalikeand at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a very enjoyable scene overallGarfield's humorous lines help too.The flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate it.Had there not been the Spiderman maskI would never recognize the man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical electrical? web shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comicslet's give them thatbut I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above in this new film they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in order to do that!.One of my first thoughts was how many times had the directorWebbtaken me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a television series or something. FurthermoreWebb never seemed to understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his whole approach to this project was false.Few examplesPeter Parker being a skateboarder ! while a genius geek at the same time.There are more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally go on forever.To conclude there is no stigmastyleinteresting shots there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I haven't seen his other movie but he did an amateur job.Take out the CGI and production money and you have yourself a fanmade film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he can directand his movies are really heavymeaning important and professional.I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him before the eyes of us fans.".

I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as SpiderMan that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then but now when I saw this I must say that I like Andrew Garfields version better. He's a little more tougher both physically and in personality. Also I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain too was great. I won't say more about him not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least it's mediocre. Giving this a 110 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.".

He's a little more tougher both physically and in personality. Also I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain too was great. I won't say more about him not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least it's mediocre. Giving this a 110 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.";

There Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider. He discovers he has super strength spider sense agility and other stuff.Well this movie is realistic but sometimes it seems some scenes need something else something really powerful has the character SpiderMan. The actors are wonderful the special effects are awesome and the Costumes...oh are great. In the movie it isn't very difficult to find the answer of the main story and that it's very good. When SpiderMan is helped by cranes to arrive Oscorp and stop the Lizardthe scene is special but not powerful to make the fans watch and watch very very very times without get bored. About the soundtrack i have to admit I LOVE IT!More Heroic than the older moviesSam Raimi this soundtrack can prove who really is SpiderMan the hero we love.The Lizard a powerful villain to SpiderMan the fights between them are more based on dodges kicks and webs fired but still are awesome. We don't see the full transformation of the Lizard which is a little bad just can see a part of the transformation.Other things the director Marc Webb did was use the SpiderMan into the water when he makes a silk trap for the Lizard. It is very clever and detailed. We can see small lizards walking but the lizards are made in computer and turns unrealistic in that point.I simply love when the Lizard discovers SpiderMan's identity and Peter Parker has become in a timebomb. Now what happens with his father and his mother? We have to wait to see The Amazing SpiderMan 2 which arrives in 2 May 2014.In the scene when Uncle Ben died is emotional but something is missing in that scene maybe more time I guess. In conclusion The Amazing SpiderMan is a AMAZING movie but still is far away to be excellent. I really hope in the next movie they increase the story and the scenes. This movie is the movie we been waiting for years.".

It is more comic accurate than the Raimi films such as the web shooters and Gwen Stacy as the love interest instead of Mary Jane. I liked the new suit because it looked like a teen could make it. The villain the lizard was a great first foe for spider man. Uncle Bens death scene made me want to cry and Garfields reaction was sad. I love how Gwen comforted him and Flash didn't bully him out of sorrow. i love how peter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero fighting all crime.".

The movie was too complicated for children and was strange for adults like me.Despite of Emma stone and Sally field being totally wasted in their respective roles. I still thought that Andrew garfield would do a good job in the movie or at least justice to the spiderman character but he too seemed lost in the school He is only 28years old Why did peter and gwen need to go to a school school which occupies half of Manhattan ? as if that is possible in NY.Dr. Connors seemed deranged more than seeming like a genius. when you see a Marvel movie you expect the villain to display a lot of shades of grey and here we had an antagonist who seemed to be obsessed with improving mankind of all its weakness.our dear Dr. Norman Osborn seemed to be dying in the movie God save the green goblin what are we going to do in the sequel if the green goblin is not saved !!! Irfan khan was visiting from the sets of MIB4 or maybe 5 he seems better suited there and not as a scientist dressed in all black.Peter's parents have a small side track which is left unexplained that it leaves viewers perplexed as to why did we just waste 20 minutes talking about them !!! A dying police chief applauds spiderman for his service to NY and tells him that he is meant for great things but also makes him promise to stay away from his daughter. The man just gave his life for the country but seems to be an overprotective father.I had gone in thinking that i would see a movie as amazing as The Avengers but clearly i was disappointed.

The Amazing SpiderMan is divisive with opinions ranging from it being the best SpiderMan film so far to being a waste of space.Peter Parker Andrew Garfield is a nerdy outsider who enjoys photography inventing and skateboarding. His parents mysteriously run off in the middle of the night when he was young and he has been living with his Uncle Ben Martin Sheen and Aunt May Sally Field ever since. One evening Peter finds his father's briefcase which contents his research that he wanted to hid from mysterious forces. Peter is led to Oscorb meeting his father's old research partner Curt Connors Rhys Ifans and he ends up getting bitten by a genetically altered spider giving his spider powers.When Uncle Ben is murdered on the streets Peter goes on the hunt for his killer leading him to become Spiderman. But at the same time Connors is forced to test an experimental serum on himself leading him to become the Lizard a powerful creature that is a deadly threat to the whole of New York.Let's get the comparisons to the original Spiderman films out the way the special effects are better I preferred the hyperrealistic look of this version then the original film and Garfield is a stronger Peter ParkerSpiderman then Tobey Maguire was. But Cliff Robertson was a better Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was perfect as Aunt May and Field was not able to compete. On the whole I felt that the original film was generally a better origins story I preferred that Peter was bitten by a spider in a lab visit and I especially preferred Uncle Ben's death in the original film because it had more emotional impact and handled better because Peter comes up a real dick in The Amazing SpiderMan.There are also comparisons to actual scenes and ideas between the original film and the reboot which will lead to some spoilers. We get similar scenes of Peter awkwardly using his powers when he first gets them citizens of New York crane lift operators helping SpiderMan during his confrontation with the villain and Peter losing a father figure which results in Peter having to reject the woman he loves. There are even similarities between the villains as both men are scientist are forced to experiment on themselves and developed a split personality.The SpiderMan origins story is equal to Superman and Batman for wellknown it is and there is less leeway for reinterpretation. I personally felt that it was a waste going through the origins story again because it is so well known killing the pacing especially because it takes an hours before we get to see Peter Parker don the spandex. It would have been more effective if Peter Parker was SpiderMan and the origin was done in flashbacks. But once SpiderMan does show up the pacing picks up with gusto and director Marc Webb shows great confidence with the action sequences and special effects even more impressive considering his previous film was 500 Days of Summer.As a comic book fans I would have liked to have seen Curt Connors' family adding to the dilemma of Peter Parker trying to stop the Lizard without harming him too much and made Connors more sympathetic. I also would have preferred to see more of a snout and be a raging beast but Ifans is talented actor and it is good to see him in a Hollywood film. Ifans did have a great sinister delivery as The Lizard.One more small criticism is some of the humour in the first half film which was weak a little awkward and was topped off by comedy music. It was out of place for a film going for a more serious tone.Danny Elfman did supply strong scores for the first two films particular giving the series a signatory theme tone. Whilst James Horner's score for The Amazing Spiderman does not quite those heights he still gives the new series some good music that is dramatic soaring and triumph when needed.On the whole there are elements which The Amazing SpiderMan does improve upon the original SpiderMan whilst the original SpiderMan was better on other parts. If there was a way to blend both films together then you would properly get the perfect SpiderMan film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hardcore fans of Sam Raimi's Spiderman can rail all they want to. THIS version of the Marvel Comics superhero Marc Webb's THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2012 is BETTER! While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter ParkerSpiderman Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty amazing newcomer Andrew Garfield who was superb in The Social Network as the wellknown iconic character of Peter ParkerSpiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and twotime Oscar winner Sally Field as a child.Peter's father was a brilliant scientist working on crossgenetics technology that allows an organism to cure and regenerate itself by merging with another. Peter a novice photographer who inherited his father's science acumen accidentally stumbles upon some of his father's work in his Aunt and Uncle's attic including a formula that solves the crossgenetic puzzle that his father's former colleague Dr. Curt Connors sublimely played by Rhys Ifans has been trying to solve for years. After sneaking into the Oscorp facility and passing himself off as an intern Peter snoops into a lab full of test subject spiders one of which latches onto him and bites him giving him spiderlike abilities strength speed elusiveness scales webshooting.Connors works for Oscorp whose founder and leader Norman Oscorp is dying and in need of a cure and so Connors is trying to use the crossgeneticism to accomplish this. With Peter's help the puzzle is solved and Connors ends up using himself as the first human test subject as he has only arm which becomes regenerated but it also has enormous side effects transforming him into The Lizard Spiderman's first enemy.During this time Peter caught up in his work with Oscorp and bemoaning his parents' abandonment selfishly chooses to ignore a robbery which inadvertently leads to his Uncle Ben's death so Peter initially uses his newfound powers to go an a rampage to find his Uncle's killer as he stalks the streets of New York on a nightly basis bringing lowlife criminals to justice.A romance develops between Peter and his fellow highschooler the equally scientifically inclined Gwen Stacy played with exquisite charm and maturity by the gifted Emma Stone. The PeterGwen relationship is really the heart of this film. Very beautiful and engaging. In addition to his Aunt and Uncle Gwen actually gives Peter a purpose and direction. Even though in virtually every modern superhero film the girlfriend always seems to find out the secret identity this is the first film that I think does it in a truly genuine clever mature and natural way and not just for shock value or cheap effect. I dare say that the romantic aspect is really the MAIN reason why this film works whereas in Raimi's flicks I couldn't wait for the romantic parts to come and go to get to the action! Credit really must go to Garfield and Stone for having incredible chemistry and being terrific actors. The Raimi films are really juvenile by comparison when it comes to the realistic love story in TAS. Special mention should also go to legendary comedian Denis Leary who does an extremely effective and refreshing turn as Gwen's father Police Captain Stacy injecting the character with his trademark sarcasm but also coming across as very commanding.Another thing this film does is that it literally builds Peter from the ground up as a hero making him learn the hard way through attempts failures experiences pain loss and gain. Even many times when Peter is wearing the suit he still acts very human and downtoearth. He has to LEARN how to be a hero by still using his own instincts and common sense. It's not just about looking cool scaling walls and kicking ass! Spiderman isn't Superman! The film also stages the action as realistic as possible with a healthy dose of CG effects of course. But here unlike in Raimi's films every action scene makes sense and we get to see how Spidey must use his webs on ACTUAL surfaces! Not just magically touching the sky the webs hit just about everything in sight buildings cars windows and even other people! Garfield is simply superb as the awkward gifted teenaged Peter Parker who has led a tragic existence but finds a purpose through the memory of his parents his aunt and uncle Gwen and the innocent citizens of New York. I usually think sequels suck but I patiently await the sequel to his underrated underappreciated extremely compelling and original superhero flick!".

	schema:reviewBody "I first was going to see another movie but my cousin wanted to see this. I walk into the movie theater thinking 'Yeah this'll probably suck and be boring' and came out with chills. I saw this movie in 3D and it felt like I was there with the actors in all the scenes! Of course the fight scenes were a little bland and they could have added a little more action. But the part when Peter is Spiderman and he was doing flips up in the air also swinging across buildings literally gave me an adrenaline rush. It was an amazing feeling.But the best part of this movie wasn't the action but the chemistry between Peter Andrew Garfield and Gwen Emma Stone. Every time they had a scene together I could absolutely tell that they were in love. Their love story was one of the best parts of this movie because it blossomed from them being cute and flirty to being completely head over heels in love with each other. They were both charming but also pulled it off as their character very well Emma as the intelligent graceful Gwen and Andrew as the cute but awkward and nerdy Peter. They were definitely the highlights of this film.Like every movie it had it's flaws. I think that they could have chosen a better villain than 'The Lizard'. Don't get me wrong Rhys Ifans was a good actor in this film but his character just felt rushed to me. One moment I see him as a brilliant kindhearted scientist to him then becoming psychotic and turning himself into a giant green monster way too quickly. Also I didn't think he looked like a lizard at all. Honestly I think once he turned into 'The Lizard' he looked a lot like 'Lord Voldemort' from 'Harry Potter'. He was the only character I had an issue with though everyone else was great and was perfect for their part.Another issue that a lot of people complained about was the lack of thrilling fight scenes. The fight scenes in this movie were a little clich like you have seen it in another action movie. Also the fight scenes just kind of came and went. They were so quick and just very boring like you knew every move SpiderMan AKA Peter was going to make. I thought they should have put a little more effort into these scenes and they should've put a lot more action into them.Honestly overall this is a terrific movie! Despite some flaws I think it is definitely worth seeing. Andrew and Emma are very charming in their parts and look adorable together onscreen. It has some cute lines were I had to laugh out loud because they were just really funny! If you like a superhero movie with a comedic and romantic twist into it I think you will enjoy this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "There was no way I was going to miss this film but after reading a number of reviews by fans here I began to have some reservations. Most of that had to do with the retelling of the origin and fundamentally I agree that this probably wasn't necessary after only ten years since the Tobey McGuire version. But now that I've seen it I can say my second thoughts were unwarranted because this film provides an adrenaline rush with every spider web fired.I always had this unsettled feeling with the McGuire SpiderMan or more accurately with the McGuire Peter Parker. I found him to be too much of a wuss wimping out whenever confronted as the timid teenager. With Andrew Garfield I didn't get the impression he was OK to let things go whenever a bully came on the scene. With only one picture under his belt as opposed to Tobey's three I'm going with the new kid in town.Whether intended or not I also preferred the darker tone to this take on the Spidey character. Many of the action scenes occurred at night and better conveyed a sense that this costumed hero might be more of a menace than a friend. Peter Parker's dinner clash with Captain Stacy Denis Leary helped push that agenda and it worked pretty well.As for the main villain a mixed reaction. There were times The Lizard Rhys Ifans looked a bit corny and other times truly menacing. It seemed to me that the film had trouble establishing the villain's proportion in relation to SpiderMan and other humans. In some scenes he looked like a monster at others merely somewhat larger than SpiderMan. However the concept of crossspecies genetics on which The Lizard came to being was handled rather well and proved effective.As always my favorite moment in a Marvel hero movie did not leave me disappointed. Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance once again this time as the oblivious librarian listening to a symphony while Spidey and The Lizard make a shambles of the bookcases in the background. I can't believe he'll be ninety at the end of this year.".

A notorious attribution from the German cinema are the socalled Lmmel films 6 in total in which the young students and other youths dissociate themselves from the older generation. But as this series was made as comedy within the mainstream German cinema its rebellion is toned down to say the least and no more than a standard farce is the outcome.In this episode there are some remarks made by the students to their teachers about the Nazipast of some of them Vaterland military discipline and such but on the whole the film is no more than a series of the usual adolescent cheap and boring jokes and the usual petty love affair. The script is  just acceptable with only a hint of story in fact it is no more than a series of events wearisome held together by director Werner Jacobs who directs in his wellknown as long as it is on the celluloid style.Great comedian Theo Lingen was a regular in the series and brings with him his charm but can not provide anything else. Georg Thomalla keeps himself in check and watch how charming he can be when he does so. The rest of the cast is nondescript but I love Hannelore Elsner in her whitelace corset.It must be said that compared to the sequels and other films prompted by the Lmmel films this episode is not made badly at all  the quality such as there is would deteriorate in the sequels   but in the end the viewer will agree with the phrase that Hansi Kraus frequently says directly into the camera Man fasst es nicht  It is beyond understanding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Lmmel von der ersten Bank is a German comedy movie in color from 1968 so this one will soon have its 50th anniversary. I do not want to go much into detail about the cast you can check the list for yourself but you will find many famous names on there people who are still wellknown in Germany almost half a century later. This probably does not apply to the writer and director though. The film is not too long only runs for slightly over 80 minutes but that's good better this way than stuffed up to 100 with unnecessary filler material. It was a huge success with audiences and won a Golden Screen as a consequence. As a result of that several other Lmmel movies were made afterward with some of the cast members from this one but also new faces like Heintje who joined the gang in the second film.I personally must say the main reason why this works are not the pranks or the younger actors it's the experienced cast members especially Theo Lingen but also Rudolf Schndler who sadly only appears early on but makes me want to check out the sequels and also Gnther Schramm. In contrast to that Hans Kraus was quite forgettable and he was actually maybe the main character. His scenes when he talks to the audience are even downright cringeworthy. Hannelore Elsner brings really nothing to the table but that's more the fault of how the character was written than of her acting. And the other younger actors are also forgettable for the most part. I guess their task was just to look good. But thankfully there is the likes of Lingen in here people with real talent. They are the ones who keep this film from being a complete waste of time and they are also the ones who let me recommend the watch. Thumbs up for this first Lmmel movie.".
