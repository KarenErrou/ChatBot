While it has some murky plotting no doubt due to the reediting it's quite an interesting evocative adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel.  Ferrara always impresses with his sharp direction and the wonderful art direction really captures the feel of sleazy bars motel rooms and the Dominican Republic.  Peter Weller is fine Kelly McGillis is quite uninhibited in her numerous nude scenes and it's fun to hear Charles Durning pronounce toilet as turlet.  Cat Chaser is a lost treasure from the late 80's worthy of rediscovery and a director's edition DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cat Chaser had a fair amount of promise from the start. Its director is the maverick Abel Ferrara who was responsible for such transgressive movies as The Driller Killer and The Bad Lieutenant while its story is sourced from a novel by crime genre master Elmore Leonard. It has an interesting cast which has Peter Weller in the lead role with a very good support. Charles Durning turns in the best performance as a sleazy sidekick. Tomas Milian is the chief baddie but looks almost unrecognisable from his days as an icon in 70's Italian movies. Kelly McGillis puts in a very uninhibited performance that includes a fair amount of full frontal nudity and a tough scene where she is abused by Milian. Frederic Forrest also stars although his character doesn't really have a lot to do other than fall in swimming pools.Despite the good personnel Cat Chaser lacks a certain overall impetus. Its story feels more than a little bit confused at times. The whole plotline involving Weller's character travelling to the Caribbean to revisit a girl who saved his life years earlier is to put it mildly underdeveloped. It really could have been removed with no damage to the film in the slightest. I think the tales of the film being heavily reedited by the studio would explain the somewhat haphazard cut of the film we have. The hand of Ferrara is only occasionally felt most notably in a couple of shocking scenes. The aforementioned sequence involving McGillis is one the other occurs later on where two men are stripped naked and shot to death. Both are pretty shocking for sure.Although you have to think this movie should have been better it's overall a decent enough flick.".

It keeps you moving wondering and figuring out the mystery. The story has several components that mix well as they are revealed. And there is the basis of reality to this film. It helps to recall the invasion of the Dominican Republic and the practices of torture attributed to the head of police at the time.One of this films wonderful attributes is the score by jazz pianistcomposer Chick Corea.

But I think the real reason for the movie going direct to video is that it isn't very good overall. Not everything about the movie is bad  the acting especially by Charles Durning is decent. But the movie ultimately sinks due to a combination of unspectacular locations which are also flatly photographed and a story that after the first twenty minutes makes very little sense afterwards. The trivia section says the rough cut ran 157 minutes  obviously A LOT of explanation was taken away in the editing room. If I ever get the chance to see the 157 minute version someday I'll give the movie another chance. Until then this is a movie to avoid.".

The equivalent of the bargain box at a toy store.But I liked it. It wasn't the usual thriller and that's saying a lot given that thrillers like action movies all have relatively the same plot. They tend to be like the Harley Davidson store crowd as in they all dress the same and claim they are rebels. Cat Chaser was something different. The plot stood out. Peter Weller did as best a job he could. The cast did as best a job as they could.It was just the director didn't really know what to do with the script which was I learned thank you IMDB based on an Elmore Leonard novel...and that sort of says it all.The writer Elmore Leonard isn't exactly a literary great. He has an irritating vernacular. BUT he also has a talent for creating unique characters and unique settings and situations and stringing them all together into a coherent plot.Leonard is a pulp writer but he was a pulp writer that was original in his approach to just about everything and his stories are a pleasure to read.And when like this one they are adapted to the big screen that uniqueness carries over. Even in a bad film as this one wasalbeit a bad film with good actingit becomes a story that you haven't really encountered before and you won't encounter again.So give it a watch it's Elmore Leonard you aren't seeing a great film but you are going to see a story you haven't encountered before and to me that alone is worth 10 out of 10 stars.Don't rate it on it's cinematic prowess watch it for the plot it's new it's original and even if its badly done we need a lot more of that especially now when almost everything we see is exactly like almost everything else we are seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buckle your seat belts this film is quite the ride. As so often with David Lynch's movies 'Lost Highway' doesn't bother with a traditional narrative and follows its own dreamlike or nightmarish logic. It is a wild expressionist work of art and while it starts on a slow brooding note the film soon explodes into a crazy violent trip that hooks you competely and doesn't let up. My advice to people unfamiliar with Lynch's work is this just enjoy the experience and let yourself be immersed. While it is fun to analyze Lynch's movies especially his most surreal ones they're not mysteries that require resolution in order to be enjoyed.As for the filmmaking itself the pacing is fantastic throughout the cinematography outstanding and the cast of character actors like Bill Pullman Robert Loggia and Patricia Arquette simply a joy to watch especially Loggia gets to shine in a wonderfully overthetop part. Another aspect that should not go unmentioned is the music. The orginal score by Angeolo Badalamenti who is to Lynch what John Williams is to Spielberg is hauntgingly beautiful but equally important is the amazing soundtrack  featuring greats like David Bowie Lou Reed Rammstein Marilyn Manson Trent Reznor and more  which fits and enhances the images on screen perfectly.As far as I'm concerned this is Lynch at his best.

In this regard it is comparable in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's Dreams.  Indeed in terms of sensory experience  cinematography and sound for example  Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content.  Lost Highway is really no dream but a nightmare.Let's face it like it or not everything Lynch does is intentional.  This film has inspired polarized reviews here on IMDB.  Those looking for a plotheavy movie that they do not necessarily have to pay attention to tend to despise it.  Those who are open to allowing this manipulative intensely disturbing and thoughtprovoking film to carry them into its own parcel of hell love it.  This is in my opinion what good art can do.Like a dream Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives.  It forces itself upon you with a vengeance but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming.I recommend Lost Highway highly.  See it with intelligent openminded friends who like to talk about film experiences.  And expect that the conversation will keep you up way past your bed time.".

Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problemsolving message but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story.Most viewers will have realized that Lost Highway is a story about a schizophrenic murderer even Lynch mentioned it. But that is not the complete clue to the movie. Cause everyone is aware of Fred's metamorphosis although no one seems to really care about. So his mutation seems to be real and till the end no one proves the opposite! But Lost Highway is not a common movie about schizophrenia like Beautiful Mind or Das weie Rauschen Which is a mustsee too!. INSANITY IS NOT THE SUBJECT BUT THE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOVIE! In other words The movie is not a presentation of mental sickness but a complete sick presentation which means that the subjective perception of the protagonist becomes the objective reality! You'll find this way of telling a story quite often in surrealistic literature i.e Franz Kafka's Die Verwandlung engl. Metamorphosis  just note the title!!.All LynchMovies refer to mental illness or the state of dreaming No character ever seems to care about the illogical and irrational twists of the plotjust like in dreams the landscapes are unrealistic and change appearance or size and the story takes place at deserted areas forests claustrophobic rooms industrial areas desserts far away from civilization or reality!Insanity  Sanity Evil  Good Reality  Fiction are no longer categories one can rely on. The protagonists see their surroundings and environment always threatening but they never question it! They act with such a matter of course that one has to ask whether it is ignorance naivet or selfdeception. Perhaps you don't have to ask yourself how far you are able to UNDERSTAND the message.

	schema:headline " Lynch's most bizarre movie to date....Possible explanation only for those who have seen the film";
	schema:reviewBody "David Lynch is known for his  art films films that defy the rules and rubricks a movie should follow. Of course Lynch isn't one to follow any kind of Hollywood Rule. His films always have a general sense of the surreal of emotions only understandable to the characters and actions that defy comprehension. They always have lurid eroticism or at least one character with a sexual perversion. And for the most part his films are incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. 'Lost Highway' has just been defined for you though not explained. Perhaps the film is not meant to be explainable perhaps it is just an abstract work meant to involve us and toy with our emotions until we forget it right after we leave. But the film is memorable so that cannot be the reason. Maybe Lynch is just working out personal demons and only he is meant to benefit from doing the film. I'll explain what I mean.'Fred Madison' Bill Pullman is a sax player who performs at the local club. He and his wife 'Renee' Patricia Arquette live in a funky Lynchian house that seems designed specifically to disturb the audience. Their marriage and sex life is not going well. One day 'Renee' finds a videotape on the doorstep. When they play it it is almost like a promotional video for their house moving down every hallway before entering the bedroom where 'Fred' and 'Renee' are shown sleeping. The tape abruptly shorts out to snow. 'Fred' and 'Renee' are obviously quite bothered by this. They call the police who don't really impact the situation in any way. Later at a party 'Fred' meets an ingratiating pastyfaced man Robert Blake at a party who calmly explains ''We've met before haven't we'' and then goes on to explain they met at 'Fred's house and that the man is ''There right now phone me''. He does seem to be at both ends of the line. 'Fred' immediately grabs 'Renee and they leave to go home. This leads to one of the most tense and terrifying sequences I have ever viewed on a piece of celluloid since Hitchcock. Since we know Lynch is directing we know anything could happen......And does.I have not given away anything. In fact the events I have described might have never happened. In fact any event or character that enters the film may or may not have happened. The film exists in it's own queer dimension. Lynch shots the film like a noir with 'Renee' as the femme fatale. The colors are pitchdark and lush which helps structure the film into what it is a psychological nightmare. It manipulates our emotions to a shocking extent and we don't know how Lynch is doing it because nothing in the movie makes sense. Lynch himself uses the phrase 'psychogenic fugue' when describing the movie as he says the hero is 'inventing a fantasy because his real life is so screwed up.' Patricia Arquette is more blatant when describing the film 'Fred Madison is a fed up guy who invents a fantasy because his real life is so fed up. But Fred is so fed up that his fantasy falls apart...'' Makes sense to me. It would explain the bizarre events and would explain the ending. Fred is so angry and so paranoid that he has a fit in his car twisting and whipping his head around in circles because his fantasy has gone wrong and collapsed. The film reveals clues that support this explanation. At one point the pastyfaced man says of Renee ''Her name is Alice if she told you her name was Renee she was lying. And you who the f ARE YOU!'' This suggests that Renee has used him and that 'Fred' doesn't even know who he is. If you were inventing a fantasy about yourself and you wanted to create a given persona isn't it possible that you could forget who you were in the first place?Some people have suggested that the 'Mystery Man' Robert Blake is a manifestation of 'Fred's' illness. But then why does it seem that the 'Mystery Man' is trying to help 'Fred'? Perhaps 'Fred' has created the 'Mystery Man' in the hopes that this being will solve the mystery for him to egg him on until he saves himself. And the mob boss 'Mr Eddy' Robert Loggia is the real villain cold calculating abusive and spontaneously violent just like a virus. And 'ReneeAlice' is just one of the virus' cohorts reproduced from the DNA of the virus to spread the illness and incapacitate the victim.Or perhaps the most likely explanation It is a Lynchian fantasy designed to screw the mainstream audience and entertain open moviegoers.This makes the most sense. People will always want to explain this film to dig up it's secrets. Maybe the secrets will never be uncovered. Maybe there are no secrets and it is just a Lynch film calculated to please his fans. Any way you see it it will never be solved. I wish you good luck if you try to solve the film in its entirety... But you will certainly have fun doing it.".

I don't agree Lynch doesn't work like that  no matter how bizarre and reticulated there's a story there all right but you have to dig for it.'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things how he shows us the elements the language he uses and what he leaves out for us to discover. So then  SPOILERS if I'm rightAs with MD there's a big clue in the first few seconds Fred is shown in closeup looking thoroughly wrecked smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound and light sweeps across his face and the room. The sound is one you'll become familiar with later in the jailhouse. Fred looks up warily.Major premise I believe this scene shows Fred in the last moments of his life having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may in fact be the only 'real' scene in the film with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.As the door to his cell opens Fred rejects the awfulness of reality and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection which  as he himself says  is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds  listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones'  and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.At the party scene several events take place his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy  because he's seen through Fred's eyes  loungelizard Andy are effectively confirmed for him. And he meets the 'Mystery Man' a devilfigure who tells Fred You invited me into your home. It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted. I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else a 'devil who made him do it'  don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity or his jealousy. Or all of the above  all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.As the flashback continues we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over  they're a blur to Fred  and he winds up on Death Row.Facing execution and unable to tolerate his real state Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person  an innocent young enjoying a simple life good at his simple job with groovy understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasymadereal the dialogue is ludicrous the events comicbook. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.Although safe in this new fantastical environment FredPeter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger initially via his unlikely relationship with the  again comicbook  gangster boss Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a onedimensional violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.Even so Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the greasemonkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee the purehearted damsel in distress that is Alice.Except that once again Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films and one of the candidates is I think the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a FredPeter fantasy so we continue with the point about her ruthlessness made.What else? The storyline continues as might be expected with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight during which the devilfigure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat EddyDick Laurent as we have discovered and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.And then Fred begins another metamorphosis which we never see completed and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape or his death in the Chair? I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack put electrodes on his nuts and extract the linebyline details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry. And marvel.".

David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first film directed by David Lynch I've seen not counting The Elephant Man which is another great film but is an outsider in his career since it is not surreal. This film is however making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching What exactly is this film about?. As soon as the credits were over I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you when you see the very end exclaim Ah! Now I get it!. This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream or more appropriately a nightmare. The film is great it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating however. This was an excellent example of masterful filmmaking. Lynch's direction is eminent evidenced by the fact that I kept watching despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any charactersomething we are much too used to from mainstream movies. The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all a wonderfully welldone film but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes but I enjoyed how wellmade it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 1010".

You actually feel the urge to search for solutions you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do sountil you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore my advice would be Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many theories' just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness violence and erotica you get to see. It's amazing what David Lynch pulls off here! He serves an absurd and impossible structure that involves an inexplicable metamorphosis of the protagonist and he actually gets away with it!! Meanwhile he introduces a bunch of bizarre  but extremely fascinating  characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in topcondition in other wordsyou almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience.  The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score Angelo Badalamenti a blasting soundtrack Rammstein! and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquetteeither blond or brunette looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. Lost Highway comes with my highest possible recommendation yet I still prefer the David Lynch of the lat 70's and 80's. Can't really give a reasonable explanation for this Films like Blue Velvet and Eraserhead had something extra.".

Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive Memento The Man Who Wasn't There etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan but this movie rocked big time.     One of the most eery parts of the film is when Bill Pullman is making love to his wife Patricia Arquette and her face turns into the mystery man Robert Blake. A very freaky looking individual indeed. In my eyes he represents the devil. But that's my take on it.     Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert. The lighting music camera angles emotions and everything is just one of the best pieces of cinemtography I've ever seen in my life.      My recommendation is this If you liked Mulholland Drive Memento Pulp Fiction Fargo The Man Who Wasn't There Blue Velvet then this movie is your cup of tea. If not don't waste your time cause you'll hate it more than likely. 3 12 's out of 4 's.".

	schema:reviewBody "The thing that's great about Lost Highway is there is no absolute solution to the events in the film everything about the film is open to interpretation and after you watch it you either need to thing and talk about it for a couple of hours or watch it again. In Mulholland Drive people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway.Although it is described as a modern filmnoir it's more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The use of music to increase the suspense of the film is used a lot here and in many Hitchcock films such as Psycho. Even if you cant work out what it is about it is still a very tense thriller.Final Score  1010".

But without knowing it he's caught in an infinite timetravelling paradox conundrum. Confused? It gets even more complex.Someone is leaving sinister video tapes on their doorstep. At first it only shows the exterior of their house. But the subsequent tapes reveal a little more and more.At a party hosted by one of his wife's sleazy 'friends' a mystery man appears out of the crowd and tries to convince Fred that they've met before. Not quite aware of the true nature of the nightmare he's falling into Fred dismisses this man as crazy and promptly leaves the awful party. At home Fred disappears into the shadows of the labyrinthine hallway and isn't seen again til next morning.The last videotape reveals Fred brutally murdering and dismembering Renee. Only he cannot remember doing it. Caught by the cops and sent to prison awaiting the chair Fred begins to suffer agonising headaches. Then one night in solitary confinement he goes through a psychogenetic fugue and transforms into a completely different person.Next morning the guards and warden are freaked to discover Pete Dayton Balthazar Getty a 24year old mechanic in Fred Madison's cell. With no choice but to let him go Pete goes back to his parents house while closely tailed by the cops. Something has happened to Pete a few days earlier and his parents are keeping their mouths shut. They can barely comprehend it themselves and it appears that Pete is involved in the same nightmare plot as Fred Madison was.A powerful gangster named Dick LaurentMr. Eddy Robert Loggiahas a fondness for Pete and his ability to fix any car. But when he swings by the garage with his new floozy Alice Wakefield Patricia Arquette again he falls instantly in love with the woman despite having 'femme fatal' practically tattooed in bold on her forehead.Pete and Alice begin a relationship of nothing but aggressive shagging. And slowly but surely a world of mystery unlike anything you've ever seen is so vividly realised that you are practically pulled right into the film itself. The atmosphere is so thick that it'll flood over into your living room.David Lynch's direction is honed to perfection. The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. Lynch is a master of space and sound and the world of Lost Highway is at once beautiful and downright evil. He uses sly editing tricks to keep you paying the utmost attention and even if you don't take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still takes dozens of viewings to even begin solving it.The ingenuity of Lost Highway is that it can be interpreted in so many ways but there is always one piece of the puzzle that Lynch has deliberately warped or hammered out of shape so that it doesn't fit and negates any theory you may have. You could spend hours and I have painstakingly trying to make sense of it all and you can some close to the answer but be so far from the truth. Be it a dream or reality a trip down the Lost Highway is one you seriously need to take. Though you might not come back.".

I don't think I can wrap up the plot that space.I'm a recent inductee into the strange and twisted world of David Lynch. It all started when I caught a rerun of Twin Peaks on a lowbudget digital satellite channel.  Since then I've been hooked and have had fun with cult films and filmmakers since.Lost Highway is as descried by Lynch a new twist on filmnoir.  And only Lynch could put a twist like this on a classic genre.  People keep wanting to draw comparisons to other films saying Well it's not Blue Velvet or It's not Mulholland Dr...they're right.  It's Lost Highway a unique and twisted foray down a dark highway that may or may not be entirely metaphorical...or metaphysical.One of the things that I've noticed about David Lynchand what probably inspires much of the hatred nonLynch fans have towards his workis that he doesn't explain everything.  He lays it out says Here's my story.  What do YOU make of it?  It's an incredible artistic attitude much like viewing a Dali painting as opposed to a Da Vinci and not for everyone's tastes.Lost Highway is open to many interpretations as are most of Lynch's works. Are we in our world and being invaded by some outside force?  Are we in a world we don't know we're in?  Are we in Hell?  What would you do if this happened to you?  Maybe we are all someone else really.This film is at the same time allegorical philosophical incomprehensible and satirical.  It warps understood movie conventions and is always pulling the unexpected.All that praise aside it is NOT the best of Lynch's work.  One would have to be a fan to enjoy this and should establish that fanhood with his better works like Mulholland Drive Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks.If one has a set standard of how movies should be an ABC pattern stay away.  But if it's originality unanswered questions and a break from standard Hollywood convention go full ahead.In my humble opinion it's better than Wild at Heart and Dune but not most of Lynch's rest.  It is definitely an experience but not one everybody will enjoy.".

His interest is simply described duals.All his films work with some exploration of this idea. What makes him interesting is that he doesn't work the usual way with a reality and then a surreal overlay. Both elements in his experiments are what we coarsely call surreal. The game in traveling with him is an investment in the idea that there is no anchor to reality that all references are among imaginations sometimes twisted. Mulholland was a little too conventional for me because you could actually explain things and one of the realities was sorta real if you ignored a few things.My favorite Lynch is Velvet which imposes the two warring realities on film genres. The most fun is the seemingly straight Straight story which is perhaps the most bizarre encounters of dual strangeness because it seems so ordinary. Dualing roots that keep getting mowed.But if you are into Lynch this is an extraordinary pleasure this one. Its the most obvious in plan the least hidden in the swirl of two worlds. Neither world is anchored in reality and each hallucinates the other. Probably the only anchor with reality is the most disturbing character in appearance The Robert Blake guy.But even these two surrealities are nested in cinematic realities. One is the gangster movie elevated to cosmic status by the French new wave. The other is visual jazz and the accompanying dream linkages that have been similarly blazed starting with Dennis Hopper so far as American films.What you are open to determines what you can get I suppose. What Lynch provides is a sort of postpost modern notion of film as sometimes centered in itself with its own cosmologies and lives that always refer to other film notions and never to real ones. There is no fold of us as viewer no acknowledgment of our world at all except for the mysterious videos. Celestial madness.I prepared for this by watching four bad Holmes movies in a row. How we detect and discover is what this is about and is so superior to what we normally encounter you should watch it.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lost Highway is a great many things but often seems to be reduced to a loveit or hurtsmyheadfromtheconfusion soI'lljustdismissit kind of movie. Some critics have written it off as selfindulgent swill saying that only people who could hope to appreciate it would be Lynch himself and his plethora of wideeyed adoring fans etc etc. I myself have never actually been a huge fan of Lynch perhaps because I thought his stories didn't take themselves seriously enough were just too darn quirky who knows. Still I've always admired his talent for creating beautiful disturbing imagery and Lost Highway has to be my favorite film of his and possibly one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing I've ever seen!

	onyx:emotionText "Lost Highway is a great many things but often seems to be reduced to a loveit or hurtsmyheadfromtheconfusion soI'lljustdismissit kind of movie. Some critics have written it off as selfindulgent swill saying that only people who could hope to appreciate it would be Lynch himself and his plethora of wideeyed adoring fans etc etc. I myself have never actually been a huge fan of Lynch perhaps because I thought his stories didn't take themselves seriously enough were just too darn quirky who knows. Still I've always admired his talent for creating beautiful disturbing imagery and Lost Highway has to be my favorite film of his and possibly one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing I've ever seen!

This film is a Lynch film it is therefor a mysterycrime with a very strong emphasis on the mystery...and the crime. But in both cases an extreme version. So extreme in fact is the mystery that it never actually unravels its coherent meaning for simply there is none. This sounds all very seductive to the pseudointellectual but for others this comes across as clearly lacking a coherence even within the incoherence an order in the chaos attempted. This comes across as way way too many sex scenes unnecessary violence to cover up strong plot work easily too much length and ultimately an artist abusing his status in creating lazy and complacent pudding it's sweet it looks good but it's amorphic. Shape cannot entirely replace content and if the content is to be this sort of fantastic network of vistas and concepts then it should at least provide a certain understanding to its public some light along the dark alley. Lost Highway is interesting visually pretty enjoyable to watch but it really doesn't amount to anything of any valuable quality when it comes to an actual resolution of the plot and never provides the fullness in meaning the satisfaction of understanding the whole. This film may have a compelling abstract narrative to start with but it becomes so very selfindulgent towards about the last third and it just goes on and on and on... Sincerely not a great film. Not as well made as 'Blue Velvet' to give an example made a decade earlier. 510.".

Even so I know that it is a filmexperience that very much feels unlike any other with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike visually beautiful because the images are impactful and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like walltowall music.So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete an attractive young lad with halfbiker halfBeaver suburban parents thanks Donald Lyons who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him preferably with a gun up somebody's butt and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.Skip to This Magic Moment as Pete hooks up with Alice his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo' from the dame's blonde doppelgnger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he gets more pussy than a toilet seat but those small similarities add up.As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasyself eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this other guy better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.This loss of control is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings cruise me blonde  cruise me babe sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know I'm deranged. As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride.Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex You'll never have me he makes a banally simple realization a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories the past as he remembers it not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul and unless maybe her name is Beyonc woman isn't a thing that can be owned not even if you like it and you put a ring on it.As the fantasybubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his fcking name is. But not all hope is lost quite yet Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinistervoiced unknown who tells him that Dick Laurent is dead before the whole thing ever even started a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.".

Fred is suspicious of the relationship of Renee with her friend Andy Michael Massee. One morning Renee finds a videotape on the doorstep of their house and when they watched the footage they find that someone has broken in to film inside their house.

He is found guilty of murder of first degree and sentenced to the electric chair.

Pete fixes the car of the powerful and dangerous gangster Mr. Eddy Robert Loggia and when he meets his mistress Alice Wakefield Patricia Arquette they have a love affair and the woman convinces him to escape with her from Mr. Eddy and travel to some other place. Lost Highway is one of the most intriguing bizarre and challenging cultmovies that is to be loved or hated but never fully understood. I believe that even David Lynch that directed and wrote Lost Highway does not have answers for all the mysteries of the plot. The best and most provocative scene is when the mysterious man tells Fred that he is at his house and gives a cellular to Fred to call him. The film is shot following the style of filmnoir and Patricia Arquette is the femme fatale. The beauty of the halfnaked Patricia Arquette is astonishing and her striptease is very erotic. The soundtrack with music of David Bowie Angelo Badalamenti Rammstein Lou Reed and Tom Jobim with Insensatez is spectacular. Last time I had watched this movie was on 23 December 1999. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Estrada Perdida The Lost Highway".

	schema:headline " Why does everyone think Fred did it? SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film murdered and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police case closed. As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician he is playing in a small club. The house he and his wife share is a multimillion dollar house there is no way Fred could afford that kind of house on what he makes. So he marries a woman who has a multimillion dollar house and doesn't know what she does for a living?heck it might even be Eddys house that would explain the horrible vibe in the house No way. The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife Andy and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy million dollar houses don't grow on trees. That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred 'You invited me into your house it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore and associated with wholly evil men. This analysis is also backed up by the fact that Fred sees the mystery mansatanic character briefly imposed on his wife's face.

Which is shown in the film at the party we see the instant where it becomes known to the sleazy guy that Fred had something to do with the death of Laurent. The sleazy guy is the one responsible for the videotapes that get the police involved. If hes not why have the long setup with the series of videotapes? He is the one who kills Freds wife to set Fred up. They probably even force Fred to play in the gore while they tape it as an added punishment.The film is incredible it really shows the type of person that lives a life like Fred. Fred is utterly human and I think anyone who tries to write him off as 'mentally ill' would have trouble doing so. After watching the film one must admit there's a little bit of Fred in all of us.some more than others ".

	onyx:emotionText "Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film murdered and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police case closed. As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician he is playing in a small club. The house he and his wife share is a multimillion dollar house there is no way Fred could afford that kind of house on what he makes. So he marries a woman who has a multimillion dollar house and doesn't know what she does for a living?heck it might even be Eddys house that would explain the horrible vibe in the house No way. The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife Andy and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy million dollar houses don't grow on trees. That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred 'You invited me into your house it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore and associated with wholly evil men. This analysis is also backed up by the fact that Fred sees the mystery mansatanic character briefly imposed on his wife's face. This sends a clear message and clearly explains how he got 'into the house' it was through Fred's wife and her evil conduct.Fred lived with his wife day in and day out with some childish notion he could 'save' her from her degraded life.which is represented by the way the naieve Pete character treats her When it was in fact her choice to live it and in fact Fred benefited greatly from that life materially.

The elements of film noir are these a man who is innocent of all wrong finds himself in an inescapable situation in which he is pointed out as a culpritcriminal. He is helpless not only in wrenching free of the circumstances usually he is set up by someone but is quite in the dark as to how he arrived in the center of the mess in the first place. Another element is that the man is usually used by a woman.All of these fit in with Lost Highway. The Bill Pullman character definitely finds himself in bizarre relationship with his wife played by Patricia Arquette receives strange videos of someone entering his house and then showing him murdering his wife. His character is completely innocent from the audience's point of view. In some supernatural nonlinear way that must involve some kind of time warp he is fingered as his wife's assassin and jailed for it. And you can't help think that his wife is somehow in on it.When the transformation into the Balthazar Getty character happens it is Balthazar's turn to meet another woman played not by accident by Patricia Arquettewho then seduces him and uses him to escape her relationship with her mobster boyfriend. The Getty character is unaware that he is being used although comes to some realization that she's not as innocent as she seems.In the end when the Getty character transforms back into the Pullman character you realize a little at least why the two are connected. They perhaps are connected because they represent the fact that finding oneself helpless framed and convicted at least on one level is a universal phenomenon not just one meant to tell a story.When Pullman running from the cops stops by his own house to warn himself via intercom of his futurethat's really a nice touch and makes your hair stand on end. The self trying eternally to reach back and save itself or something like that.And then when he's driving down the Lost Highway it's really spooky because you don't know whether it is a highway to redemption or a useless attempt to escape the inescapable.It's such a great movie and a million things could be said about it on so many different levels. Lynch's creepiness and his use of the otherworldly elements really make the movie. To me Lynch is the best American director alive. Jarmusch Scorsese et al are fine but they've yet to produce the kind of complexity of form and transcendence of vision that Lynch has achieved.".

This director is great in creating the atmosphere. I felt I was drawn into it. I also like the way characters are created. The movie shows  both the strengths and the weaknesses of the leading characters. Sometimes I think they are so cruel and brutal but then the movie shows that they are very weak inside. Sometimes I think they are aggressive later I saw that they are also victimized. I like Tanya very much not because she is very sexy and elegant but because I felt connected with this character. I admire and have a great respect for this character. Though I don't approve of everything she did I really sympathize her.Moreover I felt chilled and thrilled seeing this movie because I realized that characters in this movie are capable of doing many things beyond my imagination. There are many many scenes that I like in this movie. These scenes impressed me a lot and I don't know exactly why they can affect me this strongly. These scenes include the scene when Tanya's lover talks to a woman behind a door the scene when Tanya sits in a car and sees a woman standing on one side of the street the scene when Tanya runs away from those two guys and descends the staircase and also the two shocking scenes. This movie is never boring or dull for me. It affected my feelings and my senses in a strange way. I have to give this movie 10 out of 10.".

At times the movie is slow but in all I found the movie compelling.There are very few good and interesting films being made in Holland these days therefore it's really admirable to see a project like this being made. I especially like it because the story and the characters are so different from anything else. People that criticise this movie are lazy and don't understand films can entertain on different levels. I recently saw the director on TV and it was amazing to see that she is a vibrant beautiful young girl with balls and international allure. She will probably blossom more abroad than in Holland where they can't seem to handle a woman being both talented and beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "In reading through these comments I've seen tons of people complain about how this movie is thoughtless the characters are onedimensional stereotypes blah blah blah.  People that was exactly the point...to challenge White and Black Americans' perspectives on those very stereotypes! Before you pick a film apart you have to ask yourself what audience it was directed at.  Would you criticize a Disney film for being too childish if it was supposed to be directed at children?  Of course not.  Therefore ask yourself what audience White Man's Burden was targeted at.  Because of where I grew up that answer was obvious to me before I even saw the movie.I'm a White man who grew up in Monterey California.  Central Monterey is middletoupper class and is dominantly White and Asian.  The southside communities of Pacific Grove Carmel and Pebble Beach are very upper class and dominantly White.  In the north we have Seaside which is the lowerincome highcrime area and is dominantly Black and Hispanic.  This seems to be pretty typical of the raceclass division that plagues America. Note that Monterey is not exactly a major metropolitan area where these neighborhoods are far away from each other.  The entire area has a population of maybe 120000 and stretches only about 12 miles 19 km from north to south.By growing up between the downtown area and Seaside it's been easy for me to see the racial problems in this country from many angles.  I can tell you from experience that the most hotheaded controversial and hateful examples of racial bigotry and stereotyping in the USA are in the way so many Whites and Blacks view each other.I have met countless Blacks who think that being born White automatically makes you greedy naturally oppressive of the poor and have a geneticallyinbred desire to dump on every other race in the world.  These Blacks typically think that everyone with white skin owes them something because of the crimes of our ancestors slavery lynching etc. whether it be walking around giving an apology to every Black we see expecting a free ride from the government just because they're born with black skin or just having us generally take whatever they want to dish out and accepting that we deserve it because we were born into an evil race.On the other side of this coin are the Whites who think that being born Black makes you stupid lazy and a naturalborn criminal.  These Whites can cite the fact that there is a high amount of violent crime committed by Blacks despite making up only 12 of the US population not thinking about the fact that this is a result of poverty not skin color or the high amount of hard drug use in Black society again depression due to poverty not skin color.White Man's Burden was very obviously aimed at these two particular groups of people.  What they both have in common is the belief that certain behavior is naturally part of being born with a particular skin color.  By depicting an alternate history with the roles of Blacks and Whites reversed in America the film shows that lack of knowledge and a tendency towards crime is inspired by growing up in poverty not by being born with black skin.  It also portrayed selfishness greed and elitism to be qualities of those who grew up in luxury and wealth rather than being tied to white skin. The point of the film was not to go into painstaking detail about how the roles came to be reversed where the other races are or to explore the alternatereality society on every single level which would require a miniseries rather than a 90minute film.  The point was to shake up the narrowminded perspectives of two particularly bigoted groups of Americans to kick them in the butt and make them consider that skin color isn't a factor in who you are.  Whatever else you want to say about the movie's performances or characterizations it did its' job perfectly.".

However it was this very realization during the film which made me respect its message.  Because the roles are completely and totally reversed swapping black and white character for character the film is disturbing.  It's almost painful to watch.  Ask yourself while you're watching how you're reacting and how the reaction would be different if there were no race reversals.  Maybe that's because of the stereotypes we have in place and the roles we do play in the world  if it were just another story about a black man down on his luck we'd all yawn but because it's a white man and all of society is reversed we watch we wonder how it will play out and we're bothered by it. I analogize the film to Planet of the Apes in some ways because of its ability to make us step back and take a look at society in a different way entirely.

	onyx:emotionText "just because the movie reversed the roles that blacks and whites play in society did not make the movie any less clichd. it was the same tired story of a poor man trying to overcome all of the obstacles that life lays in front of him. if his normal life weren't hard enough something happens to make him even more desperate. just when he sees fit to do the right thing... i thought that John Q was a much better version of this theme. additionally why did john travolta have to speak in some sort of Ebonics? is it because people are poor and oppressed that they speak that way? there were so many things that did not make sense about the movie. i understand that the writer was trying to make a point of showing how it is for blacks in a white society. most dolls and action figures in U.S. society are white making it difficult for AfricanAmericans to find roles models for their children. so in the movie they were black instead of white. but why was every single policeman black instead of white except for one white female cop at the very end? why was every single personality on the TV shows black? pardon the pun but it was so black and white that it offended my intelligence. i could have figured out the point had it been done in more realistic terms.";

It seemed to very subtly explain what I have always believed racism has nothing to do with colour it has to do with wealth. I never realized that John Travolta was such a superb actor until I watched this film. I saw it about 7 years ago and I tell everyone about it when talking about cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "European imperialists absolutely hate looking at themselves in the mirror. This movie forces them to do so in a unique way which causes all the metaanalytical comments herein and all the vituperative reviews. Granted Martin Luther King Jr.'s methods were not what my family and I prefer as we'd never allow people to hurtmanipulate us without fighting back. But MLK encouraged people to let the white imperialists act like animals towards them then force them to watch themselves act like violent savages towards peaceful people on TV news broadcasts later in the day. It worked for the intended purposes Civil Rights Act but that law is still largely ceremonial.The imperialists in White Man's Burden are perfectly aloof disconnected and violent police just like the white Americans and government they are meant to portray. John Travolta and his family fill the mediareinforced stereotypical role of ignorant poor people that must beg the imperialists for jobs survive police savagery and live in a world where you are set up to fail and struggle just to survive. The most powerful scene IMO is when Don Travolta's kid is flipping through TV channels and he sees nothing but black people on every channel. The only white person who appeared while Don was channel surfacing was on a news station a criminal wanted in connection with some type of crime. Don also preferred to buy a black toy action figure vs. a white one the same selfhatred that is conditioned in reallife black people via media and public education.Its hard for white people to watch this movie objectively because they see their hero police as what they really are gestapo thugs with badges that harassassault people for no reason at all and kill people simply because they like it. They are also forced to see the powerful conditioning imperial governments and societies force onto the oppressed class. Harry Belafonte was perfect for this role because he has lived a privileged existence for his entire life but at the same time is a true activist who fights for the oppressed.This movie should be required viewing in all U.S. public junior highs. Hats off. Great film.".

It became the focal point of the movie and confused many of its viewers. Other than that the movie was ok. I give it a 8 on a scale from 1 to 10 only because I have never seen such a bold attempt to deal with race roles as this one. Therefore I enjoyed the movie.".

The idea is this allows us to tackle our prejudices and preconceived notions about society. Does it work? No it's too busy being laughable or boring.From the opening I felt chills. Was this chocolate factory scene brown being poured on top of white some horribly clumsy use of imagery? I feared so. The film looked set to be heavyhanded and it was. The movie's flaw is that it overdoes it's premise  nearly all the white people are poor and rundown while all the black people come across as elitist snobs. The underlying message of course being that in our reality the situation is reversed and this gives a horribly simplistic and downright irritating attitude towards race. It's completely simplistic and infuriating  not because you're angered that it's right but because it's done so poorly and with a preachiness that grates.It might all be OK if there was a story to support it. There isn't. Reeking of TV movieoftheweek John Travolta is playing a desperate factoryworker who kidnaps his exboss in a bid to get the money he lost from being fired unfairly. Yawn. There's no suspense and no tension in their scenes. There's the boring trite situation where the boss played by Harry Belafonte starts to understand Travolta's cause. Far too obvious in coming. There's even the hilariously poor moment when Belafonte's son takes home a white girl to a look of distaste from his mother  bang that messagehammer on our heads Mr Nakano the script writer. I'm reminded of a moment from Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood when the character is similarly preachy and the postman turns to the screen and says Message! pointing out how morale messages are weakly delivered. In fact the only decent bit is about two minutes from the end and even that's ruined by the incredibly obvious followup final minute. Yawn.Travolta does nothing for this picture. This film was released after his sudden reemerge in Pulp Fiction but I imagine he made it while still wandering around the Turkey Farm. His performance is as forgettable as is usual with him and Belafonte is just OK.Nothing can make me recommend this piece. If you want a movie about race issues why not watch the infinitely superior American History X. This movie has a dreadful plot weak acting and destroys a promising premise by being both heavyhanded and insultingly simplistic. Avoid. 210.".

I laughed at that one part. But the rest was just so depressing and that story line apart from the racial switch has been done to death. Take Boys in the Hood and switch the white and black people around. There was no real point other than the fact that racism exists in our world and that it's a darned shame people get discriminated against. Really? Wow! Who knew? So if you want to be miserable and your favorite Blues radio station has been taken over by the Dance Mix Syndicate go rent White Man's Burden. Otherwise don't.".

Initially the widespread symbolism is interesting and inventive yet becomes overbearing relatively quickly and to me it seemed that the director underestimated his audience's perception and continually rammed home his point with the subtlety of Dolph Lundgren.The film ultimately left me frustrated because I thought the idea was a good one but the story simply wasn't multifaceted enough to be engaging. Aside from the characters played by Travolta and Belafonte most of the supporting cast was very underwritten particularly the families of both men. However the performances were very good and I thought Belafonte conveyed the defeatism and inherent arrogance of his role particularly well.Overall though I thought this was pseudoart it masqueraded as a deep and meaningful examination of the social relevance of race but ended up as a very simplistic story disguised by delusions of self worth.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This could be the film that is needed to refer to right now as whites and blacks in this culture finally begin to circle each other trying to decide how best to get down and dirty with that damn bugaboo of race and it's shadow players of class justice and power.John Travolta plays Louis Pinnock a factory worker for See's Candies with a history of exemplary company loyalty working his way towards a promotion. He's been with the company many years dutifully doing his job looking forward to the day any day now that he'll finally get his muchdeserved promotion to foreman. He has a wife a little boy a small house in the part of the city that doesn't have any sidewalks and some sort of problem with pride because his wife Kelly Lynch wants to work but Louis gives her the evil eye every time she brings it up. One day after work just at quitting time Louis's boss asks Louis and his coworker if one of them could take a small package across town to drop off to Thaddeus Thomas Harry Belafonte the owner of the company who has an estate. Louis steps forward and grabs the package immediately even though he'll be delivering it on his own time and happily takes his beatup old white truck across town to deliver the package. When he gets to the estate of Mr. Thomas he ends up approaching it from the back way without realizing it walks up to the house looks up and inadvertently sees Mr. Thomas's wife nude through an upstairs window. Mr. Thomas who is watching him through the window as he stands right next to his unclothed wife says to Louis' boss on the phone Send another delivery boy next time. Not another peeping tom. These few words set off a chain reaction that ricochets for the rest of the movie serpentining it's way through the issue of color by presenting a mirror image for society to see Louis and his family in fact ALL whites in this picture live in a black world. When Louis's little boy flips the channels on the remote control EVERY television station has nothing but black faces. Black game shows. Black soap operas. Black news broadcasts with violators referred to as Caucasian. Black commercials. The family of Mr. Thomas all sit around fat and happy at their gigantic dinner table talking about how inferior the white race is. Scary? Wait until you see the look of incredulous horror of Thaddeus' face when he sees one white man gun down another.What screenwriter and first time director Desmond Nakano Last Exit To Brooklyn American Me has created is a horror movie for white folk and this SHOULD scare the white folk who have never thought twice about their hegemony in society and the responsibility it brings. Since he has directly inverted the equation the question of skin color is shown to be completely moot as the real underlying issues of class and power are revealed to be the causes they really are not the effects. This is a film about a situation that gets out of hand due to a simple misunderstanding that is dealt with so offhandedly that the ensuing consequences were never even contemplated by the perpetrator and they come back not only to haunt him but to place him on the threshold of death's door. I don't want to reveal any more of the plot for a reason The script is so good that when lawabiding Louis finds himself in the worst of all desperate situations scene follows scene so haphazardly as a reflection of his thought processes because he has completely freaked out. He has no idea what he is going to do next and the tension of the film is wound so tightly because the film is through Louis's eyes and there is nothing more dangerous than a criminal who has not thought out his own motivation. John Travolta's performance is exceptional because he doesn't have any of his standard suave moves or cool facade to lean back on ala Pulp Fiction or Get Shorty. He's a bluecollar worker who has become accustomed to his lower rung in society yet has accepted his responsibilities with pride and diligence. He has been a considerate patient lawabiding citizen his whole life and has worked hard for his position and his family no matter how slightly above the poverty line he may be swimming and when he realizes that all he's worked so hard for means nothing to the heartless authority figures that begin to circle around him like vultures who insist on remaining oblivious to his circumstance he begins to behave like a cornered rat.When the film is over and the cards have fallen where they have what is left is a tragedy that like all tragedies could have been so easily avoided if only two minutes of someone's time could have been negotiated. Take someone you know to this film. Take that person who you know as an acquaintance whom you've never wanted to have as a friend just because they don't understand it's not about the color of someone's skin it's about character. Talk to them extensively about the issues in this film on your way home. Make sure they get it.".

	schema:reviewBody "White Man's Burden is a compelling lowkey film that probably won't be remembered because of its lack of melodrama.  It's a brutally realistic look at a world where the roles are reversed  the whites are workingclass people living in rough neighborhoods and the blacks are upperclass people living in mansions.  There's a lot of movies that deal with racism but this movie deals with reverse racism.  Believe it or not there is a good deal of whites who are on welfare and work in factories and have other manual jobs. And believe it or not there is a good deal of blacks who are very wealthy and work in big business.  This movie plays against all the stereotypes. And that's what I found fascinating.  None of that cheesy exploitative White people badBlack people good crap.  Though Harry Belafonte's character is a closeminded racist in the beginning he develops a healthy friendship with John Travolta as the film goes on and eventually he changes his views.  Just like some white people should realize that not all black people are lowclass idiots some blacks should realize that not all whites are highclass snobs.  There is no such thing as a superior race.Travolta and Belanfonte give splendid performances.  This is a fine example of Travolta's versatility as an actor.  He doesn't just play the smoothtalking chainsmoking villain.  This is obviously a lowbudget film so I imagine Travolta didn't get paid much to do this movie.  Kelly Lynch is compelling as his wife and there's a very disturbing scene in which she's forced by two cops to change clothes in front of one of them.WMB has a good message but doesn't deliver it in a melodramatic inyourface fashion.  It's a brutal realistic touching character study that I think most people should check out.  It's one of those overlooked films that really deserved more attention.My score  7 out of 10".

I would have liked better production values on a ground breaking movie like this.I was confused by John Travolta's performance. I wondered if he was trying to sound street or black. He came across however as not too bright. Whatever he was attempting to do with the accent and mannerisms it seemed so unnatural that it was somewhat distracting and took some getting used to. Among the elite class there was only one white person and that was a girlfriend of Harry Belafonte's character's son. The seemed odd and I suppose that was the point. There also a few whites in service positions like the maid bank teller officer assisting in eviction of John Travolta's character and family. I understood the message that was being conveyed. I am glad that I had the opportunity to see it for myself. And I still would recommend the movie. Because in spite of this movie's flaws it got the message across I think.Before this movie I would not have thought about what it would be like if racially the tables were turned. Interestingly the message was that if indeed the black people were the elite group in charge things would not be any better. The ruling class ultimately gets corrupted by the absoluteness of their position  I suppose that is the message that the filmmakers were conveying.I wish this movie could be remade.".

Because in spite of this movie's flaws it got the message across I think.Before this movie I would not have thought about what it would be like if racially the tables were turned. Interestingly the message was that if indeed the black people were the elite group in charge things would not be any better. The ruling class ultimately gets corrupted by the absoluteness of their position  I suppose that is the message that the filmmakers were conveying.I wish this movie could be remade.";

The premise is completely straightforward black people's lives are played by whites white people's lives are played by blacks. It is otherwise an entirely ordinary kind of drama A hard working honest blue collar family man John Travolta is struggling to support his wife and two children. He happens to inadvertently offend a very wealthy man Harry Belafonte with the power to have him instantly dismissed. What follows is a believable catastrophe that might befall a black family. The whites played by blacks talk as whites tend to do. The blacks played by whites behave and are treated as blacks tend to be.What makes the movie stand out is that a white audience could easily watch  not callously but simply as a believable example of the way a black family might get treated. However the fact that the family is played by whites gives the white viewer the instinctive sense that they are being exceptionally roughly treated  that there is something not at all nice going on.If as surely is the case a white audience feels instinctive revulsion at the harsh treatment of the white family then only one thing follows. That is the uncomfortable realisation that there are dual standards when it comes to race. White guilt does not come into it. It is a very rare movie indeed which puts an audience in that very uncomfortable position. Each white audience member is thus forced to come to terms with their feeling of discomfort either by acceptance  or some kind of more or less elaborate strategy of denial.It is on the surface a completely uncomplicated and even obvious film as is its message. Yet the strange misunderstandings seen in the reviews attest to the unpalatability of its message. Even the UK's leading liberal newspaper review gave it the following oddly flat and neutral review which makes no mention of the movie's entire reason for being Drama set in an alternative America where black people are members of an elite society and their white counterparts inhabit innercity ghettos. John Travolta stars as a lowly factory worker who is mistaken for a peeping Tom and beaten by cops leading him to kidnap a prominent black businessman and demand justice. It does not make saints of an entire race  indeed Travolta's struggle to bring up his family is made more difficult by the drugdealing whites playing blacks lowlifes who are his neighbours. Just that the central character is a good man who only comes to public attention when for the first time in his blameless life he is driven off the rails. Although set in the USA it could have been set in the UK but with a less extreme storyline. The British newspaper review hints that it would also produce discomfort  and denial  there also.".

It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an antihero. While that may be true to an extent read more into it and you can see a film that tries to show us that there is something terribly wrong with how we live. I wasn't alive in the 50's in fact I was born in the 70's. So I can't honestly tell you if life was easier back then. But what I can tell you is that times were a bit more simple then. For the most part you had one income in the household. You had T.V and radio as your entertainment and kids went outside to play. Now you must have both parents working so you can have that double income. Kids are obsessed with the internet and videogames and so on. What does all of this have to with the film? Everything!Falling Down is about the decay in one man's life and how it affects not only him but those around him. There is one very powerful scene in the film that can sum up everything.There is a key moment in Falling Down that is sad in it's reality but true in it's opinion. Douglas is in a surplus store and the guy running it is a Nazi sympathizer. When Douglass doesn't share his opinions they get into a confrontation. The guy snaps and tells Douglas to spread against the wall. He obliges and then the Nazi guy wants to handcuff him. He tells Douglas to give him his hand he does. Then he tells Douglas to give him his other hand. Douglas is supporting himself on the wall in a 30 degree angle and if he gives the guy his other hand  he'll fall down.  Which is precisely what he tells the Nazi guy. This is a microcosm of the film and a microcosm of what may be wrong with not only society but people in general. There is a theory in wrestling that your arms and legs are like a table if you take out any two of the legs or arms your opponent falls down and is vulnerable. Same thing with a human being. Take away so many of his limbs  job wife dignity credit rating kids etc.  and it may be only a matter of time before that person does snap. This movie shows us what happens to one individual that does snap. He wasn't all that bad to begin with but as time went on and he was  lied  to he can't handle it and finally one day he has had enough. I think this film is more important than people realize and if you have only seen it once see it again. You may see something that you didn't see before. Hats off to Schumacher and Douglas who had the guts to make this film.".

	schema:headline " An affirmation of decadence";
	schema:reviewBody "Take the hottest day of the year a traffic gridlock cracked pavements dirty streets unwarranted hostility and a general feeling of being short changed. Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable' you are of no use and the result is Falling Down.The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.Full of clichs like the cop on his last day before retiring Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes rather than challenging them making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here a man in extremis without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street makes his way on anger and luck alone somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.Relying heavily on symbolism illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful the over all message of 'No Matter Never Mind' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced DFENS as he casually totes gang weapons complete with rubber bands on the grips in his formal shirt and tie does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants homeless people gangsters and Nazis.

	onyx:emotionText "Take the hottest day of the year a traffic gridlock cracked pavements dirty streets unwarranted hostility and a general feeling of being short changed. Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable' you are of no use and the result is Falling Down.The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.Full of clichs like the cop on his last day before retiring Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes rather than challenging them making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here a man in extremis without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street makes his way on anger and luck alone somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.Relying heavily on symbolism illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful the over all message of 'No Matter Never Mind' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced DFENS as he casually totes gang weapons complete with rubber bands on the grips in his formal shirt and tie does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants homeless people gangsters and Nazis. Robert Duval is equally brilliant as the desk jockey on his final day determined to stop anyone else from being hurt including the perp.There is of course a small amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown in for good measure however the dynamics of such a strong narrative make this completely forgivable and it's possible to overlook this as a flaw given the film's overall strengths.Praise surely has to go to Ebbe Roe Smith for writing one of the finest scripts ever to grace celluloid.

	schema:reviewBody "Falling Down is a film that intends to point out the many quirks and oddities of modern urban society.  It succeeds in doing so but one must look carefully.  Each situation Bill Foster Michael Douglas faces is one that most people can relate to.  However unlike most people he decides to fight the system and wage war on the everyday annoyances that we all face. Foster is a People's Champion.  To illustrate this most people who watch this film naturally pull for him and see him as being a hero mostly out of pure sympathy.  However at the end of the day Foster is still the bad guy for going against the societal grain.  Most viewers will find this upsetting or even unfair considering that he fought back against many criminals and unjust forces.  Where Falling Down fails at times is during the scenes where it attempts to do too many things at once.  The bits of humor throughout the film are mostly derived from overthetop scenes and at times Foster's actions seem cheesy and unrealistic.  The fact that the film is two stories in one Foster and Prendergast provides a good contrast because the viewer gets to see both sides of the story.  On one hand we see an ordinary family man going bezerk but in a way most of us can understand and on the other hand we see a cop who believes Foster is a complete psychopath.  Only the audience knows the truth.  The film could have done without some of the lame subplots such as Duvall's marriage even though those scenes illustrate his perception of being weak or whipped.  The film sets out to do a lot at once which is quite necessary to create a thorough storyline but at times doesn't come out right on film.One scene that I have always found moving and powerful is the scene where Bill Foster sees the man who is Not Economically Viable protesting outside of the bank that denied him a loan.  As everyone on the busy street goes about their business and ignores this man Foster and the viewer are focused directly on him.  Foster obviously sympathizes with this poor hardworking man who is also being stepped on by society.  As the man is escorted away in the police car he looks directly at Foster and says don't forget me.  In a gesture of sympathy and appreciation he nods to him.  The two characters share a connection.  It is especially important to notice the symbolism of this scene.  Both men are wearing the exact same outfits a white shortsleeved dress shirt black tie and black pants.  They are on the opposite sides of the street.  When they look at each other even though they are white and black it is as though they are looking into a mirror and seeing the same thing a victim of society.Overall a slightly sad story that tries to do a whole lot succeeds in most of it and provides lots of entertainment.  A good storyline and an excellent observation of modern society.".

Having been pushed past the brink of sanity Foster loses it and storms out of his car walking around town and trying desperately to see his little daughter for her birthday a daughter who is untouchable because of a court order against him by his estranged wife. Along the way Foster will run across character types we've all come across the 'war veteran' bum who is really just a lowlife looking to score some quick cash an irate Korean grocery store owner a homophobic neonazi army retail store owner a crusty elitist country club golf player super friendly fast food workers young Hispanic thugs and so forth. And each one will chip away at what remains of his patience and tolerance for stupidity fueling a rampage.Up against this antihero is Prendergast a veteran cop who has felt many of the same pains as Foster but who serves as sort of a foil to him. Foster has lost everything and while Prendergast has lost quite a bit his wife is a basketcase his little daughter died years ago under mysterious circumstances he still retains some optimism calmness and dignity. As Prendergast who is on his last day on the job begins to put together the pieces of the mysterious crime spree plaguing the city he seems to be the only one smart enough to figure out it's all the doing of one man! it pits him in an inevitable confrontation between him and Foster.Michael Douglas playing Foster  DFENS plays an incredibly complex character. On the one hand you know much of what he does is so wrong but at the same time there's immense satisfaction at seeing him lash out at those deserving of it. And while he tries to stay calm he finds himself constantly provoked by those who have 'wronged society.' In fact many of the things he does could so easily have been avoided if the 'victims' were not so positively despicable. You can't help but feel at the end of the day when Foster gets his due that he's in some small way made Los Angeles a better place despite the carnage he's unleashed.And this is perhaps what is so strange about the movie. There seems to be no clear message. Who was right? Who was wrong? It becomes a very blurry line over the approximately 2 hours of the movie's run. I've seen it now several times and I still can't give any definitive answer. Perhaps this is a strength that different people will view this movie in different ways. Some will see this as the story of a noble decent man who modern society has beaten down and crushed and who desperately tries to struggle against the tyranny and betrayal. Others will see Foster as a lunatic who needed to be put down. No one I think will find that Foster doesn't warrant some sympathy.Personally I think Foster got the wrong end of the stick. His wife's anger and fear of him seems somewhat unwarranted and though it is clear that Foster and not just society itself has brought many of his problems upon his own head he is tired and angry and rightfully resentful at the course his life has taken. He feels he has nothing to live for so he takes it out on anyone who crosses his path. I recommend this movie because the performances are allaround great it delivers a solid cast and as the portrayal of one man's journey down the path of madness few have done better.Grade A".

I think because of the way the movie was shot people look at it like a B movie but if you really think about it it's far from that. There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film. I give it 10 stars. If I could give it 11 I would. A movie that will be forever misunderstood.".

	onyx:emotionText "I declare this one of the most underrated movies ever made. What a great story. Just look at the situations in the movie. Did people not understand this movie? I think because of the way the movie was shot people look at it like a B movie but if you really think about it it's far from that. There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film. I give it 10 stars. If I could give it 11 I would. A movie that will be forever misunderstood.";

	schema:reviewBody "I think Joel Schumacher is a really terrible filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion he managed to rise above his desire for eyecandy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.Falling Down would have to be the best film out of Schumacher's mostly awful body of work. Its the one thing he's ever done where he actually forgets about battering an audience into submission with glorious light effects and pretty costumes and sets. He's produced a violent story to be sure. But a curiously humane one too. And Michael Douglas is its human centre.Douglas plays Bill Foster a defence worker of seven years who gets laid off. He spends the next month and a half trying to make sense of the tattered shreds of his life. He's a man with no job. No wife and daughter because they've cut him out of their lives. And most importantly he's a man without purpose.But on one particularly hot day in LA he finds a purpose. The opening scene is filled with glaringly aggressive closeups of Douglas' face. Sweating and twitching. All while he's sitting in his car in the middle of an agonisingly slow traffic jam. You know something is coming. Something is about to erupt. And that thing is Bill. In a splitsecond he snaps abandons his car and tells the baffled motorist behind him he's going home.Although Bill is indeed going home to his wife and daughter he makes a few stops along the way. Bill has become so disillusioned by society's flaws and shortcomings he feels a need to rectify it by lashing out at the mundane trappings of our everyday lives. With his crewcut white shirt and tie briefcase in one hand and automatic weapon in the other its Ordinary Joe meets GI Joe.Its hard to believe Falling Down came from the same director of mindless trash like Batman  Robin. This is an acutely observed portrait of the sorry state of our affairs. And Michael Douglas turns in a real showstopper of an acting performance. Its a style of acting brimming with raw honesty. He plays a man not at the mercy of madness but someone who's grown accustomed to it. This is the film Michael Douglas should have won an Oscar for.The film is bold enough to portray Bill as an object of sympathy even when he's committing shocking acts of violence. Bill is a middle aged man who felt he was in control all of his life and when everything that mattered to him fell to dust it left him a broken man. His new mission gives him something to focus on but I sense its not quite the liberating experience Bill envisioned it would be. Even when he tries to reassert control his inherent emptiness still plagues him. What a brave plaintively truthful performance!Falling Down has received a fair amount of criticism especially from racial minorities who have lambasted the film because Bill's targets appear to be Korean shopkeepers or Latino street gangs. It is easy to view it in that context. That Bill is nothing more than a walking megaphone venting his hatred towards foreigners. But that's too narrow a vision. Schumacher's direction is really more expansive then you realise.Yes he does trash the Korean's store because he overcharges for a can of Coke and Bill won't have enough change left over for the payphone. And yes he beats up Latino thugs. But these are just the bystanders along the way of Bill's inexorable journey. I don't think there's any intentional malice intended there.And Schumacher's direction is quite excellent. He stages selfcontained vignettes that are tiny microcosms of what exactly is wrong with this world. Like the scene at the fastfood restaurant. A classic example of the bureaucratic red tape that deliberately sets out to entangle people like poor Bill. Who hasn't felt like standing up for they're rights as a consumer? Bill can't have breakfast because he's a few minutes late. These are the type of absurdities Bill is campaigning against.Falling Down works like a steadily unfolding carpet. And as Bill walks through the city of LA he is wearing out the hollow material that its weaved from. There is a very natural flow to the film. Things fall into place quite beautifully. Such as when Bill makes the decision to carry a bag full of weapons instead of his normal briefcase. This is a man going through a steady metamorphosis from which there is no return.Some people have felt disappointed by the somewhat lowkey ending. But I felt it couldn't have ended any other way. Its an ending of weary resignation. No matter how much Bill has tried to add meaning to his rootless existence the truth is society may have to live with its flaws. No matter what Bill's efforts.One of the most daring films of the 90s and any film that attempts to address society's failings with such frank honesty deserves strong commendation indeed.".

	schema:headline " I had fallen for Falling Down. It's one of my favorite films of the 1990s.";
	schema:reviewBody "We've all had bad days. And oftentimes a day that starts out horrible just keeps getting worse snowballing into a really awful day. This is how 1993's crime thriller 'Falling Down' begins. Directed by Joel Schumacher  taken place on one of the hottest days in Los Angeles California's history the film written by Ebbe Roe Smith the film tells the story of an defense worker William Foster Michael Douglas trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party only to get frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society which starts to unravel him until he suffer from a major to psychotically and violently unstable mental breakdown. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say that the English Hard Rock Band Iron Maiden got it right with this man. He was truly on the edge with each step gets closer to losing his head. Even if we can't condone his extreme actions as least some of us can relate to the issues he had to deal with. Everybody at least had one of these days. If you can't relate to his struggles as least you can understand the frustrations that Det. Martin Prendergast Robert Duvall had to deal with on his last day on the force on figuring out the mystery who is this madman is all about. Both of these character's stories make 'Falling Down' a very intriguing yet challenging movie worth watching. Added to that is the wonderful use of music by James Newton Howard that set the mood and powerful visual cinematography from Andrzej Bartkowiak under Schumacher's direction. Sunny LA has never look so bleak and hopeless before. Great use of desaturated and low tech camerawork and shooting at rundown locations. Also great use of symbolism and metaphors throughout the film like the running use of the lyrics of 'London Bridge'  others. However I do have to say the film isn't with some faults  I'm not talking about the minor nitpicking goofs. I'm talking about how the film was notorious criticize by critics at the time for its treatment of minorities mostly with how they show Korean and Latino Americans as thugs. It got so bad that Warner Brothers canceled the release of 'Falling Down' in South Korea  certain Latin America countries following boycott threats. In my opinion while I can understand the reasons why minorities groups like Korean  Latino American Coalition got anger. After all the film was made during and released just after the 1992 Los Angeles Riot where Koreans and Latinos were targeted by police and looters. In truth there was plenty of positive Hispanic  Asian Americans characters in the film like Detective Brian Steve Park  Detective Sandra Torres Rachel Ticotin. Both characters were played by Korean and Latina performers. If anything if you look at the majority of negatively characters throughout the film. Most of them were portray with white actors. Plus as a minority the portrayal weren't as bad as people back then make it out to be. Compare to other films back then it's pretty tame. I just think these groups are just missing the point. The film is trying to tackle the struggles of trying to get along despite cultural differences language as well as the economic conditions in which many of us Americans lived under. Honestly if there is any real faults for this film it wouldn't be their use of harshlanguage  violence if anything it would be due to the fact that the film couldn't stop itself being label as the negative 'angry white racism man' movie. While on the surface the film might look like the stereotypically disproportionally portrayal of an older White Americans having animosity toward minorities in truth the film is nothing like that. We sees throughout the film William Foster getting along with a number of minorities. Some good examples are the 'Under Construction' scene where a young unnamed black kid Valentino Harrison teach him how to use a bazooka and the scene with the not economically viable man Vondie CurtisHall. There is even a scene where Foster disagree with a NeoNazi Surplus Store Owner Frederic Forrest about race. Because of that I can't say Foster is a racism character nor can I say the movie glorifies lawbreaking. Of course we see many elements of our society that contributed to his madness. However the movie never condones his actions as the right thing to do. He's never the hero. If anything Robert Duvall's character is. Despite that I do have to say portrayal Foster is probably the best role Michael Douglas has done since 1987's 'Wall Street'. You really do see the unbalance nature of his character trying to figure out what is right and what is wrong in a world that he views is upside down. You see his alienation disgust and mounting rage against what he perceives to be an increasingly unfair and depersonalized world. However I can't say the same with Robert Duvall's character. His performance was a bit too similar to the role he played in 1988's 'Colors' still interesting but in the end he really didn't stand out as much as Douglas does. After all Douglas's character inspired the creation of the oneepisode character Frank Grimes from The Simpsons 23th episode Homer's Enemy on Season 8 and received a parodic homage song in Foo Fighters' video for Walk. In the end the dark comedy of this movie really does payoff both tragedy and humorous. Either way it's a film that inspires quite a bit of discussion and debate. That's one thing I love about this movie. It makes you think. Depending on who you ask this film is either social commentary on the dangers of capitalism and the ignorance of the citizen under it or the call to arms for conservatism against the dangers of liberalism. All these arguments have merit and it could be any of this. That's why this is one movie that is worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Superb examination of violence and aggression in America";
	schema:reviewBody "In Leonard Maltin's book the entry for this film says What exactly is the point? Well Leonard I'll tell you. FALLING DOWN is a critique of violence and aggression in America particularly  but not limited to  white heterosexual males. The point of the movie is to demonstrate that America falsely celebrates itself as a land of opportunity and a melting pot rather it's a powder keg of selfishness arrogance and prejudice that can cause anyone to snap for any reason.The movie suggests that this anger is learned at a young age through the media. Notice how the daughter of DFens Michael Douglas is playing with a water gun while watching violent cartoons. And of course there is the boy who immediately assumes DFens is filming a movie because he has a bazooka. The boy then teaches him how to use the weapon because he saw it on TV.But the film doesn't lay the blame entirely on the media. It also covers the psychological aspect of violence namely the impact of a person's work and family life on their state of mind. The movie perfectly shows how one can affect the other while both affect the whole person. DFens was divorced unemployed and raised by a weirdly obsessivecompulsive mother Lois Smith. His life  empty and routine  turned him into some kind of machine as she put it. Meanwhile Prendergast Robert Duvall had become a human punching bag at his job picked on at work the same way he was picked on at home. It's only with the help of his sympathetic partner Rachel Ticotin that Prendergast is finally able to stand up to his coworkers and his wife. Suckerpunch notwithstanding he used more appropriate forms of aggression than DFens did. Overall this is a brilliant film with a lot to say about the violent and angry times we live in. It should really be seen by everyone.".

	schema:headline " There's more to this film than you think";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of semieducated liberals assume this film is about the festering xenophobia of America's middleclass whites. But I don't see that at all in this film. The script very boldly explores post cold war America and seems to ask this question While we were busy defending ourselves from outsiders and fighting wars abroad did we forget what was wrong at home?The central character played by Michael Douglas represents old school commiefearing Uncle Sam. He's a man who has spent his life developing weapons to defend his country. Now he is in every sense redundant and is left wondering what he worked so hard to achieve.The film captured how many of us were feeling at the time. Opening with a traffic jam on a baking freeway we immediately get the idea that all is not well in the land of the free. Despite all the tumultuous events of the 20th Century all the wars technology science politics and the hard lessons despite the brief optimism felt as the wall came down the dream of a better world is still so far away.Most of the characters we meet along the way represent nations which at some point in history the USA has been at war with The Korean economic The Hispanics land rights the Nazis ideology. We meet one solitary black man in the film holding a banner which reads NOT ECOMINCALLY VIABLE. This speaks volumes and rams home the central message We looked abroad to solve problems while we ignored our own. The Whammy Burger Bar scene is a representation of the inflexible and misleading' corporate world even the child can clearly see what's wrong with this picture' it captures a dissatisfaction that has gained much momentum since 1993.Despite what was written in reviews of the time Douglas' character DFens' actually commits very few acts of violence in the film. The press yelled racist' too but here's a story brave enough to avoid the token blackpolicechief approach to race and show a world where everyone is potentially malicious. His mirror opposite in the story played by Duvall balances the bleak view of modern America nicely but as we gradually discover how horrible and strange Dfens has become to his own wife and children the film leaves thinking about how strange and horrible so much of American society has become.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of semieducated liberals assume this film is about the festering xenophobia of America's middleclass whites. But I don't see that at all in this film. The script very boldly explores post cold war America and seems to ask this question While we were busy defending ourselves from outsiders and fighting wars abroad did we forget what was wrong at home?The central character played by Michael Douglas represents old school commiefearing Uncle Sam. He's a man who has spent his life developing weapons to defend his country. Now he is in every sense redundant and is left wondering what he worked so hard to achieve.The film captured how many of us were feeling at the time. Opening with a traffic jam on a baking freeway we immediately get the idea that all is not well in the land of the free. Despite all the tumultuous events of the 20th Century all the wars technology science politics and the hard lessons despite the brief optimism felt as the wall came down the dream of a better world is still so far away.Most of the characters we meet along the way represent nations which at some point in history the USA has been at war with The Korean economic The Hispanics land rights the Nazis ideology. We meet one solitary black man in the film holding a banner which reads NOT ECOMINCALLY VIABLE. This speaks volumes and rams home the central message We looked abroad to solve problems while we ignored our own. The Whammy Burger Bar scene is a representation of the inflexible and misleading' corporate world even the child can clearly see what's wrong with this picture' it captures a dissatisfaction that has gained much momentum since 1993.Despite what was written in reviews of the time Douglas' character DFens' actually commits very few acts of violence in the film. The press yelled racist' too but here's a story brave enough to avoid the token blackpolicechief approach to race and show a world where everyone is potentially malicious. His mirror opposite in the story played by Duvall balances the bleak view of modern America nicely but as we gradually discover how horrible and strange Dfens has become to his own wife and children the film leaves thinking about how strange and horrible so much of American society has become.";

	schema:reviewBody "Falling down is a movie that makes people take a look inside themselves. Have you ever felt so angry you want to explode? Have you ever had a week or even a single day when nothing is going your way and everything seems to be going wrong? Who hasn't? On these days you just want to throw your hands in the air and say I give up! Many people hold in their anger for days weeks months or even years. They get up in the morning go to work come home go to sleep and do it all over again. There is no release of stress. People keep holding in this anger and tension and it just builds and builds and keeps building until it can build no more. This is the point where people lose it. This is the point where people commit suicide. This is the point where people go on shooting sprees. This is the point where people commit horrible crimes of passion or just simply disappear and start a new life.Falling down is a movie about one such individual. The movie starts out with William Foster Michael Douglas sitting in a hot car in a traffic jam. You can feel the tension building up inside of him until he finally gets out of the car and leaves it there. That moment when he gets out of his car is the moment he threw his hands in the air and said I give up! He wants to go home. We find out more and more about him as the movie progresses. We find out he has been fired from his job over a month ago his wife left him and took their daughter and he has pretty much lost it all. We don't know too much about him which is a good thing as this leaves room for us to fill in the blanks with our own imagination and think whatever this guy has been through it must not have been easy and this could be me. He goes through the city in a very matteroffact manner trying to get home to his exwife while people keep getting in his way. He has been taking people's crap all his life and he is not going to take it anymore. William Foster is basically your average Joe. William Foster could represent anyone. You feel for this guy. You feel his frustration. You feel his anger. You see yourself in his character. You see how just one man who loses it causes a ripple effect and influences his environment.Throughout the movie through all the things that happened you ask yourself did he really do anything wrong? He was quirky he was brutally honest he was aggressive. But was it justified? It actually makes sense! He really didn't do anything wrong. Afterall he could have just went on a shooting spree and turned the gun on himself. The whole thing is a last ditch effort to get his life back together. When Duvall catches up with him he realizes that this is in no way possible so he essentially commits suicide by pulling a water pistol on Duvall and getting shot. Go see the movie. Then see it again think about it and absorb what you just saw. And most importantly learn to shed yourself of stress or you just might be the next William Foster!".

The corner store owner who defends his business... before collapsing into fear and surrender. The gang members seeking vengeance for a slight... who are Three Stooges stupid and clumsy. The fast food chain... where the customer always comes last. The beggar... who barely pretends to be little more than a thug. The neoNazi... destroyed by his new idol. The occupiers of a lavish estate... who are only the hired help. Untouchable countryclub types in their golf course paradise... driven to terror and panic by an outsider. The innocent children... well versed in the operation of weapons of great destruction. The big city cop... emasculated by a deranged wife and humiliated by his colleagues.The chaos and violence of a big city... where law order and morality is ultimately restored.One of the more trenchant observations of society since some of the great movies of the Seventies like Network Nashville and others Falling Down takes us on a fastforward noholdsbarred ride through the stylized hell of modern life replete with alienation hatred misunderstanding misrepresentation cynicism suspicion and general human baseness. This is a world in which every element of society has completely lost touch with every other element. And the Michael Douglas character feeling caught in the middle lost in a world he no longer understands snaps grows bold and swaggers through the twisted landscape determined to make everything right again.He says he only wants to give his little girl a birthday present but there is far more to it than that. Note that this gift he gives her is one of those little globe worlds like a snowshaker an ideal world he feels once existed and which he wants to be able to give to her.That world does not exist of course and perhaps even he knows it but things are not as bad as his eyes see them. Chaos eventually resolves itself into order and in the movie this happens through the Robert Duvall character from meekness and weakness he hardens into the figure of strength and righteous authority. Order is restored. The world is as it should be.We have never stopped relying on stereotypes and this movie is very effective at puncturing them all and leaving a little kernel of truth to observe and appreciate. Each of the little episodes that make up this movie always end in an assertion of simple humanity. The little masks that we wear and that we see on others are torn away and we see ourselves as we really are no matter what image we might try and pass off for ourselves in the end we are all fragile vulnerable often a little stupid but ultimately idealistic and we are only good or bad by accident.Mixed with a sense of humour a good cinematographic scheme some decent secondary characters to support the powerhouse performance of Michael Douglas and the more subtle shadings in Robert Duvall's role and the very real urban locations used and you have one of the more notable achievements in film in the past decade or two. Enjoy.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Michael Douglas in an uncomfortable movie about American society";
	schema:reviewBody "The scenery is starting in a traffic jam The protagonist William Foster played by Douglas is caught in the usual stress of not being able to get away from this annoying everyday scene. Surrounded by people who also have to cope with it. Children shouting drivers swearing phoning honking and other ways of bearing the waiting time. The cinematography is reflecting well the uneasiness of Foster as he sweats and seemingly looses his temper during the stay. Not being enough a fly in his car makes him slap around aggressively while a little girl watches his movement from the backseat of a car as if she knew what dangerous potential of DFens Foster will show later on. Then he makes a decision He WILL leave this situation leave the car and climb up the hill to go home...This is the starting point of Foster's mental falling down. It seems to be a strange behaviour to leave your car behind and escape from the jam. But to be honest  haven't you ever thought of just doing this?! Such a behaviour seems strange yet one could understand it as it means no real harm to anyone around him.Later one gets to know that this man has lost his family job and is not economically viable. In this hostile situation thoughts about what you have forgone in your life may explain and defend this naive escape motivation. He escapes this deadend  symbolized by a jam  to get home.In the next scene the sympathy towards the protagonist gets lost or changes into a feeling of unsettlement and pity. He might have just chilled out a few moments on the top of the hillwalked around to calm down and return to his car. But he does not. Instead Foster get sucked into a maelstrom of aggression which he of course provokes.The movie is full of details about Foster's anger about society. A general anger which everyone has felt before but not uttered in such a direct and crude way. There are dozens of pictures of the decadence of the USA a decadence which can be found in all western societies but to a special amount in the US Overpriced goods in stores gangland area people carrying guns even automatic military weapons the delusion of fastfood racism neo Nazis having their freedom drug addicts aidssuffering folk beggars begging for money DFens constructing weapons of mass destruction divorce and a man not being allowed to see his child anymore decadence of golfsites economically nonviable people...... See for yourself your will find many examples throughout the film. And Foster is in the middle of it realizing that this is not only unjust. He knows the he has also fallen victim of his surrounding society. Especially the scene where the cops get hold of the black guy protesting in the front of the bank is addressed to Foster. The police car stops and the protestant stares at Foster to tell him don't forget me. This scene seems to be Foster's point of no return. He won't forget he will get his right to go home! In fact it is a desperate right a right of socially marginalized person an illusion.Noteworthy is the way how Foster's potential violence comes to life. When he enters the Korean corner store the viewer does not realize that he will turn out to be a dangerous man with aggressive behaviour. Everything stars harmless when Foster just asks for change money to use a phone. It is the usual counter aggression of racism that drives Foster to use inappropriate measures. No change you have to buy something. Foster hesitates but still accepts this silent offense by purchasing a coke. When he realizes that the price of this drink is exaggerated and will not leave enough money for his phone call he makes a last effort. He asks for 50 cents in exchange for a dollar !. Even that offer is refused by clerk. Now Foster gives way to his anger and gets started about the inflicted rights of the consumers. His rage cumulates to point where the clerk feels unsafe and tries to produce a bat to force Foster out. Violence creates counterviolence and Foster gets hold of the bat palpability. Now having the power he interrogates the clerk of the prices of the other goods in the store relieving his anger on batting around in the corner store. But Foster never hits the clerk and finally even pays for the coke taking his change from the cash and leaving the store like a normal customer It was a pleasure of frequenting this establishment!.If you carefully revise this scene you see that it is not Foster who starts to be aggressive. It is an understandable reaction of his to get angry facing provocations like these. Also the way of taking out a weapon as a defence is inappropriate. Maybe a short palpability as reaction might not be seen as Foster's guilt. The situation gets out of hand. It seems to be an aggression based on racism of an Asian and white guy. But still the above mentioned sympathy for the protagonist is vanishing as his behaviour is unsettling. Foster's potential violence is present now. Nevertheless the viewer is left with the feeling that Foster had a bad day and does not really want this.Michael Douglas plays Foster's psychotic development in a very plastic and authentic way. Douglas does not just emerge as a violent berserker. He reflects Foster's inner despair ambiguously Foster is not a man without feelings yet he is a man letting out too many feelings on the spot. Driven by his love for his daughter he fights his way through a hostile environment and society. He is only dangerous when people provoke him. He has lost his inhibition. Foster goes amok. In fact this has happened several times in reality. Think about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people have said many nasty things about Joel Schumacher for what he did to Batman on the big screen. Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate DFens the man Michael Douglas abandons his car and starts walking. He says he's going home but where he's going isn't his home anymore. His exwife Beth and daughter Adele Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer now live there and Beth has a restraining order against DFens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles DFens has a series of violent encounters first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant DFens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neoNazi gun nuts pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of DFens' slow moving rampage come in the only one to figure out what's going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast Robert Duvall is retiring early an taking a reduced pension to satisfy the demands of his insecure needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he's friends with Rachel Ticotin Prendergast sets out to stop DFens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of going postal where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture this movie doesn't take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make DFens a character who defies easy definition. He's neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal's easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He's a man who can legitimately claim he's been victimized by society yet he's also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. DFens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that. Most of the characters even minor ones are given depth and personalities like they're real human beings and not just constructs serving the script. They experience genuine humor and friendship and anguish and fear in a way this sort of highconcept movie usually doesn't provide.The contrast between DFens and Prendergast that runs through the story is a great example of that kind of complexity. They're both guys whose lives aren't working out like they wanted. One has a failed marriage and a lost career the other a dead daughter and a crazy wife he feels responsible for. The ways they deal with those challenges are quite different. DFens is an idealist who cares about the way he thinks things should be at the expense of the other people in the world with him. Prendergast is a pragmatist who takes the world as it is and does what he has to do to get by without even thinking it could be any other way.I suspect that Falling Down has not gotten the acclaim it deserves because it's a mainstream work of entertainment that won't fit neatly into a particular box. It looks and sounds like a white male power trip but it feels much more introspective and melancholy and despairing. I find it to be a compelling story with some great acting and I think you should give it a look.".

When i tried to explain that they were not popular because every time someone tries to order one they have to wait an eternity for you to cook it i was presented with a face of immense puzzlement and confusion! I'm not saying i would ever go as far as Michael Douglas does when he cant get his breakfast 2 minutes after the cut off time in this film but i understand EXACTLY how he feels.!. Falling Down is a very good interpretation on how if someone not quite the full package comes up against the day to day greedyness rudeness and descrimination of todays western society and how he feels he needs to get his point across in his own way. This is a very good film and is superbly actedespecially from Duvall and Douglas. 8 out of 10.".

If we were less than tough and strong we would end up shooting and beating people up like Michael Douglas' character in this movie. From the very start we realize it is something wrong with him by the way he perceives the details people's faces in the traffic jam the heavy heat or by the way he carries a conversation when he decides to leave the car in the middle of the road and go home on foot. There begins a journey with all the signs of a tragic end. Each new incident adds a little to his discomposure and every time he refuses to ignore the absurdity of the situations as a normal' person would do. But it's only a matter of time before he crosses the line and reaches the point of no return'. It is the point where someone loses their equilibrium their sense of reason and stability and no one can help them. Society in the form of local police reacts by trying to hunt him and stop him. Nothing left to do. The big events in Bill's life that formed his character already happened. We only witness one day in his life the fatal day that was bound to happen when everything goes wrong. The efficient filming and directing of the oneday story make possible the understanding of a lifetime. It seems to be one of the directors' strengths to choose a dense oneunit story taking place one day like in Falling Down' or in one particular spot like in Phone Booth' and make something suspenseful and even meaningful out of it.".

Even good old Cousteau gets into the spirit of things by bringing his rifle on deck and shooting a whale in the head well it was probably suffering after they ran over it with the boat and then later harpooned it.These guys would be up on criminal charges if they'd made this film today.

Set on boardand belowthe good ship Calypso during an exploratory expedition this featurelength documentary was codirected by Cousteau and Louis Malle whose first film this was Cousteau selected Malle for this assignment immediately upon the latter's graduation from film school.

Compare this to the old Lloyd Bridges Sea Hunt TV show and there is no comparison  what can you do with those old cables and hoses attached? And besides Cousteau was a master.

	schema:reviewBody "The Silent World is an Academy Awardwinning documentary from directors Jacques Cousteau and Louis Malle. It helped to introduce many around the world to ocean exploration and for that we should be grateful. That being said the film will no doubt horrify many viewers today as sensibilities have definitely changed and the nice conservationoriented crew of the Calypso from the 1970s and 80s is no where to be found! Instead this earlier version of Cousteau and his team are at best irresponsible! As you see them travel the world they commit atrocity after atrocity all in the name of science!! If you think I am being overly sensitive try justifying them dynamiting a coral reef in order to 'get an accurate count of the fish' running over a baby whale and then harpooning and shooting it and THEN murdering the many sharks that then come to feed on the whale carcass!!! By today's standards it's completely insane and I must say I had to speed through the sharkkilling orgy as seeing crew members with axes bashing the crap out of the creatures was upsetting! You also see the crew destroying stretches of turtle grass harassing a sea turtle riding atop tortoises petting fish you name it...all the things they now tell people NEVER to do! In addition to all this senseless violence the film also lacks a cohesive plot as well as scientific rigor. The bottom line is that the film is seriously passe now....and you'd be a lot better off watching the much more responsible and interesting reruns of The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau from the 1960s and 70s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both Le Monde du Silence and Le Monde Sans Soleil are remarkable documents of the underwater world. At this time during the fifties very little was known about coral reefs sea creatures and the sheer profusion of life beneath the ocean's surface. Cousteau and his crew go a long way indeed dedicated their lives to allowing us a glimpse of this fascinating world. Yet there are scenes in both films which seem to pride themselves upon this human mastery over other creatures and the destruction of their habitat. Whether sledge hammering at coral walls or tormenting fish by enclosing them within a glass box or dispersing chemicals in the sea as 'harmless waste' or simply killing a wide variety of creatures in the least humane way possible appal to appeal all in the name of learning there comes a point when I simply switch off and think to myself Were scientists really that dumb in the fifties? How can anyone watch this and think Cousteau and his cronies great pioneers of 'knowing' science? Of course not all scientists were that dumb. But there are always exceptions. Recently we could see this at least televisually with the Australian 'tormentor of beasts' Steve Irwin who when his karmic credit finally ran out was stung to death by a manta ray he was attempting to toy with for the sake of his Channel 5 program.It's curious more than slightly ironic that the following year the best documentary award was handed to Jerome Hill for his moving portrait of the Alsatian polymath Albert Schweitzer. Cousteau irrespective of how he popularised the underwater world I shall not enumerate the crimes that have been carried out under the pretext of 'scientific endeavour' would have done well to have been acquainted with Schweitzer's work and above all the 'ethics' that Schweitzer extolled. A man is truly ethical only when he obeys the compulsion to help all life which he is able to assist and shrinks from injuring anything that lives. When science and exploration 'shrinks' from ethics when it just becomes an excuse to gain more knowledge and 'better understanding' does understanding even come in degrees? that will invariably rationalise postfactum the deeds we have done it has already debased itself and become the way forward for a race of people who have lost their entitlement to the nomenclature 'human'.".

That the two milestones are set above the water isn't the point the point is in the cruel treatment animals get all through the journey. And keep in mind one is a cartoon and the other is praised for its ecological values. In fact my puzzlement had a lot to do with my expectations but the reputation of The Silent World is likely to set them high.The 1956 documentary featured the first Technicolor underwater shots made possible thanks to great waterproof cams combined with JacquesYves Cousteau innovative scuba diving equipment. The iconic Commandant and soontobe ecological icon has always been revered as the early defender of environment at a time where global warming and ecosystem didn't even belong to the dictionary. The film was the directorial debut of Louis Malle whose body of works includes My Dinner With Andre Atlantic City and Au Revoir les Enfants. Last but not least the film won the Golden Palm at Cannes Festival and the Oscar for Best Documentary. In a certain way The Silent World exuded cinematic respectability from every drop of water the Calypso sailed over.Even the title was the promise of some magnificent shots under the sea where we would be transported into the majestic beauty that dominates a few leagues under the sea and discover the fauna and flora with only the sound of bubbles pouring or the diver's breathing in the background you know a more Bergmanian version of National Geographic stuff. But what we get in The Silent World is a world that is anything but silent it's about a bunch of explorers aboard the Calypso sailing over the Indian Ocean. Guys who wander in the boat wearing swimming trunks smoking cigarettes and not acting like the noblehearted environmentalists we expect. Sure they are experts in diving and the film fulfills its documentary value by educating us on the origins of scuba diving and such but these are not the parts the CaptainPlanet generation will most remember.I still have the dynamiting of the reef in mind the only way to number the sea population what an odd irony killing creatures to identify the living. There's another scene where a diver uses a brave tortoise to move into water and almost complains that he had to abandon it when it was out of breath. I guess this is all preparing us to the infamous encounter with the sperm whales and when a baby whale goes under the boat and gets torn up by the propeller because it was careless like a kid says the narrator his long agony is shown someone tries to harpoon it but the only way to end its misery is to shoot it in the head and it's shown in closeup. Pretty hardcore. But this is nothing the bleeding whale attracts dozens of sharks and when the narrator says that sharks are the mortal enemies of sailors unlike the dolphins who're like their pals you know the worst is to come.The Calypso crew literally rail at them. It's a live massacre that didn't seem to bother anyone by the time of the film's release and that even Cousteau regretted later you see the socalled environmentalist display such a high level of violence hitting harpooning disfiguring the sharks that a PETA member would call them Animal Nazis or Apocalypso. So give Spielberg a break he didn't start that whole trend against sharks. This is the climactic display of violence only followed by the discovery of giant tortoises in an Island and at that point of the film we're not even surprised to see them sitting on them and smoking cigarettes. The film is to documentary what Tintin in Congo is to comicbooks if you're not familiar with this album never mind you don't miss much.The film ends with a friendlier encounter with a grouper nicknamed Jojo but even the narrator has a sense of condescension toward the animal and it seems that The Silent World is about men who loved the sea but didn't treat its inhabitants with equal respect there was still that 'distrust' and ancestral hatred pumping in their macho veins and as strange as it sounds maybe it's all these controversial characteristics that made The Silent World an interesting film it didn't try to play the documentary card it just was a honest and bold reflection of its time and the guys there were no environmentalists or ecologists but adventurers as flawed and disrespectful as treasure hunters.It's obvious that the world of sea would be better left without humans I was just watching these disaster documentaries one about the future of the planet if there were no humans and if the Earth stopped spinning. In both cases fish species wouldn't suffer much on the contrary. So it's obvious that men had an impact on the oceans and we're doomed already it's been 10 years since we've been briefed about this inconvenient truth. It's certain that we have enough documentaries to look with hypocritically tearing eyes at how the sea used to be. But when I had The Silent World in mind I was expecting this kind of documentaries it wasn't but strangely enough it was entertaining in its own wicked way.So for its controversial content that reflects the behavior of men that prevailed even within the context of a respect toward the environment for its lack of moral consensus and its rather acid and condescending tone The Silent World has the appeal of these controversial milestones a shocker but a necessary one. I wasn't prepared for how awful some parts would be but this is what makes it so interesting the film doesn't leave you indifferent and still some underwater shots are breathtaking.".

	schema:headline " For better or worse there's a tremendous sense of fun in Jacques Cousteau  Louis Malle's seminal The Silent World.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have long known of Jacques Cousteau and his pioneering technology through my father he transferred his childhood interest of diving and the oceans onto me. Despite this I was not aware that Cousteau and his team were the subject of several featurelength documentaries with two Academy Awards and a Palme D'or to boast of. When I stumbled upon The Silent World in a CEX shop I was immediately attracted to the idea of seeing the ocean through the wonderful vibrancy of Technicolor  it was one of the first films to create such an experience.The documentary follows Cousteau his crew and a lucky little Dachshund aboard the Calypso. They may grow tired in the oppressive sunlight and absence of activity when they're travelling across the vast lonely stretches of ocean but it is all proved worthwhile when they get into the water.Using Cousteau's aqualung the men swim around with relish in one instance encircling a sponge diver heaving along in a metal helmeted diving suit that today we see only in tacky gold fish bowls. The man hiding in his relic of a suit doesn't mind the aqualung upstarts the men shake hands and scour the seabed for sponges together.The greatest liberation however is afforded by their rotary propelled underwater vehicles. They glide among an array of wildlife with ease including a sea turtle with one diver seizing the opportunity and hitching a ride on the majestic animal's back until it's exhausted  it all looks thoroughly enjoyable until he overstays his welcome.Indeed the documentary regularly reminds you of the age it comes from  they provoke most of the animals they encounter! When they happen across the group of whales the skipper decides to try and harpoon one with little success Cousteau narrates 'Under our skipper's nose is a whale sixty feet long and he can't resist having a crack at it'. Soon after this the Calypso's propellers mortally injure a small whale and the crew mercifully kill the profusely bleeding animal.This inevitably attracts scores of sharks and the crew's reaction to them surprised me more than anything in the film. Cousteau narrates 'For us divers the sharks are our mortal enemies.' As the sharks tear through the whale carcass of the men's making he continues 'Every seaman hates the sharks after what we have seen the divers can't be held back they grab anything they can to avenge the whale.'The men proceed to brutally catch the sharks tearing their mouths open as they yank them on board battering some of them with the blunt end of an axe. Marine biologists would abhor such attitudes and behaviour today however like with the lobsters and flying fish earlier in the film the Frenchman probably made good use of them in the kitchen.No animal is left unpestered even land animals aren't safe. When the men arrive at a desert island they meet a group of giant tortoises and sit and stand on them as they casually eat their lunch. The men's irreverence seems to leave an impression on the Dachshund as he is seen nipping at the legs of a poor tortoise trying to mind his own business. Their cavalier style also sees them blowing up part of a coral reef and collecting the detritus in the name of science  it's an awfully destructive approach to taxonomy.The crew restore your faith in them somewhat when they befriend 'Ulysses' a gregarious eightypound Grouper fish who along with scores of other fish becomes surprisingly tame when the men present them with a bag of delicious gristle.There are moments where the men contrive conversations to show the viewer the procedures that happen aboard the ship. I use the word contrive because of how awfully stilted the men are but this is mainly because of the useless dubbing on my Bluray so I'll give the crew's acting abilities the benefit of the doubt. I liked Cousteau's Frenchinflected English narration but I would have preferred subtitles when the men spoke to each other.The Silent World is a charismatic documentary that provides a compelling insight into the history of both diving and underwater photography.78www.hawkensian.com".

It's no wonder to me how this film won the Palm d'Or and an Oscar because it is probably the best filmed documentary ever.The focus on the new technology and the lives of the shipmates was even more fascinating than the nature particularly the more violent scenes like the butchering of the sharks by the sailors or the dynamite in the water used to discover the diversity of fish in the area. It is for this reason I would guess that this film has been forgotten and the animal rights movements of today would likely shun the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever a movie mistakenly thinks a bad pun of a tagline Dupree's a crowd anyone? is gonna rope in ye olde moviegoing audience there is officially room to be concerned with what you're about to watch. OK so the tagline isn't as bad as some but it is enough to raise a red flag. However is it enough to indicate what's to come? Welp I'm happy to say that once again I'm gonna keep my distance from all your unfavorite I'm makin' up words baby! stuffedshirt critics out there who are giving You Me and Dupree a merciless shredding because it doesn't meet the inherent level of pretension they so girlfriendlessly demand. That's right folks. I Johnny Betts enjoyed You Me and Dupree. I'm one of about three movie reviewers to boldly make that claim but doggone on it I'm sticking by it.Granted my enjoyment was heightened due to the fact that I kept my expectations low and didn't have to pay to see the movie but I was entertained all the same.It's only fair that I be perfectly honest and admit I'm somewhat easily amused when it comes to watching actors and actresses that I really like and Dupree sports a great cast. Mileages will vary depending on your tolerance level of the actors involved.Owen Wilson is one of my constant comedic favorites once again displaying that crooked nose we all love and projecting childlike innocence with his signature charm. I also love his ability to sincerely deliver outrageous and cheesy lines in ways that make them seem not quite so outrageous or silly.Then there's Kate Hudson only the absolute cutest thing that Hollywood has going for it. She plays this role a little more low key than usual but she's still irresistible evidenced by her black bikini scene where she proves that she inherited what was always her mom's best ahem asset.Rounding out the cast straightman Matt Dillon's cool as always and Seth Rogen though woefully underused brings an impressive laughstoscreen time ratio. Most of you will remember him from The 40 YearOld Virgin but he'll always be Ken Miller and Ron Garner to me. If neither of those names means anything to you then we need to have a serious talk about a couple of DVD sets you might want to consider acquiring.Is this a film that'll find its way to the top of any of these actors' resumes? No. Is it a nonstop laughfest? No. Is it a film I can watch over and over and cry with laughter every time? Nah. Will you be disappointed if you're expecting something along the lines of The Wedding Crashers? Most likely.After all I never said the movie doesn't have its flaws. Some of the humor is a little too conventional and predictable and the dramatic dialogue isn't exactly the most compelling to grace the screen so no this isn't gonna go down in the Book of Comedy Classics nor do I feel a necessity to pencil it in as a future addition to my DVD collection unless the special features are loaded with Kateness. But I found it to be a fun lighthearted silly way to take a 2hour break from the real world. As I mentioned in the paragraphs above its greatest strength is in its likable cast and their chemistry and I appreciate the charm it displayed in never taking itself too seriously.Plus the majority of the screening crowd seemed to enjoy it. I've personally never had nor been a third wheel like Dupree but those of you who can relate to such an experience might appreciate it on a different level.I can't say that You Me and Dupree is a film that just absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen but it's certainly the kind of movie that you usually watch with friends and family where most everyone will walk away with a good chuckle no one will be overly offended Aunt Ella will comment on how it was cute no one's life will be dramatically altered and Uncle Larry's uninvited segue into some boring recollections about his own Dupree experiences will wake everybody back up to their nightmare reality.All in all if you think no one can bring seven different kinds of smoke like Owen Wilson and you find Kate Hudson to be seven different kinds of smokin' then there's something here for you to enjoy. Be it at a matine or as a future rental. It might just help you discover your ness. THE GIST You Me and Dupree might not deliver two solid hours of nothing but outloud laughter and the dramatic elements might falter at times but there's no denying that the cast is great and if you love those involved then you'll find some enjoyment here. I wouldn't pay more than matine prices and if you don't have a lot of spending money to throw around then just save it for a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Owen Wilson when he's in the right genre. He has proved to be a considerably good talent in drama as well but comedy is his real niche. The whole Frat Pack subgenre that is popular right now is where he most belongs and as such You Me and Dupree offers what one would expect from a comedy starring Owen Wilson as a slacker who leeches off of people.What I didn't expect from this comedy was its dark side. Matt Dillon's character turns pretty nasty and his relationship with wife Kate Hudson gets rough. Likewise his confrontational scenes with Michael Douglas seem to betray the lighter attitude of the scenes involving Dupree Wilson. The movie has a few twists and turns that I didn't expect  when I saw the ads I figured it would be an OKbutforgettable movie about a guy crashing in a newlymarried couple's house end of story but there's actually more to the story here. It doesn't necessarily make it stand out it's not a very good film  but the movie moves away from Dupree being a pest and actually begins to focus on Dillon's growing anger towards his friend as he believes him to be developing a crush on his wife. The whole subplot with Douglas' character playing the father of Hudson becomes quite prominent in the film as well. This is where it really takes a turn for the worse.Whereas for the first hour or so is fun and predictable in the vein of Wilson's other films once it begins trying to develop a showdown of sorts between all its characters it gets to be too much. The ending sequence involving Wilson being chased by a Samoan security guard is way overthetop and betrays the realistic roots of the movie.I also didn't care much for Dillon's character. I could relate to his frustration but he almost seemed TOO realistic for this film. You know when critics complain in these movies about how clichd the nice guy characters always are? Well Dillson isn't a nice guy in this movie  he's got a hot temper and loses his cool a bunch of times in the movie. Towards the end he's like a mad violent alcoholic and I started to feel like Dupree should end up with his wife instead.Overall the first hour of this movie is fun and entertaining and has its fair share of humorous segments  I laughed a lot when Dupree burns down a house and at some of the early jokes involving his interaction with old buddies  but the movie obviously realizes this isn't enough of a plot for a 90minute feature and tries to develop other plot lines 34 of the way through and that's when it gets tiresome. The ending ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth and felt tacky. It seemed like a lastminute ending that was filmed after poor test screenings. A relationship crisis involving Dupree is never even resolved in the movie  as if the crew totally forgot about it.I guess I would have left the theater feeling more fulfilled if perhaps the film had continued as a lightweight frat packstyle comedy rather than trying to rise above other genre entries. I acknowledge the film's attempts at becoming more than just another comedy of this type  but they chose the wrong path and just made it worse. In this case it's an example of a shallow movie trying too hard to be something else.I liked it and I was entertained but it's better left as a rental and only if you're a fan of the actors. By the way it's worth mentioning that apart from Wilson's hilarious performance Kate Hudson really impressed me and had more of a realistic role than women do in most of these sorts of films. You can't slam You Me and Dupree for not at least trying.".

Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps onethird full and I was waiting for the boredom to set in which the critics said was comingin spades.Yes Owen Wilson has bleachedblond locks again but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw and I must have read at least ten of them from various parts of the country. He was very good as he was in the Wedding Crashers. Kate Hudson was perky as always and did a splendid job and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's clone just as lovely as ever.Matt Dillon did a terrific job and was totally believable comically and Michael Douglas was very good too playing his character with aplomb. In short it was a very funny movie and quite refreshing given the alternatives namely movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.It seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong dead wrong. Go see it in a theater or buy a DVD when it comes out and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaand may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this movie tonight not expecting much based on the HORRIBLE reviews given to this movie on IMDb and critics reviews in today's paper. I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be another sweet movie about two male buddies that are learning to grow up. Owen Wilson was adorable and his character was not a loser. Dupree I won't give away his real name because it surprises you when it comes up in the movie... gives sage advice throughout the movie. In one scene is he standing in for Matt Dillon's character at a career day in Molly's Kate Hudson 34? grade classroom. He tells the kids that some of them will go on to traditional or socially acceptable success while some of them pods he calls them! will float for a while while they wait for the calling from the mother ship for their destined path in life. He says the pods that needed to hear this did and I laughed my butt off. His floating pod theory was hysterical and very accurate.It sounds ridiculous but it isn't. Dupree's character is consistent throughout as a lovable guy looking for his path. He's a smart charismatic guy that makes lots of mistakes along the way. Of course the previews showed all the stupid humor bathroom jokes jacking off etc but it doesn't play as crazily over the top in the movie as it is edited for in previews. I think the movie was as fun as it was because of the great casting. No one else could have been Michael Douglas' character besides perhaps James Caan but he might have been too scary and NO ONE could have done Dupree like Owen Wilson because Dupree IS Owen Wilson. If you're like me and you like Owen Wilson movies you'll really enjoy this movie.PS There is a hush hush cameo in this movie when you least expect it and you'll laugh.".

First and foremost it's tedious. It has no real direction. Things happen and a few minutes later it doesn't matter that they've happened. You sit there and watch 108 minutes of meaningless witless anecdotes that involve the same people but have no real bearing on their lives.As far as the characters go they really aren't characters and they really don't go anywhere. We never learn how Carl and Molly met or why they love one another other than that they have sex a lot. Carl says stuff like Molly is the best thing that's ever happened to me but we see no proof of it. Dupree is a little eccentric but it's all been done before. I don't know anyone in real life who is as boring as the rest of the characters with the exception of Carl's fatherinlaw Mr. Thompson Michael Douglas. But neither Dupree nor Thompson perform with enough absurdity to make the movie work.The movie is too long and unfunny to be a comedy. And it's not that I'm opposed to body humor it's that the movie doesn't even try to be funny for huge segments. I laughed with the rest of them when Dupree broke up Carl and Molly's intimacy because of his emergency with the crapper. The movie needs more of that instead of trying to sustain drama and characters that aren't there.Once I felt that the movie was actually taunting me. Owen Wilson watches a clip from Roman Holiday a film starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. As he and I saw that clip I thought to myself Why am I not watching that?!

So why is it that when charged nearly ten dollars at a theater or more than five dollars at a video rental store to see a movie Hollywood in particular in addition to a lot of independent films these days does not deliver the same measures of quality in their own products? I have seen plenty of awful movies in the past two months of recent mainstream releases alone but this is quite possibly the first that I would have walked out on had I not paid so much money in the first place to see the movie. It was even more boring and bland than this year's remake of The Omen. You Me and Dupree is a collage of basically most movies you have probably already seen. The story centers on the Peterson newlyweds Carl and Molly Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson who's seemingly perfect introduction to the married life is turned upside down when Carl invites his downonhisluck but happygolucky friend Randy Dupree Owen Wilson in all standard form to stay with them until he lands on his feet. Needless to say aging Dupree is like a guy stuck in college bachelor mode while his best friend Carl has moved on. Imagine the potential for trouble. Add to the mix another problematic variable that Molly's father the President of the development company which Carl works for is trying very slowly to break the couple up. Things first go on the fritz for Dupree who then resolves for selfimprovement. Then of course Carl because of Molly's father doesn't seem like such an outstanding husband. And while Dupree seems like the model citizen now Carl becomes jealous. And their friendship is thrown into question and blah blah blah...add in the standard board room finale and faceoff with the fatherexecutive.Given that there are at least twenty movies just like this one that have been made in the past five years alone you're probably better off watching any number of those rather than wasting your time with this mess.".

Things first go on the fritz for Dupree who then resolves for selfimprovement. Then of course Carl because of Molly's father doesn't seem like such an outstanding husband. And while Dupree seems like the model citizen now Carl becomes jealous. And their friendship is thrown into question and blah blah blah...add in the standard board room finale and faceoff with the fatherexecutive.Given that there are at least twenty movies just like this one that have been made in the past five years alone you're probably better off watching any number of those rather than wasting your time with this mess.";

This movie was so painful to watch my date fell asleep in it i fell asleep in it most of the theatre was restless and laughter was non existent. The storyline.. well id bag it out but there is none. It is the worst conceived piece of tripe i have ever watched. Michael Douglas was totally useless in this movie and Kate Hudson was just there for eye candy. Her lines were lame and didn't consist of anything more than oh no and come on Spoilers so please beware What was the deal with not seeing Mandie in this film or Anna? Seriously? This movie was great for starting conversation on the way home between my date and I as we quickly and easily dissected this piece of garbage someone called a film. This has indeed prompted me to get out the old camcorder and make my own film. It may suck but at least I wont rip 15 out of your pocket to see it. Utter crap.".

In a comedy you don't really need to know how to act because people will laugh at the jokes and not the actor usually. Unless it's a really good actor and can just make the audience laugh by just them being on camera.The jokes are horrible. The movie didn't make me laugh except for maybe one time. They could have made the movie funny but they made it more into some stupid boring drama that people really wouldn't want to watch. I don't see why Owen Wilson would wanted to have casted in this piece of junk.Over all this movie was REALLY disappointing and I would recommend only seeing it if you liked the BreakUp or if you like drama movies where people fight and get angry without any comedy.".

Combine that with a god awful script from screenplay rookie Mike LeSieur and the same oldsame old lame basset hound loser manchild played ad nauseate by the now long in the tooth Owen Wilson and all the pieces come together for a ticking bomb.On top of that we can't help but wonder about the age difference between Dillon and Hudson as newlyweds. Unlike his role in There's Something About Mary Dillon plays pretty much the straight guy to Wilson's motel lounge quality comedian act. That said I am definitely looking forward to Dillon as Bukowski in the upcoming Factotum. Wilson needs to stick to writing or learn to accept much smaller roles. Hudson just needs better films. She is treading very close to becoming the female Matthew MacConoughy her costar in How to lose a guy in 10 days. That is not a good thing ... and I believe she is wasting her apparent talent.Michael Douglas Seth Rogen and Lance Armstrong provide the few laughs. Not even sure what to call this one. It is not funny enough to be a comedy and not romantic enough to be a RomCom. What I do know is that it is a BAD film.".

All I can say is after The Wedding Crashers and this I have one Christmas wish. Santa please let Owen Wilson's 15 minutes be up soon. I have to go...I can still hear the movie in the background and it made me puke in my mouth a little.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director R.G. Springsteen spent many years at Republic Pictures turning out efficient little B westerns and his expertise is evident in this crisp sharp little western. From around 1960 to about 1966 Universal churned out a stream of quickie westerns most of them runofthemill at best and lowgrade junk at worst. This tight little oater however falls into neither category. A cast of western veterans like Emile Meyer Ray Teal Dick Foran and the great Dan Duryea and a more than competent leading man in Tony Young combine with a good story and Springsteen's firm hand to make this one of the best B westerns to come out of Universal in that period. Young plays Taggart a man who gunned down the son of a powerful local rancher who led a gang that attacked his camp and murdered his parents. The dead son's dying father sends hired killers out to track down and kill Taggart. Fleeing through Apache territory he comes to the aid of an old man and his daughter defending their gold mine against rampaging Indians. Young reminds you of Gary Cooper in his early years although a bit more animated and it's a shame his career never really went anywhere as he's quite good in this he also shot another western around this time He Rides Tall and is equally as good in that one. Longtime cowboy actor Dick Foran plays the father and the gorgeous Jean Halewho years later married actor Dabney Colemanis his daughter. The story is interesting the scenery is pretty and Duryea isas alwaystremendous fun to watch. There's some sharp action although a good chunk of it is obvious stock footage from other westerns and things are resolved satisfactorilythough somewhat abruptlyat the end something that didn't always happen in Universal's westerns of the period. All in all a very watchable little B picture. You could do a lot worse than spending some time on this one.".

The two men wind up in an abandoned Spanish mission occupied by Adam Stark Dick Foran an older man with a young Mexican wife Consuelo Elsa Cardenas and a daughter from a previous marriage Miriam Jean Hale. The whole middle section of the film is essentially a fivecharacter drama. The Stark family has a secret one which compels hottotrot Consuelo to come on heavy first to Taggart and then after Taggart rebuffs her advances to Jason in the hopes that one of them will help her leave the mission with a cache of hidden wealth. An attack by rampaging Apaches complicates things. They all flee but not all together headed to a nearby fort for an actionpacked finale.The editors use lots of footage from other Universal color westerns including one with a cattle drive and one with Indian attacks on a wagon train and a cavalry fort. Even the long shots with the main characters riding against panoramic backdrops seem to be taken from other movies requiring the costumes in the new footage to match the previous footage. I wish I knew which westerns the footage came from. I've probably seen them but I'd love to see them again. Also the Spanish mission in which the Starks reside looks more like a hacienda to me. It's a bit of a stretch for the characters to call it a mission. Still it's an enjoyable western which moves well and is enacted by a cast of players who know how to make this kind of thing work all supervised by a director who's an old hand at this.Dan Duryea plays his character as quite talkative and gregarious rather unusual for such a greedy and coldblooded character. He doesn't display much charm so he never exactly fools anyone. It's a rather odd performance by the veteran heavy but it keeps the confrontations between him and the more stoic Taggart quite lively. Both Duryea and Dick Foran had been under contract to Universal Pictures back in the 1940s. They'd previously costarred in AL JENNINGS OF OKLAHOMA 1951 where they played brothers. David Carradine makes his debut here in a silent role as an illfated gunslinger. Elsa Cardenas is sexy and attractive in the femme fatale role. She only did a handful of films and TV episodes in Hollywood in the 1950s and '60s but instead spent most of her long career in her native Mexico starring in movies and TV novelas soap operas and evidently attaining a level of stardom she couldn't have gotten in Hollywood. She's apparently still active in Mexican television. Even so I wish she'd spent more time in Hollywood. I would love to have seen her in more westerns.Tony Young never managed to achieve much in the way of stardom and spent most of his career in TV guest spots and supporting roles in occasional feature films. He's quite good here boasting a deep soothing voice which could easily charm the ladies a tall frame that suited him well for westerns and a straightforward confident manner. With his dark good looks and heavylidded eyes he could have made a splash in Italian westerns like so many of his peers were doing in the 1960s and probably could have had a much bigger career as a result.".

Her range is amazing. She once again delivers a very powerful performance. In fact all of the actors were impressive. Shirley MacLaine's role is more than a cameo and she delivers. Randy Quaid was a pleasant surprise. In a role where he could easily have gone over the top he didn't. Azura Skye did a great job and had several very memorable moments. I look forward to seeing her again. The child actress chosen to play the young Carolina is an uncanny young version of Ms. Stiles. Along with the acting the dialog was consistently smart and sharp. Miramax should release and promote this film for no other reason than it contains some of the alltime great movie lines. Not every aspect or scene worked for me but most did. I enjoyed and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This straighttoDVD washout is an obnoxious cavalcade of stupidity accented by a circuslike musical score that gets louder every time the film gets extramoronic. Not only is it the kind of subRoseanne melodrama that gets drunk on portraying the utterly mundane as High Drama but it is swarming with clichs from the perpetually beaming game show host who's a jerk offcamera to the unkempt dog that makes a travesty of the big family dinner by jumping on the table to the protagonist who secretly attends a friend's bookreading from the back row only to learn that the book is about her. One of the first lessons I learned in creative writing class was that midscene entrances and exits of characters are signs of a desperate and uncreative author who shuffles the characters about when there is nothing worthwhile to have them say or do. It is no coincidence that Carolina has the most such entrances and exits I can recall seeing in one consecutive period of time no scene can evidently progress for thirty seconds without a new character entering or another stomping away or a door slamming or an elevator opening or a car pulling up as if the film is in the constant business of pretending that something is actually happening.Screenwriter Katherine Fugate based the tale on her own grandmother who raised three girls singlehandedly and while that level of selflessness is admirable it becomes difficult to believe when the fictional version is so aggressively repellent. One scene has her attending a cinema with her daughters in which she shouts at the characters in the film and opts to bring bowls of gumbo from her own kitchen rather than pay for popcorn then rises and berates the manager who comes to remove her. I can't tell if these behaviors were invented merely to give the scene conflict or if someone actually thought this material was funny but if the film's goal is to endear us to this colorful old grandma this scene like most others has the precise opposite effect.Shirley Maclaine and Julia Stiles's talents are wasted on a movie pitched at a thirteenyearold girl's perception of reality in which Stiles can portray a 21yearold television producer ! who goes unemployed for the better part of a year while living in a cavernous apartment and throwing expensivelooking formal parties. There's no use developing characters when the screenplay necessitates that they turn on a dime such as when Randy Quaid's character is chastised for being a lifelong drunk and then later is chastised for showing up late to a family event because he was at an AA meeting or when Mika Boorem's character obsesses for months over her lottery numbers to the point of hyperventilation then casually shrugs off the 24million jackpot when the numbers finally do come up because she's learned that the only important thing is that she was right about them all along. I've seen Cocoa Puffs commercials with more verisimilitude. Amateurish and Sheetrockstupid this torturous production is an early contender for the worst film of the decade. During some particularly cruel portions I was literally banging my head against my couch in a desperate struggle of wills to keep watching the movie despite every fiber of my soul crying out to make the agony stop. It's so many light years beyond Alone in the Dark in sheer godawfulness that John McCain is trying to pass a Constitutional amendment banning its practice. If you're a badmovie junkie who gets a rush from sitting through the most terrible movies ever made here's one you won't want to miss.".

I kept wanting to see her in some 1970's BBC drama where emotionless physically dull acting was more the rage.Azura Skye does a nice turn in the predictable role of the trashy sister who gets pregnant after a onenight stand. Randy Quaid and the rest of the cast practically disappear except to act as foils to MacLaine's outrageous tough lovelive life my own way Grandma.This is not great art or even great romantic comedy. You won't need to see it more than once. Watch it for MacLaine's performance and be ready to fluff your way through the rest!".

Some movies are not for thinking they're for watching and having fun! This is one of those movies... I enjoyed the family interaction  didn't seem canned or phony and the comedy throughout the film was capturing. I found myself waiting for the next shoe to drop. The best thing about this movie is that it actually held an ideal of family values that most movies these days seem to eager to forget about. Amazing Hollywood really CAN make a movie without much swearing and sex that is great fun to watch and also pass on a little life lesson in the process. I'd like to preface any comments with the fact that I liked this movie. It was a good watch and I really enjoyed it. I was never much of a Julia Stiles fan but after watching this one it's impossible not to love that girl oI can't stand the people on the international movie database that write these overanalytical Hollywood bt analyses so I'll keep this one simple and to the point Solid romantic plot fun dialog and interesting characters.I also had fun recognizing some of the people in this film who play lesser roles who are more notable from other moviestelevision shows i.e. Penny from Blue Crush Samara from The Ring Sarah from Save the Last Dance Stifler's mom from American Pie just to name a few. I don't want to brand any of these actors with these roles it's just that I'd find myself watching and go I know that person!I just finished seeing Carolina for the first time and my first impressions for this movie are good. I liked this movie for it's simplicity and well written monologues which entangle you in it's story line enough to take you through the entire movie. It's young cast is good enough to portray a somewhat lost teenager in what would be best described as small town U.S.A. All except for the sometimes over played but not this time feisty adventurous girl portrayed by Julia Stiles. I did though have a problem with the way the movie develops as it seems to leave as hanging awaiting for a and they lived happily ever after tag line but then again I guess that was implied in the movie itself. I'd definitely recommend it. I just finished watching it and I can't wait to see it again.This movie was not to sound cliche but a breath of fresh air. It was packed with goodnatured humor and real family values. It proved to put family before other things. This film had really no foul language or anything that made me shift in my seat while I wished my brother hadn't heard that. No this film was a comfortable funny and all around good movie for everyone. The ending could have been taken up a notch but you can't expect perfection. When we don't have to pay more than the price of a movie ticket to experience a wildly eccentric family then it's tons of fun. So first off yes I have to admit that the mere fact that the movie centers around an eccentric crazy weird family makes it enjoyable from the start. I was almost instanteously engaged until over halfway through the movie trying to keep track and with such a talented and diverse ensemble I enjoyed watching all of the development especially the Grandma Shirley MacLaine the woman who kind of tied the whole story together. They even found room for overrated stars as onenote characters among the others. I also think that underneath all the comedy there was a lot of moral value within the conflicts between and Carolina Julia Stiles and her family and all those people trying to tear it apart.Well that's all I got here...give it a watch o".

Here she plays another in a long line of eccentric characters. The problem is she is no longer in her 20s and can be cute and kooky as in The Apartment What a Way to Go! and Sweet Charity.Judging from the entire movie the movie script fails her as the script is terrible. However Ms. MacLaine has been in the movie business since 1955 and has appeared in a number of excellent movies so she at least could have made her role good in this bad movie. Nope. Not in this movie. Take for instance the scene where she talks to the screen in the movie theater and then harangues the young usher who comes to ask her to be quiet. Dreadful performance in a dreadful scene. It is also an unnecessary scene as we already know MacLaine's character is embarrassing to her granddaughters.Julia Stiles again plays a young uptight woman who needs to learn to loosen up. Ms. Stiles has acted since 1994 many years prior to this 2003 movie. She has experience playing this role before i.e. in 10 Things I Hate About You from 1999. Stiles also could have brought something interesting to her role here. She didn't.The characters in this movie were all eccentric characters who were one dimensional and annoying and not real at all.Stiles played an uptight woman who never had more than three dates with one person. Her best friend is man she has no women friends who lives near her apartment. He writes romance novels under a fake name has a crush on her and she has no idea. Duh. As the best male friend in movies is often stereotypically a gay man I initially thought he was gay. When he hired the gay housecleaning duo to clean her apartment I was sure he was gay. Speaking of the gay house cleaners talk about an offensive stereotype.Anyway her best friend is not gay and although he claims to understand her well and can predict she will act a certain way  and tells her so when she does act the way he knew she would he gets upset. Huh? All a plot device to have boy lose girl.I don't think Stiles MacLaine or most any of the actors cared for this movie. They must have been in it either because of an obligation or they needed the money.Watching this movie is a waste of time and I bet the actors wish they hadn't wasted their time making this movie.".

There were a few areas it lacked in one of the most notable was the ending which was as fractured as Carolina's family was. There were too many paths revealed without anything coming to fruition. There was also the possibility of more conflict which was implied by the families action which was never capitalized on. Apart from the fact that family stayed together it failed to show any other values you would hope from a family movie. Instead you see each person falling into the same mistakes that their parents had without truly overcoming anything.Overall it is very watchable but expect to be left with a few questions at the end.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes hard to take comedydrama about a too unbelievably eccentric family.";
	schema:reviewBody "Some films play the eccentricity card too much in their attempts to be different and from the moment you meet Shirley MacLaine's Grandma Millicent Mirabeau you will find yourself torn between whether or not you like her or find her a total pain in the butt. This wacky woman is her attempt to be Auntie Mame but she actually comes closer to Roz Russell's absurd mother in Oh Dad Poor Dad.... Whether locking herself in a dressing room over the fact that a sale on a VCR ended and asking her granddaughter for toilet paper! or constantly berating her grieving widowed son for neglecting his three daughters MacLaine takes every single eccentric character she's ever played and pulls an Emeril Takin' it up a notch! to create the first onscreen granny that needs a time out. Yes this grandmother can certainly say she lives life to the fullest using clichs like Two tacos short of a combination plate and You live and then you die to express her independent view of life. She's got a flashy wardrobe isn't afraid to express every element of her soul to the girls she is raising yet somehow seems more overmedicated than just feisty. And yet in spite of that you can't take your eyes off of her as if MacLaine was being possessed by the spirits of Bette Davis Katharine Hepburn Tallulah Bankhead or any other eccentric actress that had passed before her.If MacLaine's character does anything it is the fact that she exposes what the new generation gap has become. Today's youth besides taking themselves and life too seriously are afraid of living to the fullest walking in their own paths and trying new things in fear of rejection of a technology obsessed society. It shows that the rules have switched to where the young are seeming older than their youthful ages while the older folks are simply marching to their own drumbeat as if their evian bottles contained champagne rather than water. Take MacLaine's three granddaughters all named after states with the exception of the state of confusion all neurotic beyond reasonable belief. Oldest granddaughter Julia Stiles lives with a man that seems perfect for her yet they are only friends and he is unapologetically heterosexual. Apparently cool enough to grab two Cleaning Queens of West Hollywood to take care of an after Christmas dinner mess. Middle granddaughter Azura Skye is pregnant but in denial of who the father is while youngest Mika Boorem is obsessed with the lottery and dresses up provocatively to try to appear over 18 in order to buy a ticket. Needy messes all they defy likability in spite of loving their grandmother and just cause headscratching when trying to find one quality to even care about these character's lives.Ultimately there seems to be little point here other than showing the comedy of the absurd that reveals little warmth about identifying with a new generation in the Me! era. Alessandro Nivola is charming as Stiles' roommate and Edward Atterton has no real purpose in being there as the British date whom Stiles considers like an Italian suit she has no place to wear it to. Then Jennifer Coolidge as MacLaine's much younger Madame sister comes in serving no purpose other than to add more unappealing eccentricity into the convoluted mix. Randy Quaid is poorly treated as the troubled sonfather who gets bashed every time he shows up. No wonder he only comes around to drop off his newest offspring. So in retrospect this is a depressing view of family with comic and tragic elements on the other side of the railroad tracks where they obviously rode in on the BiPolar Express.".

Shirley MacLaine plays the role of Carolina's grandmother an irascible bold and bawdy woman who meets life head on with courage and defiance. No one could perform the part any better and I really can't imagine anyone else in the role. The tale is a love story involving Carolina her family and her best friend who adores her.The tale takes Carolina from childhood through early adulthood as she seeks balance in her life while looking for a normal guy. She thinks she has found one in the suave and debonair Heath Edward Atterton an Englishman who sweeps her off her feet only to disappoint her after meeting her eccentric family. Meanwhile in the background is her best friend Albert Allesandro Nivola who is secretly in love with her. The story contains comedy romance and pathos and will leave you satisfied. I didn't like the ending it could have been better written but the story is charming and entertaining and well worth watching if for no other reason than to enjoy the performance of Julia Stiles.".

Her love is what we are missing and keep losing in our new generations. But this firm also raised a interested question a debatable and arguable that acted by the grandmother. She shared her past romance with her granddaughters. She dated whoever he is marry or not whenever she needed. I always believe that there is a line for everyone to follow which is our mortal sense. Can we just go date a man without thinking his situation? Can we just not to worry about the consequence that will be taken by our children silently and normally that we finally realized we are setting a bad example for them? On the other hand as the actor mentioned live a little. That means life can be just that simple and easy. No need to setup a lots of rules to block us to enjoy everyday. But without following the rules we will not have a better view to examine ourselves what we are missing. It is difficult to maintain in the line but not be a prison of our mind. I've watched this movie over 20 times but not tired of it. It reminds me a lots and refreshes me the life style.".

Can we just not to worry about the consequence that will be taken by our children silently and normally that we finally realized we are setting a bad example for them? On the other hand as the actor mentioned live a little. That means life can be just that simple and easy. No need to setup a lots of rules to block us to enjoy everyday. But without following the rules we will not have a better view to examine ourselves what we are missing. It is difficult to maintain in the line but not be a prison of our mind. I've watched this movie over 20 times but not tired of it. It reminds me a lots and refreshes me the life style.";

	schema:reviewBody "As the movie opens we see a woman floating in the air surrounded by fog. It's not just a fantasy.  It's a performance by magician Antoine in Las Vegas.  Lorraine one of the performers has a 7yearold son named Albert who wants to be a magician.  The boy's father must have been a magician someone says because he disappeared.After Lorraine dies tragically there is no family to take care of him. Lorraine's coworkers think of Albert as family but they travel too much wonder why Lorraine didn't or if she did.  It is determined that Lorraine wanted Harriet Franklin to have Albert if anything happened. A flashback shows how Harriet a little black girl arrived at the foster home where Lorraine already lived.  The two became friends although this is not shown. When Harriet the owner of a restaurant supply business is contacted she gets upset.  No she doesn't want a child!  The usual reaction from a Whoopi Goldberg character  But Harriet remembers how good a friend Lorraine was and reluctantly agrees to take Albert.Harriet lives in Newark the only thing good about Newark is that it is close to Atlantic City where Albert's friends will soon perform so Albert must take a plane ride.  On the plane Albert is given a coloring book and one of the characters in the coloring book comes to life.  He is a French man who calls himself Bogus who only Albert can see or hear.  Throughout the movie people wonder who Albert is talking to.  But it seems Bogus is his only friend. Harriet doesn't want him and he doesn't bond with the other children.

	onyx:emotionText "As the movie opens we see a woman floating in the air surrounded by fog. It's not just a fantasy.  It's a performance by magician Antoine in Las Vegas.  Lorraine one of the performers has a 7yearold son named Albert who wants to be a magician.  The boy's father must have been a magician someone says because he disappeared.After Lorraine dies tragically there is no family to take care of him. Lorraine's coworkers think of Albert as family but they travel too much wonder why Lorraine didn't or if she did.  It is determined that Lorraine wanted Harriet Franklin to have Albert if anything happened. A flashback shows how Harriet a little black girl arrived at the foster home where Lorraine already lived.  The two became friends although this is not shown. When Harriet the owner of a restaurant supply business is contacted she gets upset.  No she doesn't want a child!  The usual reaction from a Whoopi Goldberg character  But Harriet remembers how good a friend Lorraine was and reluctantly agrees to take Albert.Harriet lives in Newark the only thing good about Newark is that it is close to Atlantic City where Albert's friends will soon perform so Albert must take a plane ride.  On the plane Albert is given a coloring book and one of the characters in the coloring book comes to life.  He is a French man who calls himself Bogus who only Albert can see or hear.  Throughout the movie people wonder who Albert is talking to.  But it seems Bogus is his only friend. Harriet doesn't want him and he doesn't bond with the other children.  An example  in one scene a magician is performing at a child's birthday party and Albert knows how the trick was done but when another child is scared Albert doesn't reassure her.  He just wonders silently how kids could be so dumb.  Albert doesn't try very hard to be happy with his situation while Harriet goes out of her way to help the boy and doesn't seem to be getting any reward.  Just lots of parking tickets.

In the movie Bogus we see one of these performances. What we should also mention is fine support from Whoopi Goldberg and a sublime Haley Joel Osment.Bogus is an interesting well acted and well crafted fantasy piece it is a story about the mind of a child and how this can cross over into a realadult world.This is a movie that could have easily missed it's intended mark with lesser actors and a less experienced director.

His few less years doesn't seem to take any of the talent from his performances.And he's a magician to boot.  I dabble in magic and was able to realize that none of the tricks he performed were trick photography or any other aid assisted.  Each one is deftly presented by Osment's own little hands.I on the other hand didn't watch this movies for Goldberg or Depardieu. I've never really like their movies with the exception  The Man in the Iron Mask for Depardieu and Ghost for Whoopi.  Ironically BOTH are very great movies.  That said these two actually did have great roles performances direction for this movie.  I found myself enjoying each of their performances.  Neither one took themselves too seriously and that was the magic.Overall a cute enjoyable and fun movie.  Especially for H.J. Osment fans. Cute kid.  810 pts.  2 taken for some difussion of the focus of the plot.P.S.  I just remembered I also like kind of 'Sister Act' and Whoopi's role on 'Star Trek TNG'.  I guess she's pretty good.  thank you.".

The two lived in Las Vegas where Mom was an assistant to a great magician and its the only life Albert has ever known. Alas there is no father in the picture. When the will is read everyone is astonished to learn that Albert's new guardian is New Jersey small businesswoman Harriet Whoopi Goldberg. It seems both Al's mother and Harriet were foster children together and formed a strong bond. On the other coast Harriet is also quite shook up this was far from what she was expecting. Her restaurant supply business takes up a great deal of her time and her small apartment in NewarK is not exactly kid friendly. Yet to honor a friend Harriet agrees to look after Albert. Very scared as he journeys by plane Albert is suddenly comforted by an imaginary friend Bogus Gerard Depardieu. Like true BFFs Bogus doesn't leave Albert's side as he adjusts to a new school a new home and a new life. But oh Albert is extremely smart and Harriet is going to have to keep close watch on him! Could Albert being sad at his changes suddenly take off with Bogus? This charming family film has a great cast of course. What an unlikely treat it is to have Goldberg and Depardieu as the leads its a strange but dynamite coupling. Osment too in one of his first big roles is very touching and clever. Naturally the desert scenery of Nevada and the urban Jersey is a big contrast. Viewers will like the costumes polished script and sure direction. All in all this is not a bogus view in the least. Kids and families will adore Bogus!".

Albert lost his mother in an accident and is left in the care of Whoopi Goldberg who claims to have no time for children. Soon Gerard Depardieu appears in the form of Bogus. He is fun and listens to him. This bewilders Goldberg who questions the boy's behavior after strange occurrences. Bogus is obviously there to unite the two. Not so much about imaginary friends as it is about recovering from loss but for something advertised as a comedy it plainly isn't very funny. Director Norman Jewison used these elements before in Moonstruck and Only You with fine visual elements. Goldberg holds her own in the role of caregiver unable or unwilling to participate but as formulas go she will let down her guard. As Bogus Depardieu proves to have great comic energy despite a role unworthy of his talent. Haley Joel Osment as Albert is the best casting coping with loss using imagination and adapting to Goldberg. Nancy Travis plays his mother with an interesting back story but untimely death. While the visual elements are okay perhaps parents should view it before making it a family night deal. Strong theme of childhood healing within a totally bogus screenplay. Score 5   10".

	schema:reviewBody "ONCE UPON A TIME there were different types of movies. These different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer....This seems obvious at first but I thought I'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. It doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander. People who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture literally. After all Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife wWhitney Houston are 2 examples that spring to mind.First I'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda Manon Lescaut and Turandot but also sings popular music such as I left my heart in San Francisco and the song that was nominated for an Oscar  Golden Globe If we were in Love wmusic by John Williams  lyrics by Alan  Marilyn Bergman all 3 previous Oscar winners.The story isn't that bad. It was built for Pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. It's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again at the same place the MET in NYC he loses his voice from fear. Doctor Pamela or PahMAYlah in Italian played by Kathryn Harrold gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts.They embark on an affair she knowing he's married  promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman. Despite all that they fall in love thus the song IF we were in love and with her help he overcomes his fear  goes back to the MET where he triumphs. I won't tell how it ends but it's fairly predictable. Which isn't always a bad thing. The performances in this aren't that bad. Pavarotti who plays Giorgio Fini isn't an actor so if you're expecting a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance YOU are deluded not Pavarotti. He knows he's not a thespian. What he is is cute charming  charismatic. He is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too it's not so bad. One funny line is when he tells Pamela Harrold that she's a thirsty plant Fini can water you! and of course she says I don't want to be watered on by Fini! Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semiuptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is Life never has to be life size. And there's Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Fini's manager. There are several themselves cameos by real conductors singers etc. and it is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. If you like opera if you like Pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go  enjoy a little fling just like he proposes in the movie  then you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do EVERY time. ".

In a restaurant setting Pavoratti's character takes his date into a fancy expensive dining establishment. He has rented the entire restaurant and they are dining alone in a huge room with musicians playing for them alone.The girl comments about how odd it is to be dining in such an enormous room without other diners present.I won't spoil it for you by giving his quote that makes this scene so wonderful. He says something that is one of my all time favorite movie quotes.He is a charming personality and I would have liked for him to make other film appearances.

Who cares what his acting abilities were he basically just played himself which was adorable. He was so charming so charismatic I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. It was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions.

	schema:reviewBody "By my KoolAid drinkers remark I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film. Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!!! When this film debuted I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as No Giorgio and some said it was among the worst films ever made. This is definitely overstating it as well. While bad and far from a great work of art there was a lot to like about the film and the movie's biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth.Believe it or not the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers who I believe were chimps. It is rare to see a movie with such clichd dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight but even they aren't the heart of the problem. The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middleaged man and a seemingly desperate lady. Perhaps European audiences might be more forgiving of this but in the United States in 1982 or today such a romance seems sleazy and selfishespecially when Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and this is just fun. Wow talk about romantic dialog!! Sadly if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films such as from ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO or THE SUSPECT where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her. Instead she's the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and leftas Pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting Harrold.Sadly even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti couldn't save this film. Towards the end of the film there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible and Pavarotti's singing transcendent. For that reason I think the movie at least deserves a 3. I really wanted to like the film more but it was a truly bad filmthough not quite as rotten as you might have heard.Sadly from what I have read this film might be a case of art imitating life as Pavarotti's own life later had some parallels to this film though this isn't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail.".

Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents oftentimes an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. Yes Georgio permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable I don't agree. Enormously talented people can be both selfcentered and charming  charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. Additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities.

	schema:reviewBody "Judging from what was said about 'Yes Giorgio' at the time of its release this reviewer was expecting utter rubbish and a film bad enough to be among the worst films ever made.Finally watching it as a singer myself a lifelong opera enthusiast and as someone who likes Luciano Pavarotti very much 'Yes Giorgio' is not a great film or even a good one. However to me it was not that bad. Taken for what it is which is essentially a vehicle for Pavarotti it's okay with some huge flaws but also enough charms to make it worth a onetimeonly watch.Starting with the positives 'Yes Giorgio' is beautifully shot and contains some positively gorgeous scenery particularly towards the end. The music which contains operatic favourites Nessun Dorma Puccini's 'Turandot' Una Furtiva Lagrima Donizetti's 'L'Elsir D'Amore' Cielo e Mar Ponchielli's 'La Gioconda' and La Donna e Mobile Verdi's 'Rigoletto' and popular classical songs Ave Maria the Schubert version and O Sole Mio is enough to transcend even nonopera fans to heaven while the charming music score and the justly Oscarnominated If We Were in Love complement beautifully.Pavarotti as ever sounds absolutely glorious throughout the whole duration of 'Yes Giorgio'. All the operatic arias especially Nessun Dorma and La Donna e Mobile Una Furtiva Lagrima is also quite heartfelt suit him perfectly as do Ave Maria and O Sole Mio his endearing personality too shines. Eddie Albert gives his usual solid performance he's understated but looks as if he's having fun too. Although Pavarotti is the thing that people will remember Albert gives the best overall performance in the film.Unfortunately although Pavarotti sounds glorious and there is no doubting that he has a personality that radiates his acting which admittedly with some exceptions never was a strength of his looks awkward and the amount of preparation and polish that went into the singing doesn't translate in the line delivery. He surprisingly although he was not the best of actors he always did have a charming rapport with his leading ladies shares very little chemistry with the female lead Kathryn Harrold or at least not a very natural or obviously amorous one. The romance is not very well written being contrived and cloying and Harrold's unbearably obnoxious performance is an even larger part of the problem her character being written and performed in a way that makes one wonder what did Pavarotti's character see in her.The script has some sweet and amusing moments but too many forced and nauseatingly sugary ones as well. The romantic dialogue was particularly squirminducing so much so it beggars belief how it was approved beyond first draft. With the story the predictability with a very oldfashioned premise that worked just fine before with the right execution but not so much now isn't the issue but the erratic pacing and thin structure were issues and even worse was that it felt more an excuse to string along arias and classical favourites to show off Pavarotti's voice and talents. Sure the Mario Lanza films can be seen as guilty of this too but the acting was more consistent in those films with better leading ladies and while the stories were among the weaker assets of most they were handled with more charm and emotion and easier to relate to never did they feel exploitative in the way 'Yes Giorgio' sometimes did. With the acting the only really consistently good performance came from Albert the rest of the supporting roles are underwritten and the rest of the performers can't do anything with the material.Overall okay for what it is and not as bad as its reputation but at the same time not particularly great or good. 510 Bethany Cox".

The romantic dialogue was particularly squirminducing so much so it beggars belief how it was approved beyond first draft. With the story the predictability with a very oldfashioned premise that worked just fine before with the right execution but not so much now isn't the issue but the erratic pacing and thin structure were issues and even worse was that it felt more an excuse to string along arias and classical favourites to show off Pavarotti's voice and talents. Sure the Mario Lanza films can be seen as guilty of this too but the acting was more consistent in those films with better leading ladies and while the stories were among the weaker assets of most they were handled with more charm and emotion and easier to relate to never did they feel exploitative in the way 'Yes Giorgio' sometimes did. With the acting the only really consistently good performance came from Albert the rest of the supporting roles are underwritten and the rest of the performers can't do anything with the material.Overall okay for what it is and not as bad as its reputation but at the same time not particularly great or good. 510 Bethany Cox";

What's not to like about this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti Fini was at his best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts  the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful  so was the song he sang If we were in love one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English. And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous. Get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold  Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!".

But the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful Mario Lanza movies...just to hear the voice of the star in this case Pavarotti in his prime. Okay so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing Luciano. That alone is worth watching the movie. A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds humility and love along the way and belts out a lot of hit numbers too.I must admit I'm prejudiced on a number of levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big Pavarotti fan is there anything about Pavarotti that isn't big including his fan base?. And when I first saw this movie I was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of Life's possibilities and in love for the first time. So as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again.Yes it's corny and awful. But the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what it's all about. So I give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone. Like Italian food that you've never tried before try it! You may be pleasantly surprised as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep.".

The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti and this one isn't one of them. Just get one of his many superb opera or vocalconcert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. However effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In summertime in Manhattan the plain and average Richard Sherman Tom Ewell sends his wife and son for vacation in the country. Sherman is the key man of a publishing firm Brady  Company which publishes cheap pocket books. The faithful Sherman has a routine life with his family and dreams on being successful with women. When a beautiful and sexy blonde lodges the upstairs apartment of his small building Sherman first opens the front door for her and then he invites her to have a drink with him after the fall of her tomato vase on his chair on the backyard. Along the days he spends some time with the girl and feels tempted by her but later he misses his family and travels to meet them.The Seven Year Itch is a naive and innocent romantic comedy in accordance with the contemporary moral standards but actually this feature tested the limits of censorship in a time when Hollywood was ruled by a rigid moral code. The story is based on a George Axelrod popular 1952 Broadway play about a man that has an affair with his upstairs neighbor. Unfortunately in the 50's the American cinema did not have the same artistic freedom as theater. The screenplays and movies were submitted to the scrutiny of the powerful Hayes office the censorship of Hollywood. There was a Production Code in Hollywood that stated that adultery should not be the subject of comedy or laughs and this story violated the Code. Billy Wilder was fascinated by this story and purchased the rights of George Axelrod. However to make the movie was a challenge for this great director since many scenes and lines were ripped away by the censorship and by the National Legion of Decency mutilating the plot.Marilyn Monroe was selected to the cast but Billy Wilder wanted a plain average and nonhandsome actor for the role of Sherman. His first choice was Walter Matthaus but Fox direction did not want to take the risk of an unknown lead actor therefore they selected Tom Ewell. The most famous scene of Marilyn Monroe with her dress being lifted by the air of the subway was first an exterior scene but later Billy Wilder needed to shot again in the set because the noise and whistles of the viewers spoiled the original footage. This external scene also provoked the end of the marriage of Marilyn with Joe Dimaggio who felt humiliated with the manifestation of the public.One dialog that I particularly like is when Sherman and the blonde leave the movie theater and she says that the creature needed to be loved in an analogy between Sherman and the creature of the black lagoon. The restored DVD is fantastic and this is the most sexually suggested role of Marilyn Monroe to date. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Pecado Mora ao Lado The Sin Lives on the Next Door".

	onyx:emotionText "In summertime in Manhattan the plain and average Richard Sherman Tom Ewell sends his wife and son for vacation in the country. Sherman is the key man of a publishing firm Brady  Company which publishes cheap pocket books. The faithful Sherman has a routine life with his family and dreams on being successful with women. When a beautiful and sexy blonde lodges the upstairs apartment of his small building Sherman first opens the front door for her and then he invites her to have a drink with him after the fall of her tomato vase on his chair on the backyard. Along the days he spends some time with the girl and feels tempted by her but later he misses his family and travels to meet them.The Seven Year Itch is a naive and innocent romantic comedy in accordance with the contemporary moral standards but actually this feature tested the limits of censorship in a time when Hollywood was ruled by a rigid moral code. The story is based on a George Axelrod popular 1952 Broadway play about a man that has an affair with his upstairs neighbor. Unfortunately in the 50's the American cinema did not have the same artistic freedom as theater. The screenplays and movies were submitted to the scrutiny of the powerful Hayes office the censorship of Hollywood. There was a Production Code in Hollywood that stated that adultery should not be the subject of comedy or laughs and this story violated the Code.

	schema:headline " A Fabulously Funny FastPaced Sex Farce From The Fifties...It's Just Elegant!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch directed by Billy Wilder is one of the most amusing sex farces ever filmed. Starring Tom Ewell and Marilyn Monroe and based on George Axelrod's play the film takes a humorous look at the problems of a typical middleaged married man. Tom Ewell and unassuming leading man with a flair and talent for comedy is perfectly cast in this movie. Ewell plays the part of Richard Sherman an average middledaged man of the 50's...office worker city inhabitant with a loving wife and one son. He is left alone in the city for the entire summer while his family vacations in Maine. All is well until Mr. Sherman meets the beautiful blonde who rents the apartment above his for the summer. They soon get to know each other and become friends over champagne potato chips and a Rachmaninoff record. Their friendship causes Mr. Sherman to worry that his wife will find out about his relationship with the blonde bombshell. With his overactive imagination Mr. Sherman dreams up numerous situations concerning this young woman as well as his wife. Although his imagination causes Mr. Sherman much worry it provides many of the film's most memorable and enjoyable scenes. Of course the film is famous for the scene of Monroe standing over the subway grate which has always been a classic movie scene. Monroe although unnamed in the film gives one of her best screen performances which is just elegant as she says throughout the movie. She displays a talent for comedy as well as beauty which should not be overlooked. Ewell's portrayal of Richard Sherman is delightful hilarious and perfect. His facial expressions and comedic timing contribute to the film's enjoyability. Along with these stars the supporting cast is excellent as well. It includes such character actors as Robert Strauss Mr. Kruhulik the janitor and Donald MacBride Mr. Brady Richard Sherman's boss. The Seven Year Itch is one of the ultimate 50's pop culture films. And since it was filmed in Cinemascope it would be perfect to see on the big screen. Any fan of Monroe Wilder old movies or 50's culture would enjoy this movie I strongly recommend it. The comedy timing acting and direction are flawless...and they all help to make The Seven Year Itch just elegant!".

I've been trying to watch as many as her films as possible lately ever since a study of Photography at college found me researching the icon of the silver screen. The good news is for me is that there was plenty of Marilyn to enjoy in this classic comedy. I was pleased to find that she is supported by a good cast and a very funny script and the film on the whole is a real winner. There were several laugh out loud moments for me and considering my young age and the fact this is a film from the 1950's I would say that's something pretty impressive. For me though the reason the film was great has to be Ms. Monroe. She is just simply stunning and elegant in this movie A word her character very much likes to use!. She really captures the audiences heart as The Girl and it's not hard to see why Tom Ewell's character fell for her obvious charms  she is just a sheer delight in the film.A sequence which I found totally hilarious was that in which Ewell's character imagines a variety of heated liaisons with various women in his life  all of them supposedly throwing themselves at him. The way in which he and the women deliver the lines  in a classic deadpan fashion had me almost crying with laughter. Really hilarious stuff. And that's not even mentioning the glorious skirtoversubway scene. This is a film to watch and fall in love with. You'll really enjoy it if you like Marilyn you want to laugh you're looking for a warm movie to just relax to and you're interested in cinema history and classic Hollywood. A great film for so many people  rent it and enjoy!".

Legendary screenwriter and director Billy Wilder spearheads this movie and that promises a lot and it doesn't live up to the expectations. There were a few outright laughs it mostly made me smile a little. With Sherman's obsessing it almost gets a little brooding instead.It does bear watching though if nothing else for one famous scene where Marilyn Monroe steps out on the grating above the subway and her dress blows up around her legs. It's fun to have seen the original seen that has been copied and parodied countless times since.But at almost two hours running it is not really good enough to really carry itself.

It packs a topdrawer duo protagonist  Marylyn Monroe and Tom Ewell  and a splendid secondary cast formed by a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations . When his family  wife Evelyn Keyes and son  goes away for the summer a so far faithful husband Tom Ewell is tempted by a beautiful neighbor Marilyn Monroe  a blonde model who moves upstairs . Understandably he gets itchy . Soon  the known but abortive relationship with his blond neighbor and his wolfish dreams coming to nothing in the face of her ingeniousness and his own ineptitude . Rightly enjoyable and funfilled  milestone comedy which neatly combines humor  mirth  entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun  laughters and smiles . This is the funniest comedy since laughter began  it is mordantly funny and todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Twentieth Century Fox happy  the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a duo of sensational protagonists  including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever  she tickles and tantalizes . Adding  of course  the funniest sequences of all being those in which Monroe's blown skirt and those in which Tom Ewell dreams as the great lover .Despite being one of the most iconic images in pop culture history as well as one of the most recognizable photographs of Marilyn Monroe the famous fulllength image of Monroe standing with her dress being blown up never actually appears in the film  the shot used in the film is only of her legs cut with reaction shots and never shown fulllength. The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting . Magnificent performance from Tom Ewell as an angstridden fortyyearsold husband left alone while his spouse go off on holiday . Tom Ewell won the 1953 Tony Award for Actor in a Drama for The Seven Year Itch in the role of Richard Sherman which he reprised in this film . Furthermore  an attractive support cast giving appealing interpretations such as Robert Strauss  Oscar Homolka  Carolyn Jones  Sonny Tuffs and Evelyn Keyes . This sexy motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as Ninotchka  Ball of fire  making their film debut as such with Major and the minor .

	schema:headline " A Dated Sophisticated Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Contains SpoilersHollywood's moral code in the fifties meant that sex comedies in the sense that we would understand the term today did not exist. Sophisticated' comedies about divorce and adultery with all the action taking place strictly offstage were about as close as anyone ever got. This film is a typical example of that style of filmmaking. It is set in Manhattan during a summer heatwave. The leading male character Richard Sherman has sent his wife and son to escape to the cooler mountains of New England but he himself has to remain in town as July is a busy time at the publishing firm for which he works. The flat above his has been rented by an attractive young model whose name we never actually learn. When Sherman meets her he spends most of his time in attempts to seduce her interspersed with panic attacks at the thought of his wife finding out.With its small cast of characters and action largely confined to a single flat it clearly betrays its origins as a stage play. I have never seen the play on which it is based but I was interested to learn that the play is actually more explicit in that the two main characters do have a sexual relationship. The theatre of this period was clearly more liberal about sexual matters than the cinema in America at least. In Britain the Lord Chamberlain's Office which governed theatrical censorship was quite as puritanical as its cinematic equivalent the British Board of Film Censors. Despite this change of emphasis the filmed version works well in its own right. Sherman becomes less a middleaged lecher than a middleaged fantasist. He fantasises about women not because he wants to sleep with them his fantasies generally end with him fighting the woman off amid protestations that he is a happily married man but because his ego gets a boost from the thought that he is handsome charming and irresistible. He pursues Marilyn Monroe's character not because he has any cause for dissatisfaction with his wife or any serious thoughts about divorce but because approaching his fortieth birthday he needs reassurance that he is still attractive to women.Although Tom Ewell is witty and amusing as Sherman it is Marilyn Monroe who steals the film as she normally did. Now this may seem like heresy to many but Marilyn was not the most beautiful woman ever. She was not even the most beautiful actress of the fifties several others such as Audrey Hepburn Grace Kelly Elizabeth Taylor or Brigitte Bardot had more classically perfect features. What Monroe could do like no other actress of her time and like very few who have come since was to combine sex appeal with wideeyed innocence. Her character in this movie is a fine example of this. Sherman falls for her precisely because she is not only pretty but also young and nave the sort of girl her can exercise his charms on without creating any real threat to his marriage. This is a film about flirtation not about serious longterm relationships so it does not matter that the girl is the typical Hollywood dumb blonde'. Monroe was perfect for the role if virtually any other actress had been cast in it including any of those mentioned above the result would have been a very different film. There are also some amusing cameo roles from Oskar Homolka as a Germanic psychiatrist from Robert Strauss as the loud pushy janitor and from Donald MacBride as Sherman's cynical boss.Although the film must originally have seemed sophisticated and daring fifty years later it is somewhat dated and now seems tame and lightweight. Even the famous scene where Marilyn Monroe stands above the subway grating is much less revealing than popular legend or the film's reputation might have you believe. When I say that a film is dated' I do not necessarily mean that one cannot today watch it with pleasure but rather that it is an example of an older style of filmmaking that it would not be possible to recreate today. Indeed a film of this type would probably have been impossible at any period after the midsixties.  There is still much in The Seven Year Itch' that is worth watching but it no longer seems as fresh or as funny as it probably did when it was first released. It has not lasted as well as Monroe's other famous collaboration with Billy Wilder Some Like It Hot'. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Something that irritates me about the IMBD is that if you criticise a movie that was made before 1980 a truckload of idiots send you messages telling you how much you hate old movies.  Let me say right away I don't.  I like films from pretty much every era of cinema that I've had the chance to see but having had common sense recently installed I've come to realise that age doesn't automatically make a movie great just as modernity doesn't automatically make a movie bad.So bearing in mind that I'm talking about this one movie and not every movie made in the 1950s The Seven Year Itch is as average as they come. The minimal plot sees Tom Ewell's summer bachelor' trying to resist the charms of neighbour Marilyn Monroe while his wife and son are shipped off for the season.  Very obviously adapted from a play there are few characters few sets and even fewer laughs.  That it succeeds at all is due to the charm of the leads and the occasional good joke that sneaks its way into the script.The film's main problem comes in how it tells its story.  First it depends on Ewell constantly talking to himself babbling on endlessly about what he's doing what he might do what he's never done and what other people will think he's doing done and about to do.  Secondly he is constantly daydreaming the film constantly dissolving into one of his fantasies that are unfortunately no funnier than reality.  If you find this storytelling approach irritating as I did the film's potential is lost immediately.You'll no doubt be shocked to learn that in this film Marilyn Monroe is cast as a dumb blonde.  Most people in the world seem to immediately pitch a trouser tent at the thought of Norma Jean but I can't say I count myself among them.  The problem with a dumb blonde is that she's dumb so to find her attractive you have to be attracted to stupidity.  I'm not so it doesn't matter how much she pouts or how often we're treated to shots of her hourglass figure she's as thick as a lobotomised footballer and therefore unattractive.  She's basically got the personality and intelligence of a six year old and not being Gary Glitter I can't say that appeals to me.A comedy with few laughs a sex symbol who doesn't float my boat and a classic that just doesn't do it for me.  I guess there's another bunch of snide messages coming my way.".

	schema:reviewBody "After sixteen wonderful pictures I didn't think that Billy Wilder could do wrong. However after lulling me into a false sense of security the director then delivered a right hook to my jaw leaving me dazed confused and with a splitting headache. As melodramatic as that sounds I really did spend last night with a niggling feeling of discomfort in my brain as though I'd been unexpectedly betrayed by an old friend. 'The Seven Year Itch 1955' has the best of intentions and it showcases sexicon Marilyn Monroe in one of her most alluring roles but overall it just doesn't work by the end of the film I found myself more than a little exasperated. The screenplay was adapted from George Axelrod's popular 1952 threeact play of the same name which Wilder apparently liked to such that he prophetically included an allusion to it in his 'Sabrina 1954.' Whether or not film censorship played a role in diluting the director's true vision all I can say is that I am decidedly disappointed.A stairway to nowhere! I think that's just elegant. So says The Girl Marilyn Monroe when she notices the lowbudget fashion in which a formerduplex has been converted into two separate apartments. This is exactly how I feel about this film it's a stairway to nowhere. The story starts off with definite promise as a middleaged husband Tom Ewell says farewell to his beloved family for the summer and must fight the urge to misbehave in their absence oh no not me! that means no drinking no smoking and no women. Oh what glorious temptations Wilder could have flung in this man's path! Unfortunately this is where the story's foundations in theatre come into play. Just as the story promises to get interesting it stumbles into an inescapable rut and everything suddenly stagnates the running time prolonged through frustratinglypointless monologues and imagined conversations. Ewell's neurotic overreacting funny at first becomes grating and I couldn't wait until he rid himself of that socalled Seven Year Itch.That there are shafts of light beaming into this dark tunnel is a welcome reassurance to this keen Wilder fan. The casting of Marilyn Monroe is perfect bringing a sex appeal that was unrivalled by even the finest beauties of her time. Young lively and naive The Girl accepts Richard Sherman's awkward advances as just another daily occurrence frequently mistaking his obvious lust for simple neighbourly kindness. That imaginative money shot above the New York subway is justly iconic and probably most fully defines Monroe's screen persona even though Wilder would utilise her to even greater effect in 'Some Like It Hot 1959' four years later. Despite my general dissatisfaction with the screenplay there are nonetheless a few great lines of dialogue many delivered by Oskar Homolka as the straightshooting psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker At fifty dollars an hour all my cases are interesting!. Remarkably 'The Seven Year Itch' was a considerable boxoffice success something I can't quite understand considering the failure of some of his most impressive pictures. Sorry Billy  I guess nobody's perfect after all.".

Ted Danson is an unlikable jerk his two moron loser friends make Marv and Harry look like road scholars and the music is fingernails on a chalkboard obnoxious.

If you took out the dumb slapstick all this would be is a cringe worthy father son after school special. After a lot of stinkers this was obviously the straw that broke Macaulay's back. I can imagine him jumping up in happiness when that's a wrap was finally uttered. I can also imagine Ted Danson wandering back to TV grateful to still be alive.Maybe the reason this movie annoys the hell out of me was it was that we watched the VHS copy of it about 200 times at our holiday house as it was one of the few kids movies on the shelf.

	schema:reviewBody "The title was very familiar to me and it sounded like the kind of film that the young star of Macaulay Culkin would be in so I was interested to see whether the concept would be from director Howard Deutch The Whole Ten Years. Basically Raymond 'Ray' Gleason Three Men and a Baby's Ted Danson is planning a coin heist with his two accomplices Robert 'Bobby' Drace Saul Rubinek and Carl Gailard Sartain so he can buy a bakery but he has a surprise visitor. His son Timmy Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin has been living with Ray's sister including while he was in prison and he wants to a get to know his father better but obviously this is inconvenient. The thieves manage to pull off the heist and get the valuable coins and Timmy finds out about it and he uses it to his advantage by taking and hiding the coins in order to con his father. Ray has to spend time with his son in order to get the coins back this includes trips to a swimming park a mini golf course and meals out and for a while this is getting on his nerves but actually over time the father is getting closer to and finding admiration for his son. Meanwhile the police are also trying to find the coins and catch the gang out with Detective Theresa Walsh Glenne Headly going undercover to get close to the main man and unintentionally falling for him. Eventually Timmy finds that he cannot change his father's ways and he offers him the choice of the coins back or staying with his son and thankfully he chooses his son but the locker the coins are in are opened and he ends up arrested. In the end though the bag is full of loose change the real coins are returned to the authorities and Timmy and Ray go on to have a close fatherson relationship. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Lt. Romayko Sam McMurray as Alex Sydney Walker as Mr. Wankmueller and Kathleen Wilhoite as Kitty. Culkin does his usual mischievous and more clever than the adults character as well as being a little spoilt and he has a silly hairdo Danson also has a slightly daft pony tail he gives a good annoyed performance I will agree that the father's thieving partners are the ones that get a little more punishment I hoped for more slapstick stuff it was an easy to swallow but hardly worth the effort family comedy.

One wonders how his characters like Kevin McAlister or in this case Timmy Gleason fared in school with classes like calculus physics and trigonometry requiring more booksmart level thinking. It's one thing to build an amateur trap it's another being able to explain why the trap works and how it is triggered.Getting Even With Dad marked Macaulay Culkin's last project for six years before appearing in a film adaptation of the stage play Madame Melville. His downfall could be attributed to many things but Culkin was fourteen during the time of this film already growing out of his cutekid appearance and becoming more of an adult as well as Getting Even With Dad's extremely poor box office performance after the kid was proved to be a solid cashgrab with two Home Alone projects. Even with this film Culkin shows a certain tiredness to doing the same old schtick with little reward.The film revolves around his character Timmy whose mother died some years ago and who has been living with his aunt and her fiance since the event. Planning to marry and get Timmy out of her hair the aunt decides to drop Timmy off at his biological father's house where both can meet each other and Timmy can have a place to stay. Timmy's dad turns out to be a pettycon by the name of Ray Gleason Ted Danson who is plotting with two amateur cronies Bobby and Carl Saul Rubinek and Gailard Sartain to steal a collection of rare coins. It is only obligatory that Timmy is smarter than all three of these cons put together so when the gang actually do find the coins he'll hide them in order to squeeze more quality time out of his father than he's willing to give and also maybe have his hand at nudging a little romance in his direction on the side.Getting Even With Dad is the classic case of a film biting off more than it can chew. The film tries to mesh themes of crime romance fatherandson bonding slapstick comedy and sentimentalist drama all into and it barely succeeds as a film detailing fatherandson bonding. It makes not knowing your father and then coming across him when you discover he's a petty crime out to be another instance to practically laugh off rather than one to be deeply upset about. Writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein who also wrote the other Macaulay Culkin showcase of the same year Rihie Rih as well Major League II had a golden opportunity to explore the sadness and the neglect of a father not being there for his son during crucial developmental years and then not even making a good toolittletoolate effort that I believe kids would've responded to much more than the mashup of cheesy themes we got with the end product of Getting Even With Dad.The film was directed by Howard Deutch who was responsible for directing both of John Hughes' screenplays Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful as well as other products such as the charming Great Outdoors and The Odd Couple II. Deutch's directing style has never been one to praise for its uniqueness but even in projects such as The Odd Couple II he always seemed to manage to squeeze something out of his performers and his crew. Here however there's little he can do to liven a slumping screenplay with too many different themes to tackle adequately.Starring Macaulay Culkin Ted Danson and Glenne Headly. Directed by Howard Deutch.".

He actually looked great with that long hair.Despite having in my opinion the most famous scream in film history here Mac never screams. But he shows his beautiful smile as in other films. He could have had future as an actor if his personal life hadn't become the mess it was.The movie is by no means a copy of 'Home Alone' but some of its ideas have a certain similarity to those films  mostly the fact that Macaulay Culkin plays a character who outsmarts the crooks in this case 3 instead of 2.This is not a bad film but it's nothing great either. It's mediocre. It's only really worth for Macaulay Culkin. In fact I only recommend it to fans of Macaulay Culkin. Mac as usual is great but aside him no one else has particularly good actings in this film.As for the crooks Bobby is the worst of the three. He is way more aggressive than the others  and he has a sick sense of humor such as when he grabs a rat. Carl is harmless comparing to the others  he's more of a poor devil than anything else and unlike Bobby he hesitates before doing anything and seems to redeem himself at the end.Despite being a relatively poor film it has its good moments such as Mac dancing at the sound of the great song 'Do you love me?' from the movie 'Dirty Dancing'. Also being a car lover I've gotta say this I love that car which Mac has a ride in the beginning  a 1959 Cadillac Eldorado. That is one heck of a car!".

This is a perfect encapsulation of the film as a whole a beautiful mixture of journey and dream.  The film is ostensibly a documentary that holierthanthou genre convinced of its own superior truthfulness.  And the film is full of documentary images snapshots from the faraway places Marker visits Japan Africa South America San Francisco Iceland Paris.  The film is full of the observations of the filmmaker about the cultures he observes.But 'Sans Soleil' couldn't soar further from the prosaic ambitions of the documentary.  Like the film it most resembles Marker's own 'La Jetee' it is in fact a work of science fiction as much about time travel as literal travel.  Each place Marker visits is stripped of its familiarity and made eerie alien.  Concrete images become springboards for dizzy philosophical speculations.  The film moves with ease from the court of 11th century Imperial Japan to the revolutionary struggles in 1960s Africa to emus on the Ile de France to an interpretation of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' to astrological rumination on a desert beach and still remains thematically coherent and full of the most startling connections.It is this structure that creates the feel of science fiction the linking of seemingly disparate images symbols stories experiences places to create a strange pattern which emanates something spiritual that seems to make sense of increasing chaos dislocation displacement.  But we are constantly reminded that these are secular manmade adhoc arbitrary constructions as phantom as the relationship in 'La Jetee' but similarly a necessary construction to cover the abyss.  The distortion of the soundtrack the mixture of silence and mooged classics the computer visuals of Marker's friend known as The Zone which seep conventional representational images and turn them into ghosts traces stripped of history recognisability humanity the film's fictional framework the narrative comprises letters to the narrator by the filmmaker Sandor Krasna all add to this unsettling science fiction appropriation of the documentary genre.When the history of cinema  comes to be written in centuries to come there will really only be two films that will survive from its first century films dense supple playful renewable enough and full of enough possibilities for future direction to transcend the local the generic the pretentious the narrative.  One is that final gasp of modernist cinema 'Vertigo' the other is this epitome of postmodernity.  in many ways 'Sans Soleil' is a stunning exegisis on Hitchcock's masterpiece which had only just been rereleased after twodecades withdrawel echoing its circular structure its concern with time memory the elusiveness of history. 'Soleil' locates the crisis of postmodernity in Japan that most modern of modern capitalist societies.  With the curiosity of an anthropologist the good humour of an essayist and the eye for the unusual of a rare filmmaker Marker gives us a Japan we rarely see even in the country's own cinema on the one hand a culture of startling modernity leading the way in computers technology department stores etc. on the other full of residual traditions rituals superstitions ceremonies going back centuries.  The coexistence of these two timescales has resulted in a kind of blur a temporal vacuum whereby all sense of time and perspective is lost where religious ceremonies for the souls of stray pets coexist with stateoftheart video games.  Japan is like a ship that has lost its anchor where all time is the same and therefore irrelevant just as Scottie Ferguson wanders around dazed in a loop of fantasy and distorted memory.  Without history memory a culture ceases to be a culture and lays itself open to all sorts of vulnerability. But this lack of foundation ironically leads to a greater freedom particularly of the mind and the film as it reaches its conclusion becomes visionary and hallucinatory.'Soleil' is anything but bleak  its stories myths cultural tidbits observations are unfailingly entertaining and full of good humour.  Krasna compares the overcultured saturated Japan to the timeless emptiness of Africa to the spooky otherworldliness of Iceland as his 'objective' narrative becomes increasingly a personal odyssey that must be teased out from hints and ellipses.  In its focusing on the minutae the forgotten the arcane the ephemeral the back alleys the garbage but suggesting that 'Soleil' is ultimately only one film out of a possible multitude made possible by new technologies Marker's film is at once profoundly democratic yet exhilaratingly idiosyncratic an apocalyptic vision teeming with life.".

In my opinion SANS SOLEIL is an inferior version of KAYAANISQATSI which was released the same year while KAYAANISQATSI lets its images of different societies machines and crowds speak for themselves Chris Marker layers a monologue of pseudointellectual babble over his. The footage itself is pretty interesting we see Japanese people performing ancient purification rites some nice shots of Iceland's lunar landscape and other scenes from societies around the world but the voiceover pretty much ruins it. It's like a failed poet hijacked National Geographic and forced them to make SANS SOLEIL instead of something interesting. Honestly you could probably find more meaningful prose in a teenage goth's LiveJournal.I had a few ideological problems with the movie as well. Chris Marker a Frenchman I assume? darted about in nonWestern societies viewing foreign people through a camera lens. He then mashed all the footage together drawing inferences from the images which he then communicated to us the primarily Western viewers through a voiceover. He never interviews anyone he films. His voice is the only one we hear he is the sole authority who controls the information we receive and as a result he can construct other cultures to fit a message of his choosing.What to the people living in the jungle have to say about life? That's what I'd like to know. But instead we hear through Marker that they are noble savages free in their own way despite being so primitive practicing mystical rituals the narrator doesn't actually comprehend etc. Even Japanese TV somehow serves to illuminate Japanese culture for Marker despite the fact that he admits he doesn't speak Japanese and can't understand a word of what's going on! Edmund Said explores this form of representation in his book Orientalism but basically I see Chris Marker as the Rudyard Kipling or Marco Polo of our day. He travels abroad reports back to us with a romanticized description of other cultures which the cultures themselves do not contribute to directly we accept it and the discourse ends. We never learn anything tangible besides the fact that Marker found this experience to be personally significant in some vague way.Also I had to close my ears while the narrator discusses Hitchcock's VERTIGO... I haven't seen that one yet and had a feeling Marker wouldn't include any spoiler warnings.".

To put it disrespectfully there is a lot of eye candy in this film some of which is extremely beautiful ... the computer graphics towards the end might even remind Cocteau fans of some of scenes from Blood of a Poet these though were what I found to be a bit over the top.  So far I have only seen this film once and so many of the memories that it prodded just three weeks ago have faded like for example the name of the composer whose Bez Solntse inspired the title and the documentary on volcanic activity I saw somewhere sometime which was echoed in the section filmed in Finland.   In any case this film will give you insight into the fascinating coexistence of traditional and modern culture in Japan.  This struck home with me because I lived in Asia during the 80s when the technology of videogames computers and stereophonic luxe were exploding in the very same culture in which colorful Hindu and golden Buddhist temples w smoking incense birdsinging contests and kite races were popular Sunday diversions from production.  Bref a fabulous film.  As others have suggested be prepared to suspend the Hollywood mindset for this treat.".

Chris Marker isn't so crude however I always felt that when one is experiencing the culture of a distant land the medium of film was never the choice way to experience it. Rather the exploration of different cultures when traveling must be experienced within the moment rather than taking the moment with a camera and experiencing it at home. This is where Sans Soleil becomes a success or a failure in the eyes of the audience do we live in the moment close to the same way the filmmaker does? This is something only you can answer when watching it.

An atrocious waste of two hours which makes Russian Ark look like FaceOff.";

You see lots of lengthy and seemingly random footage from around the world with an emphasis on Japan and a narrator drones on and on about nothing in particular. As for the footage despite being in color it's rather grainy and generally uninteresting. It's also accompanied by electronic music that generally is annoying and I think it was honestly meant to be annoying. And this goes one for over 100 minutes. I'll be honest. I stopped watching this one after a whileand that's saying a lot considering I almost never bail on a film. Additionally I've probably reviewed at least a couple thousand films and rarely have I felt like I wasted my time more than with this one.".

Marker takes canonical historical signposts and challenges their ability to tell us anything of worth about the world and humanity within it. He jolts and it is a jolt our attention away from the official processes of historification that goes on beneath our noses in cinema towards the banal and the everyday detail that comes the stuff of life itself.On first viewing especially if you are unfamiliar with the codes of progressive experimental or 'counter' cinema you may well be confused. But you will also be intrigued and on second viewing its secrets begin to reveal themselves.

It's as bizarre a movie as one could ever hope to find but it does work as a documentary. The film is in no way concerned with entertaining the audience. It is a philosophical text presented in film format. It also describes the culture of Japan and GuineaBissau.The movie explains a lot about the reverence of the land in Japanese society. We see people praying with their heads bowed to the Earth and the narrator provides commentary about it. We also learn the importance of the dog to the Japanese people. Also the film discusses the importance of the train to the Japanese. Something intriguing about the film is how the narrator discusses the artistic possibilities of video games. Since the film was released in 1983 video games were in crisis due to the crash that happened earlier that year in North America and Europe. Now looking at games like Metroid Prime and Shadow of the Colossus I understand what she meant. For GuineaBissau the narrator discusses the political history of the country and the risks of being a revolutionary. I'd like to write more about it but I cannot recall anything to say.Those who choose to watch Sans soleil would be best served to read the script before and after the viewing. Then they should talk about what they just watched. I will do that when I watch it again as I have for many philosophical texts. This film is not intended for a large audience and those wishing to watch it should be knowledgeable of that. Also if you enjoy Hitchcock you'll be pleasantly surprised by the homage Marker plays to him.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most worthless things I've ever seen put on celluloid. I had previously tried to get through it twice and failed  finding it miserably tedious. The images were barely more than home movie quality every sentiment was abysmally banal and there was something me than faintly selfcongratulatory about it all. What on earth can Marker's fans get out of this? He seemed to think he was the first westerner to set foot in Asia  and with a camera too! He tried to invest everything he saw with such utter gravity and meaning but fell head first into every clichd image and hackneyed idea of Asia there is. I waited for something to grab me some remarkable insight or pearl of wisdom nothing just a filmmaker a fairly amateurish one desperate to film every little oddity and when there are none every little banality.I knew this was going to be a hard ride but I tried to shrug off any preconceptions and prejudices to give this another try. After only three minutes I had to hit the pause button. Later I tried again a nonbeliever reading the Bible.Bland images. This kind of thing needspictures like Baraka to at least provide some justification. Five minutes are spent watching a Japanese street carnival. Marker takes a fascination in people that comes across as simply nave. He waxes philosophical about a man frying food on a hotplate presumably because it's the first time he has seen it happening. A Japanese cameraman of equal naivety might well point his camera at a little old woman frying chips in a British chippie and call it meaningful. Thankfully nobody ever did.His camera craves little oddities such as the temple of the beckoning cats but it's no more than touristic innocence.The observation that people ought to look in the camera is typical of the 'aren't I being meaningful by seeing something that noone else can?' attitude. But by doing so they are not revealing themselves with curiosity only hiding themselves with insecurity.There are two ways of looking at every human emotion. A blithe side and a cynical side.

There's something unpleasantly adolescent almost JD Salingerish about this trick and I instinctively resist.I felt like I was supposed to be impressed by the fact that Marker had travelled had had reflections that he was alive. It was not just selfcongratulatory but selfratifying selfaggrandizing the immodesty of the adolescent that hasn't yet learned sophistication.At the end of it he had shown me nothing about the world or about people. He had made mountains out of philosophical molehills and was dining off the tale.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the most worthless things I've ever seen put on celluloid. I had previously tried to get through it twice and failed  finding it miserably tedious. The images were barely more than home movie quality every sentiment was abysmally banal and there was something me than faintly selfcongratulatory about it all. What on earth can Marker's fans get out of this? He seemed to think he was the first westerner to set foot in Asia  and with a camera too! He tried to invest everything he saw with such utter gravity and meaning but fell head first into every clichd image and hackneyed idea of Asia there is. I waited for something to grab me some remarkable insight or pearl of wisdom nothing just a filmmaker a fairly amateurish one desperate to film every little oddity and when there are none every little banality.I knew this was going to be a hard ride but I tried to shrug off any preconceptions and prejudices to give this another try. After only three minutes I had to hit the pause button. Later I tried again a nonbeliever reading the Bible.Bland images. This kind of thing needspictures like Baraka to at least provide some justification. Five minutes are spent watching a Japanese street carnival. Marker takes a fascination in people that comes across as simply nave. He waxes philosophical about a man frying food on a hotplate presumably because it's the first time he has seen it happening. A Japanese cameraman of equal naivety might well point his camera at a little old woman frying chips in a British chippie and call it meaningful. Thankfully nobody ever did.His camera craves little oddities such as the temple of the beckoning cats but it's no more than touristic innocence.The observation that people ought to look in the camera is typical of the 'aren't I being meaningful by seeing something that noone else can?' attitude. But by doing so they are not revealing themselves with curiosity only hiding themselves with insecurity.There are two ways of looking at every human emotion. A blithe side and a cynical side.

	schema:headline " Lawnmower Man 2 A few competent scenes and a whole lotta unintentional laughs make it a fun onetime watch for fans of trashy bmovies. All else need not apply.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty much a permanent fixture on IMDb's Bottom 100 list 1996's Lawnmower Man 2 Beyond Cyberspace is not only widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made... it's widely considered one of the worst films ever made period. While the second claim might be somewhat debatable in retrospect oh it's bad... it's really bad but maybe not worst of all time bad the former is most certainly a given. The original film is a wildly dated but mostly harmless scifi thriller about a mentallychallenged man who is granted superhuman intelligence and abilities through the power of virtual reality sending him spiraling on a path towards an evil plot for world domination. It's forgettable save for its cheesy earlyCG effects and a few decent performances by future star Pierce Brosnan and the titular Lawnmower Man Jobe played by Jeff Fahey. It's a mediocre film but it hit it fairly big at the box office so a sequel was pretty much guaranteed.What people couldn't have predicted however is just how incredibly insane the followup would be. Lawnmower Man 2 is frankly bizarre and never anything less than overthetop from scene to scene. Story goes the studiosuits behind this mess were hoping to spin the series off into a teenaimed superhero movie franchise set in cyberspace a far cry from the more deliberate and slowburn thriller the original was and this film would be sortof a stepping stone in that direction. Add to that woeful miscasting of pretty much every lead character a lot of nonsensical retcon work that frequently butchers the storyline of the first film and postproduction problems including the director being locked out of the editing room... and you pretty much have a recipe for disaster.Six years after the events of the first film in a now post apocalyptic world right out of Blade Runner I guess? Jobe now played by Max Headroom himself Matt Frewer has been discovered and brought back from the brink of death by an evil megalomaniacal VR tycoon who needs him to perfect the film's MacGuffin the Chiron Chip... the most powerful computer chip ever conceived. After rediscovering his old friend Peter Parkette Austin O'Brien in virtual reality Jobe goes on a quest to track down the creator of VR Dr. Trace Patrick Bergin who has key information that will assist in Jobe taking control of the Chiron Chip... or something stupid like that. Blah blah blah... Jobe goes powercrazy yet again and tries to take over the world with the Chiron Chip. Chiron Chip Chiron Chip... Chiron Chip. You'll be sick of that combination of words by the time the film's over. They say it constantly.Basically the film is a weird mixeddrink from Satan's tavern... one part Blade Runner one part Super Mario Bros. The Movie one part Tron onehalf part the original Lawnmower Man... topped off with five parts Highlander 2 The Quickening. Garnish with overacting. Serve over ice from Flint Michigan.Everything is a fundamental mess. The storyline is nonsensical and completely unclear with the main focus being on delivering constant technobabble as often as possible while punctuating every few scenes with an explosion or bizarro murdersequence as Jobe picks off various targets though sanitized for a PG13 rating. As mentioned above the film's MacGuffin of choice is the Chiron Chip though the Chip itself is poorly established and doesn't seem to amount to all that much in the story. There's also some genuinely laughable misjudgments on the part of the filmmakers to try and gear the film towards children as per studio request... so you get uproarious scenes where the Information Superhighway is personified as an actual highway in cyberspace that our heroes get into a carchase on. I could not stop laughing. Everyone in the cast mugs for the camera in such a way that you cringe so much that you can't help but giggle with special props going to Frewer who turns the quiet and sinister Jobe from the firstfilm into a cackling Jim Carrey wannabe who spouts one liners at the top of his lungs in every scene. The editing is an absolute mess with not a single moment given more than an instance of breathing room before it rockets to the next scene... probably because producers ohsoneeded it to appeal to the kids with their Mtv's and their Nintendo's and whatever kids these days like. And the effects sucked plain and simple. Not only were they poor in comparison to other films released around the time... they're somehow objectively worse than the effects in the original four years earlier!Yet... I don't totally hate the film and I even do have a mild recommendation for it. It's awful. Dreadful. But also kinda entertaining. Fans of trashy Bmovies and bad cinema will probably get a kick out of it much as I did. It's worth watching once for those crowds. I know I couldn't stop laughing at it. It's just so baffling and mindnumbing that even as you feel your braincells depleting... you might get some serious chuckles thanks to it. Also I can't help but comment... there is an occasional hint at brilliance here and there. You get the feeling that directorco writer Farhad Mann was really trying his hardest and there are a few scenes that are competently filmed and directed. I think there's a significantly better film somewhere beneath the surface that you glean the occasional look at here. Not a good film... but a better film. It'd be interesting to see what his original vision was.But really aside from badmovie buffs I cannot in good conscience recommend Lawnmower Man 2 to anyone. It's terrible. Strange. And wildly confusing. And it is easily and indisputably one of the worst sequels ever made earning a muchdeserved 1 out of 10 for me.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pretty much a permanent fixture on IMDb's Bottom 100 list 1996's Lawnmower Man 2 Beyond Cyberspace is not only widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made... it's widely considered one of the worst films ever made period. While the second claim might be somewhat debatable in retrospect oh it's bad... it's really bad but maybe not worst of all time bad the former is most certainly a given. The original film is a wildly dated but mostly harmless scifi thriller about a mentallychallenged man who is granted superhuman intelligence and abilities through the power of virtual reality sending him spiraling on a path towards an evil plot for world domination. It's forgettable save for its cheesy earlyCG effects and a few decent performances by future star Pierce Brosnan and the titular Lawnmower Man Jobe played by Jeff Fahey. It's a mediocre film but it hit it fairly big at the box office so a sequel was pretty much guaranteed.What people couldn't have predicted however is just how incredibly insane the followup would be. Lawnmower Man 2 is frankly bizarre and never anything less than overthetop from scene to scene. Story goes the studiosuits behind this mess were hoping to spin the series off into a teenaimed superhero movie franchise set in cyberspace a far cry from the more deliberate and slowburn thriller the original was and this film would be sortof a stepping stone in that direction. Add to that woeful miscasting of pretty much every lead character a lot of nonsensical retcon work that frequently butchers the storyline of the first film and postproduction problems including the director being locked out of the editing room... and you pretty much have a recipe for disaster.Six years after the events of the first film in a now post apocalyptic world right out of Blade Runner I guess? Jobe now played by Max Headroom himself Matt Frewer has been discovered and brought back from the brink of death by an evil megalomaniacal VR tycoon who needs him to perfect the film's MacGuffin the Chiron Chip... the most powerful computer chip ever conceived. After rediscovering his old friend Peter Parkette Austin O'Brien in virtual reality Jobe goes on a quest to track down the creator of VR Dr. Trace Patrick Bergin who has key information that will assist in Jobe taking control of the Chiron Chip... or something stupid like that. Blah blah blah... Jobe goes powercrazy yet again and tries to take over the world with the Chiron Chip. Chiron Chip Chiron Chip... Chiron Chip. You'll be sick of that combination of words by the time the film's over. They say it constantly.Basically the film is a weird mixeddrink from Satan's tavern... one part Blade Runner one part Super Mario Bros. The Movie one part Tron onehalf part the original Lawnmower Man... topped off with five parts Highlander 2 The Quickening. Garnish with overacting. Serve over ice from Flint Michigan.Everything is a fundamental mess. The storyline is nonsensical and completely unclear with the main focus being on delivering constant technobabble as often as possible while punctuating every few scenes with an explosion or bizarro murdersequence as Jobe picks off various targets though sanitized for a PG13 rating. As mentioned above the film's MacGuffin of choice is the Chiron Chip though the Chip itself is poorly established and doesn't seem to amount to all that much in the story. There's also some genuinely laughable misjudgments on the part of the filmmakers to try and gear the film towards children as per studio request... so you get uproarious scenes where the Information Superhighway is personified as an actual highway in cyberspace that our heroes get into a carchase on. I could not stop laughing. Everyone in the cast mugs for the camera in such a way that you cringe so much that you can't help but giggle with special props going to Frewer who turns the quiet and sinister Jobe from the firstfilm into a cackling Jim Carrey wannabe who spouts one liners at the top of his lungs in every scene. The editing is an absolute mess with not a single moment given more than an instance of breathing room before it rockets to the next scene... probably because producers ohsoneeded it to appeal to the kids with their Mtv's and their Nintendo's and whatever kids these days like. And the effects sucked plain and simple. Not only were they poor in comparison to other films released around the time... they're somehow objectively worse than the effects in the original four years earlier!Yet... I don't totally hate the film and I even do have a mild recommendation for it. It's awful. Dreadful. But also kinda entertaining. Fans of trashy Bmovies and bad cinema will probably get a kick out of it much as I did. It's worth watching once for those crowds. I know I couldn't stop laughing at it. It's just so baffling and mindnumbing that even as you feel your braincells depleting... you might get some serious chuckles thanks to it. Also I can't help but comment... there is an occasional hint at brilliance here and there. You get the feeling that directorco writer Farhad Mann was really trying his hardest and there are a few scenes that are competently filmed and directed. I think there's a significantly better film somewhere beneath the surface that you glean the occasional look at here. Not a good film... but a better film. It'd be interesting to see what his original vision was.But really aside from badmovie buffs I cannot in good conscience recommend Lawnmower Man 2 to anyone. It's terrible. Strange. And wildly confusing. And it is easily and indisputably one of the worst sequels ever made earning a muchdeserved 1 out of 10 for me.";

While governments scientists and the like do their thing the REAL geniuses kids with a home computer in this case save humanity! Ugghhh!! Second there is the film makers' notion that says special effects can take the place of plot. However rarely have I seen a film with such a bizarre and incomprehensible plot and such wonderful graphicsit's like a story wasn't even important to the film. What WAS important was lots and lots and lots of computer tricks and explosionswith graphics that were brilliant for 1996but did nothing to create a movie worth seeing or understanding. It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot such as it is is about some smart disabled guy who is using his berbrain to tie into all the world computers and mess with peoplekilling them in various ways that are supergraphics intensive. And of course it's up to a bunch of kids and a downandout Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?! Well it's obvious that I think this is a bad and vacuous film. However is it bad enough to merit the inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list? Well that's not an easy answer and I should talk about the confusion in putting any film on the list. I guess it all depends on how you personally would interpret a bad film and what should be on the list. For example the films of Ed Wood and Al Adamson are abysmal lowbudget messes and yet they are not on the list. Perhaps this is because in their own weird way they are so bad that they are funny. Or perhaps because they are so lowbudget they shouldn't be taken seriously. Lawnmower Man 2 is clearly nothing like these filmswith a relatively large budget despite some bargain basement actors and wider release than an Ed Wood film it clearly is in a different league. And sadly while bad it isn't what I would consider fun viewing. And considering the sheer waste of money i.e. bang for the buck and unwatchability I would consider putting it on this infamous list. Pretty too look at mindless brainrotting mushthat's MY interpretation of what should be on the listand this clearly is brainrotting mush!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Lawnmower Man 2 1996  out of 4 1992's The Lawnmower Man was a disastrous film that somehow gained a cult following. Perhaps it was the special effects or perhaps it was the wicked performance of Jeff Fahey as the dimwitted Jobe that made people enjoy the movie. For some unknown reason four years later we got Lawnmower Man 2 Jobe's War which fell into theaters in January and was on video within months. The first film was bad but this one here is something far worse.This sequel starts off where the previous film ended. The dimwit turned genius by virtual reality training Jobe Matt Frewer has been blown up but when special agents check out the building they find him still breathing. Jobe missing his legs must undergo plastic surgery to save his face and to bring a new actor in and then the scientists try to figure out more about him. The evil Jonathan Walker Kevin Conway wants Jobe to teach him about the Chiron chip which would be able to let Walker into any computer throughout the world. By doing this Walker could overtake the world and end it as we know it God knows he isn't the first to try this.Due to the explosion and various other mental problems Jobe has plans of his own which included taking over the world himself. Jobe goes cyber surfing to a futuristic Los Angeles where he discovers his old friend Peter Austin O'Brien the same kid who gave him Twinkies in the first film he's aged a lot for one day. Jobe tries to get Peter to help him but when the kid discovers what Jobe's plans are here turns to Dr. Trace Patrick Bergin who might be able to stop the maniac from taking over the world and saving us all. Are you on the edge of your seat yet? Lawnmower Man 2 is one of those films that's so bad I'd recommend you stick needles in your eyes instead of watching the film. I love bad movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Reefer Madness but this here is just so bad that I dare you not to hit the FF button or return it to the video store after the first five minutes. I'm really not sure why sequels like these are made. I'm really not sure who'd want to watch the film but I guess producers are hoping fans of the original will flock to this over the title.I'm really at a loss of words on talking about this film. I did a little research on the film and learned that it's number twenty on the worst films list over at the IMDb. To think there are people out there who think nineteen other movies are worst than this really blows my mind to no point. The media wants to mock and make fun of a recent Ben and Jen flick yet I bet none of them sat through this film. The acting makes Lopez seem like Bette Davis. The screenplay here makes Ed Wood look like Woody Allen.Another thing missing from this film is just a person choice of mine but I've always enjoyed Jeff Fahey as an actor. I enjoyed him in the first film and other horror films like Psycho 3 and Body Parts. I'm sure he wasn't too busy when this movie was made and the fact he turned it down says a lot about it. I always hate it when sequels come along with the same characters being played by different actors. The most mind blowing thing however is that the studio opened this in over fifteenhundred theaters which is a shame considering how many better films never get into one.".

Despite the good showing of the first lawnmower man the theaters here in Thailand refused to be shown. So I had to wait until it came out in video stores. Strangely enough the first time it went on sale they were selling at a deep discount. I thought it was a bargain so I bought it. It was the one of biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. Stephen King is no longer active. Actors are totally changed. I cannot see any resemblance at all to the first movie. At least hiring Pierce Brosnan would have helped a lot to the continuity. The characters looked like paper doll. The story line just did not fit with the first movie at all. You can watch this movie in itself without any knowledge whatsoever to the first film. The ending of the first Lawnmower man was he is now in Cyberspace. In the second part he is back and still alive as a human and no longer in cyberspace. Total contradiction. I completely forgot the entire movie minutes after watching it and had to forced watch THREE TIMES because I could not understand it. The PLOTS for the entire movie are so complicated and if you bothered analyzing them made no sense at all. The technology that the Evil Company offered made no sense and the public looked far too gullible and the government is as mindless as ever. The religion that people joined looked like zombies. If you pretend you are in a video game playing Lawnmower Man 2 then it looks just that a video game not a movie but lacking of action sequences. Movie is somewhat similar to the lame Matrix 3. This has got to be the worse movie I ever watched besides Super Babies Baby Geniuses 2. Oh yes I forgot my pet dog died while watching this movie.Score 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams aka Dirk Diggler Mark Wahlberg through six years of sex drugs and disco. His chance meeting with pornography director Jack Horner Burt Reynolds starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on reallife porn actor John Holmes who like Dirk was renowned for being extremely wellendowed. This is where Dirk finds initial success.The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre pornography drugs sex betrayal violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. It is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.Throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously and the film's setting Los Angeles 19771983 reflects the popularity of the drug at that time which the film captures perfectly. However Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film before this scenes has been fairly upbeat and comic but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.The music scenes are executed brilliantly from superblystaged disco scenes to a downandout Dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack too is excellent featuring tunes from The Emotions ELO The Beach Boys and the unforgettable Sound Experience. The standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music Dirk Redd Rothchild John C. Reilly and Todd Parker Thomas Jane visit drug dealer Rahad Jackson's Alfred Molina house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs but Night Ranger's Sister Christian which is playing in the background increases the intensity of the scene incredibly proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with those kind of scenes which makes the film even more fantastic.The standout performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic yet moody film director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies it is a complete shock for the audience because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg who delivers the performance of his career.Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong or at least until the 80s arrive. From then on things turn very dark indeed and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. This does not however reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.Boogie Nights was not a boxoffice success earning only 2 million at cinemas in the UK. But this is not the film's or the director's concern. Anderson recognises quality not popularity which is evident in his three other films Hard Eight Magnolia and PunchDrunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations because at the end of this film you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality tale but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. Boogie Nights is at once shocking hilarious devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any wouldbe filmmaker should take a long hard look at.  Sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study halfheartedly.Where to begin I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industryand what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and ahem rubber.  But honestly Boogie Nights brings back the pure nobul!shi in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clearyou are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie AdamsDirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I'm a sucker for the line Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.  Anyway the look of the film is incredible the Director of Photography and DirectorWriterProducer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrickin terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music like in any great film is a character of its own.  At times it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970's. OK back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the wouldbe mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life imitates art and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eyecandy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fastpace 1970's. It makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.".

Heather Graham is the eyecandy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fastpace 1970's. It makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.";

It is a frank compelling and disturbing vignette of unforgettable characters.  Mark Whalberg in his best performance to date plays a wellendowed 17 year old who begins working in the porn industry under porn director Burt Reynolds in an Oscar nominated performance.  John C.

The best scenes belong to former porn star couple Don Cheadle and Nicole Parker who add some of the comic relief to the film.  What's intriguing is the way the actors interact with each other and the way they struggle to find their selfidentity plus a bravura script colorful and startling cinematography and a rousing rocking 70s soundtrack that make Boogie Nights one of the best films of 1997.  It is a touching humorous and shocking film bursting with originality with an overall message of redemption and forgiveness.".

I can actually understand why many would dislike it due to the subject matter. I personally feel however as many do judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.The direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.There is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a movie about the porn industry one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. The direction is among the best I've ever seenand I've seen a lot of films.The film isn't about one particular personal individual's story it's about many.It's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. Boogie Nights draws you into their story from the beginning and though the film is longI believe almost 3 hours you honestly don't even notice. And when it ends you kind of don't want it to....I'm not easy to impress meaning there aren't many movies I'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. Beyond the multiple character study is the use of music in the film. I have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.There was such flawlessness to it you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen him do and Mark Wahlberg is incredibleI'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. I don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think thatbut the person who really surprised me was Heather GrahemRollergirl who is absolutely fantastic in her role in particular the one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo towards the end.Again I'll echo other IMDb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody.

	schema:reviewBody "SOME SPOILERSBoogie Nights may well be the best film of the 1990s.  I cannot remember the last time I was so overwhelmed by a new film.Interestingly I was not planning to see it.  I knew nothing about the director I've never cared for Burt Reynolds and the only thing I knew about Mark Wahlberg is that he had been an annoying boy singer and Calvin Klein model.  Nor was I all that interested in seeing the story of an extremely wellendowed porn star.A couple of months ago I tuned in about 20 minutes into the film when Boogie nights was on cable  and I was hooked.  I have seen the entire film twice and it has become one of my favorites.First of all P.T. Anderson is brilliant ... it's daunting to think he was only 27 when BN was made.  Despite the borrowing from Scorsese and Altman I believe he brings a profoundly individual vision to his work. What sets him apart is that his keen observation and satirical vision are enhanced by warmth compassion indeed love for the people who populate his film.Is Anderson judgmental toward his characters?  A friend who watched BN at my suggestion said that one thing he loved about the film is that it's moral but not moralistic.  Anderson makes it clear that these people's lifestyle is often destructive.   The critics who complained about the abrupt shift from hedonistic fun in the '70s to horror and disintegration in the '80s were mistaken.  The first half has many intimations of darkness the girl who ODs on coke at Jack's party face streaked with blood limbs twitching Amber's son trying in vain to reach her at the party Little Bill's anguish at his wife's infidelities.  Clearly too most of these people aren't very smart and their pretensions  Dirk's belief in his stardom Jack's belief in his art  are ridiculous.  Yet we never lose connection with their basic humanity.  When AmberMaggie is denied visitation with her son we know it was probably the right decision yet we sympathize with her anguish.It's the ultimate cliche to say that a film will make you laugh and cry. With BN it happens to be true.  The Brock Landers clips and the preparations for EddieDirk's porno debut are just two of the riotously funny scenes.  On the other hand the confrontation between Eddie and his mother or the scene of Dirk coming back to Jack asking for help have more genuine emotion and poignancy in a few brief minutes than there was in all of Titanic.  And some scenes are both comical and moving Amber and Rollergirl talking as they snort coke Scotty making a pass at Dirk.This film will also make you think without beating you over the head with a message the way Three Kings does for instance.  Many say that its theme is family but equally important is the theme of selfdeception.  Most of the characters are prisoners of their dreams and delusions.   For Jack and Dirk it's the delusions of glory and greatness in Amber's case her selfimage as a good mother.  Right after telling Dirk she sees him as a son she introduces him to cocaine  his eventual undoing.  Why do Jack and Rollergirl unleash their fury on Rollergirl's former classmate? Because with his comment on how squalid their lives actually are reality intrudes on their selfenclosed world of illusion and they can't take it.There's no real happy ending either.  At the end Jack has reconciled himself to being a rich hack.  A wistfullooking Amber sits at her makeup table while Jack tells her she's the foxiest bitch in the world clearly her looks will be more and more difficult to keep up.  As for Dirk he has presumably kicked the drug problem and is back working looking slick yet somehow lifeless.  Note that in the infamous final shot when he exposes his penis in front of the mirror we don't see his face.  He has been dehumanized reduced to a sex machine  and that's all there will ever be for him.  Think of the early scene of Eddie telling his girlfriend I'm going to be a star a big bright shining star his eyes gleaming his voice aglow with hope and contrast it with him saying at the end I am a star. A big bright shining star  his voice flat his face invisible ... the real star is his penis.Despite the film's setting in the porn industry I think BN has something to say about the larger culture of media glitz and celebrityseeking.A word about the acting.  Burt Reynolds is superb Julianne Moore truly shines.  It takes courage for a female movie star to take on a part where she often appears physically unattractive.  Philip Seymour Hoffman Alfred Molina John C. Reilly and Heather Graham stand out in a supporting cast that doesn't have a single bad performance.  As for Mark Wahlberg he proves himself to be one of the finest young actors working today.  He is utterly convincing as he shows EddieDirk's evolution from an eagertoplease innocently amoral kid with a dopey but radiant smile to an obnoxious egomaniacal paranoid prima donna and then the despair of his downfall. During the drugdeal scene there's a closeup of his face for more than a minute with no dialogue and he conveys a complex range of emotion as Dirk spaces out listening to Jesse's Girl  obviously thinking of better days then of how low he has fallen  and then snaps back to reality and is terrified.BN is not without weaknesses.  A few scenes are too long the theme of Amber's mother role is overemphasized a few plot strands are left unresolved were there any legal consequences to Jack's and Rollergirl's assault on the guy in the limo or to the drug dealattempted robbery that ended in two dead bodies?.  But these are minor flaws in a nearperfect work.".

Many say that its theme is family but equally important is the theme of selfdeception.  Most of the characters are prisoners of their dreams and delusions.   For Jack and Dirk it's the delusions of glory and greatness in Amber's case her selfimage as a good mother.  Right after telling Dirk she sees him as a son she introduces him to cocaine  his eventual undoing.  Why do Jack and Rollergirl unleash their fury on Rollergirl's former classmate? Because with his comment on how squalid their lives actually are reality intrudes on their selfenclosed world of illusion and they can't take it.There's no real happy ending either.  At the end Jack has reconciled himself to being a rich hack.  A wistfullooking Amber sits at her makeup table while Jack tells her she's the foxiest bitch in the world clearly her looks will be more and more difficult to keep up.  As for Dirk he has presumably kicked the drug problem and is back working looking slick yet somehow lifeless.  Note that in the infamous final shot when he exposes his penis in front of the mirror we don't see his face.  He has been dehumanized reduced to a sex machine  and that's all there will ever be for him.  Think of the early scene of Eddie telling his girlfriend I'm going to be a star a big bright shining star his eyes gleaming his voice aglow with hope and contrast it with him saying at the end I am a star. A big bright shining star  his voice flat his face invisible ... the real star is his penis.Despite the film's setting in the porn industry I think BN has something to say about the larger culture of media glitz and celebrityseeking.A word about the acting.  Burt Reynolds is superb Julianne Moore truly shines.  It takes courage for a female movie star to take on a part where she often appears physically unattractive.  Philip Seymour Hoffman Alfred Molina John C. Reilly and Heather Graham stand out in a supporting cast that doesn't have a single bad performance.  As for Mark Wahlberg he proves himself to be one of the finest young actors working today.  He is utterly convincing as he shows EddieDirk's evolution from an eagertoplease innocently amoral kid with a dopey but radiant smile to an obnoxious egomaniacal paranoid prima donna and then the despair of his downfall. During the drugdeal scene there's a closeup of his face for more than a minute with no dialogue and he conveys a complex range of emotion as Dirk spaces out listening to Jesse's Girl  obviously thinking of better days then of how low he has fallen  and then snaps back to reality and is terrified.BN is not without weaknesses.  A few scenes are too long the theme of Amber's mother role is overemphasized a few plot strands are left unresolved were there any legal consequences to Jack's and Rollergirl's assault on the guy in the limo or to the drug dealattempted robbery that ended in two dead bodies?.  But these are minor flaws in a nearperfect work.";

This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be likeit was a fantastic and quite involving drama which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless and the glamor of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad the firecrackers the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to Jessie's Girl and Sister Christian. Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends but realized he had to be father to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.".

The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrowminded the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter and Robert Zemeckis's Contact came close to being as great as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction  until now. Paul Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino gave John Travolta's career a kick P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick that his career needs.

	schema:reviewBody "Boogie Nights is one of those films which can be classified a multitude of ways. It can easily be viewed as period piece a character study or a social commentary among other things. Anyway you look at it it proves to be an effective piece of filmmaking. A key to this success is the performance of Mark Wahlberg. Watching him make the transformation for cleancut kid Eddie Adams to porn superstar Dirk Diggler is what keeps the audience invested in the story being told. In the first half of the film when it's the most crucial Wahlberg is able to maintain such innocence and charisma and yet seems instantly at home in the new decadent world his character finds himself in. These scenes work greatly to the film's advantage because they are played with such earnestness. Seeing Eddie Adams embark on his new career we might as well be watching Peggy Sawyer of 42nd Street being told she's headed to Broadway. The whole thing just feels so unexpectedly clean which in turn may be something of a setup for the much darker moments to come.Admittedly the rise in the late 70s and fall in the early 80s of the pornography industry is an area of history we don't learn about in school. But it is a legitimate topic of interest nonetheless. While it certainly contains humor and a plethora of colorful characters Boogie Nights takes itself seriously. Aside from sex as a business issues such as race relations homophobia and drug abuse prove vital to the story it is telling. Another overriding theme of the film is the classic notion of fame as a doubleedged sword. One heart wrenching plot line involves a porn actress gently portrayed by the always wonderful Julianne Moore who is engaged in a custody battle with her estranged husband over their children. The irony here is that throughout the film we have seen how naturally she mothers those around her and yet she is ultimately deemed unfit to be a mother to her own children. I'm not saying that decision is wrong but it isn't easy to watch as she's forced to accept it either. If in fact porn can ever be inspiring it is something of an inspiration to see the concern the filmmakers within this film put upon themselves for producing a product they can be proud of. They strive to create movies their audiences will appreciate for reasons beyond the sex. We witness their creative process behind James Bond's porno counterpart Brock Landers from brainstorming through production. We see the adult industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards ceremony. It is only when we remind ourselves that these people are pornographers does any of this seem the least bit perverse. I strongly feel that this film is in no way trying to glamorize porn. The ultimate fates of some of its characters are proof enough of that. I do however feel that sometimes we are too quick to demonize based on preconceived notions. The characters we meet here are all consenting adults engaged in a lucrative business. True they are flirting with a myriad of dangers. But this film does them a great justice. It allows us to understand the psychology at work behind the choices they make. And it does us a justice too. It lets us choose whether or not we condemn them for it.".

Boogie Nights follows his first appearance as a naive young actor to a drug hampered egomaniacal lunatic who spirals down into the world of crime and Cocaine.

The viewers gather that Eddie Adams or Dirk Diggler the pseudonym he assumes for acting has a prodigious member lurking under his jeans. But until the final scene all we see to indicate that is the stunned reactions by peers and onlookers.The script is very good but the film is overly long.

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain taboos a director doesn't dare touch when he wants to become a respected filmmaker. In my opinion it takes a truly gifted director to incorporate such themes in their work while still keeping widely acknowledged critical credibility. For instance Stanley Kubrick was a master at this. He touched on subjects as pedophilia rape and even the horror genre and he never lost an ounce of brilliance nor credibility. Coming off his modest lowkey debut Hard Eight Paul Thomas Anderson made an extremely bold decision on the subject matter of his followup the adult film industry.There is a certain indefinable mastery that seemed to flow through the veins of young directors in the 1970s. Films like The Godfather Chinatown and Apocalypse Now had it on rampant display. Anderson is one of the very few modern filmmakers with this mastery within him.Boogie Nights opens with an explosion of color and sound as the camera glides through a bustling street of '70s nightlife with liquid ease. We are introduced to the cast one by one in a nightclub before finally arriving at a young busboy Wahlberg. Adult film tycoon Jackie Treehorne Reynolds spots him and immediately knows he is something special. He is correct as this busboy is endowed with an enormous talent if you will. Treehorne takes him under his wing and nurtures him into the biggest thing in the industry no pun intended.Never before has a modern film encapsulated the spirit fashion and sound of the 1970s as well as Boogie Nights. The soundtrack is incessantly infectious the sets and wardrobe vibrant and even the cinematography is lush and colorful.The 1980s start off with the bang of a suicide on midnight of January 1st. Thus begins the fall of class and decency if that's what you want to call it in the porn industry. I would say that the early half of this decade is nothing but drugs sex and debauchery but those were the '70s. Those were the good times. No the '80s are filled with violence serious drug addiction despair and the general fall of the mighty.As I have said Boogie Nights is a fantastic sensory experience. However its real strengths lie in its characters. It may sound odd to hear Boogie Nights described as an epic but it really is. In a lot of ways it's a modern Gone With The Wind. It doesn't make itself big through massive sets and thousands of extras but through the journey it takes us through with the characters over the span of two decades the rise the top the fall the bottom and the triumphant return.And Anderson orchestrates it all with a presence ease confidence and mastery atypical of a director on his second film. The music is perfect. The visuals are perfect. The acting is perfect. The editing is perfect. The writing is perfect. The direction is perfect. Anderson makes his cinematic influences subtle yet apparent and even his obvious influence Martin Scorsese could not have pulled this film off as impeccably as he.It would have been easy for a filmmaker to turn Boogie Nights into a parody of the pornography industry. After all it's not exactly held in high regard. But Anderson crafts a loving portrait of these characters and the audience likes and cares about them just as much as he does. Boogie Nights is a funny depressing uplifting exciting heartbreaking and strangely beautiful film. It truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.".

We see much of the film through the eyes of a young man who takes the industry by storm at the tender age of 17. We see his rise during the carefree innocence of the later 70s and we witness him bottom out in the early 80s. We are also introduced to several other performers filmmakers hangers on and criminals. Cocaine seems to be the catalyst behind much of the action. This type of film might have been laughable if made by a director with less talent but Anderson's unique style and skills make it a winner.Mark Wahlberg plays our young stud who takes the name of Dirk Diggler. He's apparently a high school dropout with an enormous penis who catches the attention of a porn director played by Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg's performance begins as properly understated then seems to grow with the character. Reynolds hasn't been this good since Smokey and the Bandit. The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of the more respected actors of our day. Don Cheadle is outstanding as a young man who takes pride in his acting but really wants to open up a stereo store more than anything else. Julianne Moore is is also very good as the maternal figure of the troupe who has basically adopted the younger actors as her own children to replace her real son lost in a custody dispute. There is simply not enough space here to give credit to everyone who acted superbly in this film.Anderson's skill with the camera is on display in numerous shots. Many have been used elsewhere but he knows how to work them into his story. Many of the scenes take place in crowded rooms or at parties where all kinds of interesting things are going on. His technique often takes us from one room to another then perhaps outside so we don't miss a thing. The use of soundtrack is perhaps the best of any film I've ever seen. In fact it IS the best. With so many great songs of the period at his disposal he works two discs worth into the story. Nothing seems excessive or out of place.If one fault can be found with this film then I would have to say it would be too much violence in the last half hour. Any industry that deals in sex and drugs to that extent is bound to encounter violence in some circles but Boogie Nights over does it. I counted no less than five extremely bloody scenes. In one a VERY young woman overdoses on coke and breaks a blood vessel in her nose. There are several gunshot victims. But the most overthetop scene would have to be the one where Heather Graham stomps on the head of a young man with her roller skates. The manner in which she comes in contact with him is contrived to the point of hysteria then the scene ends in such a brutal assault that you'll hardly be able to control your skepticism. The fact that the consequences of the assault are not even revealed to the audience at least not in any version of the film I've seen makes you wonder why Anderson thought to include it at all. It was just a means for the young woman to get some revenge on a guy who made fun of her way back in high school. Nothing more.The film lacks any scene which inspires any true sexual feeling from anyone I've ever talked to. This was indeed intended. The sex in the film is all about business though Graham's brief nude scene was well appreciated. The film is also lacking in any kind of judgment or moral lesson. We are merely introduced to these characters then we see what happens to them. Despite a near documentary point of view the film never bogs down or fails to keep one's interest. The film didn't make that much money but it has earned the distinction of being one of the better films made in the 1990s. A reputation welldeserved.9 of 10 stars from The Hound.".

I sat for two and a half hours and I was simply stunned! I cried I laughed and when the end came I was sad. I really didnt want it to end. First of all I was deeply moved and touched by this film and I cant say it enough Mark Wahlberg is simply magnificent in this film and portrays Dirk Diggler with passion and skill. Its really a kind of sad story and you begin to feel sorry for Dirk but you know that he has himself to thank.The best thing about this pic maybe is the acting. Academy Award nominee Burt Reynolds in the role of his life! Great and if nothing less SUPERB!! Don Cheadle Luis Guzman Julianne Moore Melora Walters John C.Reilly P.S.Hoffman William H.Macy Phillip Baker Hall and Heather Graham!! Every each and one of them delivers blistering performances and makes this movie unforgettable.The directorwriter Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my personal favourits and i do believe he will continue to make great films in the future. His excellent style in camerawork and his intense and brilliant scripts are all known qualities. I think and I mean that he really deserved that Oscar for Best Original Screenplay!! I would already categorize P.T.Anderson as one of greatest and most promising directorwriters of all time.The best movie of the 90s and why stop there?! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen and I think its one of the alltime topten!! I give it 1010!! So see this movie and do not miss out on the great soundtrack that is also a strong part of the film.I am a bigbrightshining starDirk Diggler".

	schema:reviewBody "It takes genius to make a believable film about the porn industry that makes us care about its characters and for me this movie accomplishes that nearlyimpossible task. Boogie Nights is a film about the adult film industry in the 70's and early 80's and even though the sleaze is thereit is done with style humor and taste. Eddie Adams aka Dirk Diggler Mark Wahlberg is a charming but notverybright 17year old dishwasher who is discovered by Jack Horner Burt Reynolds a fatherly adult filmmaker in 1977. The movie tracks his career and life over the next 8 years as well as the other members of Jack's family. The camera follows its many characters from scene to scene with a certain joyfulness and we come to care about all of them deeply no matter how small their roles.  There is a perfect balance of the hilarious and the tragic and the fast pace never lets up. The end of the '70s' ends with a literal bang which is totally appropriate and marks not only the end of a decade but the shift in mood from a partyatmosphere to one of growing tension. The soundtrack is wonderful with the songs not only appropriate for the time period but also to underscore the feeling of each scene. There is a scene late in the film that must be seen to be believed. In it Dirk Diggler and two of his druggie friends go to the home of a drugdealer to try to rip him off. The interplay of hilarity and tension is almost unbearable. A little Chinese boy walks around the room setting off firecrackers as a crackaddled bathrobeclad Alfred Molina as the drug lord rants and raves and sings along with Sister Christian and Jesse's Girl which blast on the stereo. We can feel the characters' uneasiness and sense of danger each time another firecracker goes off. Everyone should see this movie. There's never been another like it.".

I was real dissappointed to see yet another how drugs can make things bad theme show up in yet another movie but at least some of the drug material is shown at a fresh angle.  I was really happy when the drug part turned into just another part of the movie instead of the main focus.The drug lifestyle contains inherent drama and it is almost cheating for a writer to fall back on this tired old theme just to create drama where he doesn't feel like thinking it up on his own.  See Requiem for a Dream the best and hopefully the last how drugs can make things bad movie.I was quite pleased to see real porn stars in the movie and I'm not sure why Nina Hartley Veronica Hart there were probably more. The 'giveaway' at the end leads you to think about the entire movie and how this guy's entire life was merely because of one special thing.

What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream if such a thing still exists.For those of you who have been living in a box or a confessional for the past 8 years Boogie Nights tells the literal riseandfall tale of young Eddie Adams Wahlberg. Eddie is just a dopey kid from Torrance California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in musclebound naive Americana. His dreams are far bigger than his potential but not quite as large as his...special gift. His baldheaded southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming omnipresent adult film industry. Jack Horner Burt Reynolds as the film's twinkleeyed Papa Bear gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.Before you can say deepthroat Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wideeyed public. Fame and fortune make Dirk's acquaintance as do a bevy of local porn celebs. His friends and coworkers become his makeshift family but it soon proves to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the feelgood 70s give way to the cokeaddled videofriendly 80s Dirk  Co. begin a dangerous backslide. Anderson put everything he had into this glorious moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this one immediately.

I was awed at witnessing the planning sessions of President John F. Kennedy Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy General Abrams Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach etc. The University had already approved the admission of the two students Alabama was the only remaining state which had not fully integrated its university system and Governor Wallace vowed to stand at the entrance and prevent the students from entering. What the federal government will do when that happens is the focus of the documentary? The tension is real!  The drama is real! The participants are real! A most extraordinary documentary I never knew existed before it bowled me over when I saw it in 1981 in a theater and again when recently shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.  I would have thought it could never have been made. After all I'm sure Governor Wallace knew it was a lost cause yet he gave permission for the film makers to film him and his staff and the confrontation. The principals were covered by four teams of film makers and most of the footage appeared unstaged. Shots of Robert Kennedy at home with his kids and George Wallace with his daughter or granddaughter helped to make them more human rather than larger than life. The sense of history was overpowering. A must see for anyone interested in the civil rights movement or any of the participants.".

Kennedy and his brother Robert are seen trying to get Wallace to step down and allow two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama but the governor stands to his ground. After PRIMARY director Drew was given more access to Kennedy and it's pretty clear that the two of them knew this decision would be something big so it's pretty incredible that so much was able to be captured for this film. It runs just 53minutes but there's certainly some drama here even though you know what happened at the school. I thought the film was extremely wellmade and especially towards the end when the countdown starts on getting the two students into the school. Getting to see Robert Kennedy listening to what's going on in Alabama was pretty fascinating and you can see the drama going on just by looking at his face. Also seeing the aftermath of the events was also rather special. It's hard to believe that this film was released just a month before Kennedy was assassinated so in some ways that gives it even more power when viewed today. It's hard to believe that this type of stuff was happening such a short time ago but this documentary does a very good job at capturing the moods at the time.".

As Vincent roams the building's sterile halls peeking into meeting rooms where men are busy at work we see a man who yearns not just for a new job but also for a place in the world.

That man had no sense of identity about himself but he knew what he cared about and what he believed in the power of art and cinema. That brings him one up on the hero of this story.  Vincent is a man who also cannot accept the banalities of his life but he hasn't the foggiest idea of who he is or what he really cares about.  It's as if he was born out of a computer software program.  He knows what he's supposed to care about nice home nice car nice bank account... But his work as an investor is so deprived of any human value that he loses all sense of values.  His environment a sterile generic upper middleclass vacuum that could make one believe that all of France has turned into Silicon Valley with a touch of the Scandinavian has none of the passion or warmth that one identifies with being human.  He has a loving wife but according to his 'program' he believes that he would lose her if she knew that he was no longer able to function as a cog in the machine and provide her with the lifestyle that she has grown accustomed to.That is the first tragedy of Vincent because his wife really does love him. The second tragedy of Vincent is that even though he recognizes his need for freedom he doesn't know how to use it.  He's like a man who has been released from a lifetime of imprisonment but still hangs around the prison yard because he is unable to comprehend what might be available to him. He'd lost his job because his love for being free was more important to him than keeping his appointments but most of his time spent in his newfound freedom is in doing the same job he'd done before investments.  The only difference now is that he likes to believe that the investments are helping developing Third World countries.  He knows that there really are no investments he keeps the money that people give him and spends it on a nifty Range Rover among other things but momentarily he can feel as if he is 'somebody' to his family and friends when he tells them of this meaningful new job he allegedly has.Vincent has been described by many as 'everyman' but I think of him more as 'everyman who has just stepped through the looking glass'.  Instead of taking a good hard look at himself he somehow ended up taking a look beyond himself because he could not find a reflection.  He can't even recognize how much he's patterned his children to follow the same program he did.   We see him teaching his kindergartenage son how to 'hard sell' his toys at a school fair.  Later in a fascinating scene we see him and his family doing what most people of his class do in their free time.  They go shopping in an upscale overpriced store to buy clothing that they know they don't really need.  Vincent has it all but it fills nothing in him.  His family has it all yet they don't seem to question the fact that they rarely spend any time together.Laurent Candet has created a beautifully somber and sober look at the price of 'success'.  The film is practically drained of all color save for blues and grays to illustrate the life force that has been systematically drained from Vincent throughout his life.  And the score a somber cello piece refreshingly accentuates Vincent's mind instead of his actions like most scores do.  It is like a slowmoving merrygoround that brings on a sense of familiarity that is simultaneously comfortable and unnerving.  Because what the gist of it all is is that no one wants to spend their life on a merrygoround.  Even a comfortable one.".

Recoing is captivating his face a turmoil of quiet bewilderment and pain and he is ably matched by Viard as his increasingly unsettled partner. The penultimate scene between Recoing Viard and their children is quite astonishing for its tension and disquiet.In the end however the final scene says it all. Recoing's face tells us everything we need to know and he really should have won every award going for this brilliant performance. Once again the French film industry shows us all how to make films.".

	onyx:emotionText "A middleaged middle class family man has a midlife crisis.Hardly an inspiring or original idea yet Laurent Cantet creates a quite devastating and compelling landscape of one man's internal terror  terror at his situation and complete inability to express his feelings.Through Cantet a combination of economic script astonishingly sparse and subtle performances and Pook's deeply moving musical score takes the viewer on a journey of displaced despair and futile attempts to paper over the cracks. Recoing is captivating his face a turmoil of quiet bewilderment and pain and he is ably matched by Viard as his increasingly unsettled partner. The penultimate scene between Recoing Viard and their children is quite astonishing for its tension and disquiet.In the end however the final scene says it all. Recoing's face tells us everything we need to know and he really should have won every award going for this brilliant performance. Once again the French film industry shows us all how to make films.";

This is without a doubt one of the most satisfying films coming from France in recent memory. As he proved with his Human Resources M. Cantet loves to present us stories in which characters are at the crossroads of their lives facing dilemmas related to things in the work environment.If you haven't watched the film perhaps you should like to stop reading now.Vincent the main character of Time Out is seen at the beginning of the film driving aimlessly through rural France stopping at rest stops to sleep buying things at roadside shops or just idling around. When he calls his wife Muriel in his cell phone we hear banal conversation between a married couple where the husband is calling home to check on his family. The only trouble is that Vincent is unemployed and he is reluctant to break the news to the family.This man has a lovely wife three normal children. His parents seem to have a good relationship with him. We see no sight of conflict. That is why so hard to understand what makes Vincent tick. Is it shame? Is it an ego thing? Is it his pride? Nothing seems to answer our questions because for all appearances he is a normal person.When Vincent hints about the possibility of a job in Geneva with the UN his father as well as the rest of the family believes him. Vincent witnesses a meeting in the UN building about the investment opportunities in Africa and how is that body going to be instrumental in helping the emerging economies. Suddenly Vincent makes a plan to get some of his friends part with their savings by inventing a sure plan with incredible returns. In a way it seems that people will be reluctant of schemes such as this one but obviously greed play a great deal in their minds and they give money to any charlatan. I know it first hand since I have a close friend that lost a lot of money this way even though he understood about the risks involved.Jean Michel the mysterious man that happens to overhear Vincent pitching the idea to prospective investors realizes the impossibility of the scheme. Vincent tells him about his plight and Jean Michel offers him a job helping him smuggle the counterfeit merchandise that makes a lot of money.Unfortunately for liars discovery is only a phone call away. Muriel finds out the truth and confronts Vincent about it. She tells her father in law who has given an obscene amount of money to Vincent. When the father arrives at the house Vincent flees into the night to the comforting highways that have become his best friends because they don't ask anything of him. Eventually Vincent is seen calling Muriel from a roadside. She pleads with him to come home but he refuses. The turmoil within his soul will not let him see the end of the tunnel. In his own mind there is no solution for the problem he created.The director hints to an easy solution for Vincent with an imminent suicide but no. In the last sequence that ends the picture we watch a Vincent dressed all in black being interviewed for a job that his father has been instrumental in securing for him. Are we seeing the truth or are we seeing what the director has brilliantly done in order to get take us to a possibility that will register as the solution in our minds. The only thing is M. Cantet has left us clues about what really becomes of Vincent.Aurelien Recoing is a terrific actor. As times he reminds us of Kevin Spacey and at times he resembles a more ethereal James Gandolfini but make no mistake M. Recoing is an actor who captured the essence of the troubled Vincent. As Muriel Karin Viard is perfect. She gives a restrained performance. Also Serge Livrozet the kind Jean Michel makes a wonderful appearance.We await for the next work by the amazing Laurent Cantet.".

	schema:reviewBody "TIME OUT Laurent Cantet  France 2001.The English language title Time Out is not entirely fitting. Perhaps Time Running Out would be a more appropriate title since this is exactly what Vincent the main character is going through. Vincent Aurlien Recoing is a highly motivated financial consultant. Or at least that's what he used to be. Fact of the matter is he lost his job three months ago and now concocts an elaborate facade to cover up the fact he is now unemployed. While his wife Muriel Karin Viard thinks he's at work Vincent is aimlessly roaming the highways hanging out at rest stops and sleeping in his car regularly calling his wife to give her an update about his next meeting and apologizing for coming home late before turning in for his overnight stay in his car. Vincent lives like a ghost increasingly detached from his wife children and former colleagues he doesn't seem to realize the truth is closing in. One day they will find out. But Vincent has gotten to a point where he's constructed his own dream world. He resorts to reading all kinds of economic pamphlets about his apparent line of business studying and memorizing them like he really is active in this line of work. As Vincent needs money he makes up a plan to defraud old friends and his parents out of their savings by letting them in on some bogus investment scheme. He conducts his business out of a hotel lounge where he catches the eye of JeanMichel Serge Livrozet a brilliant role a real  experienced operator who immediately recognizes Vincent is a fraud. He offers Vincent a job in his own operation meaning some extra pocket money and perhaps even a way out of his increasingly sticky situation. Director Cantet's style is distinctly unflashy. Set against the wintry landscapes of RhneAlpes around Grenoble and Annecy the film makes very good use of its locations. Whether it's the bland office complexes in the zones commerciales at the outskirts of anonymous towns or the snowclad mountains surrounding them it seems to blend perfectly with the film's tone. Accompanied by a beautiful classical score Cantet shows himself a remarkably sharp and observant storyteller. Although the film maintains interest throughout the running time of 132 minutes did seem a tad long and Vincent's lengthy economic arguments when conning his friends and relatives some of them business men themselves out of their money weren't terribly convincing. His arguments range from unconvincing to downright nonsense. At least he would'n have convinced me but even my 91 year old grandmother wouldn't have bought any of this for a moment. But some of these inconsistencies aside this is a skilfully constructed film and an engrossing psychological drama that slowly unfolds like a thriller with a brilliant performance by Aurlien Recoing to top it off.Camera Obscura  810".

This behavior eventually results in his dismissal  a fact he hides from his family.A white collar worker who has lost enthusiasm for his job  Vincent spends each work day sitting in public parks and eateries fabricating imaginary business meetings and appointments  talking to his wife on a cell phone and promising her that he will be home soon  for supposed longer trips he sleeps in his car at night  interrupted at times by parking lot security who gruffly tell him to leave What follows is a devastating tale of lies and more lies  of eroding relationships with wife  children  parents and friends. Vincent finds himself in a nether world and this film's director  Laurent Cantet  brings a chillingly cold but compassionate eye to the proceedings. Curtly refusing help from a former friend and business associate who is aware of his predicament  Vincent becomes enmeshed in a labyrinth of deceitful money making schemes. If all this seems like so much high melodrama  be assured that Mr. Cantet has painted as naturalistic a portrait of one man's modern day angst as has been seen on the screen in many a moon. Here is a filmmaker who possesses a keen eye for ordinary  everyday life. What distinguishes this magnificent film from most contemporary releases is its total lack of artifice. Each sequence in this riveting movie is so spontaneous that it convinces the viewer that what is happening is real. Much of the credit for this must go to Aurelien Recoing as Vincent. A handsome French actor  he portrays a likable fellow encroaching middle age who has lost his way  as the film progresses  his sturdy frame becomes weighed down as much from literally running away from home and responsibilities as running from himself. Equally impressive is Karin Viard as Vincent's loving but exasperated wife. The movie also benefits immeasurably from the director's penchant for casting on professionals in supporting roles  no better an example than the presence of Serge Livrozet as a petty crook  a character who serves as an important catalyst for the film's gripping denouement. Mr. Livrozet  who acts with the authority of a seasoned professional and turns in a brilliant performance  is in real life an exconvict who apparently lived the life he portrays on screen. This adds a verisimilitude that makes watching this movie such a sobering experience. As spontaneous as this picture feels  it doesn't lack for a meticulous production design. Elegant camera work  carefully appropriated sets  the interiors of the Geneva office building Vincent wanders through look as though they were photographed and designed by Stanley Kubrick  add to the chilly atmosphere. Jocelyn Pook's melancholy chamber music seems suffocatingly oppressive at first but achieves an overwhelming resonance at the story's climax. One man's isolation may not seem like an earth shaking subject for a movie.Playwrights from Becket to Genet to Miller have traversed this area very eloquently in the past. But Laurent Cantet has fashioned a modern day morality tale that very quietly and methodically builds to a fever pitch of anger  loss and sorrow. The final scene of this film is devastating  it will fill you with contradictory emotions. It is one of the great endings in movies. L'Emploi Du temps is a giant of a film  a masterpiece for our time.".

It tells the story about a middleaged man named Vincent who lives in France with his wife named Muriel and their three children. Vincent is a busy man who spends most of his time on the road on business trips and in meetings but he hardly ever shares anything about his professional life with his wife who spends most of her time at home with her children. Vincent has recently lost his job but instead of telling this to his family he invents a false story about being offered a new prestigious job in Genova. Vincent is determined to maintain a certain facade but his betrayal begins to occupy his every breath and suddenly he finds himself deceiving not only his parents his wife and his children but also his closest friends.French filmmaker Laurent Cantet's stylistically and precisely directed fictional tale about a man who in fear of losing face and letting his family down entangles himself in an increasing circle of lies which distances him furthermore from his loved ones draws a realistic portrayal of a man living in a united and competitive society where the value of success and status apparently has more significance than humane values. This pervasive study of character which examines themes such as family relations interpersonal relations alienation betrayal and love is a finely paced and characterdriven story with naturalistic milieu depictions notable cinematography by the director's frequent collaborator and cinematographer Pierre Milon and with an effective score by British composer Jocelyn Pook which underlines the poignant atmosphere.This throughout riveting independent film which was produced by Caroline Benjo who has produced most of Laurent Cantet's feature films is brilliantly narrated and functions both as a psychological drama and a subtle thriller. An austere gripping and detailed character drama with remarkable acting performances by French actor Aurlien Recoing and French actress Karin Viard which gained among other awards the Don Quixote Award at the 58th Venice Film Festival in 2001.".

This pervasive study of character which examines themes such as family relations interpersonal relations alienation betrayal and love is a finely paced and characterdriven story with naturalistic milieu depictions notable cinematography by the director's frequent collaborator and cinematographer Pierre Milon and with an effective score by British composer Jocelyn Pook which underlines the poignant atmosphere.This throughout riveting independent film which was produced by Caroline Benjo who has produced most of Laurent Cantet's feature films is brilliantly narrated and functions both as a psychological drama and a subtle thriller. An austere gripping and detailed character drama with remarkable acting performances by French actor Aurlien Recoing and French actress Karin Viard which gained among other awards the Don Quixote Award at the 58th Venice Film Festival in 2001.";

He does not tell his family about his being fired and not just because he does not want to face the humiliation. He remarks that his old job used to require his driving long distances and that was the only time he was happy. He said that he could just drive forever listening to music in a thoughtless state. In fact that is how he lost his job he would be so in the moment when driving that he would miss his turnoffs. That seems to be what Vincent wants just to cruise in neutral without the obligations of job and family.When Vincent lost his job he entered into a sort of fantasy world where he made up a position as a worker for the United Nations as a manager who would set up teams of managers to set up companies in Africa.

It's ironic that the job environment that Vincent had been cut loose from endowed him with the skills to run the scam he did.When Vincent walks the halls of various businesses where people are in meetings exchanges are taking place between boss and secretary phone calls are being taken paperwork being filled out it looks like important stuff is happening. But the undercurrent is that there is more busywork going on than anything of value. However you do see the human value of belonging to the social structure of a corporation.As Vincent Aurlien Recoing is skillful in capturing the illusory world that he has entered. Karin Viard as Vincent's caring and concerned wife is particularly good.At some level Vincent knows that his time out must end. As evidence of this we see him paying back a friend that he had taken money from as an investor. There is a powerful scene toward the end where Vincent's whole family confronts him and he absconds by jumping out the window. From there he literally spends time lost in the wilderness.The final scene has Vincent being offered a high level job where he would have a staff of eight and a lot of responsibility. You would think that that would be a happy ending but as Vincent's eyes slid to the side as the job was being explained to him this was for me a depressing ending since I sensed he was soon going to be right back where he was when he was wandering in the dark. It will be but another chapter in the life of a man who never really made a decision about what he wanted to do but rather just went with the flow and followed the money and society's pressures. It is a commentary on how so many well paying jobs now amount to moving bits around in computer memories and dealing with paperwork and phone calls. And how for many people those jobs provide such little meaning and satisfaction.".

The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation' as Thoreau said.  When the movie begins Vincent is already driving around sleeping in his car and calling from the hyperspace of hiscell phone to pretend to his family that he's still at work.  Later he admits he's not at his old job but claims he's working in Switzerland at an even better one for the UN helping developing nations in Africa.  When we see him on his wanderings in hotels parking lots and corporate headquarters we feel he's killing time the French title L'Emploi du Temps' simply means use of time' but also fantasizing escaping and gathering material for his scam.  He's creating a new life for himself and when he's back among friends and family he's enthusiastic.  The fantasy has him excited and the job' contains the one thing he liked about his old job  the long drives  without the boring meetings and paper work.The friend I saw Time Out' with has experience with the unemployed and said this behavior is commonplace  lots of people who are out of work pretend they're not.  But the movie doesn't feel commonplace to me.  I feel it creates a new cinematic language' as they said of Antonioni's L'Avventura' which had a similarly dreamlike glacial pace.  In both cases the mood is compelling and hypnotic. Time Out' also evokes some of the films of Chabrol or the Ripley novels of Patricia Highsmith in showing an apparently conventional bourgeois character who underneath is isolated strange and scary.  The power of such pieces is the tension between the conventional and the criminal. Vincent is soon doing something illegal  bilking friends and former coworkers out of large and small sums of money in a getrichquick scheme that's supposed to relate to his connections in Africa  and then he's recruited by JeanMichel the smooth reptilian Serge Livrozet a dealer in contraband.  It's strange to see how conventional Vincent always seems through all this. But the really shocking thing is that he's pretending to be someone he isn't not just to his friends and former associates and anyone he meets but also to his wife and three kids. A strange sense of disquiet comes over us as we see Vincent getting away with all his scams.  It seems nothing will ever go wrong for him but we know he is doomed.  Or is he?  The ending is the biggest surprise of all.Aurlien Recoing the gifted movie newcomer who plays Vincent in Time Out' looks something like Kevin Spacey but unlike Spacey he isn't sly selfconscious and stagey but has a recessive manner.  When an emotion plays across Recoing's face it seems teased out of him from outside rather than projected from within.  His apparent joy at his invented new job' puts us off guard because we'd expect his twilightzone wandering and the unemployment he's hiding to depress him. His older son Julien Nicolas Kalsch is cool and wants to ignore Vincent but does he suspect'?  I don't think so I think Julien is just being a rebellious teenager  at first. Julien's steady straightforward demeanor is a point of reference for the movie.  He's the only person in the family who's sure in his limited way of who he is and what his values are.  Vincent's wife Muriel Karin Viard is on the cusp uncertain suspicious but a lover as well as a wife willing to respond to whatever signals Vincent sends out.  When she meets Vincent in Switzerland there's a disquieting scene where she keeps seeming to disappear in the snow.  The scene reflects her uncertainty.  Will she follow Vincent wherever he goes?  Almost imperceptibly as the movie progresses the situation becomes more and more dangerous for Vincent and his fabricated world seems about to explode.The paradox is that Vincent is trying to be free by deceiving everybody and reinventing himself but he is completely the slave of their expectations and of his scams.  His family is always present to him and to us  isn't the whole game primarily for their benefit?  but he's terribly alone.  In signaling that aloneness again Julien is a key figure because Julien avoids his father then rejects him.  Muriel is searching for him looking into that recessive face going over his body trying to find a truth she can respond to.It's worthwhile to see Time Out' as a riff on a theme rather than a pedestrian recreation of the true story it's based on  whose dramatic ending Cantet has removed.  The movie doesn't just tell a story though it's full of the suspense a good story contains.  It's a disquieting mood piece that shows how we're all groping toward identity  often feeling like we're frauds  and how modern office workers are detached from anything real. Cantet's previous movie Human Resources' was about a factory strike and dramatized the conflicts between a working class father and his well educated son who as a manager is expected to supervise his own father's early dismissal from a lifetime spent at the factory.  Not many directors could have made such a social issue both so intellectually clear and so emotionally fraught.  This time Cantet has continued his study of labor issues but carried them to a philosophical indeed existential level and Time Out' is a more original and thought provoking movie than Human Resources.'  Its dark mournful vision creates a disturbing aftereffect. Instead of murdering his family as the reallife original of Vincent did or simply disappearing as he seems about to do this Vincent reappears seven months after his firing to be offered a plum job at a new firm.  We know he will not like this job. It's a terrifying No Exit' finale very upbeat and absolutely depressing.".

	schema:headline " Vincent's oblivious journey in taking some time out for himself became une grande illusion";
	schema:reviewBody "The beginning shot as the credits appear looks so painterly  the soft tone seemed serenely neutral  not until a slight movement in the picture do I realize what we're looking at and where the scene is. This is another film previously I commented on World Traveler distributed by ThinkFilm whose company logo has the ' i ' upside down in 'Think.' TIME OUT is challenging for the camera there's quite a percentage of time we spend with central character Vincent a distinctive subtle portrayal from Aurlien Recoing inside a car on the road at night time out in the fog or rain even scenes with extensive snow and whiteness all around. Cinematographer Pierre Milon skillfully delivered. The English film title Time Out could suggest just that Vincent needs to 'time out' pause and take a look at his life so far. The French title L'emploi du temps indicates the use of the occasion which Vincent certainly does he's literally taking the 'given' time making use of it by giving himself a break from the accumulated stress at work and mounting expectations at home. He looks at ease being out of his 9year long corporate position. He enjoys being alone by himself driving and singing along to a tune. Such bliss. It's stress putting on a mask. Solitude is the temporary palliative. For a while Vincent is in control of the situation at hand. Even managed to transiently delight Muriel his dear wife. When will this playacting  lying without a blink stop? When the tap is finally loosen a bit  meeting JeanMichel the bottled up truth released. How relieving to pour out to a total stranger. It's a respite he's actually happy not having to exhaust himself in weaving his lies keeping up a front hustling friends and father for finances.  Again as in director Laurent Cantet's previous film Ressources humaines there is the latent gap between father and son.

	onyx:emotionText "The beginning shot as the credits appear looks so painterly  the soft tone seemed serenely neutral  not until a slight movement in the picture do I realize what we're looking at and where the scene is. This is another film previously I commented on World Traveler distributed by ThinkFilm whose company logo has the ' i ' upside down in 'Think.' TIME OUT is challenging for the camera there's quite a percentage of time we spend with central character Vincent a distinctive subtle portrayal from Aurlien Recoing inside a car on the road at night time out in the fog or rain even scenes with extensive snow and whiteness all around. Cinematographer Pierre Milon skillfully delivered. The English film title Time Out could suggest just that Vincent needs to 'time out' pause and take a look at his life so far. The French title L'emploi du temps indicates the use of the occasion which Vincent certainly does he's literally taking the 'given' time making use of it by giving himself a break from the accumulated stress at work and mounting expectations at home. He looks at ease being out of his 9year long corporate position. He enjoys being alone by himself driving and singing along to a tune. Such bliss. It's stress putting on a mask. Solitude is the temporary palliative. For a while Vincent is in control of the situation at hand. Even managed to transiently delight Muriel his dear wife. When will this playacting  lying without a blink stop? When the tap is finally loosen a bit  meeting JeanMichel the bottled up truth released. How relieving to pour out to a total stranger. It's a respite he's actually happy not having to exhaust himself in weaving his lies keeping up a front hustling friends and father for finances.  Again as in director Laurent Cantet's previous film Ressources humaines there is the latent gap between father and son. Candid communication and patient understanding from both sides are dearly lacking. In TIME OUT Vincent is often on the road and away from home and family a schoolteacher wife and 3 children. He assumes the family man responsibility matter of factly unaware of the increasing chasm he's creating between himself and Muriel sensitively portrayed by Karin Viard even though he continues as usual calling her from 'work' on his cell phone letting her know his 'whereabouts' putting up a front under his conscienceclearing rationale that Muriel is too weak to take the news that he was actually fired from his job.

It is an oversimplification to say that this intelligent movie is about losing one's job and going to unethical extremes to make ends meet for it is nothing less than a penetrating look at the conformity alienation and spiritual emptiness of modern life and how one man rebels against it. Vincent Renault doesn't simply get fired. He courts his firing because he is sick and tired of the shallow yuppie grind his responsibilities to his young family and the unrealistic expectations of his affectionate but controlling wife his overbearing father and his affluent circle of friends. He has experienced a crisis of confidence following a gradual loss of meaning and for a guy who functions on enthusiasm it's too much to bear. He thus appears to be singularly unmotivated to deal with socalled reality. All he wants to do is drive around smoking and listening to the radio with no obligations to anyone but himself. Sleeping in his car yet in constant touch with home by cell phone he maintains the illusion of continued employment as a traveling consultant for the French company that terminated him because he can't face the disappointment of his family and friends nor stand up to their renewed pressures upon him. Knowing this facade of normality can't last for long he invents an exciting new career in Switzerland somewhat removed from their prying eyes but the ruse only pushes him deeper into a selfdestructive web of lies. Borrowing a large sum from his father to get set up and defrauding old acquaintances he sidesteps the growing concern and suspicion of his wife and avoids the wideeyed vaguely accusing stares of his spoiled middle class children. As he explains to a sympathetic Swiss hotelier a worldliwise smuggler of cheap knockoffs he is simply trying to win some time before he must face the inevitable. When it comes in the form of a resolution to his dilemma we sense that his troubled soul has not been palliated in the least.".

Aurelien Recoing the hero of Laurent Cantet's L'EMPLOI DU TEMPS doesn't summon the instant empathy we feel for those actors. Cantet is a schematist in the style of Arthur Miller without Miller's cornballs but also without his visceral punch. Recoing's very body seems to be a manifestation of Cantet's twosided patness. From the front Recoing has some of the bland boyishhaired handsomeness of a Skarsgard or a young Klaus Maria Brandauer. From the back balding and bearlikehulking Recoing is a monster or a wreck. Cantet's moviesoldschool slowly downhillrolling tragedies about the inhumanity of late capitalismuse JekyllandHyde dichotomies for thudding dramatic effects.Recoing's Vincent has lost his job as a management consultant. Instead of getting another one he drives around hangs out in officebuilding lobbies and hotel bars and generally dresses and comports like an uppermiddleclass Frenchman. When he starts dreaming up a fantasy jobbringing bucks to developing markets in the Third World via the U.N.he starts taking money from alltooeager friends to invest. Then a middleclass mobster is onto Vincent's scheme. And from there...before you can say FARGO the cards come tumblin' down.Like Cantet's last movie HUMAN RESOURCES we are meant to hate the game not the player and to believe that a rigged soulless system has robbed Cantet's characters of their capacity to experience joy on earth. But what does this character want exactly? At one moment he seems to genuinely wish he had the idealistic U.N. jobsomething at his stage of life with his background in the forprofit world he could never attain. At other moments he seems to want to drive around the snowy countryside and listen to golden oldies. At still others he seems to enjoy a la Kevin Spacey in AMERICAN BEAUTY the undemanding work of selling hot stereos and toasters for his mafia friend. And yet Cantet has designed the movie to make it seem as if the need for status for patriarchal prestige has led Vincent into the fantasy land that is his undoing. The endinga softer landing than you might be expectingis meant to be soulchilling.But what's the big whip? Everyone has dreamed of a life of aimless rambling those who have it never seem very happy with it. Cantet could've tested his ideas if he had bought Vincent a ticket to a lazybones' paradise. And Cantet underlines the irony that Vincent's hustling to keep himself in nonwork is in itself a more than fulltime job. Cantet's movies struggle for a Millerlike inevitability but they always fail to persuade on a human level his crushed heroes seem more constructs than creatures. One brilliantly observant and shudderinducingly cruel moment Vincent's wife catches on to his ruse when he brings a buddy from the office to dinnera pockmarked hustler who is too lowclass to inhabit the highflown world Vincent pretends to have a berth in. The jig is up for Vincent because his wife's snob meter goes off. Too bad nothing else is as acutely examined or observant.".

The opening scene where we the title character Vincent slumped over a car wheel as a school bus dumps the kids makes one thinks he is waiting on his child but alas the child is at home.

If it was an American movie you can imagine the guy would be full of wrath and swing a baseball bat at anything that moves and doesn't move a la Michael Douglas in Falling Down. But the actor didn't need to convey such bodily action.The ending was a bit poignant and I sometimes wonder whatever happened to him. Did he end up working supporting his family?Remarkably Time Out is based on a true story although the true story is far more violent and disturbing than Time Out.".

The main culprits are the script which fails to offer any kind of insight into the protagonist's baffling actions and the direction which drags out the uninteresting details of his mindnumbing scheme interminably instead of attempting to connect you with any of the characters on an emotional level. When making a film about a regular person doing things as ridiculous as these it is crucial to do these things and Time Out does neither. Instead I was stuck for two astonishingly slow hours watching a man the film never tells me anything about engage in a laughably amateurish plot for reasons that make no sense. The tension I have read reviews praise this film for generating must have been surgically removed before the film made its way into my DVD player because last time I checked tension over a film's events requires at least an iota of engagement with what is occurring on screen which this film seems utterly uninteresting in eliciting.".

He plays football but harbors no illusions about a career in that direction. The pros won't take anyone his size so he just wants to get to college to study engineering. His working class father and brother can't get him there and as a B student no academic scholarships are in the offing. Football really is his life.The difference between Bedford Falls and Ampipe is the difference between a rising and falling economy. If you remember in It's A Wonderful Life George Bailey gets Sam Wainwright to reopen the old glass works for a plastics factory instead of locating in Rochester. There's a future in Bedford Falls like there is none in the Eighties Ampipe where industry is relocating to the south and even out of the country. The future is definitely not in rustbelt Pennsylvania. Everybody wants out of that place except those with no future. Cruise's girlfriend Lea Thompson is jealous because as a bandmember there ain't no scholarships for him. The coach Craig T. Nelson wants a winning season so he can get a prize college coaching job. All his other players have ambitions like Cruise.All the Right Moves was Tom Cruise's sixth film and first dramatic lead it's the film that made him a star. He was first billed in Losin' It and Risky Business but this one showed what a good actor he was. If it wasn't for All the Right Moves Tom Cruise's career would have faded with the eighties. Lea Thompson gives good support to Tom and Craig T. Nelson is far from the coach that we see in Coach. He's a bitter driven man and not happy when some in the town toilet paper his house after a loss and he sees Cruise on the scene.Paul Carafotes and Christopher Penn are a couple of other football players whose lives take an abrupt change in direction by other reasons than football. Best supporting player in the film though is James Battico who's stayed all his life in Ampipe. He turns out to be a malevolent creep very similar to Robert DeNiro in This Boy's Life.Ampipe stands for American PipeSteel. The town the high school is named it. But the very name I'm sure gives rise to other less flattering nicknames that I'm sure anyone reading this will come up with.All the Right Moves is one of the best coming of age films ever made and should never be missed when broadcast.".

I'm 24 and just viewed this movie for the first time last week by stumbling upon it at my parent's house while I was visiting for the weekend. Why do you care? I live in Johnstown where this movie was filmed as was 1977's Paul Newman classic Slap Shot and I had never heard of this film! So I find this dusty VHS copy and take it home with me to view. As i pull it out of its slip sleeve a yellowed napkin falls out with Tom's autograph on it! Turns out when I was about 1 my parents brought me down to Johnstown to ride on the Inclined Plane and I was introduced to Tom Cruise. I never knew?! So knowing that I had to give the movie a thorough watching and I must say I have a little pride that that film was shot here. It was an enjoyable movie although the ending was a little dry. The sad part of the film is all the activity and energy that takes place in the movie with the steel mills is no longer here. The mills have been shut down for about 20 years and the city is pretty much in a depressed state. It's good to watch the movie just to get a glimpse of what this area use to be. So watch it enjoy it heck you can even rent it from the rental place a block from my house. That place is called All the Right Movies. Enjoy! P.S. For the Kid's sake It is rated R for strong language and some intense nudity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ampipe Johnstown PA a depressed and gritty steel town located just outside of Pittsburgh is in obvious decline. It had been founded long before by Ampipe Pipe and Steel when steel was big. In the old days young men left high school acquired a job at the mill married fathered children and bought a house while they were still young. Most of the local men still work at Ampipe but layoffs are increasing. Enter Stef Djordjevic Tom Cruise a cornerback for his Ampipe High School football team The Bulldogs who wants a college scholarship to an engineering college his ticket out of town. He displays his Penn State pennant on his bedroom wall. Stef resides with his father Charles Cioffi and older brother Rick Gary Graham both of whom work in the mill. Stef doesn't always act in a nice way but is generally likable. His problem is his attitude which drives his Coach Nickerson Craig T. Nelson mad as a hatter. Stef does not always listen to his coach's teachings. Stef maintains a B average at Ampipe High not good enough for a college scholarship. So he needs football as his meal ticket. Stef happens to be a very good defensive player although he is not the star of his team. Meanwhile Coach Nickerson too is looking for a way out of Ampipe as he has a chance to become defensive backfield coach at Cal Poly. The coach is tough and nononsense and really works his players hard during the practices. He is less than perfect and when players make mistakes he considers them as quitters on the team. Even though the movie revolves around high school football it is more about interpersonal relationships than about the gridiron. In fact the big game against the Knights of Walnut Heights a richer school undefeated and ranked number three in Pennsylvania occurs only halfway through the movie not at the denouement. And yet an interesting wellfilmed piece does involve the road game the long bus journey to Walnut Heights with the players thinking their individual thoughts the tensions in the locker room the pregame prep talk the long spiral football spinning through the air the hard hits and grunts in the rain and the eventual heartbreaking loss. Nevertheless the important matter is the story of life as when the two teenaged protagonists Stef and Lisa Lea Thompson finally get around to expressing their true feelings. Secondary characters have their stories to tell. There are the men laid off from work who drown their sorrows in the local gin mill. One young man in financial difficulty becomes desperate enough to commit a robbery. A lifechanging event involves a cheerleader who becomes pregnant. Then there are the antics of a bar room bully. Stef himself becomes tense as his expected football scholarships fail to materialize. In summary the plot is decent and even though the movie is not a great one is still worth watching.".

Nevertheless the important matter is the story of life as when the two teenaged protagonists Stef and Lisa Lea Thompson finally get around to expressing their true feelings. Secondary characters have their stories to tell. There are the men laid off from work who drown their sorrows in the local gin mill. One young man in financial difficulty becomes desperate enough to commit a robbery. A lifechanging event involves a cheerleader who becomes pregnant. Then there are the antics of a bar room bully. Stef himself becomes tense as his expected football scholarships fail to materialize. In summary the plot is decent and even though the movie is not a great one is still worth watching.";

Tom Cruise gives a wonderful performance indicative of his future superstardom and even though Craig T. Nelson seems to be typecast as a coach he plays the role to perfection. The scene of the big game against neighboring rival Walnuts Heights was shot so masterfully you felt like you were on the 50 yard line. You could just feel the tension in the locker room before kickoff. Even though this film came out when I was 11 years old I remember in high school our whole football team would gather at the coach's house the night before a game and watch this movie. I don't think that there has ever been a movie since that has come along that portrays high school football its significance to Small Town USA and the young men who portray the roles of Friday Night Gods with such gritty realism as this film.".

	schema:headline " The best high school sports movie ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "It took me 28 years to finally get around to seeing this high school football drama but it was well worth the wait and probably for the best since I appreciate it far more now at 40 than I could've at 12.I remember when it came out in late 1983 a few months after Tom Cruise became a star through Risky Business. Despite a solid publicity campaign All the Wrong Moves failed to reap a huge benefit from Cruise's presence. The movie grossed a modest 17233166 at the American box office and quickly faded into obscurity.Then I saw it in the 3 bin at Big Lots and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did because it's a diamond in the rough definitely the best high school sports movie I've ever seen. Rather than the usual sports movie clichs such as the focus on the big game this is a heavyweight drama that's about football on the surface but life at the core.Stefen Stef Djordjevic played by Cruise resides in the blue collar town of Ampipe Pennsylvania where he plays cornerback for the local high school football team. He resides with his older brother Rick Gary Graham and their father Charles Cioffi both of whom work in the local steel mill as does seemingly every man in town. Stef's and Rick's mother is dead and the three Djordjevic men seem to all have a pretty good relationship with each other. And at a couple of points in the latter half of the movie the father shows great support in the midst of his son's hardships.Now a senior Stef is a moderate college prospect and has realistic expectations. Being a mere 5'10 178 cm and white he has no illusions of making the NFL and being a B student he has no illusions of getting an academic scholarship. But he hopes to attain a college football scholarship and earn a degree in engineering. Still he's uncomfortable with the possibility of being far away from his beautiful cheerleader girlfriend Lisa Lea Thompson a junior who adores him even though she's not a football fan.Ampipe's next game is at Walnut Heights who is undefeated and ranked 3 in the state as well as located in a much wealthier area. Stef and some of his teammates view the game as an opportunity to impress college scouts and break away from what they see as a dead end town. Ampipe is economically struggling and the steel mill is laying off many workers. And the team's tough nononsense head coach Nickerson Craig T. Nelson is also looking beyond the town pursing college assistant coaching jobs.Late in the game with Ampipe trailing 107 Stef intercepts a pass and returns it for a touchdown. But shortly afterward while disobeying Nickerson's order to go after the ball instead of the receiver Stef commits a crucial pass interference penalty that contributes to his team losing. In the locker room right after the game he and Nickerson have an argument that results in Stef's dismissal from the team. Nickerson won't even Stef ride home on the team bus and tells him to ride with the cheerleaders.Instead he hitches a ride home with some Ampipe fans who stop at Nickerson's house and vandalize it. Not realizing what they were going to do Stef unsuccessfully tries to stop it. Nickerson's daughter hears the vandalizing and tells her father who goes outside and sees the vandals fleeing. It's initially uncertain whether he got a close enough look at Stef.But the next week Stef visits Nickerson at a football practice apologizing for his role in the argument and asking for reinstatement to the team which has only one game left. But Nickerson says that he saw Stef at Nickerson's house that night after the game. Stef insists that he did none of the vandalizing but Nickerson doesn't believe that.The day of the game Greg and 700 others get laid off from the steel mill. In his ensuing depression he goes out and gets drunk. While he's gone Lisa comes over and she and Stef have sex for the first time.The next few weeks are chaotic for Stef and his teammates. Brian Christopher Penn having just accepted a scholarship offer from USC learns that his girlfriend Tracy Paige Lyn Price is pregnant. They keep the baby and get married. Vinnie Salvucci Paul Carafotes gets arrested for armed robbery. And Stef's previous scholarship offers are revoked leading him to believe that he was blackballed by Nickerson. And though Lisa is bitter about athletes getting scholarships while other deserving students don't she goes to Nickerson's wife and tries to intervene.And without revealing the ending I will say that it has great messages of forgiveness and the selflessness inherent in pure love.All the Right Moves mostly lives up to its title. All of the performances are top notch and both 80s small town high school life and the atmosphere of big time high school football are portrayed flawlessly. I also like that the school has a good mix of blacks and whites and that people of the two races have much positive interaction throughout the movie both on and off the football team.In addition the scenery brings Ampipe powerfully to life and the rock dominated soundtrack while not one of the best of the genre further cements the movie's early 80s feel. And don't be turned away if you're not a football fan. The movie actually contains only one game scene. While the surface theme as I said is football many other surface themes could equally be used to teach the same lessons.The movie is a fairly heavy R mostly for language and a couple of semigraphic sex scenes but if you can tolerate that it's hard to find a better teen dominated drama than this.".

Stef played by one of my fave actors Tom Cruise is similar to his character Joel from Risky Business.

The songs do a superb job of setting the tone for the given scene. For example when Stef is rounding second base with Lisa in the car the bus ride to the big football game the party and the end credits.  Sometimes I watch ATRM just to hear Blue Skies Forever sung by Frankie Miller.All the Right Moves is a good film to watch if you like high school football are expecting an athletic scholarship or if you don't like your coach.  This movie paved the way for other football flicks like Varsity Blues.  Look for it on The Family Channel or at usedmovie stores.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing here you haven't already seen many times before. All the Right Moves is one big clich from beginning to end. The small mill town where nobody ever amounts to anything. The high school football team that the townspeople take much too seriously. The kid who sees football as his only way out. The girlfriend who is not appreciated because well she doesn't play football and nobody in this town cares about anything besides football. The big game that the team just has to win. The setbacks before that big game that will make it much harder for them to do so. The conflict between players and their coach. Secondary characters but not our hero heaven forbid making terrible decisions which will destroy their future. The problem our hero faces and the inevitable way that problem will be dealt with. If you can't see very early on how all this is going to turn out well you obviously haven't seen too many movies. This is about as predictable as movies get.About the only thing which makes this film even remotely noteworthy are the actors playing the key roles. Tom Cruise is the young football star Craig T. Nelson his coach and Lea Thompson his girlfriend. Cruise Nelson and Thompson were obviously destined for bigger and better things. Here their performances are all fine with the more seasoned Nelson unsurprisingly being the most convincing. Cruise and Thompson have a rather awkward romance capped by a rather awkward love scene but as they're playing young naive high school kids the awkwardness actually seems to fit. Unfortunately though in the grand scheme of things the actors really don't have much to work with. The characters are unoriginal and clichd. The story is one we've seen in various incarnations many times before. There's really nothing of note to keep your attention. And the whole thing comes with a sense of inevitability to it that lessens the sense of drama one might otherwise feel. This one will not live long in the memory.".

And the whole thing comes with a sense of inevitability to it that lessens the sense of drama one might otherwise feel. This one will not live long in the memory.";

The only options open to them in the town are to work in the steel mill which is currently laying off workers.  The film shows the many barriers that trap the youngsters in the town.This is one of Cruise's first films and it is a lot less glossy than many of his stardriven projects now it's a lot more rough and ready than he would let it be if he made it now.  It is a very simple story and a very short film  it basically shows a group of friends trapped in the town who have dreams of more but must overcome obstacles to get to college.  Cruise must overcome the team coach's dislike for him to get a recommendation Penn finds himself with a pregnant girlfriend who he must marry Paul Carafotes finds himself drawn into crime to make ends meet.  The lesson of the film is that it's difficult to break a cycle where you're in an industrial town and are expected to go into the same type of work as your father etc.The most interesting thing about this is how young all the actors are! We've all got used to their faces now and it's weird seeing how young Cruise Penn and Lea Thompson once were.  The story is OK but is a little clichd and is all a bit tidy towards the end.  The football action is not exciting but I suppose is a muddily realistic representation of small town school sports.  The performances are good considering the young cast and Chris Penn and Craig T. Nelson provide the two best roles.  Cruise is a little too overplayed and brings a bit too much teenage anger and angst to the role.Overall it's an interesting film a little clichd but OK.  Personally I found it a little boring and didn't really care what happened to Cruise but it's not too bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Please remember that a film doesn't have to be perfect or even close to be worthwhile. If it contains some interesting and memorable elements than it has lasting value. Having said that let me address this one and refute some of the accusations of clich. Let's start with the setting. The opening sequence around town and the football practice scenes portray a combination of gritty urban reality and unrefined sylvan ambiance with remarkable effectiveness. Interestingly I don't necessarily think that living in a small woodsy town having close family and friends and working with your hands is such a terrible fate. If your mill closes down there are other towns within commutable distance to work in. What if this movie was set in the Spring? Maybe that part of the country is lovely in Spring. So we are shown the region with a slanted spin as it is set in the Fall. I lived in a depressed logging town at about the time of this movie but the difference is that it was totally isolated. Conversely Ampipe the town in this movie is not far from Pittsburgh and its' suburbs. Nevertheless I get the basic depressed vibe and I'm sure it existed. Tom Cruise brought heart to this role. There's a scene where he is no longer the cocky jock but rather simply a boy in need of a mother and seeking refuge in the reassuring arms of his father. What a uniquely gentle moment for a film about a high school football player. There was nothing clich about it and Cruise pulled it off with savvy. For the record no one is stuck in any town in America. What about Junior College what about just moving to a bigger town? So of course I don't buy the clichd stuck in this town without a way out theme entirely. The gentility of the young couple's sex scene where they lose their virginity is not clichd. It is tasteful sensitive and totally believable. Tom Cruise's character looks a bit scared in awe and very conscious of the significance of the moment. Again beautifully played. Lea Thompson is lovely in this film and does a masterful job of portraying a teen in love. She sees that her boyfriend is selfcentered but she has the sixth sense of a small town girlfriend that helps her see his the finer aspects of his character. We used to rely on real girls to provide balance in society and bring out the best in a man. The music is simply great. All The Right Moves and Blue Skies Forever are 80s gems and convey the optimism of a unique cultural time period. There are two apology scenes by men that are done nicely and with simple conviction. It's fresh to see men say they are sorry and to really mean it. Cruise's best scene involves confronting his stubborn football coach in an alley and intermittently sprinting away while throwing his hands up in confounded ire. Beautifully executed. He has talent and perhaps should have pursued more gritty underdog roles than he has. What I loved best was the portrayal of the mixture of hope potential vitality sexuality and angst that color one's last two years of high school. To be an upperclassman athletic in love invincible and free.".

To All the Right Moves credit it doesn't follow that winning formula but it also doesn't necessarily create its own wellstrung story.In one of his first acting roles Tom Cruise stars alongside Craig T. Nelson and Lea Thompson as his coach and girlfriend respectively. If for nothing else this film is worth a watch just for those performances alone. Cruise and Thompson prove to be fearless in their risqu high school roles and Nelson plays a great antagonist and obstacle for Cruise's 'Stefen' character. I can't speak too highly on the film itself but those performances are certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.The biggest issue with All the Right Moves is that it actually tries to make too many 'moves' with its story pun intended. It doesn't really know what it wants to be. On one hand it's a nice coming of age story with Thompson and Cruise. The next it's an intense football drama between two schools. Or even a film that tackles the heavy themes of class struggle and sexuality just to name a few. There's just no real focus here. The minute you start to get invested with what Nelson's team is doing led by Cruise among others it changes its course to another plot point entirely. I appreciate the film's intentions it just didn't hit home the ideas that it set out to and it suffers because of that.What I can say is that this film was probably more of a product of its time. The soundtrack is blatantly filled with slow and smooth 80's tracks that can be distracting. The sound editing as a whole is pretty poor. The football sequences are borderline amateur. And some of the plot points have been done much better in more recent years. Sure that's not the film's fault but it does hinder its rewatchability to an extent. It's fun to watch a young Cruise and Thompson share great chemistry but there's not a lot beneath that.Cruise shows promiseAttempts to explore deep themesBut fails at most of themMisguided direction56100".

Director Michael Chapman and screenwriter Michael Kane deliver a compelling and authentic slice of working class American life with an especially strong and naturalistic grasp of the everyday people with dreams and desires to make something out of their lives.

Cruise brings a winning blend of courage and vulnerability to his role. Lea Thompson contributes a lovely and affecting performance as Stefan's sweet selfless and supportive musician girlfriend Lisa their love scene in particular is very tender and touching. Plus there are sturdy supporting turns by Charles Cioffi as Stefan's proud father Chris Penn as lovable lug Brian Paul Carafotes as the hotheaded Vinnie Salvucci Gary Graham as Stef's weary older brother Greg and James A. Baffico as arrogant blowhard Bosko. Longtime favorite character actors Dick Miller and Terry O'Quinn appear briefly in nifty minor parts. A solid and moving little film.".

This script is one of the most predictable things ever written and just hums by with no surprises of any sort. You can't bring a lot of variation within the formula of a small town drama but for the love of God try a little. Often it just really needs to get to the point because things get pretty boring if you already know the ending an hour beforehand. The raw realistic filming style of the movie is in fact pretty good and really expresses desperation but it just doesn't make the story any more interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "Upon reading other comments this film clearly polarizes viewers. I suggest you read the comment by someone called Phantom Fan who sums up a lot of the story and emotional content quite well in my opinion. As a result I need not repeat. I am old enough to remember the Beatles in their climb to fame but this film is not about that. The film is about John Lennon at 15. This seems to annoy some viewers. If a person reads the ads and sees the trailer it clearly says JOHN LENNON AT 15. So whining about the film not being about John Lennon at 25 and not being about The Beatles seems as though someone did not pay attention to the film's advertising information. What we do have however is a superb production set in the mid 1950s as rock n roll grabbed teens and John Lennon aged 15 realized some emotional hard truths about his family and himself. It just these key emotional Lennon family earthquakes that is the story of this film. Not 'How The Beatles met. The tug of love between two brittle sisters and the increasingly shocked and troubled Lennon let us glimpse the deep ruptures in his romantic psyche that saw his scorching opinions and acidic wit build. This is a great film the art direction and set design allow the viewer to feel as though they are there in those rooms on those days. Aaron Johnson is possibly too handsome for John and is photographed to boost his genuine beauty the photography and the direction are terrific. Interesting for Australian cinema goers is that we are fortunate to have had two award winning films previously about similar family backgrounds CAREFUL HE MIGHT HEAR YOU from 1983 written as a memoir by Sumner Locke Elliott about his life at 6 years old being bounced between two warring aunts and an absent father is almost identical family flashbacks background to NOWHERE BOY. Also Eric Bana's 2008 film with Kobi Smit McPhee called ROMULUS MY FATHER is almost a flipside between a Dad trying to save his son from an unstable mother and her lovers. So perhaps we in Oz are better more willing to applaud NOWHERE BOY on this basis. I found every part of this film compelling and thought Johnson great casting for young Lennon. The two sisters and their unraveling personal issues from their fraught past made excellent drama. I went with it all and I suggest you do too. But be prepared to let it inform you rather than you demand 'a Beatles movie'. My only niggle is the fey depiction of a 15 year old cherubic sissy styled Paul McCartney. NOWHERE BOY went somewhere for me.".

	schema:headline " Knows not where he's going to";
	schema:reviewBody "Period drama has long been a forte of the British cinema prior to this one there had already been at least three excellent examples from 2009 Young Victoria Dorian Grey and An Education. Traditional British costume drama has concentrated on the Victorian era and early twentieth century roughly speaking 18371945 but Nowhere Boy like An Education is set at a rather later period in this case the late fifties.The film is about the adolescence of John Lennon while he was at school and art college in Liverpool. Unlike his three fellow Beatles who were all from workingclass backgrounds Lennon grew up in middleclass suburbia with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George who had raised him since he was five. He was the son of Mimi's younger sister Julia by her husband Alf Lennon referred to in the film as Fred but the marriage was not a success and after Julia began a relationship with another man Mimi took care of the youngster then five years old. Julia did not reappear in Lennon's life until his teenage years when a cousin informed him that contrary to what he had previously thought she was still living in Liverpool only a short walk from his home.The film focuses on the influence these two very different women had on Lennon's early life. Although they were sisters they had wildly contrasting personalities. Julia was a bohemian extrovert liberal in her social views and keen to foster her son's musical and artistic talents. Mimi actually christened Mary Elizabeth may have shared a nickname with the heroine of La Boheme but there was nothing bohemian about her. She was a strict disciplinarian who initially had little sympathy with John's musical aspirations and insisted that he get a proper job although eventually she gave in and agreed to buy him a guitar.The film also charts Lennon's musical development including his first meetings with Paul McCartney and George Harrison Ringo of course did not come onto the scene until a few years later and the birth of The Quarrymen the band which was later to become The Beatles. There is a vivid picture of the British music scene in the late fifties a time when trad jazz and rockandroll seemed to be competing to become the music of the future. There was also a curious British musical form skiffle actually a revival of an earlier American variety of jazz which was influential at the time The Quarrymen started out as a skiffle band.The film also captures the look of the period although the late fifties were a time of increasing material prosperity there was much about British life which had a drab feel about it especially the clothes and the interior decoration schemes. There is a contrast brought out between Mimi's house decorated in various shades of brown and cream and the brighter colours of Julia's which look forward to the more garish tastes that were to predominate in the sixties. I remember growing up in a house where the livingroom combined dark green wallpaper with a bright orange carpet hideous today but unexceptional at the time.It was not so long ago that Kristin Scott Thomas was playing romantic heroines in films like The English Patient today casting directors seem to see her as a middleaged battleaxe in roles like Veronica Whittaker in Easy Virtue. Aunt Mimi at first seems like the bourgeois equivalent of the aristocratic Veronica although she later shows that there is a gentler more caring side to her nature. If Veronica Whittaker ever had a gentler side she kept it wellhidden even from herself. Scott Thomas is even better here than she was in Easy Virtue because the role she is playing is more complex. AnneMarie Duff is also very good as Julia and Aaron Johnson as Lennon seems like a young star in the making. Johnson is perhaps rather more handsome than Lennon was in real life but he is able to convey a real sense of what he must have been like in part a rebellious tearaway whose idea of fun is going for a ride on the roof of a bus part emotionally vulnerable youngster torn between loyalty to his carefree funloving mother and to his aunt the woman who had cared for him since he was very young. The title Nowhere Boy is not just a play on the title of one of Lennon's bestknown songs it is also indicative of John's state of mind as he tries to reconcile these two influences on his life. Like his Nowhere Man he Knows not where he's going to.The film's main appeal will probably be to those with an interest in The Beatles although in my view it can also be seen as a moving comingofage drama which can be enjoyed by those who can't tell Lennon and McCartney from Rodgers and Hammerstein or from Gilbert and Sullivan. It contains not only some great music but also some great acting. This was director Sam TaylorWood's first feature film but it is a debut of which she that's Sam as in Samantha not as in Samuel can be proud. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Visual artist Sam Taylor Wood has crafted the most entertaining and thought provoking piece of Lennon mythology to date in her debut feature film Nowhere Boy.The movie chronicles the adolescent years of John Lennon. Having been brought up by his Aunt Mimi John's world is turned upside when his free spirited mother Julia reenters his life ripping him open and pulling out his artistry as well as pain anger and frustration.A number of films and documentaries have tried and failed to make a definitive statement about John Lennon the human being. The reason why Nowhere Boy is so successful is because we are presented with a complex and multi faceted young man who was a number of things to a number of people and impossible to pigeonhole.Based on the novel by John's sister Julia Baird with the script penned by Matt Greenhalgh Nowhere Boy possesses an enormously strong emotional undercurrent that is missing from many films of the biopic genre. The Lennon legend has risen to almost unparalleled mythical heights within our culture and Greenhalgh does a superb job at humanising the story so much that you forget that you are watching a film about a legend in the making but rather the story of a young boy caught between the women he loves.The women in question are John's Aunt Mimi played by the ever brilliant Kristen Scott Thomas and his mother Julia brought to life in a star making turn by AnneMarie Duff. Though much of the acclaim seems to be percolating around Duff's performance Scott Thomas deserves to be equally praised for making the incredibly complex character of Mimi relatable and sympathetic. In the wrong hands Aunt Mimi could have come across as highly unlikeable considering she can often appear distant and cold but Scott Thomas juxtaposes these instances with such an understated kindness and warmth that we as the audience realise that Mimi is a very caring person who has the misfortune of finding it almost impossible to express sentimental feelings. On the other end of the spectrum Julia appears to be everything Mimi isn't a free spirit who flouts convention and lives for a good time. Julia is a flirt. She flirts with life men and even her own son. There is a rather incestuous undercurrent to her and John's relationship such as when she lays on top of him lost in ecstasy to the tune I Put A Spell On You. The scene is uncomfortable as is many aspects of their relationship. In many ways she seems more like a girlfriend to John and as the movie progresses we begin to understand more and more Mimi's misgivings. In many ways Julia has never really grown up and only knows how to engage with men in this seductive manner.John Lennon is played by relative unknown Aaron Johnson mainly associated with his role in Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging. Johnson breaks free from the shackles of his teen pinup persona and delivers a mature and layered performance worthy of accolades. Johnson fully embodies Lennon's complexities he is both good and bad insecure and arrogant sensitive and brutal caring and careless. From Lennon's wit to his magnetism pain anger and sarcasm Johnson gets it all. Considering Lennon is one of the most imitated celebrities of our time Johnson does well to avoid caricature creating a version of Lennon at his most human. Johnson's vocal abilities also sound eerily reminiscent of a young Lennon making him an excellent choice in more ways than one.Taylor Wood is definitely a talent to watch as she not only elicits fine performances from her cast but also manages to capture the essence of post war Liverpool in a vivid and imaginative way. Gone are the bleak greys squalid mean streets and endless rows of two up two down houses that usually characterises the depictions of the area. Instead we are presented with a much more colorful and vibrant depiction of Liverpool a City just beginning to discover the charms of rock and roll. The excitement in the air is palpable.One of the greatest attributes of Nowhere Boy is the soundtrack crammed with classics from Elvis Presley Screamin' Jay Hawkins Jerry Lee Lewis and Eddie Cochran. Coupled with these original rock songs are covers sung by Aaron Johnson and Thomas Sangstar as their respective characters.Nowhere Boy is an absolute gem of a film that will hopefully find the audience it deserves. You'll laugh cry and kick yourself for not learning guitar in your youth. Possibly the most touching film of the year there is nowhere else you should be on Boxing Day.

The story is beautifully handled from beginning to end and the acting from the three main leads is superb. Aaron Johnson manages to portray Lennon's mixture of cockiness in more ways than one! aggression painful vulnerability bewilderment and sheer adolescent verve with great sureness of touch. We watch Lennon developing from schoolkid into knowing young man and we literally see a different face at the end of the movie to the one we did at the start. Superb playing by Johnson brilliantly assisted by that of Kristin Scott Thomas as his Aunt Mimi and AnneMarie Duff as his mother Julia. It would have been all too easy to lapse into clich with this story but this is largely avoided. We get glimpses of Liverpool  an opening on the steps of St George's Hall a fleeting glimpse of Strawberry Fields a shot of a ferry on the Mersey  but these glimpses are all we need. And the movie closes not with a rendition of an all too predictable 'Nowhere Man' but a beautifully performed 'In Spite of All the Danger'. They say it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll in Nowhere Boy we can see where it and we all began.".

	schema:headline " John Lennon as a young poetic rebel";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess this would be considered an a momentinthelifeofbiopic as it focuses on only a couple of years of preBeatles John Lennon's life in Liverpool England and not his entire life. It is an interesting story and one I did not know. It asks and answers the question Where did Lennon get his start and love for music?

	schema:headline " Angstridden teenage Lennon portrait lacks the necessary wit charm and charisma";
	schema:reviewBody "According to John Lennon's cousin Leila Harvey during the time she knew him when he was between the ages of 9 and 16 he was a happygolucky goodhumored easy going lively lad. But looking at 'Nowhere Boy' the film that is supposed to accurately chronicle the coming of age years of John Lennon you would be more likely to get the impression that he was a troubled and angstridden adolescent who was hardly the happygolucky kid who eventually became the coleader of the greatest rock band of the 20th century. And that is the problem with 'Nowhere Boy'it simply fails to answer why John Lennon was charismatic even in his unformed early days. He was charismatic because he WAS quick witty iconoclastic and wickedly humorous all IN SPITE of his difficult childhood. He was the type of person I believe who never dwelt on the past and probably would have dismissed 'Nowhere Boy' as tendentious nonsense. A few months before his death Lennon spoke about his upbringing and he praised his mother and all of his aunts. There is not a hint of anger or bitterness which Nowhere Boy implies consumed him while growing up There were five women who were my family. Five strong intelligent women. Five sisters. Those women were fantastic ... that was my first feminist education ... One happened to be my mother ... she just couldn't deal with life. She had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me and when I was fourandahalf I ended up living with her elder sister ... the fact that I wasn't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods.Yoko Ono saw 'Nowhere Boy' twice and loved it. This is the same person who promoted Imagine the failed musical about John Lennon which put him up on a pedestal. 'Nowhere Boy' is a different kind of hagiography than the saintly John Lennon served up in the Imagine' musical. Both portraits can be likened to two different views of Christlike figures the saintly Lennon is like the wandering miracle maker dressed in a white robe healing those afflicted with a malaise of the spirit the Nowhere Boy' Lennon is one who undergoes a sort of spiritual crucifixion enduring the slings and arrows of a torturous childhood and adolescence emerging cleansed of all his trials and tribulations through a catharsis.It's understandable that Yoko would hold on to both these idealized images of her slain husband. However Paul McCartney who actually remembers everything about growing up in Liverpool at that time will have none of it. It's said that McCartney strongly objected to the scene where John punches him after his mother's funeral and asked Director Sam TaylorWood who he supposedly was friends with to take the scene out. TaylorWood refused and told him in substance it's just a movie. McCartney knows that Lennon would never have punched him because that would imply that Lennon allowed the bitterness of his upbringing to affect him. The film's scenarists would like us to believe that the climactic scene where he assaults McCartney is where he exorcises his demons and achieves his catharsis recall that he hugs McCartney afterward and apologizes. It's all cheap melodrama which never happened and the type of made up incident which Lennon would have also rejected had he been around to see the movie.While 'Nowhere Boy' does a decent job of fleshing out the relationship between John's mother Julia and the aunt who raised him Mimi the more interesting story is the relationship John had with Paul as well as George and the peers he grew up with. All the key moments are covered in 'Nowhere Boy' including the famous scene where John rides on the top of the bus the first meeting with McCartney the Quarrymen's first gig a sexual encounter with a schoolmate trouble at school buying his first guitarbut it all seems like a glimpse at picture postcards. None of the relationships are developed especially the most important one between Lennon and McCartney. And the real drama of course is not the dragged out familial problems but how the Beatles actually came to be. To make that film one would have had to have the rights to the Beatles catalog a problem which the creators of 'Backbeat' the 1994 film about the Beatles Hamburg days were also unable to overcome. Perhaps the strongest aspect of 'Nowhere Boy' are the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas as Mimi and AnneMarie Duff as Julia. Thomas is thoroughly convincing as the 'tough love' substitute parent playing opposite the troubled Bohemian of sorts Julia. You can see how both women influenced Lennon's personalityhe inherited Mimi's discipline and Julia's creativity and rebelliousness. Aaron Johnson manages to capture little of Lennon's great wit and humor but is saddled by the ponderous script. The makeup department should be commended for making Johnson look like Lennon especially once he adopts the Elvis pompadour. Thomas BrodieSangster takes a shot at Paul but doesn't look enough like the 'handsome' Beatle to be convincing. The actor who plays George looks nothing at all like him and the part is woefully underdeveloped. We're informed by a prominent Beatles historian that 'Nowhere Boy' is the first film that covers John Lennon's early years including his upbringing and creation of the Beatles. While it does cover most of the bases and does a decent job of defining the characters of Lennon's mother and aunt Lennon himself comes off as a bit pathetic. Putting it another wayhe's a character that all the joy has been sucked out of and his angstridden replacement seems far from the flesh and blood rock icon revered by millions.".

TaylorWood has consciously avoided any direct reference to the man that we all knew John Lennon would become although there are implicit signposts placed in the visual narrative. Instead his part in creating The Beatles assumed the director concentrates on the far from simple facts of his coming of age acquaintance with music and with real panache the social climate in which this all came about.The central narrative concerns the ying and yang relationships that John has with his aunt Mimi and rediscovered mother Julia. It is hard to imagine how these three parts would be better played than by you'renot foolinganyoneicequeen Kristin ScottThomas and the effervescent life force of Anne Marie Duff respsectively. There's some fine screen acting going on here. Yet the tortured break with a prosaic echt English aunt and the intense Oedipal love for a irresistible mother would be nothing without the right John  and where Aaron Johnson's been I've no idea. His great ability is to trip off endless social anachronisms turns of phrase that would seem unPC illadvised or simply too cheeky today with a body language to suggest that he has no idea of the ramifications or combativeness of such an attitude. This is what makes the rocknroll about to burst from the back of the screen like the Third Reich in Haneke's White Ribbon so palpable so believable.A good film told briskly and with rich nuance. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Nowhere Boy is a film based the biography Imagine This Growing Up With My Brother John Lennon written by his half sister Julia Baird. It tells the untold story of the late teenage years of one of the greatest musicians of all time John Lennon and the strong influences his mother Julia Lennon AnneMarie Duff and his aunt Mimi Smith Kristin Scott Thomas who created the foundation for his future as a person and the indelible mark he was about to leave on music forever. The film has created quite a racket throughout the UK since its release in December 2009 capturing four well deserved British Academy Film Award nominations including Outstanding British Film Best Supporting Actress AnneMarie Duff and Kristen Scott Thomas and Outstanding Director Debut Sam Taylor Wood. These awards are the fire that the film is running off of for its debut in the United States this month.Aaron Johnsons does a very good interpretation of his character John Lennon and reveals the mischievous antics of the teen aged John Lennon and the constant internal battle Lennon fought inside of himself to find out who he was. He is guided by the outstanding performances of Duff and Thomas as his guardians through his very rough childhood. Duff leads the cast with the best performance in the entire film by seamlessly embodying the character of John Lennon's mother Julia and has an American Oscar Nomination waiting for her in the upcoming months. These performances combined with the unique storytelling style of Director Wood and writer Matthew Greenhalgh with the help of Julia Baird's memoirs have created a film that is very different than a lot of films that focus on the lives of renown figures in history. They do this by focusing a narrow period of time allowing them to delve deep into the plot and story development giving the audience time to take in the entirety of the story instead of stretching the film over a twenty plus year period of time. The integrity that Wood and Greenhlgh produce with this style of filming allows the acting performances to flourish and creates the lost persona of the John Lennon to be fully exemplified. I recommend seeing it now in order to be apart of the audience taken on the journey of Nowhere Boy. This journey of the Nowhere Boy himself is embodied by the lyric of the following song Mother from his debut solo album John LennonPlastic Ono Band Mother you had me but I never had you. I wanted you you didn't want me. So I just got to tell you goodbye goodbye...".

	schema:reviewBody "Pop as quite a few musicologists have observed is 'mom' a couple of three letter words with a deep symbiotic relationship. A relationship occasionally verging as Nowhere Boy suggests on the inappropriate. From Jim Morrison scandalously acting out the myth of Oedipus in 'The End' to Roger Waters plaintively asking his suffocating matriarch Do you think she's good enough for me? in Pink Floyd's The Wall the history of 'mother love' among male singers is long.John Lennon a hierophant among pop's archconfessors certainly had his fair share of 'mother issues' as evinced by the White Album's 'Julia' a supremely moving and delicate tribute to his late mother lyrically enmeshed with a love poem to Yoko Ono. Later on his debut solo album he'd give full vent to the peculiarly ambiguous relationship via a fullthroated primal scream Mother you had me but I never had you. That ambiguity lies at the heart of artist Sam TaylorWood's first fulllength feature the first Lennon biopic to brave a fuller excavation of one of pop's saddest back stories and one of its most complicated psychologies a man with a distinctly whambamthankyouma'am attitude toward the fairer sex but who'd also refer to Ono as 'Mother.' As chronicled in the film we see how the boy Lennon was raised by his aunt Mary 'Mimi' Smith who took him in after it was thought that her younger sister was incapable of looking after him properly. In his teens which is when the film properly begins he goes on to pinball between the two very different women the stoic Mimi a surprisingly wellcast Kristin Scott Thomas transplanting that glorious sangfroid to Liverpool and the flighty possibly manicdepressive Julia Anne Marie Duff also excellent. Living just round the corner and closer to her son's age Julia buys him his first guitar and introduces him to rock 'n' roll before tragically she's knocked down and killed by an offduty drunkdriving policeman when Lennon is 17.In Matt Control Greenhalgh's screenplay we first spot Julia lurking in the cemetery during a funeral for John's Uncle George she is already among the dead. And there is something truly doomed about her a butterfly fluttering toward the flame as her belated reunion with John approaches though never quite nudges incest. I love you you're my dream the ultimate MILF tells him during a mother and son's stroll down Blackpool promenade that feels uncomfortably close to a date. And she tells him what the phrase 'rock n roll' really means while flirting with sailors in front of the jealous guy. She'll hurt you warns Mimi lashing her metaphorical apron strings like steel whips. Adding Your mother has always needed company. Do you know what I mean by 'company'? This is tough stuff. With the exception of Christopher Munch's lofi masterpiece The Hours And Times it's darker than previous Beatles biopics and though it takes a few liberties with the timeline the emotional honesty rings true. As far as these kinds of parcelled middlebrow dramas go in which everyone achieves a tidy sort of redemption and closure before the credits it is perfectly respectable. But it is also significantly perhaps even fatally flawed.Despite some gripes it's not tremendously important that the actors playing the nascent Beatles look nothing like their reallife counterparts although in all honesty Barack Obama Devendra Banhart and Robert Pershing Wadlow the world's tallest man 19181940 look more like John George and Paul than this bunch.But in casting Aaron Johnson as Lennon you can't help thinking the producers have gone for beauty and youth over dynamism. Johnson who in a fairgroundmirror reflection of the dynamic playing out on screen has just become engaged to the much older Sam Taylor Wood possesses the artist's dreaminess  actually he has something of the puppyeyed preSaturday Night Fever Travolta about him  but lacks brittleness. The hardness. The element that made Ian Hart's rendition so conclusively definitive in The Hours And Times and Backbeat. Even when headbutting fellow band members you can tell his heart isn't really in it. This current vogue for casting pretty boys in big leading roles see Robert Pattinson's Salvador Dali in Little Ashes Zac Efron in Me And Orson Welles may be honey to the box office bee but it's railroading pictures. And anyway the thing about Lennon was he wasn't pretty. That was Paul's job.There is also an appallingly clunky wedge of exposition in the final act which seems to zoom in from nowhere as Mimi relates to the tearful lad and the quaking Julia how her sister and Lennon's errant father Alf fought for ownership of the boy. It's awful and embarrassing with Gothic doomy chords punctuating the drama like something out of a Jane Austen adaptation while Mimi might as well be intoning Gather ye round and harken! It was a dark and stormy night... It's a mystifying misstep in a film that previously only implies and hints at childhood trauma in flashback and is all the more powerful for it.More successfully evoked is the mothballed late 1950s but also a sense of real change coming up from the streets. The Beatles' origin story is also well realised with Lennon furiously attempting to stamp his will on an ersatz family. In Paul McCartney Thomas Sangster he'd find a talent to match his own and a more pragmatic prematurely worldweary confidante McCartney's mother died two years before John's. In perhaps the most moving scene of all the then Quarrymen file into Percy Phillips' Liverpool recording studio in 1958 to lay down the track 'In spite of all the danger.' The sense of lost boys mewling for their absent mothers is palpable.".

But it is also significantly perhaps even fatally flawed.Despite some gripes it's not tremendously important that the actors playing the nascent Beatles look nothing like their reallife counterparts although in all honesty Barack Obama Devendra Banhart and Robert Pershing Wadlow the world's tallest man 19181940 look more like John George and Paul than this bunch.But in casting Aaron Johnson as Lennon you can't help thinking the producers have gone for beauty and youth over dynamism. Johnson who in a fairgroundmirror reflection of the dynamic playing out on screen has just become engaged to the much older Sam Taylor Wood possesses the artist's dreaminess  actually he has something of the puppyeyed preSaturday Night Fever Travolta about him  but lacks brittleness. The hardness. The element that made Ian Hart's rendition so conclusively definitive in The Hours And Times and Backbeat. Even when headbutting fellow band members you can tell his heart isn't really in it. This current vogue for casting pretty boys in big leading roles see Robert Pattinson's Salvador Dali in Little Ashes Zac Efron in Me And Orson Welles may be honey to the box office bee but it's railroading pictures. And anyway the thing about Lennon was he wasn't pretty. That was Paul's job.There is also an appallingly clunky wedge of exposition in the final act which seems to zoom in from nowhere as Mimi relates to the tearful lad and the quaking Julia how her sister and Lennon's errant father Alf fought for ownership of the boy. It's awful and embarrassing with Gothic doomy chords punctuating the drama like something out of a Jane Austen adaptation while Mimi might as well be intoning Gather ye round and harken! It was a dark and stormy night... It's a mystifying misstep in a film that previously only implies and hints at childhood trauma in flashback and is all the more powerful for it.More successfully evoked is the mothballed late 1950s but also a sense of real change coming up from the streets. The Beatles' origin story is also well realised with Lennon furiously attempting to stamp his will on an ersatz family. In Paul McCartney Thomas Sangster he'd find a talent to match his own and a more pragmatic prematurely worldweary confidante McCartney's mother died two years before John's. In perhaps the most moving scene of all the then Quarrymen file into Percy Phillips' Liverpool recording studio in 1958 to lay down the track 'In spite of all the danger.' The sense of lost boys mewling for their absent mothers is palpable.";

	schema:headline " Drawn out kitchen sink soapie";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it John Lennon is interesting because he was a member of and a major songwriter for the Beatles. Most of his interesting nonmusical experiences happened as a consequence of his Beatles membership. For some reason this film decides that all of that is less important and interesting than his relationship with his aunt and mother during his late teens. The founding of the Quarrymen and Beatles is just a minor subplot. We don't even get to their Hamburg experiences.Instead what we get is a humdrum kitchen sink soapie that leaves you wanting less. Its main dramatic focus is the belated revelation of how John Lennon's stern aunt became his guardian even though his more attitudinally compatible mother lived around the corner. This is all explained in one scene having been previously hinted at a few times in dream sequences. The rest of this overlong film is mainly padded out with tedious scenes of banal domesticity portraying John's rebelliousness his mother's immaturity and flightiness and his prim aunt's strictness. There's a bit of teenage truancy mild sexual encounters and what passed for teenage hijinks in the 1950's again quite dull. There are a few scenes hinting at his burgeoning interest in rock and roll and growing musical skill but this is portrayed in an uninteresting manner and is mainly towards the end. If banal kitchen sink soapies are for you then you might like this movie but it has little to do with John Lennon the musical icon. It is almost false advertising to use his name.There were some interesting aspects of Lennon's life during this time such as his art school experiences his manipulative pursuit of Cynthia his compulsive mocking of the physically flawed and the early struggles to get gigs. However all this is left out of the film. I suspect many of this film's flaws come from the film being based on a single memoir by one person who knew only one aspect of the subject's life. This is a common flaw with celebrity memoirs and biopics but it's an especially major flaw when the memoir deals one of the least interesting aspects of one of the least interesting periods in his life.As for the implementation aspects of a flawed concept the film has an overall slightly cheap low budget look although the acting is adequate. It's a little jarring though that they use a handsome actor to play Lennon and an ugly actor to play McCartney. Kristin ScottThomas is surprisingly convincing despite playing against type in an unglamorous role.".

I've disliked almost every film about the Beatles  mostly because they're so clichd and focus on them finding fame. This is not about the Bealtes  it is a movie about a young man reuniting with his mother. The young boy just happens to be John Lennon.Aaron Johnson is perfectly cast as John Lennon  he may not like like Lennon but who cares. His performance is near perfect playing Lennon as brittle lost crass sweet caring and charismatic  much like the man himself. Kristen ScottThomas portrays Aunt Mimi with such aplomb that it's hard not to love Mimi despite her cool exterior and inability to openly show her emotions. Ann Maree Duff plays Lennon's mother with a complexity of spirit and if you know the lyrical references in Lennon's songs to Julia then you will love her performance all the more.And those is minor roles also excel. Thomas Sangster as Paul McCartney again he doesn't look remotely like Paul  again who cares is simply excellent. The film portrays the early relationship between Paul and John. John teaching Paul not to be such a sop and Paul teaching John to be more controlled. One of the most moving scenes is when the two men embrace at Julia's funeral  a bond between two boys who both lost their mothers. The film implies that although the two deeply respected each other  it was never a truly easy relationship. Sangster lights up the screen whenever he appears.If you are expecting a movie about the Beatles  this is not it. This is a film about relationships between mothers and sons sisters and friends. If you like your movies complex and intricately written  then this is for you.".

It works honestly.I had misgivings about this it looked like the sort of 1950s period drama you get on Sunday early evening telly so authentic is hurts. But I went along because my sister wanted to see it and to show willing.It was awful a horrible movie. Taylor Wood is an artist Ronnie Wood would have been better. It's all broad brushstrokes and the end result is like watching paint dry. Okay that's an inappropriate jibe Taylor Wood is all art installation stuff. But that's the problem here she is depicting an idea on repeat throughout the movie. So we see Lennon meeting his mum and is amazed how wild she is and a bit turned on maybe. Then back to his Aunt Mimi who raised him looking all prim. Back to his mum and she's dancing and being wild again. Another scene of that then back to Mimi looking prim again. Nothing ever really develops much. Marie AnnDuff is v good as Julia Scott Thomas is good as Mimi but really Mimi looks like one of those women who never had sex in their life and Kristin doesn't fit that mold really a younger Maggie Smith would have been perfect.Aaron Johnson is okay as Lennon he captures his middleclassness though with glasses he becomes a bit Harry Potter. He's got the voice and the insolent look a bit but really he's too tall and manly. Lennon was a protopunk he all the Fabs were mod types with slight bodies. Johnson is muscley and tall he looks more like Travolta in Grease or the young Superman who outruns a train and squeezes his poor Dad to death. He towers over the other characters and is more a Pete Best figure.Otherwise no clich is left unturned. Paul shows up and asks for a cup of tea rather than a beer because he's the nice and square Beatle. Later he talks about writing your songs as you get the publishing because he's the calculated business one. He seems a prodnosed little jerk. Some girl dubs Lennon a 'loser' hmm that might make a good song later d'ya think? Julia introduces him to rock n roll it seems takes him to see an Elvis movie where teenage girls are screaming John looks around and we see him think Hey this is good I should be a rock star! All devoid of subtlety. It's a wonder when George appears the actor looking nothing like him he doesn't say I'm famished anyone fancy an Indian takeaway? Or someone saying. That Lennon he's going to get himself shot one day!And I somehow doubt that in one of the Lennon sex scenes inserted to show he's normal and not fixated with his mum that the hot young girl would groan orgasmically like a porn star and then  in timehonoured movie tradition  obligingly kneel down to give him a blowjob as the scene ends not in the late 1950s I don't think. Man if young Lennon was getting blowjobs off hot chicks back then I don't suppose he'd have much cared about forming the Beatles. I know I wouldn't!At the end it writes on the screen that Lennon phoned his Aunt Mimi every week for the rest of his life which I somehow doubt is true.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been brought up in working class Britain in the 40s 50s and 60s I can say that this film is totally inaccurate. Britain was much grimmer than this. According to this movie John Lennon had a comfortable middle class upbringing. John would have been 15 in 1955. At that time citizens of working class Liverpool experienced real hardship and poverty. They would have lived in small cold damp terraced row houses many of them with no bathroom quite different from the comfort that everyone in this movie seemed to enjoy. Granted Lennon was brought up in a comfortable middle class home as accurately portrayed in this movie his friends values and social contacts were working class.Other inaccuracies the records he stole were 7 inch 45 rpm. These were almost unheard of in Britain until around 1960. In 1955 records were invariably 10 inch 78 rpm. Fashions were Teddy Boy meaning very narrow tight trousers and long jackets. The fashions shown in the film came much later. The language was quite wrong the F word was almost unheard in those days even in working class culture.The movie says nothing except that he was a boy who sulked because he was abandoned by his mother. His substitute mother was portrayed as a loving devoted mother providing a comfortable supportive home convincingly played by Kristin Scott Thomas. Anne Marie Duff playing his real mother was too young for the part and therefore unconvincing.Rather than feel sympathy for the main character I found him ungrateful. The movie showed little of the Lennon who developed deep human values which he later brought to his music. It is difficult to correlate the child portrayed in this movie with his comfortable yes that was comfortable for the era upbringing with the writer of sensitive songs like Imagine Give Peace a Chance and similar music. I watched the movie and thought so what? It neither grabbed nor captivated. Listen to Lennon's song Working Class Hero. That is the story of his life not this glossy unrealistic fiction.".

Matt Greenleigh's screenplay based on Julia Baird's Lennon's sister memoirs covers only a small period of the rocker's life more specifically between the ages of 16 and 20. These were the years when Lennon met his real mother and learnt the truth about how he ended up living with his Aunt Mimi. Oh and he also met Paul McCartney and George Harrison. However the film strongly focuses on his familial issues and leaves the formation of his band as a sidenote which is a real shame because as an ignorant fan it would have been great to learn more about the Lennon  McCartney dynamic and how The QuarrymencumBeatles grabbed the world's attention.In her sophomore effort as director Sam Taylor Wood brings a nice artistic edge to the proceedings although her picture isn't always as compelling as it should be. There are a handful of powerful scenes that'll get the heart pumping though a tense allcardsonthetable discussion between Lennon Julia and Mimi is Nowhere Boy at its best. With the assistance of DP Seamus McGarvey she manages to capture the mood and gloom of 50's London extremely well the chilly weather a perfect excuse for kids everywhere to dress like Elvis.Perhaps most importantly Wood has extracted a fine performance from the 19 year old Johnson his brash confused Lennon is never less than convincing. Always reliable and almost stealing the show is Kristin Scott Thomas as the stern but devoted Aunt Mimi. She gives Mimi so much depth and unsaid emotion it is tour de force to witness. Not quite as engaging is Thomas Sangster as McCartney and AnneMarie Duff as Lennon's completely bizarre mother Julia.A small but interesting insight into the musical genius that was John Winston Lennon.3.5 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Ordinary 3  Good 4  Excellent 5  Classic".

	schema:headline " Before he was famous";
	schema:reviewBody "Before John Lennon became famous as one of the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960's he was just another teenage boy filled with many unanswered questions as to who he really was who his natural parents were and he maintained distant and tormented memories of his very early childhood. Aaron TaylorJohnson played the teenage John Lennon with convincing authority. Some viewers would say that Aaron TaylorJohnson did not look like the real young John Lennon but I would rather have a good portrayal by an actor than someone who just happened to look like John Lennon. The movie has no mention of the world wide fame and future of the Beatles which is just fine with me. Instead it focuses on the early childhood of young John growing up in Liverpool with his Auntie Mimi and Uncle George and his introduction to how music could mesmerize the world. Like a lot of families there are issues with adult siblings and their offspring. John happens to be one of those children affected as he is raised by his Auntie Mimi and Uncle George from the age of 5 to 15. He eventually reconnects with his birth mother and this just adds to John's turmoil but also provides him with his first taste of a stringed instrument that his mom helps him learn.Kristin Scott Thomas plays Auntie Mimi superbly as the loving and authoritative mother that John was lacking. His questions about why he came to live with his Aunt and Uncle are gradually realized and his birth mom and Aunt who are sisters put aside their differences and John seems happy to see that they have patched up their differences.We also see how Paul McCartney and George Harrison eventually join John's band originally named the Quarrymen. If you are interested in how the Beatles actually became the Beatles then this movie will not shed any light on that history which came later in their lives when they eventually connect with producer Brian Epstein. I did not consider Nowhere Boy anything special but it did accomplish what it set out to do which was to provide Beatles fans with insight in to what kind of a life John Lennon had growing up in Liverpool and how like many teenage boys who established a band got their start in life. I rated this movie only a 5 out of 10 as Nowhere Boy could have been about any teenage boy whose actual childhood living with an aunt and uncle could resemble that of any one of a thousand teenage boys who came from a broken family. Nowhere Boy is interesting because it happens to be about the early adolescence of John Lennon. This movie allows the viewer to witness John Lennon from simple beginnings as one of three young teenagers from the town of Liverpool who formed a band with their original drummer Pete Best before Ringo Starr decide on their own to travel to Hamburg Germany for a few months and see if they could make it in the music industry. And so their historical journey began......".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure what the negative reviewers on IMDb saw but it certainly wasn't this film. They seem to have problems with the premise of the film the very nature of biopics and non existent problems with the film itself. Let me get something straight biopic films are melodramatic and exaggerated by nature. Otherwise we'd get a much more watered down film that'll only interest the most hardcore of fans and bore everyone else to death. If you want realism read a John Lennon biography or watch a documentary. This by its own admission is a DRAMA about a teenage John Lennon and the emotional effect his mother and aunt had on his adolescence. It isn't about his adulthood or the music itself that was made clear with in the advertising so I'm not sure what people are whining about. Having said that this film is far from sugarcoated and pleasant. It gave a very honest and objective look at the man showing that he wasn't a saint and at times portrays characteristics not unlike the antagonistic school bully in your average high school movie particularly in his treatment of the young Paul McCartney. It reminded me a lot of Cemetery Junction not necessarily 100 realistic but still dramatic and dark as well as being humorous heartwarming and uplifting in places. The film does an excellent job of showcasing Lennon's signature witty retorts and mindset and that brings me on to the performances. The acting is more or less spot on. Aaron Johnson Kirsten Scott Thomas and AnneMarie Duff all work together to create a triumvirate of acting perfection each part is entirely naturalistic and believable portrayed and the emotional turmoil that John is feeling really reflects on the viewer Is his mother freespirited and lovable or reckless and frivolous? Is his aunt cold and oppressive or loving and protective? The film constantly throws the viewer between each one and although not necessarily excellently plotted or expertly constructed Nowhere Boy creates a potent drama that asks as many questions as it attempts to answer. I for one enjoyed the hell out of this and would recommend it to Beatles fan or hater alike.".

	schema:headline " It is an imperfect film but one that is still quite watchable because of its ambition and the glimpses of its heart";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is set during the teenage years of one of the greatest musicians in history John Lennon. He is shown here in his youth as a boorish foulmouthed hoodlum and womaniser thoroughly disinterested in school and regularly getting into trouble. Having been given away by his mother Julia AnneMarie Duff when he was just fiveyearsold John lives with his very proper auntie Mimi Smith Kirsten Scott Thomas and they share a tenuous relationship. Following the death of his uncle though John learns that his mother lives just down the street and decides to visit her. His mother is a highly enthusiastic vigorous woman and he takes to her kindness. They start to rekindle their relationship and while John is suspended from school she teaches him to play the banjo and inspires him to start a rock and roll band.Nowhere Boy directed by Sam Taylor Wood is credited to being adapted from a memoir by John Lennon's halfsister Julia Braid. Yet one must assume that Matt Greenhalgh's screenplay is largely improvised given the absence of Julia throughout the majority of the film. She is not present to witness many of the critical moments portrayed in Nowhere Boy. There is little doubt that the film has its heart in the right place in attempting to present a story that is largely unfamiliar but wholly valuable to those that appreciated Lennon later in his career. It might indeed be accurate in a more general manor  that John could have been a very misbehaving student  but the way that it is portrayed throughout the film lacks both credibility and subtlety. Where the film suffers most for this is in its characterisation which is quick to draw such thick lines between the personas. Kristen Scott Thomas is thorough in her role as the pompous Mimi but the script and presumably Wood's direction of her actors remains so constrictive that the performance rarely eventuates into something more complex. Mimi's nemesis and antithesis is of course her sister Julia who is rather loose and excitable almost overbearing with the affection she shows for her son. Neither performance is poor its just that they are so obvious in contrast between the tough but responsible woman and the more loving but irresponsible ditz.The livelier portion of the narrative is dedicated to the formation of Lennon's first band The Quarrymen. Aaron Johnson seems slightly blank in those initial scenes reuniting himself and his mother but he shines with a complete idea of how to play an arrogant selfabsorbed wannabe musician with utter swagger. Whether this representation is entirely accurate or another contrivance will be up to the more knowledgeable Lennon fans to decide. It's an image of Lennon that works for and against the film because it is a portrayal that few will have seen but by the end one still wants to know how he went from this scallywag to a man of such integrity and spirituality. The inclusion of Paul McCartney is somewhat problematic as well because the actor playing him Thomas Sangster the little boy from Love Actually looks to be ten years old even though he is actually nineteen in real life. He is a minor character but he also represents the way things happen so rapidly in this film. He meets John randomly at school and is included in the band almost instantly then happens to introduce Lennon to his friend named George on a bus. Fortunately Paul's inclusion at least gives the film its one really touching moment where he and John console each other in their common grief. We know in this moment that there is something stronger than just music which will tie these boys together for much of their coming lives. It is a scene of such empathy between the two characters that speaks greater volumes than any amount of yelling from some of the more dramatic scenes in the film.One can appreciate the courage of Nowhere Boy and its director to attempt to tell a rather unflattering story about one of the world's most loved musicians. It is a story that will interest and surprise many. Others will simply relish the quality of the music and the rich soundtrack which includes artists like Elvis Chuck Berry Buddy Holly Little Richard the real Lennon and a number of others from the period. Yet it is difficult not to question the authenticity of the film and how well it has been researched because of the overall simplicity of a number of the character portrayals. It is an imperfect film but one that is still quite watchable because of its ambition and the glimpses of its heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will count Nowhere Boy as one of my favourite musician biopics even if John Lennon doesn't actually count as my favourite Beatle. Set during his teenage years when he's still a student and a lousy one at that this film by Sam TaylorWood takes a look at his influences the early years in the formation of his band before the Beatles with Paul Thomas Sangster and George Sam Bell already onboard and of the two important women in his life his mom Julia AnneMarie Duff and aunt Mimi Kristin Scott Thomas where the latter had taken on parental responsibilities.First the music. Don't expect to listen to any Beatle classics because John Lennon still hasn't found his calling yet in the story ending just about the time the Liverpool boys are going to head to Hamburg and the rest as they say is history. Instead there are a lot more other classics that get their air time here that you'd find yourself tapping your feet to and defines the era that once was before Beatlemania swept the world with their brand of music to define a new generation. And who would have thought as the film suggested that John will be influenced by Elvis Presley because his interest got piqued when a legion of female fans packed in a theatre were swooning and openly gushing their adoration for him.So begins his quest toward learning how to play starting with the banjo courtesy of suspension from school and lessons from his mom. As mentioned the film splits time in defining who John Lennon was in his teenage years and exploring the relationships he had with his mom and aunt. With his mom it's all about fun and her introduction of rock and roll to him and the kind of connotations that that brand of music gets associated with which naturally will interest any teenage boy should you tell them that. However this is very much a love hate relationship as there's spectre of gloom hanging over their rekindle of relations especially when John has to learn the truth behind and come to terms with why he's actually living with his aunt Mimi all along.With Mimi it was almost the exact opposite in how time flies when with his mom. It's more rigid and strict with her expectations more set toward him doing well in school than to wander off pursuing some crazy dream. But that doesn't mean she's not supportive but does so at her own time in her own way which frustrates John as he cannot see past Mimi's stoic demeanour. Both AnneMarie Duff and Kristin Scott Thomas were excellent in contrasting themselves to set up an inevitable clash that is powerful and stinging but blood always runs thicker than water despite how the new found happiness would be cut short.And who would have thought that Aaron Johnson who got his ass kicked most of the time in Kick Ass would actually kick serious ass here with his portrayal of one of the most iconic musical legends of all time. He brings about that aura of a musical god who's just beginning to get hold of his roots in establishing who he is and what he stands for and in some ways prove to be quite the dead ringer from certain angles. With the cast members lending their singing voices here Johnson provides ample aural pleasure with his crooning that flair of arrogance and what I thought was a very fine and subtle touch in suggesting some serious competition with Paul very early on in their collaboration.Nowhere Boy is a fictional dramatization of the growing up years of JOhn Lennon but has plenty of positives from the songs to cast delivering their roles with aplomb that made this a delight to sit through. Most definitely highly recommended and goes into my shortlist for one of the best this year.".

	onyx:emotionText "I will count Nowhere Boy as one of my favourite musician biopics even if John Lennon doesn't actually count as my favourite Beatle. Set during his teenage years when he's still a student and a lousy one at that this film by Sam TaylorWood takes a look at his influences the early years in the formation of his band before the Beatles with Paul Thomas Sangster and George Sam Bell already onboard and of the two important women in his life his mom Julia AnneMarie Duff and aunt Mimi Kristin Scott Thomas where the latter had taken on parental responsibilities.First the music. Don't expect to listen to any Beatle classics because John Lennon still hasn't found his calling yet in the story ending just about the time the Liverpool boys are going to head to Hamburg and the rest as they say is history. Instead there are a lot more other classics that get their air time here that you'd find yourself tapping your feet to and defines the era that once was before Beatlemania swept the world with their brand of music to define a new generation. And who would have thought as the film suggested that John will be influenced by Elvis Presley because his interest got piqued when a legion of female fans packed in a theatre were swooning and openly gushing their adoration for him.So begins his quest toward learning how to play starting with the banjo courtesy of suspension from school and lessons from his mom.

Lennon's family were critical of the project and on set director Sam TaylorWood earn herself a toyboy star Aaron Johnson. But Nowhere Boy is very well film and a excellent directional debut for TaylorWood.In 1950s Liverpool John Lennon Johnson lives with his aunt Mimi Kristin Scott Thomas whom uncle and fatherfigure George David Threlfall dies of a heart attack. This tragic event spurs John on to find his mother Julia AnneMarie Duff who happened to live close by. Julia has her own family with two daughter but she soon teaches John about rock'n'roll and how to play the banjo. Soon John starts to form his own skittle band but Mimi and Julia soon clash and John's domestic situation becomes more chaotic.Nowhere Boy was written by Matt Greenhalgh who also wrote Control he must have a liking for musical biopics. He was able to write a taut script looking at two different parental approaches and how they have positive and negative effects as well the forming of a band. This is combined by TaylorWood's effective directing making a fast pace with a strong visual style form her sideways tracking shots of John as he is walking and the montage scene where John is practicing on the banjo in real time with everything around him is spedup. There is a real period feel in the sets and the costumes making it feel more real even more impressive considering the low budget and there is a very good soundtrack of classic 50s rock.The best feature of the film is the three leading actors of Johnson Scott Thomas and Duff. All three are very talented actors. Duff is particularly impressive as the fun loving biological mother of John who obviously suffering from bipolar disorder. She is great for John's musical development but terrible for when John really needs her. Mimi is a more restraint character a typical oldfashioned personality of stiffupper lip and don't show emotion. She is a sterner character who does is a disciplinant and does not know how to react to a rebellious teenager. Johnson himself is a very promising actor also proving himself in KickAss and he has a great future ahead of him. He had to show a young man who is talented has a number of desires but also got a lot of anger inside of him directed to both his mother and aunt.For Beatles fans there are few references to Strawberry Fields and the Cavern Club and I am sure there are more that I missed.".

Basically Nowhere Boy is about complicated and entangled faith of him and his family therefore we just witnessing a lot of emotional scenes which have strong predominance here. Of course the creators were not exempted from other aspects of Lenon's life but it was just an additional to not bore people by showing only family clashes. No I don't wanna say emotional scenes are boring no not at all it's just about variety of the film. Despite John Lenon is undoubtedly one of the symbol of his and further generations I reckoned to see something more and I suppose I've seen it.What I really liked in this film were obviously the soundtrack and authentic mood of early 60s nicely done costumes haircuts and other things is really a feast for the eyes. Though actors showed rather decent performance I doubt that Aaron Johnson is the best choice for young John Lenon's role. However being far from adoration and idolatry his acting I was satisfied. During my stay in the cinema theater I couldn't avoid comparison with an other good recent British biographic movie Control which is about Joy Division band and their frontman Ian Curtis. And in my opinion Joy Division's story was made more elaborately maybe because of the more tragical faith of Ian I dunno. But still I liked present film as well.Nowhere boy is not really a masterpiece or cinematography gem but it's very good movie not elongated very sincere enchanting that inspires observer to discover something more about John Lenon's life and listen more attentively his creation work in The Beatles. Highly recommend especially for Beatles fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ivan is a country boy in Jamaica who comes to see his Grandmother and make it big' by recording a record.  However when he finds himself exploited by a record producer he turns to drug running to make money.  When he kills a cop who is in on the trade he goes on the run and finds fame as an outlaw standing up against the man'.I first saw this in a cinema in 1995 and it was fully subtitled I watched it again last night and it had no subtitles.  It was slightly hard to follow some of the very thick dialogue so I suggest if you have the choice that you go for the subtitles unless patwa is a very familiar dialect to you.The plot takes swipes at the exploitative music business but also the nature of celebrity and the problems of drugs.  However at it's heart it's a reggae gangster movie that is gritty and enjoyable.  The story is involving but really it's the detail of the setting that carries the film.  The camera allows a great sense of place and really captures the mood and place well using crowd shots and wandering shots to music.  Really the best scenes are all natural as music plays in the fore ground.The music is one of the strongest aspects to the film  where the gangster element is sprawling and relaxed the music allows us to accept this whole chilled out vibe as just part of the film.  The cast also helps greatly by being very realistic without much effort not trying to make the accent easier is a brave move if you want to sell the film!  Cliff is easily believable and very watchable likewise almost all the cast are great  many not being actors.Overall the plot may wander in the way only a Jamaican can! But the music and the vibe more than make this a cult film that is well worth watching whether with subtitles or not!".

When he kills a cop who is in on the trade he goes on the run and finds fame as an outlaw standing up against the man'.I first saw this in a cinema in 1995 and it was fully subtitled I watched it again last night and it had no subtitles.  It was slightly hard to follow some of the very thick dialogue so I suggest if you have the choice that you go for the subtitles unless patwa is a very familiar dialect to you.The plot takes swipes at the exploitative music business but also the nature of celebrity and the problems of drugs.  However at it's heart it's a reggae gangster movie that is gritty and enjoyable.  The story is involving but really it's the detail of the setting that carries the film.  The camera allows a great sense of place and really captures the mood and place well using crowd shots and wandering shots to music.  Really the best scenes are all natural as music plays in the fore ground.The music is one of the strongest aspects to the film  where the gangster element is sprawling and relaxed the music allows us to accept this whole chilled out vibe as just part of the film.  The cast also helps greatly by being very realistic without much effort not trying to make the accent easier is a brave move if you want to sell the film!  Cliff is easily believable and very watchable likewise almost all the cast are great  many not being actors.Overall the plot may wander in the way only a Jamaican can! But the music and the vibe more than make this a cult film that is well worth watching whether with subtitles or not!";

	schema:reviewBody "Like most important films The Harder They Come is a flawed masterpiece whose inextricable link to a specific time and place and heavyhanded thematics are both its greatest strengths and its greatest weaknesses. The film follows Ivan Martin almost quite literally as he transforms himself from a country bumpkin into an urban outlaw cum reggae star. There are precious few frames missing the amazing visage of Jimmy Cliff but that is no shortcoming despite the singer's lack of acting experience. He lends an immediacy to Ivan and a impish charm that completely wins us over as it does almost everyone he meets in the film. The characterization of Ivan isn't particularly deep but it does not need to be. With a few broad strokes we understand this man. As an anthropological exploration of early 1970s Kingston the film also works particularly well. The squalor and desolation we see though perhaps exaggerated is not forced or factitious. You could not make this poverty up. That said this film is not timeless. It is tied so much to that specific timethe popularity of the radio DJs the burgeoning reggae scene the antiauthoritarian themesthat the film does seem a little quaint. Nor is the outlaw as folkhero tale anything new to American audiences. The film makes no pretense that it should seem unique though as it clearly draws our attention to its debt to the Hollywood western. Nevertheless the film is an incredible success. The acting especially by Jimmy Cliff is exuberant as are the sights that unfold before the audience. And this energy is of course paralleled by an amazing score. If you cannot appreciate the joy and sweat that has gone into this music your ears are closed. Look to the scenes of Ivan recording his hit songand the other scenes of artists recording their worksand you will find something sublime that no amount of acting could create. Its immediate and visceral and on its own is enough to recommend this film. I have a friend who has studied filmwriting in school and dislikes this movie immensely because he claims the movie lacks the techniques one usually finds in well written and well made films. Though I understand his point of view I think it is too much skewed by mechanics. A film can have an aura and atmosphere that can overcome any number of technical faults. I believe this is one of those films.".

	schema:headline " ready rocksteady!";
	schema:reviewBody "The original reggae film. Although made on a low budget with musicians rather than actors the film holds up surprisingly well over time much in the same manner as the Jimmy Cagney film Public Enemy. The story is an updated renarration of the life of Jamaica's most notorious outlaw. But it is given considerable depth and energy by getting tied in with the history of the Jamaican music business which really treated artists badly back when this was made and with the subtle inclusion of general cultural and political commentary Ivan the outlaw is persuaded to a life of violence in part because he takes spaghetti Westerns seriously when he realizes his situation in Jamaica is hopeless he begins dreaming of escaping to freedom in Cuba  what a hope!.

	onyx:emotionText "The original reggae film. Although made on a low budget with musicians rather than actors the film holds up surprisingly well over time much in the same manner as the Jimmy Cagney film Public Enemy. The story is an updated renarration of the life of Jamaica's most notorious outlaw. But it is given considerable depth and energy by getting tied in with the history of the Jamaican music business which really treated artists badly back when this was made and with the subtle inclusion of general cultural and political commentary Ivan the outlaw is persuaded to a life of violence in part because he takes spaghetti Westerns seriously when he realizes his situation in Jamaica is hopeless he begins dreaming of escaping to freedom in Cuba  what a hope!.

The film uses other contrasts to stimulate our senses love and violence the richness of the Jamacian landscape and the despair of the ghetto and the innocent ambition of a young man set against the corporate machine Jamacian version. The result can be unsettling but the edginess of the film is in keeping with its storyline and it holds your attention to the end. I first saw it after buying Jimmy Cliff's EP extended play vinyl record which features songs from the film and I admit I was expecting a musician turned part time actor. In fact he was entirely credible in the role and given the rawness of the film his lack of acting experience probably helped make the performance seem very real. An 8 out of 10 for the film 10 out of 10 for Jimmy Cliff and 9 overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jamaica's first feature film certainly left its successor with something to live up to even though by more advanced standards it's pretty raw filmmaking that lacks focus at times. Where the film does score is in giving the viewer an insight into a side of life that is hardly ever glimpsed  the crimeridden slums of the impoverished island's cities and the tyrannical power of music producers over the country's music industry.Jimmy Cliff plays Ivan Martin a country boy fleeced of his belongings within hours of arriving in the city to advise his mother of the death of her sister. Martin has dreams of becoming a reggae star but can't find anyone to record his song and quickly finds himself depending on a local preacher who treats him harshly. This treatment gets worse when the preacher discovers Ivan is carrying on an affair with a girl he has possibly been grooming for himself. Ironically thanks to the Machiavellian deceit of a bigshot record producer Ivan finds himself sucked into a life of crime just as his music finally begins to take off.This film plays like a Warner gangster film transplanted to the Caribbean and infused with copious amounts of ganja. This being the 70s it isn't Cagney or Bogart that Ivan models himself on but Franco Nero's incarnation of seminal spaghetti western antihero Django. Probably the cutest moment of the film comes during its climax as director Perry Henzell intersperses shots of Ivan's comeuppance with the earlier shots of the cinema audience laughing and cheering at the carnage unleashed by Django and his gatling. The difference is Ivan's guns are empty and he is almost entirely bereft of principles or redeeming features. Somewhere during the course of the film he turns from victim to victimiser and yet Henzell expects the audience to retain its sympathy for him as he embarks on a copkilling spree as bloodthirsty as it is pointless. Unfortunately he and cowriter Trevor D. Rhone aren't skilled enough to pull it off.The soundtrack as others have noted is superlative even though the tunes are not always played at optimum moments what's Many Rivers to Cross doing there at some relatively insignificant moment to which it bears no relevance?. Gritty seems to be the word most other viewers choose to describe this flick and it certainly has echoes of the meanest of the early 70s blaxploitation films. Had its production values and locale been more appropriate it may even have become the same kind of talismanic film that De Palma's Scarface became to urban gangster of the 90s.".

As years went on THTC begin to gain a cult status and became more readily available. It is probably one of the few movies with spoken English that is subtitled. The patois which was created by the Rastafarians to replace Jamaican English considered the language of slaves is very difficult to understand so the subtitled version is recommended.The film stars the dynamic Jimmy Cliff as the rude boy Ivan who gets on the wrong side of a record producer who only wants to pay him a pittance for the song he has recorded. Things go from bad to worse and Ivan kills a cop among others. Then the song becomes a hit and Ivan becomes a folk hero running from the police. The ending is a little bit of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as Ivan faces down his many pursuers for one last shoot out.This is not the Jamaica that we see in travel brochures but the real thing......poverty stricken and unlovely however it has a terrible beauty of its own. Of course the music is something you dream about if you are a lover of reggae ska and rocksteady. Nobody does it like Jimmy Cliff. He is simply phenomenal. Don't miss it!!!".

The patois which was created by the Rastafarians to replace Jamaican English considered the language of slaves is very difficult to understand so the subtitled version is recommended.The film stars the dynamic Jimmy Cliff as the rude boy Ivan who gets on the wrong side of a record producer who only wants to pay him a pittance for the song he has recorded. Things go from bad to worse and Ivan kills a cop among others. Then the song becomes a hit and Ivan becomes a folk hero running from the police. The ending is a little bit of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as Ivan faces down his many pursuers for one last shoot out.This is not the Jamaica that we see in travel brochures but the real thing......poverty stricken and unlovely however it has a terrible beauty of its own. Of course the music is something you dream about if you are a lover of reggae ska and rocksteady. Nobody does it like Jimmy Cliff. He is simply phenomenal. Don't miss it!!!";

I understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's...Regardless it became a struggle to sit through and watch. The DVD I saw did have some subtitles but about 75 of the speech is not subtitled. Some of it is hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear but you struggle not to 'tune out' after awhile. Some of the shots were nice and the realism was there even if some of the performances were not great.Jimmy Cliff did a good job The plot is not bad but quite predictable. In the 143 film the highlights are Jimmy CliffIvan singing for a scene and a couple of shootouts and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. BTW near the beginning of the film there are some weird cuts with the Ivan character that seem like a editing mistake which made me laugh for a bit. One reviewer said this film has been cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. The ending was kind of interesting showing how the media from a young age influences people it could also be a general comment on the white man'scolonialism's influence on Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty corruption church ambition... In closing the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile the film much less.".

He said he loved the songs particularly the song of the title which he thought would get even the most unlikely person in the cinema dancing in the aisles. Then he added'But the the rest of the film is nonsense'.I certainly agree with him about the infectious song of the title having badly hummed it often. However I don't think the rest of the film is nonsense. What I believe many people mistake for nonsense is actually a playful kitsch knowingly referential film revolving around the desires and problems of selfmythology and the power of Bollywood fantasy. The film is set in Waterloo station where a young Indian man and woman of Pakistani origin bump into each other and form an acquaintance while waiting for infamously late English trains. But their talk about themselves we come to see may not quite be so credible and ingenuous. Not only this but there is something magical in the air at Waterloo Station for a wondering busker Amitabh Bachan looking like a sixties drop out is somehow mysteriously involved in the lively plot.The two leads Bachan's son Abishek and Preity Zinta make engaging leads and alongside the wonderfully outrageous Laura Dutta and Bobby Deol handle the film's sense of fun and comedy vigorously though perhaps the nods to the famous BachanDeol partnership in Sholay goes too far.Another thing about Jhoon Barabar Jhoon is its sure sense of place something few Indian films set in Britain can claim. Preity Zinta's Alvira is an NRI and the film makes a playful but genuine attempt to engage with the London Indian diaspora.".

	schema:reviewBody "What generally works as the weakness of a film is the strength of this one. The film has a week storyline virtually nonexistent script and no logic. But that's where the fun lies.Abhishek Bachchan and Preity Zinta are introduced in very beginning of the film who from there carry forward a total mindless and fun filled sequence of events. Events that are funny sometimes very funny romantic sometimes emotional but never real. The narration is unique and keeps you interested for most of the time. The strongest part of the film is its music. ShankarEhsaanLoy have created sheer magic with their instruments. Each song is masterpiece. And with modern day sound technology watch it in a Doolby Digital theater you would actually want to dance especially on the 3rd version of the title track.Actors have performed well. Everyone has pulled the comic timing very well. Amitabh Bachchan keeps appearing in between with fabulous attire and equally good song to keep the zing intact.The punch line of the film says it all... Jump Dance Shout... But don't expect anything more. Entertainment is only thing that this has to offer. No matter with what mood you enter the theater more likely than not chance are you'll come out smiling. And isn't that smile worth all the money you spent on that ticket. It certainly is.".

	onyx:emotionText "What generally works as the weakness of a film is the strength of this one. The film has a week storyline virtually nonexistent script and no logic. But that's where the fun lies.Abhishek Bachchan and Preity Zinta are introduced in very beginning of the film who from there carry forward a total mindless and fun filled sequence of events. Events that are funny sometimes very funny romantic sometimes emotional but never real. The narration is unique and keeps you interested for most of the time. The strongest part of the film is its music. ShankarEhsaanLoy have created sheer magic with their instruments. Each song is masterpiece. And with modern day sound technology watch it in a Doolby Digital theater you would actually want to dance especially on the 3rd version of the title track.Actors have performed well. Everyone has pulled the comic timing very well. Amitabh Bachchan keeps appearing in between with fabulous attire and equally good song to keep the zing intact.The punch line of the film says it all... Jump Dance Shout... But don't expect anything more. Entertainment is only thing that this has to offer. No matter with what mood you enter the theater more likely than not chance are you'll come out smiling. And isn't that smile worth all the money you spent on that ticket. It certainly is.";

	schema:reviewBody "I read in an Abhishek interview that when he was initially presented with the JBJ story idea while shooting Bunty babli it was set in a Delhi train station platform......i can just about imagine the charming scene. Abhishek and his heroine chatting over a cup of chai next to the tea stall. How did that potentially charming romantic tale turn into this over the top Bollywood film based in London? Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was an utter disappointment to me considering the same banner and director came out with the thoroughly entertaining Bunty Aur Babli. The movie felt like a 2hr long music video fashion show. I felt the person who would get the most mileage out of the movie would be the fashion designerstylist of the movie which had a lot of outlandish costumes none more so than the attire of the Big B in the title song.The first half felt awkward although there were a few funny moments thanks to the Lara and Abhishek. The movie picks up in the 2nd half but it was more due to the performances of the actors rather than the progression of the story. The actors did a relatively good job considering the weak script. I felt Lara Dutta and Bobby Deol were the standout performers from the movie as they had the opportunity to portray characters that had different shades to it. Lara was especially cute with the French accent and the potty mouth of the 2nd half. Bobby had some excellent comic moments in the 2nd half. Abhishek took a bit of a risk by playing such a loud character...he does go a bit over the top at times but I still think he is a good actor and he has his moments. For me Preity Zinta has been repeating herself in all her movies recently except maybe Lakshya...ever since Kal Ho Na Ho she seems to be playing the same character over and over again i.e. an Indian who is either born and brought up abroad or living abroad. She too improves only in the 2nd half when she is not trying to put on an accent. There was not enough chemistry between the lead pair although you could see that they are buddies.The music was excellent although Shaad Ali managed to drag all life out of the catchy title song since it pops up all over the film. The slow romantic number was also good.I feel that Yash Raj films are catering more to the NRI crowd with their movies and subsequently took the soul out of this movie by presenting on this enormous scale.. you cant really blame them as it is a business and they need to recoup their costs.The film has its moments but it is in no way anything more than an average product.".

When he got it he kissed Lara in front of the Eiffel tower which was lighting up and threw the ticket away Crap Crap Crap  Mega Crap!. In Preity's story she was in Madame Tussaud's and a lawyer Bobby saved her from a Superman statue falling above her and they fell in love. Preity wanted to sue the owner of Madame Tussaud's and Bobby was fighting her case but all of a sudden the judge started singing like a squirrel and they started dancing  singing the Kiss of Love song. The lyrics of the Kiss of Love song should be changed to Stupid film Stupid film Stay away from the stupid film. Music is not that great as many people are saying the only good song is the very first Jhoom and the rest of them do not jar and lacks instant recall after one hearing. There are a few surprises but they were so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure them out. Amitabh's getup was good with his long hair and hat with feathers but it didn't make the film any better. Watching three hours of your washing machine spin would be more rewarding than this!".

The song numbers have been an artistic tradition Hindi films and what particularly amazes me about all these films is the complete irrelevance of the song numbers to the film's story itself unless it's a film like Dil To Pagal Hai where the music is part of the script.I think Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is a brave attempt to make a film with the songs being part of the screenplay. But even then it just doesn't work. Why? Because there is NO screenplay. The entire film is a big dance show. And it shouldn't be like this. When there are no songs the film consists of silly jokes and plastic acting. Some sequences are so ridiculous that you start hating anyone who's been ever involved with this film. It is intended to be funny and crazy which is a good purpose but this film manages to be neither this nor that and instead it sadly ends up being a big silly show. I do admit that the songs are well danced and catchy but they become tiresome at some point mainly because most of them are actually the same song in different versions.The acting not that it can be called acting in this case is bad. Abhishek is annoying and miscast. Pretentious performance. Preity an actress I like immensely is her usual bubbly and vivacious self but here somehow lifeless. The fact that a great actress like Preity could even think of appearing in this film makes me want to slap her. Bobby and Lara are terrible. They ham overact and even in the dance numbers get overshadowed by the leading stars at least here they make some sense. Lara is particularly horrible as a prostitute with her fake French accent.

After discussing their respective fairy tale romances they ponder upon what would have happened had they not met their 'Fiances' and met as two single people. And this dream sequence took you to what can only be described as the director's tribute to Yash Chopra's Veer Zaara .WHOA!!!! HANG ON HANG ON. You thought the first half was Over The Top????Then the second half is 'OVER whatever you can BLOODY IMAGINE'So what do I think about Shaad Ali's third directorial venture !!!!IT BLEW MY MIND AWAY.JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM ROCKS BABY !!!!Because somewhere between the 'Over The Top' phase and 'Over the Bloody Everything' phase I realized that this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously or logically or practically. That's just not what its asking of its audience. Its like one of those wild rides you hop on in an amusement park and just let yourself go crazy not knowing what to do when every moment is a new surprising experience.Is it one of the best films I've ever seen . NO Is it one of the best screenplays ever written.NOBut it's genuinely one of the bravest and sincere attempts I've seen of a film that redefines mainstream Hindi cinema. Its in true terms a refreshingly different piece of entertainment.Yeah Yeahthe 'Nay sayers' can go ahead and sue me for using the oh so criminal word 'DIFFERENT' for a OH MY GAWD!!!! Yashraj Film's production.The major flaw of the film is the sluggish pace of the first half. The film has a running time of a little over 2 hours yet it seems to have some scope for a bit of trimming in the initial reels. The song 'Ticket to Hollywood' no matter how foot tapping and well choreographed seems unnecessary and could have been done without. All the other songs have been interestingly shot as well may it be 'Kiss of Love'  the film's tribute to the Oscar winning Richard Gere starrer 'Chicago' or Bol Na Halke'  an ode to 'Veer Zaara' perhaps  Director Shaad Ali has a flare for comedy and that comes across effectively in the film. JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM is as MAD and CRAZY as nothing else I've seen in a long time. It makes the director's last film Bunty aur Babli look like a serious art film. SERIOUSLY !!!!J But its not a LOUD film. Yes I am aware the above two statements sound contradictory but you'd understand what I mean when you watch the film.Also Mr. Shaad does a fine job of extracting some 'real life' moments and making them fit seamlessly into the film which is as close to reality as Taj Mahal is from Eiffel Tower.Performances by Abhishek Bachchan and Lara Dutta  in whatever little role she has are brilliant. Specially Lara Dutta who stuns you with her most polished performance to date. She works the audience brilliantly in her two different 'avatars' in the film.. Hang in there Ms. Dutta you'll get your due very soon as you clearly deserve every ounce of it.Bobby Deol gets a similar opportunity in the film where he gets two diametrically opposite personas to potray and he does a decent job. He manages to look like a hot and suave IndoBrit lawyer and then a silly Punjabi mama's boy with amazing finesse.Director Shaad Ali has a flare for comedy and that comes across effectively in the film.

Would it appeal to the masses or would they find the 'hollywoodish' first half too iffy !!!! I don't know the answer to these questions. What I DO know is that due to the fantastic marketing and immense prerelease popularity of its music it will get a good opening at the domestic and international box office. So the crux of the situation is....Meaningful cinema it isn't. But then it never pretends to be so. Just watch it and enjoy the sillinessMy verdict  PAISA VASOOLPopcorn Included !!!! ".

Hang in there Ms. Dutta you'll get your due very soon as you clearly deserve every ounce of it.Bobby Deol gets a similar opportunity in the film where he gets two diametrically opposite personas to potray and he does a decent job. He manages to look like a hot and suave IndoBrit lawyer and then a silly Punjabi mama's boy with amazing finesse.SO .... Would this film work at the Box Office ???? Would it appeal to the masses or would they find the 'hollywoodish' first half too iffy !!!! I don't know the answer to these questions. What I DO know is that due to the fantastic marketing and immense prerelease popularity of its music it will get a good opening at the domestic and international box office. So the crux of the situation is....Meaningful cinema it isn't. But then it never pretends to be so. Just watch it and enjoy the sillinessMy verdict  PAISA VASOOLPopcorn Included !!!! ";

I've never known such loyalty towards a production house.But JBJ will be a massive wake up call for all concerned. The film has its good moments and some worthy performances. But the overall product is nothing short of being a complete disaster. Fair enough the Director may have thought that he has come up with an ingenious idea but sometimes certain ideas or thoughts are far better off staying within the confines of ones head as they sound and look a lot better swirling around 'up there' than on a large screen.The protagonists Abhishek Bachchan and Priety Zinta look unconvinced by their characters and the whole scenario. And despite Abhishek's best efforts you almost end up hating both the main characters purely because the film has bored you senseless by the time proceedings really begin. And by this I mean the introduction of the other two main characters Bobby Deol and Lara Dutta  this time in person rather than in the imaginary world of AB and PZ.Bobby Deol does a very good job considering that he is offered very little in the way of screen time. He plays both his characters very well in particular the mummy's boy. Lara Dutta is amazing and really puts Priety Zinta in the shade with her performance. Despite both BD and LD having peripheral parts in the film  they both in my eyes walk away with the honours as the most entertaining pair on screen.Amitabh Bachchan is wasted and only appears every time they need to break the monotony of the main characters. He also appears in the dance competition to lend his support to a rather over long sequence.Overall JBJ offers very little in the way of a storyline. The treatment of the subject is what you expect of Yashraj films. But even they couldn't dress this weak subject up. DVD rental material at the most.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading through many of the reviews for Jhoom Barabar Jhoom I assumed that the film was 100 awful from start to finish. Well I disagreeit's only partially awful. The first half is impossible to believe but is likable. The second half is truly horrible and all the good will I had early on vanished as the film continually assaulted my senses. Subtle and romantic are two words I'd never use to describe this film.It all begins with a nice song and dance number by Amitabh Bachchan. He appears in the film periodicallythough I have no idea why other than he's the father of the leading man in this film Abhishek Bachchan. Oh well I really enjoy seeing Amitabh and at least I got a few glimpses of him even though his character was illdefined and vague.Soon Rakesh Abhishek Bachchan bumps into a gorgeous woman Alvira Preity Zinta. They are waiting to greet someone arriving by train and it is late. So they sit and begin talking. He talks at length about his fianc and she does the samethough in reality both are unattached. This really made no sense nor did it make sense that Alvira would soon fall for Rakesh because he seemed so very obnoxious and full of himself. However I have noticed that this is a BIG theme in a lot of Indian romancesthe obnoxious prettyboyand it's a clich I really hate. For me you have to like people for the romance to work. Still despite its flaws I found the first half of the film watchable and interesting. It could have worked well.Unfortunately once the train arrives the film is pretty dead. Both are in love with each other but don't know what to do since they'd been lying. Well sadly the same can be said for the writers as most of the final portion of the movie is set at a dance contest which totally assaults your senses. It's loud and looks like a 30 minute Indian music video and the costumer appears to have been Liberace!! It's tacky loud and pointless.By the time the end occurs and the inevitable occurs you are exhausted and just want it to end. It's a shame as the film was not horrible initially and had it been I would have turned it off and saved myself from the second half! So first half of the film I'd score a 5 and the last a 1. Overall a score of 3 seems reasonable as I have seen quite a few movies both Indian and nonIndian that were worse....though not a lot worse.By the way I am shocked that the IMDb goof section didn't include this one. At one point Alvira exposes the top of her left breast to show a tattoo. Later in the film it's moved to her right breast!!".

The songs were wonderful also. Highly recommend this comedyromance for those that still believe and for PZ fans! I can't comment on direction  although some distraction was felt during one shot. The acting again I can't figure out how to rate if it's chemistry then I'd say 'A' but as the directoreditor were happy with the results so was I. The four stars shown brightly I think. Chemistry aplenty and it showed in this film.Wonderful cameo also! The comedy was wonderful. Did I mention that Preity Zinta is in this? WOW! Totally amazingnice to see her working singing laughing dancing comedy  too bad she can't make movies once a week  right? Ha well I may have lost my objectiveness as a reviewer. OK...The subtitles were clear and easy to read. After I buy the DVD I get to look up a new temple and other sites from this movie so I may learn something also. A little plus for someone that doesn't travel. Side note  support theaters that show foreign films. Here in North California we have NAZ 8  please see these movies on the large screen not just in DVD anyway sorry to preach just don't want to loose more theaters in Bay area. Thanks.".

Director Natuck Baytan is known for his fastpaced light hearted and actionpacked movies and THREE SUPERGUYS IN THE SNOW  which was incidentally retitled to fit in with another Italian film series  is no exception. Although the film does take a little while to get going once it settles down into the comedy routineaction formula it becomes a highly engaging little flick which is occasionally funny with it.The film initially begins by introducing our central trio of conmen and robbers. Their favourite moneymaking routines is to shoot each other with blanks pretending to be dead and then taking money to dispose of the corpses instead pocketing it for themselves. The fun really begins when the unlucky trio attempt to get themselves thrown in prison cue lots of comedy antics as they attempt to break the law and have all manner of trouble doing so. Once inside they quickly try to befriend an ageing bank robber who they adopt as a father to try and discover the whereabouts of his hidden stash of loot. The 'father' character is however just as conniving as the youngsters and won't easily give out the details. His character is easy to spot as he bears an uncanny resemblance to an elder Sean Connery with the same lecherous manner! To make matters worse a gang of greasy gangsters led by a great bad guy who closely resembles Lurch the butler from THE ADDAMS FAMILY also want to get their sweaty hands on the loot.After breaking out of jail  by hiding in dustbins  the movie becomes one long fight scene after another. Each fight is accompanied by exaggerated sound effects overacting cool stunts from the main actors and zany music to give it a cartoonish feel. My favourite scene is the bizarrelydubbed battle played out in the Turkish baths! Finally the action shifts to some ski scopes hence the retitling but it's not over yet and plenty more doublecrosses and surprise plot twists develop before the credits briefly role. The three men playing the leads may not be supermen dressing instead as everyday folk but all are good in their demanding roles getting the manners down perfectly and they prove themselves more than athletic enough to cope with the demanding stunts and moves that the action falls for. Plus you have the solid character support and some quirky politicalbattle of the sexes type humour and the end result is an appealingly goofy cross between comedy antics and fastpaced martial artsstyle action.".

	schema:headline " Silly students seduce dancing dbutantes";
	schema:reviewBody "After the enormous critical and public success of Jaap Speyer's 'De Jantjes' the director and his star Johan Kaart were set to work together again on another musical comedy. But this time it was to be set in and around The Hague instead of Amsterdam. Unfortunately for them critics weren't so kind when 'Malle Gevallen' was released saying Speyer's time directing German comedies had influenced him for the worst and even accusing the film of being 'uncouth and tasteless'. Kaart appears as Bram van Boven who's been a fun loving student for at least ten years as the movie starts. He rounds up his two friends Boy de Wit and Hans Rikman to literally chase a group of girls touring Leiden. They follow two of them to the home of cranky old Mr. Smallebroek and thinking it's the girls home impulsively rent the flat directly above Smallebroek. They soon find out their mistake and have to find ways to sneak the girls Kitty and Toos into their combined bachelor pad without alerting the nosy Smallebroek from now on. They also have a lot of fun annoying the man by making as much noise as possible at all times of the day and night. While Bram and Boy court Toos  Kitty respectively Hans bumps into cute secretary Loeki spilling a pot of ink all over her nice white dress and of course he immediately falls for her. Both Kitty and Loeki find themselves the object of the annoying Piet Janssen's affections as well but poor little rich boy Piet proves no match for the wit of our three boys of course. This all leads to a string of silly sequences and several disguises for Bram. First there is a sailing trip during which Kaart puts on the same crooked eyes expression he used in 'De Jantjes' while posing a boatsman and an old fashioned pistol duel on the beach of Scheveningen where his character Bram shows up in a complete medieval armor. Originally intended to be a musical the songs are few and far between though there is a very quaint sequence where the boys are auditioning women to be their maid during which every line spoken by all the characters rhyme. Strangely enough there isn't a title number called 'Malle Gevallen' but instead the opening song 'Geen Geld en Toch Geen Zorgen' becomes the film's main theme. Some spoilers involving the very end coming upDespite of all the happy go lucky goings on the end is not a 100 happy one for all concerned. Boy and Kitty get engaged to each other but Hans and Loeki are separated by his new job as a reporter in Rome and our hero Bram even loses his girlfriend Toos because of a silly understanding. This leaves him sitting at the foot of the same statue in Leiden as at the start of the film so at least the story comes full circle. End spoilers on to historical factsWatching the film more than 75 years after it was made it is hard to see what could have been found tasteless by critics of the time. The film may not be laugh out loud funny by today's standards but is certainly chuckle worthy when one considers the context of the times in which it was made. Despite the critical backlash 'Malle Gevallen' did make its money back and was rereleased several time until the Nazi's banned the film in 1942 for unknown reasons there is nothing antiGerman in it during their occupation of the Netherlands. 7 out of 10".

So most people know what I'm talking about when I say Danvers State Mental Hospital. It is one of the few psychologically affective movies that I've ever seen. It takes the audience on a ride through a building that seems alive to it's visitors and forces the audience to resolve for themselves why things are happening to each character. If you want a movie that is challenging and thoughtprovoking this is the one. I always tell my customers to watch this movie in the dark but not to watch it alone.

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing a film like Session 9 just reaffirms that there are truly great films still being made.While many including the filmmakers will find comparisons to Don't Look Now The Shining and even a nod to The Changeling Session 9 still stands on its own as a most effective brooding experience of dread  and that's a good thing!  I found the style and tension more genuine than the grandiose The Shining and Session 9 relies mostly on real fears and no gratuitous material to entertain.  This film wants to creep you out and that's its soul purpose.  No pretty young GAP models no trendy MTVinfluenced rapmetal soundtrack no breasts no giggleinducing decapitation effects.  If you want those by all means go watch something else as there are plenty other films that offer that to those with short attention spans. If you want to be drawn INTO a film a place of fear and THINK as well Session 9 is like a therapy session of nightmares.The story is simple and complex at the same time as workers removing asbestos from the massive Danvers Mental Hospital slowly unravel along with secrets from taped audio recordings of a former patient.  I never saw the characters' backgrounds as underdeveloped as some have complained  you don't need to know EVERYTHING about these guys and besides more information about them would have slowed the film down even more and its nice brooding pace is just right as it is.  And don't worry if some of the things that seem like clues are left unresolved that's part of the fun.  Just like I still say many of the weird clues in David Lynch's works like Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive are just there to be weird and draw you in not that they actually have any direct connection to the main story.The actual Danvers Hospital is an amazing setting as the whole structure is a character all it's own and will disturb you without it having to do much but just BE there in the film.  The minimalistic soundtrack is unsettling and downright perfect I even bought it on CD and am still trying to figure out why it attracts me so much playing it in the background while say typing away something like this.....Each actor does a fine job  yes even David Caruso some of you need to get off his back! as a guy who seems to get a bit impatient yet maintaining a sense of calm.  Peter Mullan Steven Gevedon Josh Lucas and Brendan Sexton III seem like real regular blue collar guys. It's refreshing to see a film not insecure in having a mature roughedged cast.  By giving you a sense that these guys are real yes even though they tend to be slacking off quite a bit in places when they're supposed to get the job done in a week the quiet dread of the story will draw you in and you'll be absorbed completely.  Of course if you appreciate less flashy films like this you'll agree it's damn near perfect. Oh to those here on IMDb who criticized the scene with a jar of peanut butter left on the floor welllll think about this considering the state of its consumer do you think that whoever left it there cared where the container was disposed?  Man do you people get picky over the strangest things!  Whatever may seem implausible in the story or the characters' actions really doesn't wreck the film as it is to be appreciated much for its atmosphere and story.  I didn't find the ending to be so hard to understand at all those that had their mind set that they didn't like this film were too busy being angry to just sit back and let everything present itself quite clearly.If this film is categorized as horror then it's one of the best I've ever seen definitely one of the best in years.  It takes a LOT to scare me and there's one specific scene with Josh and his experience in the basement that caused a wave of tingling goosebumps all over my body. It was exhilarating to be scared that effectively by a single scene!Folks you can't trash this film because it doesn't give you easy explanations or allows you to have some cheap voyeuristic thrills.  Many of you who didn't like Session 9 seemed to know from reading its summary that it wasn't offering slambang entertainment.  If you like your mind to be stimulated and love being absorbed in mysterious and wondrous storytelling Session 9 is by my definition a flawless piece of work. For anyone else I'd just say.........What are YOU doing here....?".

This is a genuinely effective approach that recalls some of the more brilliant horror films of the past The Shining The Exorcist before they were replaced by cheesy slasher movies and selfmocking teen horror flicks.The plot in a nutshell five men are hired to remove the asbestos from a condemned mental hospital the movie was filmed on location at Danvers State Hospital a place so disturbing that many of the actors reported hearing and seeing strange things during filming. As the week continues they each begin to be affected by the place and it's clear there's a presence of some kind there... Each of the five main actors has a distinct style Mullan is sullen and unsettled Caruso is dark and intense Sexton is hyperactive and talkative Lucas is loud and cocky and cowriter Gevedon is quiet and introspective. Their distinct styles allow these men to emerge as having very different personalities and they play off each other wonderfully with friendly banter at the beginning and as they argue and conflict with each other as the plot wears on and fear gradually sets in for each of them.As far as the film's ending goes let this much be said Anderson deserves credit for willingness to follow his dark vision to the intense and unsettling end. It was probably necessary for this to be an independent film because any major studio would have forced the filmmakers to abandon their brilliant style and add a contrived Hollywoodstyle ending.

	schema:reviewBody "After writing editing and directing more romanticbased projects Anderson turned to horror to make this another just as effective low budget outing. The film makers took full advantage of the immediacy of video and found' surroundings to sustain an atmosphere of unease leading inevitably to terror  presumably reflecting both the proximity and the success of The Blair Witch Project 1999. The differences being that Anderson's cast provide no firstperson monologues direct to camera and Session 9's events are more 'structured' although the structure of Blair was concealed rather than truly absent. There's a professionally written musical score too amplifying events and an ending which allows a resolution to the mystery. But like it's famous predecessor there's a sense of natural horror here well handled for the most part providing a similarly refreshing change from studio' product.The plot concerns an asbestos cleaning crew working in an cavernous abandoned mental hospital the real life Danvers State Hospital in Danvers MA. Under a tight deadline to make a 10000 bonus tensions soon run high as they grow familiar and interact with the institution's history of lobotomies multiple personality disorders child abuse and gloomy incarceration. Leader of the gang is Gordon Peter Mullens who faces personal problems at home. It also includes his nephew Jeff Brendan Sexton who has a fear of the dark Mike Steven Gevedon a failed law student the brooding and scheming Hank Josh Lucas and Phil suspected to be on drugs who has had his girlfriend stolen by Hank.The labyrinthine institution dominates the film and the actions of the characters. Gordon is undergoing a stressful familial relationship Hank locates a trove of personal possessions hidden by inmates Mike discovers and becomes absorbed in the recorded testimony of a threatening multiple personality while Phil has concerns about the viability of the project and Gordon's mental state... It would be surprising if so many disparate elements came together into an entirely satisfactory whole. Predictably enough one of the weaknesses of Session 9 is that some of the terror so carefully built up is dissipated by a climax which leaves too much unspoken. Most importantly Anderson's script fails to unite completely the two main threads of the story the usurpation of personality and Gordon's personal crises. Phil blames Gordon's problems on fatherhood' but by the end of the film a much more malign influence has been confirmed. But there's an absence of real satanic dialogue between the possessor and the possessed. It leaves the viewer hanging and the inner tensions within Gordon's character remain nigglingly unresolved. While the occasional imprecations from Simon' may seem a brief obvious way of suggesting the forces at work they fall short of convincing motivation. More damagingly Gordon's relationship with his family is too distanced a sad phone call or a gaze from a parked car to evoke a real feeling of the effects of evil on their lives.  In the event the final claim by Simon' that he lives in the weak and the wounded' sounds more like an apologetic roundup of an instigating role than a convincing boast of events.Having said that Gordon's breakdown is perhaps the best thing in the film. Our sense of his subtle increasing alienation is a testament to some fine acting by the underrated Peter Mullan. In The Claim his last film before this Mullan played a powerful but morally guilty man whose estrangement from human relations comes to dominate his life. In Session 9 Mullan again plays a man excluded from his kin  although on this occasion by forces overwhelming in addition to his own dubious actions. Both experiences lead to destruction.There are some fine spooky moments within Danvers the superb environment in which the action is set. The old mental hospital decaying and monolithic provides an atmosphere that would be impossible to achieve except on such an ideal location. Hank's discovery of the hoard in a wall outside the morgue for instance ominously stressed by a compelling backward tracking shot inside while he scrambles out of shot for the dusty loot. Jeff's panic in the passageway as the generator fails running for safety the threatening dark in hot pursuit or just the quiet moment when Gordon studies his ravaged fingers with unstable amazement are all standouts. The artefacts that Mike discovers of Mary Hobbe's interview are convincing too scrupulously presented the eerie tapes convincingly acted. So effective is this evocation of past events in fact that one feels disappointed that Mike does relatively little with his discoveries by the end.Its gonna get ugly' says a prescient Phil at once point and so it proves. So much of the first part of the film is fine that the ultimate descent into gore however telegraphed in advance is somewhat of an anticlimax. Hank's madness alone and stripped in a dark corridor is considerably more disturbing than the stalk n'slash events which follow.  Perhaps Anderson thought so too as he delays confirming the identity of the maniac until the very end. Along the way he confounds the audience with an ambiguous stand off between two major characters a lot of separated principals blundering through gloomy passageways and red herrings like Phil's strange meeting with two men presumably drug dealers in the yard. Interestingly the American DVD apparently includes a further subplot featuring a homeless Indian women  subsequently dropped for the UK release to help tidy up an already straggling narrative line.What remains is a good horror film  surprisingly good given the limited resources of the production  unlikely to please those who like their terror on a grand special effectsladen scale but of interest to those who enjoy excellence on a budget. Directorwriter Anderson should be better known as the appreciative reviews of his other films by fans show for his direction is sure and effective. Session 9 is a worthy addition to his underrated output and is well worth looking for.".

It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale has pulled us and his excellent cast slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors wards treatment rooms caged stairwells and a morgue.

Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.It's a horror film aimed at a certain horror fan the one who has the patience to enjoy slow burn psychological pin prickery. All played out expertly by cast and film makers at a naturally unsettling location. 910".

I think the one that requires a brain is the best kind because there is no limit to what the mind can make you feel and when done right the second kind of movie will take you to heights of horror and suspense that the first kind of movie can only aspire to.This movie Session 9 falls in the category of the second kind and that is apparent by the number of people who have chosen to rate it based on their limited taste for just gore with no substance.So in closing I won't go into what happens in the movie because that is the fun but will simply say that if you are looking for a chop'em up blood squirting in your face slasher flick this isn't it.

	schema:headline " A True Psychological Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "My husband and I had been excited about seeing SESSION 9 ever since we'd heard positive things about it from friends. Well this chiller lived up to their praise and then some! By the time SESSION 9 ended I felt like someone had been holding a knife to my throat for 100 minutes. I've never seen directorcowriter Brad Anderson's romantic comedy NEXT STOP WONDERLAND but after sitting riveted and cowering in my seat throughout SESSION 9 I had a hard time imagining Anderson tackling anything even remotely lighthearted! Even when SESSION 9's bluecollar heroes exchange wisecracks there's nothing jokey about the film this isn't your ironic selfmocking postmodern kind of horror flick a la SCREAM. Speaking of lightheartedness I knew Vin was as profoundly affected by SESSION 9 as I was because he never once leaned over and made any quips to me about anything happening onscreen a rarity for my hubby!  Basically there are two kinds of horror films 1 the rollercoaster thrill ride kind usually with cool FX and inventive violence which manage to be both scary and exhilarating at the same time such as JAWS or SCREAM and 2 the moody psychological thriller usually characterdriven rather than FX driven think HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Interestingly the original 1963 version of THE HAUNTING fit in the 2 category and the 1999 version fit more in the 1 category but I digress... In the more emotional realistic horror films you might say the terror comes from to borrow a phrase from FORBIDDEN PLANET monsters from the id. FP rendered its monsters from the id in animation form but SESSION 9 doesn't need to. There's a sense of dread from the very first frame with an askew camera angle on what seems to be an electric chair in an otherwise empty longneglected room. The sharp sudden sound effects passing cars sound like jets in this movie! and eerie backwardssounding music by Climax Golden Twins not at all what I'd have expected from Executive Music Producer Carson Daly of MTV fame creeped me out too. Having said all that SESSION 9 isn't really a film about imagery special effects or gore. In fact there isn't much gore at all until the end and even then it's plausible realworld kind of gore not some kind of Grand Guignol overthetop bloodletting. It's a truly intense compelling nightmare about decent people and how under pressure their flaws and vulnerabilities and moments of bad judgment may lead to horror and tragedy for themselves and everyone in their orbit. I want to talk on and on about this film and yet I don't want to because I'm afraid of spoiling the shocks and suspense for you. I will tell you however that the protagonists are members of a hazardous materials removal team embarking on a job at the massive imposing longabandoned Danvers State Mental Hospital a real place in Massachusetts BTW. So no the Danvers name is not a tip of the hat to REBECCA! . This batshaped behemoth of a building is so remarkable that it feels like a character in its own right. But even before the men set foot in Danvers the stage is set for tension and trouble. Desperate to get the Danvers job boss man Gordon Peter Mullan a recent Scottish migr to the U.S. and new father of a sickly fussy baby bids low and promises that he and his team can finish the job in one week. Crew chief Phil David Caruso is unhappy because he thinks 2 or 3 weeks would be more realistic plus he doesn't think much of crew member Hank Josh Lucas the weaselly troublemaker who stole Phil's girl. Then there's Gordon's wetbehindtheears darkfearing teenage nephew Jeff Brendan Sexton III in one scene he's trapped in a hallway where each light goes out in rapid succession making it look like the darkness is chasing the poor kid. Finally there's onagain offagain law student Mike cowriter Stephen Gevedon who for some reason reminded me of a younger handsomer more rugged Jeremy Piven whose lawyer dad was involved in a case that contributed to Danvers being shut down. Once inside the grim old complex surrounded by peeling paint water stains graffiti creepy old equipment and the various patients' memorabilia from the old days Hank finds a veritable treasure trove in the morgue's incinerator Mike finds compelling audio tapes of a multiplepersonality patient's sessions and the place's overall eeriness begins to work everybody's nerves. But is it that the building is in some way haunted or are the guys really being haunted by their own demons? That's the fiendish beauty of SESSION 9 just when you think you've got it pegged as a hauntedasylum thriller or a revenge thriller or a cross between THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE or whatever it confounds your expectations. Soon you're too wrapped up in the mounting madness and suspense to sit there secondguessing. Every member of the superb cast gets you rooting for them and sympathizing with their characters even Lucas as Hank is engaging in his own sneaky selfabsorbed way so their unraveling has real emotional heft unlike say the snarky cocky trio in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. I must admit I took a sadistic glee in watching those selfimportant little jerks degenerating into terrified jibbering wrecks whereas my heart went out to SESSION 9's protagonists. As budgetconscious parents of a young child Vinnie and I could especially identify with Gordon the writing and Mullan's poignant portrayal of a strong man slowly being overwhelmed by circumstances perfectly brought out the pressures of new parenthood and providing for a family. After the film was over Vinnie likened it to HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER not only in its truetolife feel and its raw intensity but in that it shakes you up so profoundly that you can't bear to watch it more than once. If you're into psychological horror you owe it to yourself to see SESSION 9 at least once. It's one of the most powerful disturbing films I've ever seen and definitely one of 2001's best and most unfairly underseen movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say I was really disappointed with this movie. It had all the makings of a scary horror film from my point of view at least old abandoned mental hospital with a history of medieval and brutal curing methods one of the guys working there finds tapes with recordings of old sessions with a schizophrenic woman who seems to have been involved in a grisly murder the freaky looking electric chair on the cover that is also seen by one of the main characters in the beginning of the movie hey this oughta be great right? Ummmmm nope.To me it seemed like the maker of this movie himself was schizophrenic one day wanting to make a scary horror movie and the next some sort of family drama.

Well this movie is no exception only thing is that it only happens at the very end when the director finally seems to realize that this movie is supposed to SCARE people.There I think that's enough.

It had all the makings of a scary horror film from my point of view at least old abandoned mental hospital with a history of medieval and brutal curing methods one of the guys working there finds tapes with recordings of old sessions with a schizophrenic woman who seems to have been involved in a grisly murder the freaky looking electric chair on the cover that is also seen by one of the main characters in the beginning of the movie hey this oughta be great right? Ummmmm nope.To me it seemed like the maker of this movie himself was schizophrenic one day wanting to make a scary horror movie and the next some sort of family drama.

Hes walking down a passage and for no apparent reason there is a peanut butter jar in the middle of it. What kind of stupid ass murderer does this? Why in the middle of a passageway? It makes no sense. Also when they all hear footsteps on the floor above them they decide it would be a good idea to investigate this by going down to the basement. One of them just decides he is going to listen to more stupid tapes while everyone else is searching for the missing person. This film is a classic case of a good idea gone terribly wrong. If you have to watch the directors commentary to actually realize that the movie is somewhat good then the movie isnt really good.

	schema:reviewBody "The plot for this movie is supposed to involve an asbestos removal team that go into a creepy hospitalsanitarium. The movie sounded good enough but then I watched it. It's first flaw is in dragging its audience laboriously through the arguments of the team members as they take on the almost impossible task of removing hazardous building materials from a structure that is monstrous no pun intended. One team member through taperecorded sessions hence the title recounts the trauma of one of the patients that lived at the facility. We understand that they have multiple personalities that lead to murder. About this time one of the other team members winds up missing. We when see him later on it is difficult to know if he is alive or a ghost or something. I figured him for a ghost. Then the film begins to rapidly proceed through the remaining events almost at breakneck speed. Killing after killing occurs at the pace of Session 9's recording supposedly as some eerie backdrop to tell us how these killing are happening. The film tries to trick you into thinking it's a ghost not altogether untrue but SPOILER then reveals its antagonist to be that of one of the team members.He is slaying all of his buddies because he's possessed or something. This transformation occurs so quickly and without much explanation that is appears lame. In fact I thought I was going to seem something further or some spirit or an elaboration on a reason for the change that I mistakenly kept watching. The ending is ultimately pathetic in the possessed crewboss wandering around as some sort of troubled invalid. Repeated shots like that on the movie's cover are given of a chair sitting in the light. This is a reference to the psychological counseling sessions held. But the director focuses on it frequently as to suggest more than the obvious which is only so because it's easy enough to associate. In retrospect he probably should have had the chair grow wings or jump hoops or something.Bottom line  this movie does not pay off. And there's hardly any built up or suspense until toward the end. Then that peters out pretty fast as the film heads toward its ridiculously lame ending. A good plot was there for the taking but this director looks like he did his best to miss all the right opportunities.".

All of the characters in this movie act completely unrealistically as demonstrated by a scene where a guy just stands there chatting away to a man covered in blood and carrying a knife. As if that wasn't enough when the man stabs him he acts surprised. Also much of this movies dialog is incredibly clich.

Frankly it is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen and I am a horror fanatic as boasts my DVD and book collection. I have my share of the teen gore slashers and I appreciate them for what they are. But what Session 9 is is a subgenre all on its own. I honestly think people go towatch movies nowadays just turn their brains off the second the film starts rolling they want to be entertained as is their right as a movie audience but more importantly they DO NOT WANT TO THINK. Any movie that requires use of more than 10 brain cells during its entirety is dubbed with nasty reviews and insults from people who just couldn't be bothered to open their mind and use it. To enjoy Session 9 and more importantly be scared by it you have to realize that the premise of fear in this entire film is the horrible possibilities that lurk within each and every human mind on this planet. SPOILERS AHEAD!!While the subtle hint of a supernatural entity is present in the film there never is any solid scene that proves Simon was anything more than a manifestation in Mary'spossibly Godron's head. I think what the filmmakers were trying to portray is that under the right mix of circumstances any of us can turn into that crazy patient locked in the snake pit. As a student of psychology myself and others in the field unfortunately see and read about the reallife version of this movie every day and it is enough to make your skin crawl. If the thought that Gordon was so detached from reality that he could do what he did to his own wife and baby daughter is not enough to make your stomach turn then you've probably seen way too many Friday the 13th's with all due respect to that series. Again too many moviegoers just expect cheap thrills and special effects as much blood and gore as you can cram into an hour and a half. God forbid we all delve into that brain we have and realize the pure horror that already exists in our minds just waiting to be unlocked. Insanity is a lot more scarier than death.To those wanting brainless entertainment or a chance to make a move on your date there are plenty of teen slashers just waiting to hit your DVD player.For the intelligent movie buff who isn't afraid to think beyond the credits you really do not want to miss Session 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rundown cop who's always on the drink named Ben Shockley is assigned to accompany a foulmouthed prostitute in Las Vegas to a protection program across the country in Phoenix to testify against highly placed authority figure although first they have to get through a gauntlet of bad cops and the mob who actually want them both dead. So now the odds aren't in their favour but Shockley is determine to do his job no matter how big the odds are against them.Classic Eastwood is on show here people. Although it's not one of his greatest nor particularly original. But this reasonably familiar cop  action film delivers what it intended to do by giving us a taut little road movie across baron landscapes with a tremendous amount of brutally fastpaced shootouts and grand chase scenes. I mean a lot! To sum it up shootouts shootouts and even more shootouts. Watch things go boom with a lot going on at such a furious pace! What more could you want? So you ask why is this nothing out of the ordinary? Because this kind of thing wasn't particularly new within this era of films. There were definite shades of Dirty Harry Eastwood's character Shockley was the exact opposite to Harry though. The one thing you'll notice is that there is no real excuse or depth behind the plot but to stage one chaotic and stretched out shootout after another. Sometimes they feel like they go on forever! Nonetheless they might be farfetched and fail logic but they're rather well setup by director Eastwood. Giving us a sudden burst around each corner and because of that there's hardly a mundane moment uh maybe Eastwood did overkill certain shootouts but it did get the blood pumping! So when the exaggerated climax hits the screen  at least the film was consistent in that aspect. The performances were topnotch with Eastwood's persona making any film his in watchable. He gives a stellar performance. Sondra Locke as Gus Mally was perfect. The chemistry between the leads was outstanding. The scathing and rough dialogue amongst them was a treat with great use of sarcasm and offbeat humour. The biting conversations truly built on the paranoia at hand with many top oneliners. This gives the film a buddy type of feel. Other key factors are the soothing blues soundtrack well established camera shots that capture a beautiful landscape but also the panic of the situation they face. While there might be underlining themes running throughout the plot I just didn't read too much into it. Just leave your brain at the door and enjoy the total chaos and destruction that follows with your screen being sprayed with bullets! Definitely recommended for fans of Eastwood and gritty action films.".

Clint is in peak form and Locke will never again reach the heights that she does here. Clearly the two have wonderful screen chemistry and would remain together as a couple for more than a decade. Watching the film today I think there is a scene that went missingor was cut. It occurred at the beginning of the movie and involved the sadistic police commissioner and Locke's prostitute. The scene is later described in great detail by Locke when she and Clint are on the lam in a desert cave. So where is it? My dad took me to see this R rated film on a bitterly cold night in early February '78it was released in late '77. I think he was unaware of the rating because I did get an eyeful that night.

Buildings are reduced to rubble vehicles are shot to pieces people are pumped full of lead and plenty of blood is spilled.... all in the name of entertainment! This noisy Clint Eastwood vehicle is good fun with lots of exciting sequences though thoroughly unbelievable pretty much from the start.Honest hardworking Phoenix cop Ben Shockley Eastwood is sent by Comissioner Blakelock William Prince to bring in a prostitute who may be able to provide key testimony in a high profile trial. But from the moment Shockley meets Gus Malley Sondra Locke he suddenly finds himself in the firing line.... and it's not the usual bad guys who are after him but the cops. Seems Malley's testimony could implicate a major police figure in sleaze and scandal and the man in question is none other than Shockley's boss Comissioner Blakelock. Shockley attempts to get his witness back to Phoenix despite the fact that every cop on the force has been ordered by Blakelock to gun the pair of them down.The climactic sequence in which Eastwood and Locke head for Phoenix City Hall in an armourplated bus while sharpshooters try to blast the living hell out of the vehicle is truly astounding. As a destructive set piece not many sequences can rival it even to this day. The film contains many similarly noisy destructive memorable scenes. Admittedly there are times when believability is markedly lacking e.g the bit where Clint and Sondra are pursued by a helicopter while aboard a motorbike  and the sniper aboard the helicopter repeatedly fails to gun them down. However on the whole The Gauntlet is good fun. Switch your brain down a gear or two and enjoy....".

	schema:reviewBody "How many rounds of ammunition can you fire into a house before it will collapse? Or maybe you'd like to see how many rounds you can fire into a bus before it will stop running. If you're interested or if you just like Clint Eastwood then The Gauntlet is for you! Our film centers around Clint playing a sloppy policeman from Phoenix who is assigned to transport a sassy hooker Sondra Locke from Las Vegas back to his jurisdiction. This will not be an easy task. First of all this Eastwood character is no Dirty Harry. His Ben Shocklee is an alcoholic and barely capable of doing his job. The hooker's testimony could potentially bring down some important figures so the cops and mafia also don't want them to return to Phoenix. In addition to all that the woman is such a bitch that even a trip across town with her would be almost too much to bear. The two are put in one harrowing situation after another as Clint proves that he has the moxy to simply get the job done.This film if made by or starring inferior talent would be nothing short of ridiculous. Several situations that arise in this film seem improbable at best and often ludicrous. Eastwood's charm and the razorsharp dialog keep it moving along. You end up almost believing it could happen. Clint Eastwood is that talented. His acting and direction are as good as ever.The film has plenty of memorable scenes. Along with the shootouts we get some very amusing and often very funny situations. One of my favorites is when Eastwood singlehandedly talks an entire motorcycle gang into surrendering one of their bikes or facing the consequences of his pistol. And what would an EastwoodLocke film be without a scene where she is sexually assaulted? Though disturbing the scene has a hilarious conclusion. Another scene belongs to Locke herself. In it she puts a foulmouthed police flunky in his place using some very sexually explicit words.That a film which would seemingly be quite ridiculous on paper is made into such a fine product is a testimony to the genius of Clint Eastwood. He is without a doubt my favorite actor of all time.9 of 10 stars for The Gauntlet.The Hound.".

Several situations that arise in this film seem improbable at best and often ludicrous. Eastwood's charm and the razorsharp dialog keep it moving along. You end up almost believing it could happen. Clint Eastwood is that talented. His acting and direction are as good as ever.The film has plenty of memorable scenes. Along with the shootouts we get some very amusing and often very funny situations. One of my favorites is when Eastwood singlehandedly talks an entire motorcycle gang into surrendering one of their bikes or facing the consequences of his pistol. And what would an EastwoodLocke film be without a scene where she is sexually assaulted? Though disturbing the scene has a hilarious conclusion. Another scene belongs to Locke herself. In it she puts a foulmouthed police flunky in his place using some very sexually explicit words.That a film which would seemingly be quite ridiculous on paper is made into such a fine product is a testimony to the genius of Clint Eastwood. He is without a doubt my favorite actor of all time.9 of 10 stars for The Gauntlet.The Hound.";

	schema:reviewBody "In The Gauntlet as in a number of his other films Clint Eastwood plays a tough cop. Ben Shockley however is very different to Harry Callahan or for that matter to Walt Coogan Eastwood's cool dude character from Coogan's Bluff. Whereas Dirty Harry is a ruthless but dedicated officer who gets all the tough jobs his colleagues don't want Shockley is a disillusioned alcoholic the first sight we have of him is a whiskey bottle falling from his car and smashing on the ground a man who wants the important cases but never gets them and is counting down the days until his retirement.Shockley is given what seems like a routine assignment. He is to travel from his base in Phoenix Arizona to Las Vegas to extradite Gus Mally a witness in a forthcoming trial. Coogan coincidentally was also based in Arizona. When he arrives however he receives two surprises. The first is that Gus is not a man but a woman. It's short for Augustina. The second is that she is determined not to be extradited to Phoenix claiming that she will be killed if she gives evidence at the trial. Shockley realises that Gus is due to give evidence against powerful Mafia figures who will go to any lengths to prevent her from doing so. Worse still it gradually dawns upon him that some of his colleagues in Phoenix are in league with the Mob and have set him up to be killed along with his witness. He is forced to run the gauntlet to get himself and Gus back to Phoenix alive despite being pursued not only by Mob assassins but also by most of the police forces of Arizona and Nevada. The bad guys have convinced the authorities that Shockley himself is in fact a killer.Whereas Dirty Harry asked some important questions about law enforcement and the nature of justice The Gauntlet is simply an actionadventure film with some romantic elements thrown in. Gus starts out as a foulmouthed prostitute but it soon becomes clear that she has hidden reserves of courage and resourcefulness and she and Shockley fall for one another. There are a number of setpieces as Shockley and Gus try and outwit their pursuers. It never however tries to be a realistic action film. The setpieces are all way over the top sometimes almost hilariously so more closely resembling battle scenes from a war film than the sort of shootouts one normally sees in cop movies. In one scene Shockley and Gus are under siege in a house which collapses after a relentless bombardment from police marksmen they emerge untouched. In another they are pursued by a helicopter which crashes after hitting overhead power lines a denouement I could see coming as soon as I saw pylons in the distance. The most bizarre sequence must be the finale when Shockley rides back into Phoenix in a hijacked bus. Although phalanxes of armed men fire enough ammunition into the bus to wipe out several regiments he still succeeds in getting through the lines suffering only a slight flesh wound. Gus is completely unharmed. The whole thing is made to seem even stranger by scenes that seem taken from a surreal comedy the idea of bookmakers offering odds on whether a witness will survive to give evidence at trial could be out of Monty Python.Preposterous action sequences do not always make for a bad film think for example of how many unfeasible stunts the hero manages to perform in the course of every James Bond movie. The Bond films however manage to get away with being preposterous because they are made with a wit style and lightness of touch largely lacking in The Gauntlet a film which manages to combine preposterousness with heavyhandedness. The action sequences may be fun to watch in themselves but they do not really add up to a satisfying film overall. One of Clint Eastwood's weaker efforts. 410".

What possibly could this movie have in common with Fight Clubor even As Good as it Gets? In Fight Club Ed Norton meets a girl that he obviously can not handle  so he reinvents himself. Same with Ben Shockley. He meets his match so he must act quickly making up a story about snakes at the cave. He then thinks on his feet and acquires himself a bike impressing the girl and cementing their alliance. Jack Nicholson breaks down to Helen Hunt and claims You make me want to be a better man.Estwood starts saying please and and emotes a deep trust in his counterpart He realizes he must soften up a little to keep the lady around.He does. Shockley isn't some phony Top Gun hero who loses the girl he's a loser who does what he has to get the woman in love with him and it works this is his only chance at love.This is Lockes best film. Is it because of the acting or is this Lockes personality? She does it well enough where you honestly believe she is ad libbing at least half of her lines pulling them off the top of her tongue. She sizzles oozing sex in the back seat of the cop car. You honestly believe she is so used to verbal abuse that she sits there and takes the insults. She is just playing possum lying in wait. She takes her turn and delivers a knockout counterpunch to the constableforcing his mind to admit that he is just a sleazeball flunkie. What is best is that nothing but honesty and cold reality come out of her mouth. Eastwood accepts the truth and lives. The constable refuses and dies. Locke is the antifeminazi. She saves her mans life and immediately wants to go back to being a real woman in his arms.This movie deserves a ten because the action scenes are just there so people can handle all of the raw truth in the movie.

She's in Las Vegas where if you'll recall prostitution is legal and apparently she's learned some interesting information. More interesting than she realizes because there are some people who want to make very certain she does not reach Phoenix where the Maricopa County District Attorney has her for a witness.Assigned to the case is Clint Eastwood who is characterized by himself as a tired old time server of a cop. He's not by reputation with the Phoenix PD a Harry Callahan. But to the regret of forces who want to see Locke dead and consider him an incompetent and expendable Clint fools them all.As a film The Gauntlet goes at a good clip and the suspense from the first attack against Eastwood and Locke does not let up for a second. The dialog between Eastwood and Locke is crisp and entertaining and the action sequences well staged. The two leads get good support from Pat Hingle as Eastwood's luckless partner and William Prince the corrupt Chief of the Phoenix PD. I'm not sure whether Prince wants Locke dead for her testimony linking him to organized crime or for the fact she can testify to some alternate sexual practices he favors. Either way Prince is absolutely manic about making sure they never get to Phoenix alive.For fans of Clint Eastwood The Gauntlet is one of his best films one of my favorites of his and something not to be missed.".

Clint Eastwood's bland action direction is partly to blame the star failing to generate any sense of excitement despite numerous situations in which certain death seems like the likely outcome for Shockley and Malley the film's biggest drawback however is Sondra Locke who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag if her life depended on it and who doesn't even have the looks necessary to excuse such a lack of talent.";

The scene where Shockley was crawling through the house trying to get away from the firestorm of bullets that are flying all around and tearing up everything next to him and... he never gets hit??? What are the odds of that happening?

At the time I found the story very powerful because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.Last year I finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have stuck with my memories. Watching the show as an adult I was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. My girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories.

I do not think I have heard of a horror movie starring Santa Claus and while it is not necessarily a bad idea there is a reason it is straighttovideo. With that in mind this was better than I would have thought.It seems as if Santa Claus Bill Goldberg is actually a demon who lost a bet to an angel. Because of the bet Santa now had to be nice and deliver gifts to the children of the world for 1000 years. It turns out that last year was year one thousand and now Santa is pretty upset and taking it out on innocent families.Nicholas Douglas Smith is a teenager who has taken after his grandfather and is not particularly fond of the Christmas holidays. Soon it is revealed to Nicholas how Santa came about by his grandfather. Since Santa has for some reason targeted Nicholas he and his girlfriend Mary Emilie de Ravin take it upon themselves to destroy the Christmas demon.Goldberg was a unique choice to play Santa Claus. He is not exactly what I would expect in a Santa Claus but it turns out to be a great decision. Turns out Santa is buff and resembles a biker. Also his reindeer is played by a buffalo and looks pretty bad ass. It matches Goldberg perfectly.Some of the special effects were pretty cool and just as many were pretty hokey. I wish directors would not even consider the bluegreen screen as an option if you plan on making a decent movie.Basically you already know if this is the type of movie for you. If you liked movies such as Uncle Sam Frost or any other BMovie that is similarly cheesy then you will most likely enjoy Santa's Slay too. If you are the type of person that finds faults in any movie and are hard to please then skip it. It won't be worth your time. 6.510".

One day Santa loses a bet with an angel and must play nice for 1000 years this part was told in stop motion animation. Well his punishment is up and he's here to wreck havoc. Only an old inventor his grandson Nicholas Yuleson and girlfriend Mary played by Emilie de Ravin can stop him. This film takes a fun look at the Holidays with the blackest of black humor. It opens with Chris Kattan Rebecca Gayheart Fran Drescher and James Caan getting slaughtered by Santa. There are countless of other cameos strewn throughout the movie. Oh and did I mention that WWE wrestler Bill Goldberg is playing Santa and doing his own stunts? And that Brett Ratner Rush Hour 13 XMen 3 produced this? There is much fun to be had here such as Santa beating up Christmas Carolers kids running from Santa on snow mobiles and a Jew holding up the Star of David to Santa similar to a cross to a Vampire in hopes his faith would save him. You will see a candy cane in the eye a Christmas star in the back Santa's sleigh getting valet parking and some HoHoHoes in stripper attire.The production values were very high and it looks as though it was shot on 35mm. They had great props like a Santa's Slay driven by a yak buffalo ?. The sound varied a bit during dialogueheavy and actionheavy scenes which caused me to raise and then lower the volume a few times. I only have two minor gripes. While there is a high body count they skimp on the gore. The film overall is more comedic than scary so Gorehounds will not be as amused.Another thing was girlfriend Mary's personality inconsistencies. Yes I pay attention to character development even in horror films. They show her as a strong woman driving a big truck shooting guns and putting her boyfriend's hands on her breasts. But once Santa arrives she can only whine about how scared she is. She even pulls out the Stupid Card by stopping dead in her tracks while in the middle of a getaway to talk to her boyfriend about her feelings.Favorite Quote A few good ones but my favorite was when Nicholas shines a flashlight in Santa's eyes temporarily blinding him and Santa yells I'm Santa Claus not fcking Dracula!DVD Extras Scene Selection Audio Set Up Deleted Scenes Casting Taking the Reins Steiman's First Film 2 Easter Eggs one features 6 trailers and of course Commentary with the Director and Producer. This explained how Goldberg met his wife. She was a stunt double for the trapeze stripper in pasties whose crotch his face was buried in for 4 days. Duh. How else would they have fallen in love?Bottom Line Good for some laughs but minimal goressex.

The Plot is that after Santa Claus loses a curling match with an angel he is required to be nice for 1000 yearsspecially with the children. However after 1000 years passes Santa's ready to seek revenge on that angel and everybody who is in his way what includes all habitants from Hell Town. And he kills without any reason what shows that he is indeed very evil.

And even though I've seen a multitude of holiday themed movies you don't often associate yuletide cinema with dark humor.. but here it was a portrayal of Santa Claus that is about as dark and on par with David Sedaris and his story of Six to Eight Black Men where Santa is a former Bishop of Turkey and travels not with reindeer but rather with an entourage that is ready to kick those who are naughty. But enough about Mr. Sedaris..This is the first time I've seen Goldberg on any screen and I thought he was fitting for the role. I enjoyed the more recognizable actors making their appearances just to die off which is somewhat akin to George Clooney playing the voice of a dog in South Park.To keep it short and sweet this was a fun movie with a unique take on Santa. I look forward to seeing more from Goldberg gritty action movies perhaps?. I also look forward to more from David Steiman writerdirector. Because I saw this as a genuine attemptsuccess of creating a new subgenre and unique approach to make a dark comedy on happy holiday icons I give this movie a 8 out of 10.".

Because I saw this as a genuine attemptsuccess of creating a new subgenre and unique approach to make a dark comedy on happy holiday icons I give this movie a 8 out of 10.";

Santa Bill Goldberg is the sonofSatan and is out to scare children after a thousand years of imprisonment. he is killing for no other reason then to kill. Standing in his way is the man who imprisoned him to serve the children Grandpa Robert Culp and his grandson Nicholas Douglas Smith.For some odd reason Santa finds the oddest way of killing people lighting people on fire with coal choking them with a wreath or just running them over with his reindeer. For two hours or so we watch two stupid teenagers run around and hide finally leading to a rocket launcher blowing up a reindeer. In the end I was just like WTF. I was confused lost and a little humored by the movie. The fight scenes with Goldberg are pretty cool and sometimes he does act well. In the end the film doesn't make any sense it's stupid but it's pretty funny when you don't care what you're watching. Seeing Goldberg actually try to act is hilarious but some of his lines did make me laugh and in the end did give a convincing performance. The best was the giant reindeer. that pulled his sled. If you watch it don't expect a masterpiece actually don't expect much at all. Just watch it for the action not the story. Santa's Slay. Starring Robert Culp bill Goldberg Douglas Smith and Emilie de Ravin.2 12 out of 5 Stars.".

Nicholas and his girlfriend Mary Mackenzie Emilie de Ravin try to escape from the killer and find a way to stop him until the end of Christmas.The first three minutes of this movie presents one of the best sequences of black humor that I have recently seen with the Christmas dinner of a happy family and the arrival of the wicked Santa Claus. After the initial credits the old lady cursing everybody is also hilarious. However this unknown actor Douglas Smith with his silly baby face is awful and spoils practically all his scenes. This film and Emilie de Ravin the Claire of Lost deserved a better lead actor. Robert Culp is also very weak and noncharismatic in the role of Grandpa. Emilie de Ravin has the best lines and attitudes along the story and I found hilarious her quote He is scary and educational.

	schema:headline " Ho Ho Ho this movie is so slaying stupid but watchable.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is just awful like black coal in a Christmas stocking. I guess if you don't take it serious it's a bit watchable but I just can't hide from the truth that this movie has a really dumb low brow comedy. Directed by David Steiman Santa's Slay has a killer Santa Claus played by former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg who every Christmas come down from hell to kill the wicked. It's like the movie took its plot from the TV Animation Show Futurama's 1999 season episode 4 'XMAS Story' or seem a ripoff 1984's Silent Night Deadly Night. It's interesting that Bill Goldberg was pick to be the evil Santa Claus in a way because Goldberg came from Jewish heritage. So it was no surprise that some Jewish people find the movie offensive due to the film portraying one of them as a Christmas hating Satanist. I think the majority of Jewish people that work on the film see it as a lightweight dark comedy that both mocks Christmas and the negative stereotype of the Jewish people. Not only does Santa Claus kill a Christian pastor Timmons played by Dave Thomas but a lot number of Jewish character actors such as Saul Rubinek Fran Drescher Chris Kattan and Rebecca Gayheart. Honestly I don't know why the talented James Caan is in this movie! He could had done better. I don't know what the movie is trying to say with the over the top origins of Santa Claus here. In the movie apparently Santa is the AntiChrist produce by the result of a virgin birth by Satan. Just like Jesus on Christmas Santa acts as his enemy. Somewhere around 1005 A.D Jesus  God defeat Santa in a bet during a curling match that sentenced Santa to deliver presents on Christmas for 1000 years. First off curling match? The sport wasn't even invention yet and from all the weird sports you can pick from you pick the most boring sport in the world for your movie. Does anybody find curling funny? Anyways after 1000 years Santa is free to kill again in 2005 of the time this movie came out. The movie does awkwardly use a lot of Christmas and Satanist puns to give up the point that the settling for this film is in a town call Hell Township. Lot of Christmas references in this film. The jokes are so juvenile that even a 5 year old can get it. There isn't really much to guess as they put it out there for everybody to laugh at. They even had a scene where a grandma get ran over a helldeer AKA reindeer to hint that they were making fun of that Christmas song. The movie does use a lot of stupid toilet humor and dick jokes. The tongue in cheek humor in this movie is really dry. Lot of out of the blue cursing doesn't make any of these jokes in the movie any funnier. Honestly even if my eggnog was spiked I really doubt I would find this movie as funny. It's hard to find this movie as scary. Bill Goldberg wasn't one bit scary nor funny. Bill Goldberg was never a good actor nor a good wrestler as well. His limited talent really shows in the film. He can barely move due to his large mass and he's doesn't speak much besides one liners. The movie even hints the wrestler persona of Bill Goldberg by showing him do the Jackhammer on somebody and quoting 'Who's next?'. As a wrestling fan it's kinda cool to see that but also takes away from the real story. It's really hard to cheer for anybody besides the killer Claus because the main character Nicolas Douglas Smith is somewhat selfish and immature. His acting is so wooded that it burns to listen to him speak. It like watching a log cracking in a fireplace while your nuts is roasting on the open flame. Talking about nuts the movie has a guy taze there. The kills are so over the top cheesy that it borderlines cartoony. The special effects are just awful. It's so fake looking that even prowrestlers are like pointing it out. There is some female characters in the film but they serve nothing to the plot beside being a loveinterest to the annoying male character and for others background nudity. I'm not Santa but they can sit on my lap anyday. In my opinion there was some optimism that a good Christmas horror movie would come and sadly this was not that film. There was much to work with the material like how Santa is spelled with the same letters as Satan but the movie barely use anything. The movie could had gone into his mind and explain why he is evil. The years of being in the North Pole running a sweat shop elf based enterprise could be interesting. Only if the movie was a bit longer. 78 minutes is kinda short. For a BList movie it isn't that bad but pretty dumb. Anyways the movie leaves open to a sequel if they really wanted to. Unlike a Christmas list I wouldn't be checking this twice.".

Santa's Slay is a very untraditional horrorholiday movie with a really stupid plot and lousy gore effects but you can't help laughing at wrestling legend Bill Goldberg in the role of baddest Santa. And even though he won't win any Academy Awards anytime soon he's certainly a lot bettercooler than his colleague Hulk Hogan was in Santa With Muscles. He and gorgeous Emilie De Ravin are the only cast members worth mentioning by the way as the male leads are embarrassingly weak. Especially that Douglas Smith boy!

He makes up for lost time and starts to kill people.If I could give it 11 I would. Based on this performance I think Goldberg will have quite the movie career.".

But after I saw it and I realized how great this movie was how complex the plot was and how this may be one of the great movies of our generation.I mean the synopsis is Bill Goldberg plays the devil's son who lost a wager with a angel and was forced to spend 1000 years playing Santa but now the wager of that time has run out and good old Santa isn't so joyful anymore. He makes up for lost time and starts to kill people.If I could give it 11 I would. Based on this performance I think Goldberg will have quite the movie career.";

	schema:reviewBody "Santa's Slay is a mildly impressive little slashercomedy set during the cheerful holiday season. The film opens with a hilarious Christmas dinner gone wrong and we are then introduced to Nicholas Yulesone a normal teenager with a seeminglysenile grandfather. It's Christmas eve and his love interest Mary visits their house after work. Nicholas' grandfather seems a little crazy with a bomb shelter in his basement theorizing that Santa Claus is actually the son of Satan and is a maniacal killer  but there may be some truth to his theory. Because on Christmas day Santa begins a psychotic rampage in their town killing off everyone naughty and nice. Now Nicholas and Mary are the only ones who know about the demonic Santa Claus and it's their job to stop him before he takes complete control  they just have to survive all the way through Christmas day.I'll forewarn you if you rent this film and are expecting a serious horror movie you will be seriously disappointed. But if you go into it without any high expectations you should find this film highly enjoyable. The story is completely ridiculous utter nonsense. The script is underdeveloped. The special effects weren't great. Then why do I enjoy this film you say? Well it's funny. It's a black comedy with plenty of comic elements thrown into it even though it's a quite violent movie. The film boasts a fairly familiar cast especially during the short but hilarious opening scene featuring some fairly bigname celebrities including Fran Drescher James Caan Rebecca Gayheart and Chris Kattan. Bill Goldberg a wrestler plays the demonic Santa and Emilie De Ravin of The Hills Have Eyes remake plays the character of Mary. All of the performances were decent enough some of them were unbelievable but this whole movie was unbelievable.The entire film is really laughable  not necessarily in a bad way but just because of the completely unrealistic campy premise of it all. Nonethelesss Santa's Slay provides plenty of entertainment and some good laughs for a holidaythemed movie. It's not scary at all just on the gory side. I'd say it's much more funny than it is scary but technically it can be seen as a horror film  a really corny one at that but a horror film nonetheless. Among all of the other Christmasthemed horror films out there that are much more serious the masterpiece Black Christmas and Silent Night Deadly Night this one sticks out just because of it's inventive story and fun atmosphere. Just don't expect to be scared for ninety minutes.Overall Santa's Slay is a campy funny gory allaround fun little movie. It's unrealistic and it's completely cheesy but it's surely fun entertainment that anyone who enjoys black comedies will want to check out. If you're expecting a serious horror flick avoid this but if you enjoy lighthearted stupid but in a fun way slasher movies then this movie is perfect. 610.".

I not only stopped watching long before it finishedignoring the sinister urge to keep looking at this twisted wreck of a movie but I actually felt a twinge of deep sorrow that the human race could produce a movie like this and some people would actually like it. Grantedmostly drunken jobless potential rapists who live in their parents' basements but people nonetheless.The fact that Santa's Slay even the title is a lame pun doesn't take itself seriously doesn't make it clever. This movie knows it sucks. It only hopes that if it pretends not to care that it sucks you won't care either. The acting is horrible as you'd expect. The premise itself isn't horrible but that means nothing if the movie itself is absolute garbage.There is nothing and no one to care about in this film. It's pure nihilist pointless hatred. This movie hates everyone Christians young people old people women children even itself. The opening sequence presents an unpleasant materialistic family shame on you James Caan! then expects the audience to take pleasure in watching Santa Clause barge in and murder them in gruesome ways burning one girl's hair off down to her charred red scalp then dunking her in eggnog while happy Christmas music plays. Get the joke? The music is happy but UNHAPPY things are happening! Oh the irony!Listen crappy moviedirector just because people are unpleasant doesn't mean we want to watch them brutally murdered in supposedly amusing and corny ways. Well maybe you do but you probably used to torture puppies.Santa's Slay is actually worse than Manos the Hands of Fate if only because Manos didn't have the luxury of a big budget and some name actors.

	schema:headline " The Legend of Belle Starr";
	schema:reviewBody "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation undoubtedly produced their chick flick western Belle Starr to cash in on their success with their earlier outlaw biography Jesse James with Tyrone Power. Moreover this biographical oater appropriates the postCivil War South as its setting and uses both the 'Lost Cause' sentiments of old diehard rebels and the evils of Reconstruction in the Missouri to shape its protagonist. Indeed Fox appears to have cast the beautiful Gene Tierney as the eponymous heroine in her fourth role based on her striking resemblance to Gone with the Wind beauty Vivian Leigh. Cisco Kid director Irving Cummings and Drums Along the Mohawk scenarist Lamar Trotti play fast and loose with the truth about the title character. They use AfricanAmericans as storytellers to frame their story. In fact the film unfolds largely in flashback when a young black girl discovers a doll in the ruins of the Shirley Plantation. Her father declares that it must have belonged to Belle Shirley and the story picks up after the Civil War. Later Belle Starr concludes with Belle's death and three AfricanAmericans describe Belle as if she were a mythic supernatural entity that can shapeshift in to a red fox. Not surprisingly Belle Starr concerns the legend rather than the life of this notorious dame outlaw. For example she lived longer in real life than her cinematic counterpart but she died in real life the way that she does in the movie version getting shot from ambush by an assassin. Typically Hollywood movies in conformity with the Production Code Administration had to punish film characters that strayed from the law by killing them at the end of the movie. In Belle Starr the heroine is riding hellbent for leather to town to give herself up after she realizes the error of her way. Naturally her death is preordained.".

Yes it's dated from a liberated perspectivebut remember the era that it's set in as well as the time in which it was producedwith some excruciating dialogue. But it has its redeeming virtues entertainment value and deserving of a DVD release after years of obscurity on channels that us civilians can't afford to add to basic peasant vision.A dramatized sanitized account of the most notorious female outlaw who rode alongside such notables as Jesse James it boasts gorgeous cinematography in Techincolor a good musical score and wonderful costumes. Whenever Randolph Scott is associated with a project you know it will be a decent western.However the best relationship in the film is the one that exists between Belle Starr and Major Thomas Grail the Yankee commander and childhood chum who must bring her to justice in spite of his deep love for her. It is the sparks between the beautiful Gene Tierney and the handsome Dana Andrews that really makes this movie preceding the film noir classic Laura and two later collaborations.The gorgeous fiery Belle Shirley Gene Tierney sympathizes with the Southern rebels so much so that she even helps Captain Sam Starr Randolph Scott hide from the Yankee forces in Missouri by letting him stay in her home after he is wounded.When the Yankees discover this they set her house aflame and burn it to the ground. Defying them she joins Starr and his followers at their secret hideout and begins assisting them in robberies and raids chasing Carpetbaggers and running afoul of the Yankees. The bandit queen and her outlaw lover marry and continue with their Confederate cause. But only when things get far too dangerous does Belle realize that death may be too high of a price to pay for what she so immensely believes in. Sam Starr insists that there be one more dangerous escapade after agreeing to give up his personal vendetta. This leads to tragic consequences when Belle unwittingly puts herself in the line of fire placing her own life in jeopardy. The lowlife drunkard Jasper Tench who expects the much emphasized reward money for killing Belle Starr only gets disdain and hatred from the townsfolk having deprived them of their heroine and Starr turns himself in and both he and his enemy Grail grieve over the woman they both loved.I found the age difference between Scott and Tierney distracting going by what I remember as I haven't seen the film in years and also obvious is the battle that Tierney has with the accent that she assumes throughout the film. I know people having been complaining about the racist elements throughout the movie as with GWTWbut I like to think of it as a lesson on how things have changed. Chill Wills is in fine form as one of the rebels Shepperd Strudwick billed as John Shepperdis quite good as Belle's rather illfated brother Ed while Louise Beavers best remembered from her role in John Stahl's 1934 version of Imitation Of Lifedoes a good turn as Mammy Lou although her performance doesn't hold a candle to Hattie McDaniel's portrayal in GWTW.It's a good movie and it's nice to watch and a good substitution if you're not in the mood to indulge in a threeandahalf hour epic.Note to FOX as you are releasing many of your older films on DVD do likewise with Belle Starr. Don't leave this and many other gems to rot away in the studio vault!".

One of the very few things that this film got right was that Belle Starr as befit a lady to the manor born rode side saddle. You wouldn't catch Calamity Jane doing that.If you saw this film you would think that Belle's career ended a few years after the Civil War was over. In fact Belle's time on earth was 1848 to 1889 and in that period Belle Shirley married several times the last being a Cherokee Indian named Sam Starr. No hint of that background in Randolph Scott he plays the part as the real Randolph Scott was a courtly southern gentleman from Virginia.I don't know if Gene Tierney was in the Scarlett O'Hara sweepstakes but in playing Belle Starr she does it in the fiddledeedee tradition that Vivien Leigh did in Gone With The Wind. She's got all the men in the area ready to do and die for her and that includes Dana Andrews the Yankee major who is from Missouri also and has a real case of the hots for her. But Dana does his duty no matter how distasteful it is and Tierney's heart is only for Randolph Scott.The real Belle was quite a bit more earthy a character and had a few children as well. One of them a daughter became the madame of a brothel later in life. This film is entertaining with Tierney acting like Scarlett O'Hara and the plot lifted from that other Twentieth Century Fox classic about a Missouri outlaw Jesse James.Belle Starr will never make the top ten list of any of the cast members.".

	schema:reviewBody "How many westerns have there been about the life of Belle Starr? For that matter who knows that much about her real life? I remember seeing this film as a youngster and fell in love with it. I have always liked civil war films and 20th Cent. Fox put together a very good cast in the 1941 version. Gene Tierney plays the bandit queen very well despite forcing herself to use a phony southern accent throughout the film. Randolp Scott is resplendent as captain Sam Starr a renegade who rounds up bunch of confederate soldiers near the end of the civil war to stir up trouble in post war Missouri. Scott hates carpetbaggers and yankee soldiers in equal amounts and has no problem raiding banks and railroads for booty. Along the way he meets up with Belle Starr who finds Scott very brave. Belle Starr is a fiery southern belle and when the yankees burn down her home because she is caught harboring Captain Starr she joins forces with the rebels in her hatred against the transplanted Yankee forces sent to Missouri to clean out the rebel rabble. An odd love twist forms when her childhood friend Dana Andrews a yankee captain fights to conceal his true feelings for her and his hatred against Sam Starr and his rebel friends. Along the way Scott and Tierney become married and continue raiding and chasing out carpetbaggers out of Missouri. The twosome become a Missouri legend much to the anger of the yankee forces trying to capture them. Jasper Tench a town misfit and drunk shoots and kills Belle Starr near the end of the film sending Scott into surrendering to the yankee forces. Good scene at end when Scott surrenders to Andrews and both men nearly lose their composure in sadness over Belle's death. Belle's mammy played by Louise Beavers in a good supporting role adds a touch of warmth and comfort to Belle throughout the film.Good performances by Chill Wills as a redneck southern soldier and John Shepard who plays Belle's brother Ed. You might get teary eyed at the end of this film. Excellent western.".

Gene Tierney with a heavy southern accent is very good as Belle and so is Randolph Scott as Sam Starr. It is very rare to see Scott in a romantic part and he comes out great. It is curious that they show the three Younger brothers with a different surname Cole. That is quite a direct reference to Cole Younger yet they changed the names.

Maybe the reason his performance in this film is so uninspired is that he realizes how far from reality this story has strayed. The real Belle Starr was hardly an 'outlaw queen'  she was as ugly as a pig's rear end and about as charming. According to something in the plot some guy  a military guy or a marshal I forget which  was so smitten with her that he followed after her. He must have been blind. The problem as I see it is that the woman had a pretty name and a questionable history so they made her into an 'outlaw queen'. However if her name had been a reflection on this 'queen's' beauty she would have been named 'Selma Klagshultz' or maybe 'Ethel Gumpox'. Would they have made this same movie with an 'outlaw queen' who didn't sound like one? They made a movie out of a pretty name and modified the ugly wearer to suit.I don't know why they insist on making these stories so romanticized but this was so far from reality it was a joke. If the real story isn't good enough then write something else altogether. The real Belle Starr's story was maybe just MAYBE good enough to make into a movie in my opinion but this movie is just a waste of time and film. If the makers wanted a movie like this they should have invented a whole character name and all and created a story rather than taking a historical character and turning her into something she was not.

He states that it's 'the prettiest part of the truth'.Unfortunately the movie never even gets to any part of the truth regarding the life of Belle Starr pretty or otherwise. The title of the film is apparently taken from a Richard K. Fox novel of the same name a writer and publisher of the National Police Gazette so right there one's sources are questionable. At least the principal players had credibility in other pictures in this one they're doing the best they can under the circumstances. Gene Tierney in particular portraying the title character comes across as unusually sarcastic and whiny. That may not have been her own fault as the director obviously had some input into the role but it had a negative effect on this viewer.Utilizing piecemeal aspects of American Civil War history the film introduced elements from the real life of Belle Starr but that's about it. In reality Sam Starr was a Cherokee Indian and was actually Belle's second husband they lived in Indian Territory and were eventually arrested by Bass Reeves for horse theft in 1883. Both served time and oddly Belle was a model prisoner for the nine months she served at the Detroit House of Corrections.The picture did get a few things right Belle Starr did ride sidesaddle and did marry Sam Starr Randolph Scott. Two characters introduced in the story as the Cole Brothers Joe Sawyer and Joe Downing were obviously based on two members of the JamesYounger Gang brothers John and Jim Younger. That was established when it was mentioned they once rode with Quantrill's Raiders during the Civil War. The death of Belle Starr is also dealt with accurately she was killed in an ambush in 1889 though her murder remains unsolved with various theories offered.There are a handful of TV and movie Western treatments of Belle Starr but the only other one I've seen is an episode from 1954's Stories of the Century it was actually the premier episode. That one presented Belle as a horse thief and all around bad girl while Sam was a shiftless drinker and gambler a lot closer to the truth than this movie suggests. In that story Belle Starr is portrayed by Marie Windsor in a better considered casting decision.".

So when you watch the movie you need to remember that it is complete fiction from start to finish.Another thing about the film that is pure fiction is the film's depiction of the Reconstruction era.

The only horrible stereotype missing is the watermelon! Again this film is definitely NOT a history lesson but promotes a racist view of this time. And sadly at the time the film was made it was the popular view of this period. I really wish that when Turner Classic Movies showed the film that it would have been introduced by Robert Osbourne with a disclaimer about all this! The real life Belle Starr was NOT a woman crusading against the evil Yankee and political injustice. No she was a crook and had a long history of marrying crooks who ended up getting themselves shot. And not surprisingly eventually she was shot at age 41. She wasn't pretty and she was just plain vicious.Now if I completely turn off the parts of my brain that balk at these historical inaccuracies which is tough as I am retired history teacher what are the film's merits? Well the story is occasionally interesting and the production values are very goodwith nice color film stock and music. But the film also is full of ridiculous acting by Tierneywho seems more shrill and silly than anything else. As for her costars Dana Andrews and Randolph Scott they are both fine actors who are given little to do other than to stand back and watch Belle overact badly. The only one who came off well was Belle's brother Shepperd Strudwickhe had some good lines and was able to put across his character well. Overall a silly and inconsequential film. You can easily do better.".

But the film also is full of ridiculous acting by Tierneywho seems more shrill and silly than anything else. As for her costars Dana Andrews and Randolph Scott they are both fine actors who are given little to do other than to stand back and watch Belle overact badly. The only one who came off well was Belle's brother Shepperd Strudwickhe had some good lines and was able to put across his character well. Overall a silly and inconsequential film. You can easily do better.";

	schema:headline " A Dishonest Narrative";
	schema:reviewBody "The cinema has always had a cavalier disregard for historical fact and nowhere has this been more true than in its biopics of the famous men and women of the Old West whether heroes or villains. This film however is perhaps the most egregious example I have seen of Hollywood's penchant for fictionalising and romanticising Western history. There was a late 19thcentury outlaw named Belle Starr a fairly obscure figure during her lifetime but turned into a female Jesse James by sensationalist writers after her death. This film however has almost nothing to do with her story. By contrast even the notoriously inaccurate They Died with Their Boots On about General Custer also from 1941 and the almost equally inaccurate 1939 Jesse James with Tyrone Power seem like sober historical documentaries.The action takes place in the years immediately following the end of the American Civil War. The film was obviously influenced by Gone with the Wind made two years earlier. In this version the young Belle Shirley is a Scarlett O'Hara figure a fiery brunette Southern belle born into a wealthy plantationowning family and a passionate supporter of the Southern cause. After her family home is burnt down by the villainous Yankees Belle marries Sam Captain Starr a dashing guerrilla leader trying to liberate the South from Yankee tyranny. There would be little point in trying to list all the goofs and historical inaccuracies in Belle Starr it would be much easier to list the few things that it gets right. Indeed even when the scriptwriters try to be accurate they inadvertently make matters worse by making the story even less plausible than it might otherwise have been.The historical Belle Starr carried out most of her criminal activities in Texas and Oklahoma but was originally a native of Missouri and for some reason the filmmakers decided to set their story in that state. Now a storyline like the one set out above might make some sort of sense if it had been set in say Alabama or South Carolina it makes no sense at all when set in Missouri a state which had comparatively few slaves and no real plantation economy. Indeed it had only become a slave state in the first place because of a grubby compromise between pro and anti slavery factions in 1820 and it remained loyal to the Union throughout the Civil War. It therefore seems highly unlikely that Missourians would have flocked to the banner of Captain Starr as they are shown doing here.There was long an unwritten convention in Hollywood a convention dictated by the need to sell cinema tickets on both sides of the MasonDixon Line that filmmakers dealing with the Civil War era should not give offence to Southern feelings by pointing out such unpleasant truths as the evils of slavery or the fact that because it sought to perpetuate those evils the Confederate cause was a dishonourable one. This convention is observed in Gone with the Wind among other films but Belle Starr goes a step further. Not only does it seek to avoid offending Southerners it seeks to give quite gratuitous offence to Northerners.The only representative of the Northern cause we see is Major Thomas Crail a handsome cultivated young officer who is quite happy both to accept Belle's hospitality in her elegant stately home and then a week later to burn that home to the ground while courteously explaining that this act of arson is merely carried out to further the interests of the US Government. His personal feelings of course have nothing to do with the matter. It is worth pointing out that the film was made in 1941 at a time when much of Europe had fallen under Nazi control. All over the continent handsome cultivated young officers were either dining with the owners of elegant stately homes in occupied lands or burning those homes to the ground dependent upon which course of action would better further the interests of the Third Reich. Their personal feelings of course had nothing to do with the matter.Quite apart from this implied equation of the Yankees with the Nazis the film is offensive in other ways. By the forties it was no longer acceptable to portray black Americans in the way in which they had been portrayed a quarter of a century earlier in Birth of a Nation but things had not really improved. The black characters in this film are no longer the violent bestial savages of Griffith's film but are treated with patronising condescension as simpleminded childlike folk who treat their white masters with exaggerated respect. They regard Belle after her death as a legend virtually as a saint even though in her lifetime she was an ardent advocate of keeping them in servitude.Seen purely as an adventure drama in fact the film is not a bad one the acting and direction are of a reasonable standard it is visually attractive and it has the great advantage of starring the incomparably beautiful Gene Tierney the loveliest actress of the forties as Belle. In the 21st century however films like this one cannot be judged on artistic merits alone. Belle Starr is a deeply dishonest film not in the sense that it is less than faithful to historical fact which in Hollywood is at most a venial sin but in the sense that it contributes to a dishonest narrative of American history which seeks to excuse even to justify the cruelty and racism of the past. 410".

He's really quite an admirable fellow though.  He's unfailingly considerate and reasonable but brave and resourceful when coming to the aid of another as in the case of producer C.S.

I find it hard to accept the notion that the characterization is racist as some contend unless you consider the very act of a white person playing an Indian in dark makeup racist.  It can't be denied that many westerners find the accent amusing see Baboo in Seinfeld' or Apu in The Simpsons'.  Still Sellers' characterization of Bakshi is no stereotype and I don't feel that his portrayal brings discredit to anyone.That aside this is one damned funny film!  As anonymous' from Chicago has pointed out below there are interesting aspects there for your consideration if you choose to look for them.  More than just a series of pratfalls and sight gags The Party' is a multifaceted creation as is its central character.

In this the film is as rigorous as Antonioni's La Notte also set during the events of one day and night and the sight gags build and accumulate in a manner that is reminiscent of Jacques Tati with the same melancholic humor prevading the slapstick. The film is utterly charming with some acerbic touches pricking the hypocrisies of Hollywood and the film takes the time to let the characters especially the two principals played by Sellers and Claudine Longet in her only major film role develop.

	schema:headline " Blake and Peter do one together without Insp. Jacques";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a little uneven but if you stick to it you end up liking this warm and fuzzy little film the only Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers comedy without Chief Inspector Jacques Clousseau. Sellers had played an Indian before. In THE MILLIONAIRESS 1960 he was an Indian doctor working for the poor in London who attracts the world's richest woman Sophia Loren. That film has it's moments when the original George Bernard Shaw play creeps out but this improvised film of 1968 is far better.Sellers is an Indian film actor who somehow was signed up to do a lead part in a Hollywood production called SON OF GUNGA DIN. Sellers' actor is playing this supposed fictional character really fictional as Kipling never wrote about his brave water carrier having a family. In the opening fifteen minutes Sellers demonstrates the wisdom of being hired by refusing to die properly or is he trying to stretch out his deathbed sequence for the screen?. He is shot while badly wounded blowing a bugle call to the British troops about to be entrapped by the Indian rebels. Instead of falling down dead he keeps beeping his bugle again and again and again until the director tells him to stop it. Later he ruins a shot where he kills an enemy picket by forgetting that the movie is set in 1878 and Sellers is still wearing his waterproof wristwatch! Finally I think Stan Laurel would have appreciated this he ruins the onechanceonly destruction of the fort by explosives simply by tying his shoe on the plunger. Fired after the last he asks the director if he can still do television Sellers should be seen no more. But the director and the film producer Gavin McLeod  later of MCHALE'S NAVY THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW and THE LOVE BOAT call the studio President Mr. Clutterbuck J. Edward McKinley and tell him about what has just happened to send the film's budget into the stratosphere. McKinley says he'll see the actor never works in the film industry again and writes the name Hrundi V. Bakshi on a paper on his desk. Unfortunately he did not realize it is a list of his guests for a fancy dinner party the next day. So Clutterbuck's secretary sends BakshiSellers an invitation. What follows is a disaster upon disaster improv. Unlike THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK Edwards and Sellers approached THE PARTY as an experiment where they were creating escalating disasters at the dinner party that engulf all the guests. The escalating disasters is par and parcel for the work of Edwards' favorite comedians Laurel  Hardy for whom his slapstick comedy THE GREAT RACE 1965 was dedicated to.Sellers arrives at the party and quickly demonstrates the wisdom of inviting him. His shoe is muddy so he tries to nonchallantly clean it off in a pool the clean water rapidly turns black but the shoe floats away. Later due to Sellers' ineptitude the shoe ends up on a tray of canaps being served. Still later when he hurts his hand Sellers sticks it into a mound of ice on a table only to find the caterer put beluga caviar within the mountain of ice. His real problem is he is a square peg in a round hole. He can't mingle and join the people at the party many of whom have hostility towards him Marge Champion not dancing in this film is the stiff wife of a Congressman who just never cottons to Sellers. He tries to laugh at jokes not hearing them completely but laughing anyway or laughing at anecdotes that aren't funny. In his curiosity he experiments with the pushbuttons of the living room causing all kinds of odd disruptive errors to occur. He even ends up feeding Birdy num nums to the host's pet parrot.Only one person is actually friendly to him at the start  a western film star whom Sellers enjoys watching. They get on pretty well except for one mishap with a toy dart gun though Sellers isn't blamed for it. Then McLeod shows up with his latest protg Michelle Monet Claudine Longet and a second person turns out to be outofplace at the party only a French lady not an Indian man. In the meantime the problems multiply during dinner when besides Sellers the host and guests have to deal with a drunken waiter Steve Franken  best recalled as Dobie Gillis' rich rival Chatsworth Osborne Jr.. The dinner reduced to a shambles between Sellers and Franken including causing a squab to get twisted into a guests wig  don't ask the guests do the best they can. I can't get into all the sequences  that spoils the fun here.

	onyx:emotionText "It is a little uneven but if you stick to it you end up liking this warm and fuzzy little film the only Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers comedy without Chief Inspector Jacques Clousseau. Sellers had played an Indian before. In THE MILLIONAIRESS 1960 he was an Indian doctor working for the poor in London who attracts the world's richest woman Sophia Loren. That film has it's moments when the original George Bernard Shaw play creeps out but this improvised film of 1968 is far better.Sellers is an Indian film actor who somehow was signed up to do a lead part in a Hollywood production called SON OF GUNGA DIN. Sellers' actor is playing this supposed fictional character really fictional as Kipling never wrote about his brave water carrier having a family. In the opening fifteen minutes Sellers demonstrates the wisdom of being hired by refusing to die properly or is he trying to stretch out his deathbed sequence for the screen?. He is shot while badly wounded blowing a bugle call to the British troops about to be entrapped by the Indian rebels. Instead of falling down dead he keeps beeping his bugle again and again and again until the director tells him to stop it. Later he ruins a shot where he kills an enemy picket by forgetting that the movie is set in 1878 and Sellers is still wearing his waterproof wristwatch! Finally I think Stan Laurel would have appreciated this he ruins the onechanceonly destruction of the fort by explosives simply by tying his shoe on the plunger. Fired after the last he asks the director if he can still do television Sellers should be seen no more. But the director and the film producer Gavin McLeod  later of MCHALE'S NAVY THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW and THE LOVE BOAT call the studio President Mr. Clutterbuck J. Edward McKinley and tell him about what has just happened to send the film's budget into the stratosphere. McKinley says he'll see the actor never works in the film industry again and writes the name Hrundi V. Bakshi on a paper on his desk. Unfortunately he did not realize it is a list of his guests for a fancy dinner party the next day. So Clutterbuck's secretary sends BakshiSellers an invitation. What follows is a disaster upon disaster improv. Unlike THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK Edwards and Sellers approached THE PARTY as an experiment where they were creating escalating disasters at the dinner party that engulf all the guests. The escalating disasters is par and parcel for the work of Edwards' favorite comedians Laurel  Hardy for whom his slapstick comedy THE GREAT RACE 1965 was dedicated to.Sellers arrives at the party and quickly demonstrates the wisdom of inviting him. His shoe is muddy so he tries to nonchallantly clean it off in a pool the clean water rapidly turns black but the shoe floats away. Later due to Sellers' ineptitude the shoe ends up on a tray of canaps being served. Still later when he hurts his hand Sellers sticks it into a mound of ice on a table only to find the caterer put beluga caviar within the mountain of ice. His real problem is he is a square peg in a round hole. He can't mingle and join the people at the party many of whom have hostility towards him Marge Champion not dancing in this film is the stiff wife of a Congressman who just never cottons to Sellers. He tries to laugh at jokes not hearing them completely but laughing anyway or laughing at anecdotes that aren't funny. In his curiosity he experiments with the pushbuttons of the living room causing all kinds of odd disruptive errors to occur. He even ends up feeding Birdy num nums to the host's pet parrot.Only one person is actually friendly to him at the start  a western film star whom Sellers enjoys watching. They get on pretty well except for one mishap with a toy dart gun though Sellers isn't blamed for it. Then McLeod shows up with his latest protg Michelle Monet Claudine Longet and a second person turns out to be outofplace at the party only a French lady not an Indian man. In the meantime the problems multiply during dinner when besides Sellers the host and guests have to deal with a drunken waiter Steve Franken  best recalled as Dobie Gillis' rich rival Chatsworth Osborne Jr.. The dinner reduced to a shambles between Sellers and Franken including causing a squab to get twisted into a guests wig  don't ask the guests do the best they can. I can't get into all the sequences  that spoils the fun here. One of the best deals with Sellers desperately trying to find a place to pee and finding the bathrooms in use once by Mrs. Champion and finally using one in the master bedroom that he causes a flood in and even causes the band drummer to lose his drum don't ask.

	schema:reviewBody "I once had the pleasure of telling the legendary Dodgers announcer Vin Scully that he was in a Peter Sellers comedy this one of course. He is heard calling a game on the radio while Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi is looking for a restroom. Scully was quite pleased about this glowing in fact and I was able to walk away knowing I scored a point with the Hall of Famer.The Party is the kind of pleasure that keeps delivering in ways big and small. Reading the many reviews here about how sidesplitting the film is for them makes me a little jealous because the comedy isn't all that for me. It's funny yes but it works for me more as a goodhearted film about people without much of a chance in life finding strength and purpose in each other.The key line in the movie for me is when Bakshi standing up for a pretty girl is confronted by a nasty producer played effectively by Gavin MacLeod. Who do you think you are? the producer demands.In India we don't think who we are we KNOW who we are! Bakshi counters. It's Bakshi's one great standup moment in a film which shows him taking pratfall after pratfall and evidences his secret strength against all the derision around him He has integrity.So does the girl as played by Claudine Longet later famous for giving the Rolling Stones the inspiration for one of their classic bootleg songs after she shot and killed her skier lover. Longet is not really a looker in my book only mildly pretty but she has great charm and provides Bakshi with a measure of validation in the way she appreciates him and champions him after everything else in her life crashes down. Nothing To Lose she sings a great Henry Mancini song that offers ironic counterpoint since she has much to lose in one sense trying to get her big break but not in the sense that she is willing to sacrifice her integrity for it.The Party isn't an easy film to describe. Bakshi is accidentally invited to a party where he finds himself very much a fish out of water. Polite to a fault he tries to make himself inconspicuous and fails making a mess of the living room and rocketing a Cornish game hen onto a woman's wig. People walk all over him but he takes it in stride. When a cowboy star named Wyoming Bill Kelso gives him a painful handshake Bakshi grins and says he would have been disappointed if Kelso hadn't crushed his hand.The film just ambles along in its charming way bathing us in its West Coast '60s ambiance and making us feel like we are watching a very silly festivity go down in real time. The feeling of the film is noteperfect even when the jokes are labored. We get a sense of a multitude of characters including a dancing model a dipso waiter a frustrated host and many others many of whom are only glimpsed in the background and give the film a real sense of being lived rather than acted.Sellers shines as Bakshi because he manages to give us a character we can really care about even as we laugh at his misadventures. It would be easy to simply have made Bakshi the butt of every situation but sometimes he's the bystander while others create the craziness and other times he manages with a sly smile to turn a potentially hazardous situation to his advantage.The Party may be a great example of the virtue of keeping a good attitude about life and in realizing how much more important it is to be true to yourself than conform to others' expectations. Wisdom is the province of the aged but the heart of a child is pure he says before admitting he doesn't really know what it means. But watching The Party I think we get a pretty good idea what he meant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally after months of searching I find a copy of the DVD and I realize how truly worthwhile this search was! This film is hysterical! I've read that The Great Race is supposed to be Blake Edwards' tribute to Laurel  Hardy but Hrundi V. Bakshi is Stan Laurel's hindustani soul mate. Probably Peter Sellers' single funniest performance ever! He's always well meaning and gracious but just naive enough to cause chaos everywhere he goes. Much of the business about the wait staff is also straight out of the LH book of comic situations. Though the ending involving a baby elephant looks to me as if they simply ran out of ideas the rest of this movie more than makes up for it. Have another Birdy Num Num.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Party begins with a kind of lame parody of Gunga Din's final scene I guess you might consider it a SPOILER to Gunga Din so consider that before you check this one out.  Hrundi Bakshi Sellers is playing the main character of the new film production Son of Gunga Din but he's little more than a series of accidents waiting to happen. He ends up ruining a set piece which gets him fired. The producer of that film tells a studio exec to blacklist him. That exec accidentally adds Hrundi's name to the bottom of a party list. He goes and as you might expect ends up destroying everything around him like a small tornado. Most of the film takes place at this party and the film only really gets funny when Hrundi gets to the party where we meet various Hollywood phonies and stars who are full of themselves as well as a few innocent newcomers being beckoned to the infamous casting couch. All these people react in different ways to Hrundi but most like him and see him as a nice guy who probably doesn't belong there anyway. He becomes enraptured by a young French newcomer named Michelle Claudine Longet.Peter Sellers made a lot of films and I have to admit that I haven't seen many. What I particularly like about The Party is the character of Hrundi and Sellers' performance. Sellers' films are usually very funny but the characters are often just caricatures. I really like Hrundi. He could have easily been a gross stereotype. Sellers wears dark makeup to appear Indian and he speaks in an accent. But Hrundi is not just a stereotype. He is a genuinely lovable person. He does some stupid things but he always means well. I actually think the character would have been worth sequels.I am sure that Sellers and Blake Edwards were studying the French comedic filmmaker Jacques Tati when they were making this film. There are several scenes very very reminiscent of M. Hulot's Holiday Mon Oncle and Playtime. Hrundi seems to be clearly based on M. Hulot. Of course I am not accusing The Party of stealing or anything. I'm just happy that someone in Hollywood was a fan of Tati's films and felt that his formulae would work in an American film. I wonder how well this film did financially. It's not well known at all today. One more note my Lord Claudine Longet may be the single cutest girl I've ever seen! I don't know if I've seen her elsewhere. I can see why she didn't become a huge star. She's not imposing like others. Nor truth be told is she a great actress. But wowza!

The reaction shots that top all the gags. The comedy of embarrassment. Babe Hardy would be proud! There are some funny lines for sure but the biggest laughs come from moments that feature no dialog at all. There is very little slapstick until the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Point of No Return or The Assassin as it is known here in Britain is of course a remake of Luc Besson's French thriller Nikita and keeps closely to the plot of the original although the action is transferred from France to America. Some of the names such as Victor or AmandeAmanda are the same as or very close to those used in the original film although the name of the main character is changed from Nikita to Maggie. Besson had for reasons best known to himself given his heroine a masculine Russian Christian name. Like Nikita Maggie is a criminal and drug addict who murders a policeman during a raid on a pharmacy a crime for which she is sentenced to death. The sentence is apparently carried out soon after the trial but in reality Maggie's life is spared. The filmmakers ignore the fact that in America any death sentence is automatically subject to a lengthy series of appeals and reviews in California where the film is set only thirteen people out of nearly seven hundred sentenced to death have been executed during the last thirty years. She is given the option of being trained to work for the Government as a professional assassin if she refuses she will be killed and buried beneath the tombstone which already bears her name. Roger Ebert compares Maggie to a modernday Eliza Dolittle the heroine of Shaw's Pygmalion. This may seem an odd comparison given the nature of the work Maggie is being trained to do but it is in fact an apt one. The modern assassin must master not only martial arts weapons skills and computer technology but also such matters as deportment polite conversation fine dining and the art of looking beautiful. The rationale is presumably that as Maggie may be called upon to kill members of America's high society she needs to know how to behave in their company. The tuition she receives is obviously effective Maggie enters her charm school with the social graces of an alleycat and leaves with those of a dbutante. For all her poise and glamour however she also has the skills of a ruthless killer. The Government resettle Maggie in Venice Beach where she poses under an assumed name as an IT consultant and finds a boyfriend. Occasionally however she is called upon to take out a target whom the Government want dead either by delivering a bomb to their hotel room or shooting them dead in the street. At first she is happy to go along with their instructions but begins to develop a conscience about what she is doing and wants to leave her job. The idea of remaking a modern foreignlanguage film in English and with an American setting was anathema to many purists particularly to those on both sides of the Atlantic who see Europe as the home of High Culture and America as a land of vulgar Philistines who are too lazy to bother with reading subtitles. This however was a view which I found unfair as Nikita did not lose much if anything in translation when it was remade. Contrary to what some might think not every French or European film is an arthouse classic Besson's was a commercial thriller which was itself influenced by American models especially neonoir. Film noir as the name might suggest has always been appreciated in the French cinema the influence of Besson's model on John Badham's film might be seen as France's repayment of its debt to America. Moreover The Assassin has many virtues in its own right. It makes effective use of music there is a memorable score from Hans Zimmer possibly influenced by David Hentschel's music for Educating Rita. The soundtrack also features several songs by Nina Simone a particular passion of Maggie's. This seemed a rather conservative taste for a young woman of her generation but the explanation is that Maggie's enthusiasm derives from her mother. Bridget Fonda who has clearly inherited the classic good looks of her Auntie Jane is very good as the heroine both as the antisocial rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated seductive young lady of the later ones. There are effective cameos from Anne Bancroft as Amanda Maggie's tutor in the social arts and from Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner the ruthless deadpan killer called in to clean up when one of her jobs unexpectedly goes wrong. There is a larger contribution from Gabriel Byrne as Maggie's handler Bob a key role as the relationship between the two is a complicated one. At first Bob is only able to handle her by making veiled and sometimes open threats about what will happen if she does not cooperate but later he grows close to her almost like a substitute father. She passes him off to her boyfriend as her uncle. He is sympathetic to her desire to leave her job but his hands are tied by the attitude of his superiors. As a thriller The Assassin is a fastpaced and exciting one but it may also have a deeper significance as a critique of the death penalty. Maggie's development parallels that of Burt Lancaster's character Robert Stroud in The Birdman of Alcatraz who also starts off as a vicious conscienceless killer and gradually grows in humanity There is an obvious irony in the fact that she is sentenced to death for murder and that her life is then spared so that she may commit further murders on behalf of the State that has sentenced her. The further irony is that it is her career as an assassin which teaches her the value of human life. 710".

Exciting and stirring movie that was formerly adapted in French style by Luc Besson  dealing with an onceamoral street urchin become into a gorgeous woman of sensitivity and depth . A gang of armed drugaddicts break into a shop to try and steal drugs to fuel their habit and then takes place a bloody tour of force . However the police arrive too fast and all addicts but one are killed . The hardened criminal Bridget Fonda  role previously acted by Anne Parillaud and Bridget was cast after Jodie Foster and Winona Ryder turned it down  a punkjunkie sociopath acts with consistence violence  even in police custody and is given a life sentence . Having killed a cop when the theft gone awry is condemned to death row but she is reprieved by a strange organization . After being drugged by her captors she wakes up to find that she has been spared in order to train her as a government assassin . However topsecret agency official a Svengali alike Gabriel Byrne  interpreted in the French version by Tcheky Karyo and Antonio Banderas was considered for the role of Bob arranges a stage  so she can be elaborately trained as phantom killer and subdued into obedience in order to enroll in a governing finishing school. After a dramatic transformation in which she is trained in etiquette  she is allowed to leave and start a new life for herself . On her eventual release she turns into a sophisticated girl thanks to an old lady Anne Bancroft  role also acted by Jeanne Moreau . As a cover she gets a new identity and with a new beau  all the while carrying out agencymandated assassinations. And with a wonderful housemate a broadminded gentle boyfriend Dermot Mulroney  previously performed by Jean Hugues Anglade . The two fall in love but that complicates jobs. His good influence extends to breeding her a conscience that puts love over business alas unlike agency. However she begins to discover that there is more to life than she previously thought and soon begins to wish she could escape from her obligation. But the government aren't so easy to evade .This exciting noirthriller is packed with thrills  tension  suspense and lots of noisy action . From start to finish the action pace is fast moving  provides fast and furious entertainment with spectacular scenes . This is a stylish and particular version of Pygmalion by Bernard Shaw  including a master played by Gabriel Byrne and his disciple performed by Bridget Fonda . Displays nonstop action and is extremely entertaining and thrilling . Some scenes are brutal and with a load of violence. Still it's a good movie I think furthermore the incredible chemistry between Gabriel Byrne and Bridget Fonda the plot was moving and intense  it makes you want to know what happens after . Bridget is pretty good as the heroine who turns in violent tendencies to patriotic use  both as the antisocial rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated seductive young lady of the later ones  a bitterly ironic moral evolution for a contract killer . It benefits enormously from a memorably assured performances such as Miguel Ferrer as Kaufman  Anne Bancroft as Amanda  Olivia d'Abo as Angela Richard Romanus as Fahd Bahktiar and Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner . In addition a cameo by the same director John Badham as a roomservice waiter . Atmospheric musical score by Hans Zimmer  though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Michael Watkins and perfectly remastered  including his cameo as last guard at the gate during the escape. The motion picture was lavishly produced and professionally directed by John Badham with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics but with no originality  being a simple copy from original film  having directed one episode of recent Nikita series . However  Luc Besson declined the opportunity to remake his French hit Nikita. Other versions about Nikita character are the followings  Nikita series produced by Jay Firestone with Peta Wilson  Roy Dupois  Matthew Ferguson and Alberta Watson  and Nikita 52 episodes 20102013 with Maggie Q  Shane West as Michael  Lyndsy Fonseca and Aaron Stanford .".

However topsecret agency official a Svengali alike Gabriel Byrne  interpreted in the French version by Tcheky Karyo and Antonio Banderas was considered for the role of Bob arranges a stage  so she can be elaborately trained as phantom killer and subdued into obedience in order to enroll in a governing finishing school. After a dramatic transformation in which she is trained in etiquette  she is allowed to leave and start a new life for herself . On her eventual release she turns into a sophisticated girl thanks to an old lady Anne Bancroft  role also acted by Jeanne Moreau . As a cover she gets a new identity and with a new beau  all the while carrying out agencymandated assassinations. And with a wonderful housemate a broadminded gentle boyfriend Dermot Mulroney  previously performed by Jean Hugues Anglade . The two fall in love but that complicates jobs. His good influence extends to breeding her a conscience that puts love over business alas unlike agency. However she begins to discover that there is more to life than she previously thought and soon begins to wish she could escape from her obligation. But the government aren't so easy to evade .This exciting noirthriller is packed with thrills  tension  suspense and lots of noisy action . From start to finish the action pace is fast moving  provides fast and furious entertainment with spectacular scenes . This is a stylish and particular version of Pygmalion by Bernard Shaw  including a master played by Gabriel Byrne and his disciple performed by Bridget Fonda . Displays nonstop action and is extremely entertaining and thrilling . Some scenes are brutal and with a load of violence. Still it's a good movie I think furthermore the incredible chemistry between Gabriel Byrne and Bridget Fonda the plot was moving and intense  it makes you want to know what happens after . Bridget is pretty good as the heroine who turns in violent tendencies to patriotic use  both as the antisocial rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated seductive young lady of the later ones  a bitterly ironic moral evolution for a contract killer . It benefits enormously from a memorably assured performances such as Miguel Ferrer as Kaufman  Anne Bancroft as Amanda  Olivia d'Abo as Angela Richard Romanus as Fahd Bahktiar and Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner . In addition a cameo by the same director John Badham as a roomservice waiter . Atmospheric musical score by Hans Zimmer  though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Michael Watkins and perfectly remastered  including his cameo as last guard at the gate during the escape. The motion picture was lavishly produced and professionally directed by John Badham with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics but with no originality  being a simple copy from original film  having directed one episode of recent Nikita series . However  Luc Besson declined the opportunity to remake his French hit Nikita. Other versions about Nikita character are the followings  Nikita series produced by Jay Firestone with Peta Wilson  Roy Dupois  Matthew Ferguson and Alberta Watson  and Nikita 52 episodes 20102013 with Maggie Q  Shane West as Michael  Lyndsy Fonseca and Aaron Stanford .";

The only thing that kept me watching was hoping for another shootout like the one early in the movie. That was the only thing the movie has going for it that and the lines Fonda said. Those were truly great I don't think I've ever experienced that much provocation in a female role and Fonda did a great job on that. However I have no doubt that the originalmade by Luc Besson is better. So if you want to see something like this you should probably check it out instead of this. 510".

Everything!The camerawork is plain mediocre and not any action scene seems to have any choreography the whole movie lacks style and elegance while it should have those above everything else. I think if it would have been a good movie every scene would have been either very thrilling and exciting to watch or involving. The scene with the arrest in the beginning and the training scenes could have been so much better with a little imagination. The same for the other action scenes. The whole movie is very uninspired and a huge waste of talent. For those who like the chixwithguns genre which still seems a bit underused I recommend The Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson which is far superior and has a better plot to boot. Or if you want to see a really good film with Bridget Fonda go watch A Simple Plan.I give this film 4 out of 10 because it had so much more potential. Were it a Bmovie I had been more forgiving but it wasn't. It was however executed as badly as a Bmovie.".

I thought the supporting cast was fine including Dermot Mulroney as J.P. As the film went along I was drawn in and was never tempted to switch channels I saw it uncut on some premium channel. I wanted to catch every scene.  Which brings me to the main reason I find this totally implausible movie hard to pull myself away from Bridget Fonda. It's that simple. In this movie she'd get my vote for the most irresistible woman ever filmed. Absolutely gorgeous whether she's wearing a business suit or just her own skin. She plays her part perfectly I particularly like the scene where she's in the supermarket trying to buy food like an actual everyday shopper. Another good scene is when Uncle Bob comes to dinner and the tension builds really well. With this movie alone Bridget Fonda gives me the best reason I've ever had for buying a large screen television. I might try and catch La Femme Nikita sometime somewhere. Maybe. As for now I think I'm pitifully hooked on the remake...but that's not bad at all. Movie 610   BFonda 1110".

After her sobering ordeal she shows her crass yet subtlety through training in which she may not come back at all. When she makes the most out of life the only thing she like was the singer Nina Simone. If she looked like hell when she was on drugs Nina's music seems to make her more level headed. When she wore that dress to the dinner she was indeed deadly. And the way she moved no one could keep up to her. I liked the way she went down the laundry chute to avoid the rocket. And the Mardi Gras scene a killer classic. Getting through the crowd using all the fighting skill against those Cajun thieves that's wild. Assassins are always going to be stealthy but one wrong move and you're done. The romance scenes were not heavy yet the passion level is always going to be heavy at all times. A very good yet resourceful movie indeed. Great cast great plot and an ending that would be hard to believe for everyone. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.".

The music is also very well done mainly due to the lovely vocals of Nina Simone. Another aspect that I enjoyed was the shift in conflict from Maggie vs. herself to Maggie vs. everyone and then Claudia vs. the system.  It is easily said that the rehab and training program did too good of a job in the movie and gave her morals she didn't have previously but it was this fabulous job that created the second half of the film.  All in all this movie deserves more credit than it is usually given and if one can get away from the comparisons to La Femme Nikita then I think appreciated better.".

	schema:headline " GOOD SCIFI STORYLINE but not unforgettable";
	schema:reviewBody "Surrogates is a scifi movie about a future where every human being can connect their bodies into machines  they instantly live a different life through their robotic humanlooking surrogates. Anybody can just stay home all day while they are connected online with their surrogates that can just easily live outside in the real world. But when a surrogate was killed along with its user FBI agent Greer unravels a conspiracy that can lead to the death of billions of lives. The storyline of this movie falls somewhere around the categories where movies like Blade Runner Minority Report and IRobot belong. A movie that talks about how future technologies can affect human life and provide some philosophical pointofview that is worth pondering on. The idea of technology progressing into and reaching the boundaries that it becomes an abomination of nature. The movie tends to be thought provoking but does not make it good enough to be worth an entire evening of discussion. There were some moments that seemed preachy but could have been delivered more effectively if given a proper execution or interpretation. I am talking about the moments when our main character realizes the beauty of a world free from technological complexities. We also have the minor subplot of a corporation just concerned about safeguarding their own products. And a main character coming to the realization that these products eventually diminish the humanity of a person. It is surprising that the weaker point of this movie is the action. The terminator ripoff scenes seemed bland and there was a chase scene with a female surrogate that looked goofy because it employed a superhero type of action. To make it worse there are some visual effects that look like they've been rendered 15 years ago. With the main character of Bruce Willis running around in his actual human form for most parts of the movie we realize that he basically is the weaker person in this world of robotic mannequins and yes we do see him bleed a lot in this movie it is funny to note that Willis is one of those actors that just look cooler when he gets more scars and bruises it's like John McClane only without the crazy action. With him being the frail character that alone clearly reminds you that this is not your regular Bruce Willis action flick. The movie just basically starts out as a futuristic detectivetype movie then progresses into the same mood as Willis was in films like Unbreakable where he stumbles around a maze that leads him to some enlightening truth. The high points of this movie lie in the storyline. Second is the way the movie creates this amazinglooking world of a future inhabited mostly by surrogates. The surrealism of the movie is not too farout that most of what you see seem like they exist in the present world there are no flying cars or rockets everywhere its just the simple existence and presence of mannequinlike robots everywhere. The storyline may be good enough to be enjoyably satisfying but it certainly is not the best or perhaps not good enough to be groundbreaking. All in all SURROGATES is one of those good scifi movies that will simply entertain those who are fans of smart scifi movies. Action junkies may be a little disappointed though. This is a far cry from Blade Runner but this certainly gives you a cheaper version of that kind of enjoyment. I loved it. But it is definitely not unforgettable.".

And a main character coming to the realization that these products eventually diminish the humanity of a person. It is surprising that the weaker point of this movie is the action. The terminator ripoff scenes seemed bland and there was a chase scene with a female surrogate that looked goofy because it employed a superhero type of action. To make it worse there are some visual effects that look like they've been rendered 15 years ago. With the main character of Bruce Willis running around in his actual human form for most parts of the movie we realize that he basically is the weaker person in this world of robotic mannequins and yes we do see him bleed a lot in this movie it is funny to note that Willis is one of those actors that just look cooler when he gets more scars and bruises it's like John McClane only without the crazy action. With him being the frail character that alone clearly reminds you that this is not your regular Bruce Willis action flick. The movie just basically starts out as a futuristic detectivetype movie then progresses into the same mood as Willis was in films like Unbreakable where he stumbles around a maze that leads him to some enlightening truth. The high points of this movie lie in the storyline. Second is the way the movie creates this amazinglooking world of a future inhabited mostly by surrogates. The surrealism of the movie is not too farout that most of what you see seem like they exist in the present world there are no flying cars or rockets everywhere its just the simple existence and presence of mannequinlike robots everywhere. The storyline may be good enough to be enjoyably satisfying but it certainly is not the best or perhaps not good enough to be groundbreaking. All in all SURROGATES is one of those good scifi movies that will simply entertain those who are fans of smart scifi movies. Action junkies may be a little disappointed though. This is a far cry from Blade Runner but this certainly gives you a cheaper version of that kind of enjoyment. I loved it. But it is definitely not unforgettable.";

The whole thing feels like a cool episode of Star Trek or something on TV. The story is not riveting. I didn't really care about the characters. The timing was off things either came too late I was bored expecting them or so fast I couldn't really appreciate.Surrogates lacks that wowfactor.Example of bad timing At the start one wonders What do the users really look like? Anything like like their surrogate robots? I would expect that at first we see Bruce Willis just some facial hair which his robot doesn't have. Then eventually we see that he is older than his robot so he's cheating on age too. Even later still maybe we'd see an obese person at home posing as an athlete via a surrogate which looks nothing like him. Well Surrogates skips all that build up and goes straight for the punchline within 10 minutes we see a hot chick robot making with a young man turns out the hot chick is actually slovenly a middleaged man. Any twists to come later in this variety loses all punch.Worth a rental.".

Surrogates is the latest of these concepts and surprisingly one of the more well thoughtout ones. Based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele Surrogates imagines a world where humans interact with the world solely through robot versions of themselves called surrogates. They don't have to leave their homes and are impervious to danger.Writers Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato who previously collaborated with director Jonathan Mostow on Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines and sadly also wrote the Halle Berry Catwoman do their best work with this script which is of course not saying much. The positive here is that they truly embrace and explored the possibilities of a word where people don't interact with people  just the robot versions of themselves. It's the saving grace of the film. Bruce Willis stars as a homicide detective assigned to the very first case on record where the actual human operator of a surrogate died when the surrogate was killed. With nearly all of the planet using surrogates any knowledge of danger would throw the world into panic. Willis  Det. Greer  must track down the weapon that did the damage. When his surrogate is destroyed Greer begins to reexamine life through nonvirtual eyes.Without question however the concept and the setting are far more clever than the script. Ironically like robots when you boil down the exterior of Surrogates it's composed of overused clichs and recycled components of Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick stories. The simple premise and thoroughly conceived world of Surrogates manages to override some lousy story lines and character development but I'm not sure that most viewers who come to Surrogates looking for more action and less highconcept science fiction will be able to say the same.The subplots and back stories given to Greer and other characters are throwaway. At 89 minutes long Surrogates offers just enough in terms of story development to be a glorified TV detective show set in the future. The twists are foreseeable and the character motivations barely scratched at but it keeps your attention and stays focused enough on the central story that you never have to actually dwell on the more hollow elements of the film. The venerable James Cromwell who plays the disgruntled inventor of surrogates has never looked more shallow in a role but it's hardly of any consequence.Scifi epiphany? None here but a wellcalculated exploration of a possible new technology   yes. Surrogates is not mindless fun but it's not artistic science fiction perfected to a tee either. It does just enough to intrigue the futurecurious mind with a different cut from the same robot mold.Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "As with most films the trailer made this look like it would be something good  an action movie with an interesting scifi concept behind the world created for us. For this reason I was a bit surprised to see the finishing time of the film being listed as barely 90 minutes after the start time because I thought it would be hard to do all the things that the trailer proposed in such a comparatively short time. Leaving the film at the end I found it easily fitted into the 90 minute time period and sadly it achieved this by not actually doing a great deal that I had hoped it would. The plot sees us in a world where the majority of humans live their lives from the comfort of their homes experiencing life through the android clones surrogates. Although pockets of humanity have banded together to resist this generally they are seen as weirdos rather than having any sort of point. Due to the surrogates accidental death has been nearly eliminated while crime is at an alltime low. However when the destruction of a surrogate leads to the death of the user Detective Tom Greer is assigned to the case  a case that becomes even more high profile when the victim turns out to be the son of the creator of the surrogacy system.The potential is there in the plot and the various things they put in around it Tom's marriage the loss of a child etc but it doesn't really deliver on much of it. The subject matter isn't really that thought provoking partly because it doesn't hold out a lot for consideration by the viewer but partly because the film doesn't even seem happy with its own world creation. The whole idea is full of holes to the point that the film can't hide them or distract from them for very long and you get the sense that it is rushing a bit before it all runs out through its cupped hands. This is a shame because it niggles the whole way through and becomes worse whenever we see what surrogates can do their speed strength etc because you wonder why the world looks the same as it does when full of normal people. Outside of this though it is still an action film of sorts so one hopes for thrills of that side.Unfortunately this doesn't really spark either. The runningjumping effects are not perfect and the scale of some of the action sequences means that some come over as being remote and not engaging or thrilling  a bit like watching someone else playing an video game that you don't really care about. It isn't bad though  the effects do still work the action is still noisy and the plot is decent enough to at least not irritate  but that is the sort of level of film we're dealing with one where my praise of it includes me saying its not too irritating! The performances sort of match the patchwork feel to the world and the film  it doesn't seem to be sure of itself and neither are they. Willis does his best despite the wig etc he has to wear but doesn't manage to balance the action with the character stuff and thanks to the material doesn't really deliver on either. Mitchell is soso as is Pike while Cromwell essentially dials in a character he has sort of played before but it made sense in other films and Rhames is just plain odd.Surrogates is not an awful film  but it is a distinctly average one thanks to the amount of things it half does. Whether it is the action the substance the effects the performances or whatever it all appears to be OK but never pushing for more than that. Improved focus a stronger script and a longer running time could have made this a better film but ultimately it was just average.".

	schema:headline " Good Sci Fi concept and a mostly satisfying detective thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie boasts a great SciFi concept there are a couple of elements in the setting that is just too flawed even for science fiction. I'll come to those flaws shortly.Having accepted the implausible environment i.e. a world where 98 of humankind stay at home with their minds plugged into their surrogate robots that they live their life through the rest of the plot is pretty damn riveting. The mood of the film is more akin to Minority Report and certainly feels like a Philip K Dick narrative. The future depiction is not overly futuristic in technology other than the Surrogates themselves so don't expect a big budget effects ridden movie. Having said that the Surrogates robotic power makes for a couple of excellent action scenes comparable with the Will Smith vehicle I Robot.But as usual it is the awesome Bruce Willis who carries the movie both as surrogate a disturbingly young look with a frightening wig! and in human form. Thank god he carries it though because there are hardly any significant supporting characters in the story as it focuses on him most of the time as he investigates a rise in rare human murders. There is just something reassuring about watching him on screen regardless of the film quality. Going into the 4th decade since Die Hard he is still in my view a bonafide movie star.I said there were flaws in the whole concept. Well I find it impossible to even speculate the possibility that 98 of humankind will love sitting at home plugging their minds into a surrogate robot that they can live their lives through and let their natural bodies wither away with no exercise or self esteem. It seems they prefer to have sex as robots and flirt with young women surrogates who may be controlled by an old man or...well you get the gist. The appeal is supposed to be a 99 reduction in crime rate where accidents or crimes against a surrogate does not affect the human host. That concept is too flawed even for science fiction. What is stopping a surrogate from burgling a house killing its human owner for example? I don't knock the concept of surrogates itself its an excellent one but I don't buy the social environment.All in all this was a very very decent entry in the intelligent SciFi movie library.

	onyx:emotionText "Although this movie boasts a great SciFi concept there are a couple of elements in the setting that is just too flawed even for science fiction. I'll come to those flaws shortly.Having accepted the implausible environment i.e. a world where 98 of humankind stay at home with their minds plugged into their surrogate robots that they live their life through the rest of the plot is pretty damn riveting. The mood of the film is more akin to Minority Report and certainly feels like a Philip K Dick narrative. The future depiction is not overly futuristic in technology other than the Surrogates themselves so don't expect a big budget effects ridden movie. Having said that the Surrogates robotic power makes for a couple of excellent action scenes comparable with the Will Smith vehicle I Robot.But as usual it is the awesome Bruce Willis who carries the movie both as surrogate a disturbingly young look with a frightening wig! and in human form. Thank god he carries it though because there are hardly any significant supporting characters in the story as it focuses on him most of the time as he investigates a rise in rare human murders. There is just something reassuring about watching him on screen regardless of the film quality. Going into the 4th decade since Die Hard he is still in my view a bonafide movie star.I said there were flaws in the whole concept. Well I find it impossible to even speculate the possibility that 98 of humankind will love sitting at home plugging their minds into a surrogate robot that they can live their lives through and let their natural bodies wither away with no exercise or self esteem. It seems they prefer to have sex as robots and flirt with young women surrogates who may be controlled by an old man or...well you get the gist. The appeal is supposed to be a 99 reduction in crime rate where accidents or crimes against a surrogate does not affect the human host. That concept is too flawed even for science fiction. What is stopping a surrogate from burgling a house killing its human owner for example?

As an actor he has 70 projects contained within his historical biography and the guy keeps making bad films mediocre and mediocre films watchable.Surprisingly he has but one credit to his name in 2009 Surrogates a film that looks ripped from just about every other science fiction fantasy you have ever seen or read.Extracted by a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele Surrogates transports us to a future where people live through robotic surrogates from the privacy and safety of their own sanctuary and can manipulate their avatars into either copies of themselves or they can transform themselves into just about anything they want I say just about anything because the world was not full of Megan Fox's. The opening credits give us a 14 year history of how we got to whatever future we are in at Present Day.But when a murder  the first in an eon  occurs FBI agent Greer Willis is assigned the case and his subsequent investigation outside of his own surrogate is filled with enough revelations to bring down the entire Utopian world.I can't even begin to ramble of the countless movies the Surrogates borrows from in an effort to keep us entertained for the very swift 88 minutes of running time. Hell there were even a few television programs I thought it copied for certain scenes.That noted Surrogates is not all that bad. Director Jonathon Mostow Terminator 3  which I actually liked might not have put the most seasoned piece of scifi on the screen but he could have done much worse with the cheesy premise.The special effects are kinda few and kinda crappy. A scene with a surrogate riding on the hood of a car was blue screen embarrassment. But the special effects are kept in tow as Mostow tries for more of an atmosphere than he does an all out future world experience.Bruce Willis always throws me off in movies where he has hair and Ving Rhames shows up as a human ? who opposes the surrogate conglomerate. It's been 15 years since Rhames and Willis had screen time together and I was thankful there was no plastic ball in their mouth and a gimp parading in front of them while they approached their purpose in the script.Surprisingly for all the borrowing and lack of any true originality Surrogates is watchable. The ideas are all squished think of a marshmallow being squeezed through a key hole into an entertaining if not enthralling sit that might not exactly be worth 50 and a babysitter to make a night out of but it can easily be a rewarding DVD rental in the new year.Recommendation is clearly to rent it.www.killerreviews.com".

Admittedly these were two great movies yet I feared this movie would bring nothing new to the table. We've already seen huge interactive ads protests against machines moral dilemmas and conflicted leaders trying to make statements James Cromwell plays almost the same character in both I Robot and Surrogates!. What new things could the director of Terminator 3 show us? It turns out he could bring us what I Robot failed to deliver as effectively a good knockout resolution. In other words this movie delivered a nonHollywood type ending similar in the vein of Watchmen though that is thanks to the great Alan Moore. I always appreciate when a director is willing to go out and boldly create a vision even if it is based on a graphic novel some directors like Carter Smith still change the ending  as he did for The Ruins movie.The film is the tale of a world where everyone's basically a couch potato. Technology is so amazing that we can create multiple robots of ourselves in any form and control them from the safety of our own homes! We're completely safe as long as we're plugged into the network and no one harms us as we operate the surrogate robot or surrey. But as usual conflict arises and the characters are drawn into a world of corruption rebellion and sacrifices. The screenplay is full of twists and turns all very smart and satisfying though somewhat predictable. Doesn't really matter to me though films like these are made for mindless action with parts that make you think. Or so I thought.Mostow a natural action director handles the camera very well in action sequences. It's the usual Hollywood fare with great fastmoving action and impressive special effects though I keep thinking of Transformers 2 when I say that so I probably won't mention CGI again. I also really liked how much he utilizes the element of surprise there were many moments where I jumped back in shock though there wasn't anything necessarily that scary. It's just the juxtapositioning of calm and BANG. It's clear Mostow is good with the action cam nothing new in the era of Michael Bay as he demonstrated in T3 but this time around I was impressed by how he directed the emotional scenes with Bruce Willis and his wife. He handled the feelings well. This in part has to do with Bruce Willis as an actor as well. He did a fine job with this movie solid. There's also some good humor too though I think I laughed too much. And it all led to the final punch.These are all similarsounding critiques for me. I tend to enjoy cinema for what it is for pleasure. However what was different was the ending. I was expecting the typical runofthemill Hollywood ending but it certainly wasn't though there was a bit of a twist. I must admit I gasped a bit when I saw the end. I said Whoa. If a film amidst good stuff brings home something new District 9 for example was a seriously good commentary besides an action film I'm impressed. I appreciate it very much Mostow keeps the audience in mind. Sure there were flaws like its short running time sometimes it takes itself too lightly but overall it was a great viewing experience. I was enjoying it as I watched  as I usually do for movies  but the bold Watchmenlike finish really brought it home for me.Oh and Ving Rhames was pretty damn badass.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't spend too much time or money on this movie if you are bothered by seriously inconsistent or unrealistic science in a sciencefiction movie. Despite great production values and acting the film is marred by a badly imagined technological world.A world technologically capable of producing robotic avatars that convey complete sensory experiences to the users would not as the world in this film does resemble early 21st century in every other meaningful way. The technology necessary to accomplish such remote direct brain interface control and sensing is so advanced on so many levels it would by definition be accompanied by other equally huge changes in technology.In Surrogates the world is basically ceteris paribus but for one enormous mindbogglingly advanced change.

The technology necessary to accomplish such remote direct brain interface control and sensing is so advanced on so many levels it would by definition be accompanied by other equally huge changes in technology.In Surrogates the world is basically ceteris paribus but for one enormous mindbogglingly advanced change.

Enough to keep e viewer interested and entertained while lounging on a couch eating popcorn and drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. What's wrong with that? In addition it poses a couple of interesting questions about our current and especially future relationship with machines the morality of it etc. These questions will become more and more important as each day passes and even though the movie does not even attempt to analyze or answer them it is not unimportant to have posed them.

This new technology which is freely available to everyone has brought the crime rate down to almost zero and united humanity in ways never before imagined leaving a few filthy hardline rednecks to wave the flag against progress.So! What is wrong with this picture? Rather than think about what would REALLY happen with everyone using robots to do everything the writers of this film have created their own reality for the sake of convenience. For exampleWhy would giving everyone a mindcontrolled robot to play with reduce crime? The robots allow anyone to do ANYthing so surely EVERYone would be doing EVERYthing! Life would suddenly be like Grand Theft Auto. Also while everyone's using their robot they're practically asleep in their own homes so home invasions and other related crimes have never been easier.  How does everyone get a robot? You know the poor ain't getting' one but apparently abject poverty is no barrier to joining the robot revolution.  Why can't the FBI fly over the redneck camp? They can hack into people's robot feed and shut them down legally within 20 seconds but fly a helicopter over some hippie's love circle? Forget about it Willis hand over your badge and gun.And now my other problems with this filmthe entire film was shot on a dutch tilt i.e. the camera is askew this device normally indicates something wrong in a scene. I noticed this about thirty minutes in and after an hour I realised the director was probably trying to say something about his world i.e. 'this world ain't right' and would likely have the camera right itself in the closing scenes. Sure enough when Willis makes amends with his wife the camera goes level so all is right with the world once more.This is the most pretentious conceit I have seen in film in a long time. Yes a director must communicate through the language of film but an entire movie on the dutch tilt is someone saying 'Look at me! I'm saying something important!'Why didn't the bad guys send hit men or ninjas or something to James Cromwell's house and just kill him for real? He's in a wheelchair so it ain't like he's going to outrun a ninja. So much simpler than using a super secret weapon and blah blah blah. Plus the ninja could make it look like an accident or natural causes.  Why did James Cromwell commit suicide right before seeing everyone else die? And why a cyanide capsule? He had a perfectly good gun right there!  James Cromwell in robot form just happened to sneak into Radha Mitchell's house and see the EXACT MOMENT of recorded footage that would tell him how kill everyone on the planet? What are the freakin' ODDS of this people?  We've got instantaneous mind control over robots that are miles if not hundreds of miles away and yet we still use USB? Please.Ah screw it this movie was crap and I feel better now. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoy watching fastpaced thrillers and murdermysteries. Unfortunately most films which are released these days do not put the time nor effort into flushingout a story. Often times I resort to seedy little horror films to watch a good whodunit film. Therefore Surrogates was definitely a great surprise to me. I went in expecting some idiotic action film which should have gone straight to video and was very surprised at how engaging this film was! The only reason I didn't give this film a 1010 rating is because Brancato and Ferris most obviously got the idea for their script from the Wachowski Brother's of The matrix fame. The only difference is that instead of entering another reality people enter the body of a robot for which they use to interact with people in the world right from their homes never having to leave the house. These Surrogates act and talk just like their counterparts back home linkedup in their cyberkinetic chairs although as you will find in the first act don't always look like them. The entire benefit of using a surrogate is to never be hurt or killed and also to look the way you want people to see you.Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell play two FBI agents investigating the destruction of two surrogates and their operators who were connected to them at the time which up until then has never been possible. Now I won't ruin anything but lets just say that if you can use a surrogate to be anyone you want to be you might not really always know who you are talking too...or what their ulteriormotives are!!The storytelling twists  turns and fastpaced action really move this film along. Also the special effects are so well put together that when you are watching people on the screen you really believe out of this world things are happening to them...but to me the best part or character of the film is Radha Mitchell. She is required to take on so many different things here and also be believable and she pulled it off very well indeed! I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie and at a midnight screening as well. Surrogates is definitely worth seeing on the big screen so don't miss it!".

The films strives for the mock realism of district nine but ends up falling short of that level of intensity. I have not read the graphic novel upon which the film is based however knowing it's a multi part graphic novel is a bit odd since the film in incredibly short. I believe it clocks in at less than an hour and a half long. Rarely do I feel that the climax is reached TOO quickly in a film but everything seems to fall into place with little explanation as too how the characters know what's going on other than blind luck.The movie sees Tom played by Bruce Willis as a cop whose living through a surrogate. Think iRobot but with less tension between the humans and the robots. Surrogates function in a way that humans can lie down with caps over their eyes and neurologically control attractive boring versions of themselves. Curiously Tom's surrogate is a cop with a blond comb over. Tom however is growing tired of relying on his surrogate. He wants to see his wife more often...his real wife.In one of the film's many plot holes a vagrant meatbag human one who is against the idea of surrogates uses a device to kill surrogates which somehow kills humans at the same time by making their brains exploded. If that sounds convoluted...that's because it is. There's many things in this film left unexplained including that aspect as well as the need for surrogates in the first place. Why bother? These thoughts are quickly erased once Tom is on a chase to find out who is trying to kill surrogates and why.The film has a very fast pace like I said above with from the point of action to the climax very little digression. Within the title crawl you already what surrogates are what their purpose is and the history of the surrogates. I wish they could slow down a bit and discuss more of the mentality behind the process but I suppose that's up to the audience to decide.Surrogates is a film that made me happy to be alive as I walked out and thought about it. It's an entertaining film but I can't help but feel that it falls into the same lines of actiondramasci fi movies as recent ones like The Happening I am Legend and iRobot. It's definitely that kind of movie and if you enjoy that then it won't disappoint.".

The starting premise itself was a stretch  98 of the people in the future use surrogates. There is absolutely nothing in this world that 98 of the people agree on not to mention a surrogate would be an expensive piece of machinery which not everyone could afford. The plot involves Bruce Willis playing a his tired rebelcop persona only looking strangely like Robbie Rotten from Lazy Town when he is in surrogate self and stumbling upon various conspiracies involving VSI corporation producing surrogates the military of course and the inventor of surrogates who apparently in all his genius cannot figure an obvious explanation for his son's death and needs Bruce Willis to point it out to him. The subplot of the movie involves reservations where surrogates are not allowed and shot on sight even if they are law enforcement surrogates. How the government decided to waive their sovereignty to a bunch of regressionist secessionists is not explained. The regressionist reservations are filled with clichd fat hillbillies and are led by Ving Rhames with dreadlocks who delivers his lines with a passion of a low level politician reading off a teleprompter. There are other problems that I can go into such as surrogates being strong enough to withstand collision with a car yet falling apart under the force of Bruce Willis' bare fists as well as the nonnonsensical robot beauty salons but if I describe every hole in the plot I will probably have to post the entire film's screenplay. So I'll just cut to the chase the story is absurd the action is OK at best the dialogue is bland in some parts laughable in others and the ending is meaningless.If you want to see a decent sci fi movie check out Pandorum instead.".

	schema:headline " Phil Would Have Liked It";
	schema:reviewBody "Had I not known better I would have said that the 2009 scifiaction film Surrogates was based on a work by cult author Philip K. Dick. And with its central premise of a futuristic society in which the bulk of humankind lies abed while its mentally controlled robotic surrogates carry on the dangerous and tiring business of everyday life for it the film really is reminiscent of something that Phil might have smiled on with approbation. But no this picture is rather based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele. In it federal agent Tom Greer played by a typically excellent Bruce Willis investigates a rare instance of homicide in this new society and unearths a plot that threatens the lives of billions. The film's entirely plausible central premise who wouldn't want to safely lie in bed all day whilst a mechanical surrogate of any description takes upon itself the rigors of life? has here been used as the backbone for a supremely wellcrafted and intelligent instance of modernday science fiction indeed Surrogates may well be one of the finest scifi films of its decade. It features a compact screenplay a twisty and surpriseladen plot greatlooking yet restrained use of FX and several spectacularyet remarkably lucidaction set pieces. The film has been well acted by all especially Willis in what almost amounts to a dual role human and surrogate and the yummy Rosamund Pike who I have had a thang for ever since seeing her portray Miranda Frost in Bond 20 Die Another Day. And this nearfuture world in which one can roleplay any fantasy via the use of male or female surrogates sets us up for a great line from Willis. Speaking to a beautiful female lawyer he says Honey I don't know what you are. For all I know you could be some big fat dude sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out. A wonderful line in a wonderful picture. Highly recommended.".

And with its central premise of a futuristic society in which the bulk of humankind lies abed while its mentally controlled robotic surrogates carry on the dangerous and tiring business of everyday life for it the film really is reminiscent of something that Phil might have smiled on with approbation. But no this picture is rather based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele. In it federal agent Tom Greer played by a typically excellent Bruce Willis investigates a rare instance of homicide in this new society and unearths a plot that threatens the lives of billions. The film's entirely plausible central premise who wouldn't want to safely lie in bed all day whilst a mechanical surrogate of any description takes upon itself the rigors of life? has here been used as the backbone for a supremely wellcrafted and intelligent instance of modernday science fiction indeed Surrogates may well be one of the finest scifi films of its decade. It features a compact screenplay a twisty and surpriseladen plot greatlooking yet restrained use of FX and several spectacularyet remarkably lucidaction set pieces. The film has been well acted by all especially Willis in what almost amounts to a dual role human and surrogate and the yummy Rosamund Pike who I have had a thang for ever since seeing her portray Miranda Frost in Bond 20 Die Another Day. And this nearfuture world in which one can roleplay any fantasy via the use of male or female surrogates sets us up for a great line from Willis. Speaking to a beautiful female lawyer he says Honey I don't know what you are. For all I know you could be some big fat dude sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out. A wonderful line in a wonderful picture. Highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although it felt immensely parallel to Mark Neveldine's Gamer Surrogates explores the scarier side of avatar life when people opt for living through robots instead of their own bodies. With the charisma and macho swagger that Bruce Willis brings to the screen and the talents of Ving Rhames James Cromwell and Boris Kodjoe what really ended up disappointing me was the unimpressive graphics of the Surrogates themselves. Someone should have asked Milla Jovovich who did her makeup in Resident Evil Extinction because she looked more the part of a porcelain robot than the effect they tried on this movie it was distracting and strange.Plot When a couple of Surrogate robots created to replicate human beings users are killed through their hosts detectives Greer Bruce Willis and Peters Radha Mitchell set out to find the source behind the killings. What they find is that a new weapon has been introduced that kills the host and user behind the avatar. A threat that could potentially disrupt the 99 drop in worldwide fatalities that the surrogates originally brought. Greer has grown to dislike the daily routine of living through a Surrogate and before long ditches his avatar in lieu of walking around the city as a human something that is unheard of. With his own eyes and wits about him Greer is able to uncover the source of the weapon and the people behind it. With his only grip on human life being his Surrogate addicted wife he must find a way to stop the weapon which could mean danger for her and everyone in the world that is plugged in.While I can appreciate the scifi element to Surrogates it offers nothing new in terms of plot storyline and conclusion. It is the fear of a virtual world in the future exaggerated with the visuals of nasty sweaty pock ridden humans stuck to their bedlike structures. A world of pasty people plugged into a machine that gives them the control of a beautiful and flawless version of themselves. You have the stereotypical fat nerd in the guise of a hot blond sexpot the sex heavy Club scenes and the city filled with people who aren't really people. Think Blade Runner Matrix and IRobot and you know the particular shot of what I speak. Yet Greer's city did not feel like a city at all it felt like a large set with fancy CGI painted all over it to make it look futuristic. I couldn't shake the world in a glass bowl feeling as the streets seem to lead to nowhere and the shots of the external camps looked even worse. The warm and fuzzy feelings of the future that I received when I watched older movies like Minority Report IRobot and the 5th Element is missing in this one. There just wasn't enough authenticity in Greer's surroundings and it made it seem so staged.This story seemed to be better suited for a comic book or graphic novel. The big screen does not seem like the right medium for Surrogates because the humanoid CGI look is a long way from being mastered. Still if you can stomach the visuals to follow Greer in his quest for an answer you may find a bland and unoriginal police story that ends up being solved a bit too easily. I would suggest that you wait this one out for an evening rental with the family since the violence is minimal the Surrogates bleed green there are no real sexual situations and the length is relatively short. I cannot recommend the box office version of this movie.More reviews available at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com".

And yes he does tend to exhibit a noticeable sneersmirk throughout most of his most recent roles but give him a chance here. He's not so bad.Surrogates set in the future when we all have robots to carry out our menial chores  all of apart from wisecracking cop played by Will Smith who is hellbent on proving that our robot 'protectors' are not what they seem. Oh wait that's not the plot for Surrogates at all  that's the plot for 'I Robot.' Never mind  just take out the word 'robots' and replace it with er 'surrogates' which are basically robots and you have the storyline.If you haven't seen I Robot Surrogates may be quite original but I couldn't believe how similar the two were. But I still enjoyed it. I put in my review title that it was a competent LITTLE scifi number. That's largely because it's quite short for a film  coming in well below the average hour and a half. And because of this it's over pretty quickly almost like a TV episode of some scifi show.It has action conspiracy reasonably special effects and Bruce Willis isn't that annoying. In fact his  how should I put this  'mature' action hero status actually works here. The human race all have surrogate robots shaped like them who go out into the world under their human master's control. Naturally everyone's surrogate is young and gorgeous while their human owner's body gets older and flabby from the comfort of their home. It's quite amusing when Bruce's beautiful bot gets beaten up and the 'real' human Bruce has to go out onto the streets with his bald head and wrinkles for all to see.All of this means that if you're a fan of the scifi genre you should get something out of this film. It's one of those films that you like more if you haven't had to pay for. If you can borrow it off a mate or find it as part of your online TV package give it a go. It will definitely kill just over an hour of your time but you probably wouldn't have wanted to pay full price in the cinema to see it. Oh and it's also advisable not to watch I Robot before you see this it's definitely superior  sorry Bruce.".

He was apologising to people who despised it he was profusely thanking the people who liked it. He is the modern day equivalent of Victor Frankenstein. He knows that he has created a monster and doesn't really know how to deal with it now that it's being released upon the world.Martyrs truly is a monster. It's a ground breaking brave stunning brutal  moving piece of work that is guaranteed to divide audiences everywhere it gets the chance to play. Even at a genre event like Frightfest the audience reaction ranged from 'loved it' to 'hated it' to people actually going outside of the cinema to be physically sick really. For me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but I don't believe it's a movie that anybody will truly 'enjoy'.As others have already given away too much of the story i won't bother with a synopsis as Martyr's is definitely a dish best served cold. Not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with it's gutsy originality. Written by the director during a fit of depression that he did not elaborate on in the QA it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful. It's beautifully shot really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads.This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered 'tortureporn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Martyrs bears more resemblance to movies like Nacho Cerda's Aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating. The true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists. In the end despite all the on screen violence and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness.

	schema:headline " More like No and Grandrieux";
	schema:reviewBody "French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension then A l'Intrieur and newest in line is Martyrs hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun bloody gory insane horror flick can just up and leave because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'Intrieur and Haute Tension the tone and effect of the film is much closer to Irrversible or better yet Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top of that list even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak raw and pitch black horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though there's no joy limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold the characters are emotionally wrangled the tension is harsh. Lucie the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror keeping its crude and dark exterior but never crossing any boundaries. A Grudgelike ghost in added to the film but Laugier stays close to the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick. Things take a turn for the worse around halfway through where the torture theme of the film is given even more power as Anna Lucie's guardian discovers the truth about the torturekidnap story of the past.From that moment on the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and crosses over to the realm of No and Grandrieux. We are witness of cold and painful torture scenes driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing the end. The film follows the methods of the people who torture which are based on repetition and endurance making it all the harder to sit through.In a rather surprising move this film was released in theaters in Belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here the reason for that is laid bare in the second half of the film. Rather that simply serve a story of horror and torture Laugier digs deeper into the human mind. The idea behind Martyrs is not futile nor easily forgotten. There's a whole point to the film elevating is above all its reference points Saw and Hostel  sadly enough.Martyrs is in a whole different league and is everything a film like Funny Games should have been. A definite assault to the gut extremely graphic and to the point without ever flinching or resolving to silly tricks to get a point across. It's a film only a director with love for the genre could make remember that Mr Haneke after two pointless attempts and Laugier doesn't let down.Visually the film is well shot though nothing out of the ordinary. The makeup on the other hand deserves some praise same as the leading ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth at one point Anna even shows a creepy resemblance to Falconetti in Jeanne d'Arc . Essential to the film and certainly not an easy task.Don't watch Martyrs to get a little horror kick or to indulge in silly gorefests. This film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror movies on the contrary. It's a bleak depressive but all the more impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition it will leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away. And it does so without ever numbing you down.One of the most impressive films I've seen this year a definite favorite and one that'll receive my further support through a DVD purchase though I have no idea when or if I'll watch it again. Laugier uses every bit of skill he has to make Martyrs as painful as possible and reaches further than any other has. A very solid 4.55.0 though no recommendation from my side. Definitely not a film for everyone.".

	onyx:emotionText "French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension then A l'Intrieur and newest in line is Martyrs hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun bloody gory insane horror flick can just up and leave because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'Intrieur and Haute Tension the tone and effect of the film is much closer to Irrversible or better yet Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top of that list even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak raw and pitch black horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though there's no joy limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold the characters are emotionally wrangled the tension is harsh. Lucie the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror keeping its crude and dark exterior but never crossing any boundaries.

Of all the films I saw at this year's Frightfest Martyrs was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most. The film has been compared to both Hostel and Hellraiser but I think it has a lot more substance than both of those films. The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing completely holding your attention. So why only 7 out of 10? As well made as this film is the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a mustsee movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.".

Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an Xcertificate in France kicking up an almighty stink in the process  well you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery unsurprisingly the director namechecked Dario Argento during the QA as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two filmmakers.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks. After last years direct hit to the head A l'interior and the to me rather weak Frontieres this year its Martyrs which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top lately.Forsure Martyrs is different and delivers some memorable scenes punched in your memory so it sure is another sign of EuroHorror taking the top. The movie starts of with a child fleeing its prison and running frightened from years of abuse into freedom. Lucie is picked up her prison is found but she doesn't talk about what happened and her torturers are never found. This is where the first part of the movie starts which is kind of divided into subplots. Lucie is shown growing up in a foster home making friends with Anna another foster child. Lucie doesn't talk to anyone about what happened she is haunted by fears sees demons and only seems to connect to Anna. The second part is a harsh time jump to 15 Years later. A seemingly happy family is having a Saturday breakfast the door rings and Lucie takes them out with a shotgun. She has identified her torturers from a newspaper photo and came for revenge and closure When cleaning up the mess with Anna Lucie sees a demon like girl following her through the house and cutting her with a knife. After some creepy ghost scares it turns out its just her imagination of girl she left behind when fleeing as a child. Anna doesn't seem to believe all the story Lucie told her because we soon see the cuttings are self inflicted and only Lucie sees the girl as a manifestation of her schizophrenia which ends in her finally slicing her own throat. Part Three begins where Anna is left alone in the house with her dead friend not sure what happened and how to handle the situation. By a pretty stupid turn of events she finds a secret door to an underground dungeon and it soon becomes evident that Lucies depictions of her torture were true. Anna searches through the dungeons and soon finds the girl Lucie left behind shackled and blindfolded. She tries to help her and remove the blindfold which is bolted to her head but the girl like Lucie soon tries to kill herself. Part Four and the finale begins so there is some majors spoilers ahead... The girl runs wild through the house and is suddenly shot by a group of strangers who reveal the story Asick religious group believes that a suffering person can see beyond death in their final stage of martyrdom and reveal the secrets to life and death. Now Anna relives what Lucie suffered and is brought to the dungeon. From here on a seemingly endless part shows her being fed being beaten having her hair shaved and all this in an endless repetition until she breaks apart. This is not gory rather unpleasant in its repetitive inhumanity. To make a long story short... Anna falls apart talking to her dead friend Julie who tells her to give herself up to stop the suffering and when she does the final stage awaits in which Anna is skinned until she finally enters Martyrdom depicted as a trip hallucinogenic light at the end of the tunnel sequence. She whispers her experience into the old lady's ear and the sick cult soon gathers to witness its Martyr and the old ladies testimony. Unfortunately we never hear it but can rather imagine when the old lady puts a gun in her mouth. The End.I am very ambivalent with this movie... It is a nice mixture of a drama especially the childhood part and Lucies suicide with classic horrorghost scare and shock elements and big load of torture porn thrown in at the end blended in with some religious and metaphysical hints. Anna becomes a kind of Jesus Christ and the image of a skinned girl looking to heaven sure is a logical step in depicting a person in total suffering equal to the crucifixion and to my understanding equally sick just visually more direct. The four parts are all told in a very different style ... its like drama ghosthorror a little dungeon exploring and darkness some superficial explaining torture and some more drama. Martyrs sure is an interesting movie but it has some pretty stretched passage. If people leave the cinema its because they can't take another five minutes of seeing a girl beaten either because its unsettling or just plain idiotic and voyeuristic. I sure get the meaning in showing Anna fall apart but I think this and the skinning which is not even shown is what people are shocked about. The interweaving of the movie parts was kind of forced which put me off. Why the hell do they stay in the house how could the children of the family not know about a high tech torture dungeon under their living room or did they? why does Anna find the dungeon and go in there on her own and if the cult is so eager to find the answer why is there just one girl although the dungeon looks like an industrial complex and what about that cult anyway?!Its hard to compare the movie to anything else. Most comparisons are about the movies being all french seeking for new boundaries and the main characters being girls. But they are all different and where A l'interior mixes Thriller and SplatterElements Martyrs rather mixes Horror and DramaElements... maybe the tear squeezing mixing with horror scares is what shocks people. Strange thing is... to me the scenes of Lucie fleeing as a child was one of the most shocking and I even knew them from the trailer.".

	onyx:emotionText "It seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks. After last years direct hit to the head A l'interior and the to me rather weak Frontieres this year its Martyrs which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top lately.Forsure Martyrs is different and delivers some memorable scenes punched in your memory so it sure is another sign of EuroHorror taking the top. The movie starts of with a child fleeing its prison and running frightened from years of abuse into freedom. Lucie is picked up her prison is found but she doesn't talk about what happened and her torturers are never found. This is where the first part of the movie starts which is kind of divided into subplots. Lucie is shown growing up in a foster home making friends with Anna another foster child. Lucie doesn't talk to anyone about what happened she is haunted by fears sees demons and only seems to connect to Anna. The second part is a harsh time jump to 15 Years later.

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from the midnight screening at TIFF with a typical Midnight Madness audience that I would characterize as easy to please but difficult to impress. This film impressed us as it was clearly a cut above so to speak the average genre film. The first act takes recent French horror films like High Tension Inside and Frontieres and shoves them into a hyperviolent blender. So far so good. The second far more emotionally grisly act elevates the cinematic experience to almost artfilm heights with sadly realistic parallels to our current insane world situation. Oh there was a vomiting patron here too.The director was there along with the two lead actresses who are looking much better now I'm glad to say. He told us that the film has secured distribution in 40 Frenchspeaking countries but that he hopes it will be viewed elsewhere on DVD only to ensure that we see it uncut. Someone asked a question that referenced Michael Haneke's Funny Games I didn't quite hear the whole question as the person was well back in the theater but it really set M. Laugier off  he denounced FG as shit and proclaimed his film the antiFunny Games. He was fine with the hour and a half brutalization of an innocent family but felt strongly that it didn't have a sufficient point to make or justification for the violence  it just ends. I'm not sure I feel that way about FG but it was interesting to hear his opinion. It's hard to discuss how Martyrs backs up it's pretension to be superior without spoiling it however. To echo another comment you'll have to see for yourself. Enjoy not!".

	schema:headline " Disturbing Toture With No Point";
	schema:reviewBody "As some have said you either love this film or you hate it. The film's extremely disturbing torture and violence serves no purpose other than to make the viewer cringe for its victims. While this may be the goal of a typical horror film this film takes large strides to make the torture something realistic something that could really happen and therefore all the more harrowing. Once the audience understands this it expects something more than just typical slasher fare  it expects something deeper and thought provoking. It expects the film to use the torture to make a point. Unfortunately it never does.The first half of the film culminates in an unoriginal reveal that the viewer expects long before it is made. The first half sets up the second half which while making use of a truly terrifying basement torture chamber goes through torture scene after scene in effort to make the viewer feel the pain of its victim. Having seen that real life torture chambers like this exist the notion is truly frightening. However the point of these scenes is made after three of them and the remainder become unenduringly repetitive pushing the film into overkill  to the point the viewer is so disturbed she no longer wants to watch. I fast forwarded through the second 12 of these scenes and hung on through the remainder of the film only because I knew the end was near and I was expecting something huge to make sense of everything. While the film succeeds in repulsing the viewer with the depravity of humanity and the horror the victims endure the film fails to use this to any admirable advantage. One expects more from a film that goes to pains to make the suffering so realistic. And that is the problem the film is not a popcorn slasher film one which the viewer goes to for a lighthearted scare but which is ultimately an unrealistic horror film rather the film conjures up feelings of discomfort and unease because what is happening could really happen. I disagree that the film makers were doing this just to put depravity on the screen. I think they had a real goal of conveying some deep concept or revealing something thoughtprovoking behind the debauchery.Unfortunately we learn all the depravity and suffering were the result of an unclear scientific desire of the wealthy to learn what happens after death. The audience is probably supposed to feel some sort of horror or discomfort at this. But the ending is not clearly developed and fails to plant enough seeds for thought after the film is over. Thus all that came before the ending makes no sense. And to put the torture on screen without making a good point causes the viewer to question its purpose.".

	schema:reviewBody "You just can't look away from this monstrosity of a film. I won't go into full plot details because so many comments here already contain the full plot. I can give a quick condensed version. Here there be SPOILERS.Lucie escapes from a cult that was torturing her as a child. She has to leave behind another girl and becomes haunted by the vision of that girl. Fifteen years later Lucie sees a newspaper photo of the couple who tortured her. She goes to their house and kills the entire family. She calls her best friend Anna to come and help her. Anna gets there and has doubts as to whether this was the right family. Lucie kills herself.After Lucie dies Anna discovers a hidden section of the house. And she discovers the girl Lucie left behind all those years ago. And the girl is still alive but so badly tortured she is beyond real help.Cult members arrive and kill the tortured girl. They take Anna and then subject her to the same tortures that Lucie and the other girl suffered from. Mostly it's scenes of this man beating her very badly. And she's chained up a lot. It gets really nasty. There is no fun watching this. It's very much like torture scenes from Hostel.Finally they skin Anna alive and she has what they think is a divine vision which is what they were after. She tells the head of the cult the vision. We never hear what Anna says. The head of the cult commits suicide. End of movie.It sucked. First of all this is not a real horror film. It's a whole other genre. It is torture porn no matter what fanboyz keep claiming. There's a big difference between a horror film that has scary monsters and such that we have fun with and something like this which just goes to extremes and shows violence just to really show a lot of violence.I really don't like this new trend in films. And the French seem to be running with it now. If you like regular horror movies I don't think you will like this movie. If you are into Hostel type films you'll like it.To me this film just promoted violence and torture of women and it was clearly stated in the film that only women did well as being victims. I didn't like this movie at all.".

So what we get an hour of crap with this psychotic lesbian named Lucie tormenting her caring nurturing friend who is quite visibly torn between her loyalty and the fact that I don't know Lucie just murdered a whole house of people !!!!...how stupid do you have to be to even think about this seriously DITCH HER NOW AND RUN FOR YOUR LIFE then another half hour of the poor innocent best friend girl locked in a basement being beaten forcefed and finally fcking skinned alive before an uninspired and uncreative ending that left me feeling empty and impartial to any of the characters or meanings that were attempted to be conveyed here. I guess the best part of the movie is the first part because it is genuinely pretty suspenseful and tense but it drags on for waaaay too long and loses whatever suspense it was building up to replacing it instead withwell annoyance at the Lucie character really.The rest is just dung. Can anyone explain how that family went so long without the kids finding out about the huge underground torture chamber their parents had in the basement? Surely there must have been at least one day where one of them was home sick from school and must have gotten the gist that something was awry. That's a plot hole that needs tending to immediately.The religious and Nazi implications here as vague and offkilter as they may be are disturbing and highly objectionable and bring down any enjoyment one could ever derive from this mediocre piece of crap. Not only do they shave the girl's head in the third act during her torture they also bury the bodies of the dead unceremoniously in a giant hole...gee does that sound familiar at all to you?...It's really one thing to watch a movie about a teenage girl holding a rapist and pedophile hostage and threatening to castrate him and it's one thing to watch a movie where a psychotic rejected lesbian wreaks havoc on her unsuspecting lover's family with a chainsaw but a movie like thisit goes too far to the point where it doesn't matter. It's like this movie had to have a neon light over its head flashing LOOK AT ME I'M SICK AND TWISTED. You know as if the director didn't have any ideas of his own so he had to resort to the most stock and clichd offensive things in the book. The other stuff is there for a reason for some purpose that is general and unbiased but this doesn't work. It inspires nothing in the viewer but the question of whether or not he or she should really be watching the movie thus depriving and desensitizing said viewer of the ultimate horror at the ending  not a very good ploy.And let's talk about meanings here too why not? This movie is supposedly deep and meaningful but really it's just retarded. The ending sucks completely contrived and hollow. Ooh let's be all philosophical and spiritual that justifies the hour and a half of ridiculous torture pornography terrible directing and The Unbornrejected ghost scenes we stuck in there before! I also really love how they call this movie Martyrs because a martyr was always a poor screaming skinny French girl who was forced to be where she was rather than choosing it right?God this sucks just forget this trash ever existed. It isn't scary it isn't meaningful and it isn't compelling even one bit. No disgust no horror just a quiet disapproving shake of the head and a move of the hand towards the remote to turn it off. It doesn't inspire horror or disgust it just inspires anger and annoyance and if that's what this director wanted to do offend then he succeeded I hate this movie I hate the director I hate the studio that produced it I hate anyone who would find pleasure in watching it. It is the lowest form of cinematic dung possible. There is nothing worse there has never been anything worse. Unspeakably wholly unwatchable.".

	schema:headline " Bleak movie which left me unsatisfied";
	schema:reviewBody "As many reviews have pointed out before me this is a polarising movie. You either absorb its messages as high art and embrace its philosophies with a willing mind or if you're like me it will leave you hollow from a lack of resolution at which point all that's left is an exercise in gratuitousness.I'd like to preface my damning opinion with a comment on what this film did well. It's vastly superior in production quality and acting than most horror films you could watch thinking of the vast stock of directtoDVD cashins it never felt tacky or poorly delivered. The twist at the 50 mark was unexpected and felt original.As for what I didn't like? Well pretty much everything else. I felt like this movie was a plodding nihilistic beast something you had to endure rather than enjoy. The story was set up well at the beginning but fizzled out as soon as any rationale was attempted to explain the torture. I'm a fan of horrible bleak things but if you're going to put a 30 minute torture scene in a movie you better have a damn good way to put it into some sort of context. I got that sinking feeling while I was watching it there was no way this was leading to anything good. And I was vindicated when I given some second rate bataillesque philosophy to try and explain away maddening cruelty and try and elevate above all those other movies that delight in gory excess.Thinking about it this movie made no sense there was no satisfying motive for the acts committed. This is really the cusp of the problem I had with the movie why? Why would the characters torture people for 20 years based on such a flimsy motive? And when the head honcho finally found what she was looking for she kills herself?!? Why waste the 20 years? You believed in it enough to commit horrendous atrocities for 2 decades but you needed confirmation from a delirious dying women to act on your belief? This is really what I can't wrap my head around the film gives us an incredibly silly reason to explain why this all happened so the result feels absolutely hollow. The explanation the film delivers was completely meaningless to me a philosophy so vague and devoid of logic that you would never care enough to think of it yourself. Like an idea someone invents while off their breasts on drugs because they've grossly misinterpreted the real world. Again what this movie desperately needed was something clever to rationalise its depravity yet all it delivers is a 5 minute afterthought composed of senseless mysticism.Ugh running out of space here I'll try to be more succinct. Other problems I hadit isn't a horror movie horror movies are about atmosphere mystery and tension. All the tension dissipates when the movie devolves into a relentless torture fest. it's misogynistic who honestly wants to watch a fat bald man beat a Young women for ages with no context apart from some vague martyr nonsense? I'm misogynistic but this was too much. make up and gore effects are pretty bad apart from the flayed effect at the end. Cellar woman really didn't look convincing enough compared to the stomach churning effects in the saw movies.In summation this isn't just a torture porn movie. It is the ultimate torture porn movie. I believe someone commented that is isn't like SAW because the characters perpetrating these acts were emotionally detached which ironically I think is a problem with the story if you're going to torture someone have the decency to enjoy it. However the emotional state of the characters is irrelevant all that matters is the stimulus that provides the titillation and the interpretation of the viewer. And of course the stimulus is torture and gore and this film has it in sickening nihilistic abundance. SAW and HOSTEL take a back seat the gorno king has arrived in all his pointless pretentious gory glory.".

To watch it from the disturbing beginning to the relieving ending was painful and i think the writerdirector needs some serious counseling! BUT It's also a stunning piece of art. The fundamental questions are What does the writerdirector want to express with this movie? What are his intentions? And Does anyone need a movie that shows us every detail of ruthless slaughter torture skinning beating and killing?The Answer is I AM STILL NOT SURE!!! But this is perhaps the reason why this movie is a piece of art not often watched in todays cinema. This movie is thoughtprovoking. It doesn't send you home with a few nice laughs a seethrough story and it isn't entertainment.This movie only cares for the victims. This is why i think that the violence depicted is necessary. It doesn't make you numb. It even sharpens your sensitivity and you suffer with the victims while watching it.Here in Germany last week a man was beaten to death in the subway by two teenagers. He came to help some kids that were molested by the two teenagers. I think a movie like MARTYRS could show those sickos what they do to their victims. This is why I think that e.g. KILL BILL could be more dangerous than MARTYRS. Tarantino's movies which i also adore always follow the bad guys and show them as heroes while the victims die offscreen. They show that violence is cool and funny. MARTYRS shows that violence is disgusting and sick!".

	schema:reviewBody "To avoid fainting keep repeating  it's only a movie...But this time it is for real.I will start off by saying that Martyrs is probably the most shocking horror film in a very long time the concept of a revengeflick upgraded to extremes.The French have been known for making extremely violent flicks over the past few years and this time it was Pascal Laugier's turn to provide us with a movie that is meant to be more shocking than entertaining the reason why horror movies were made back in the seventies. And indeed Martyrs is an unapologetic throwback to the seventieshorror flicks the likes of The Last House On The Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre come to mind  but Laugier uses the methods he can use and makes it even more shocking than these films are.Apart from being the most shocking and disturbing horror movie in this long time  were the aforementioned titles or Cannibal Holocaust were just very disturbingthis film is also very scary and creepy  i can stomach a lot but at some parts in this movie I really was creeped out and scared to death. This is an extremely scary movie. The script is absolutely fantastic  it manages to combine 34 different happenings into one movie and contains several nods to other recent horrorworks or to the classics without falling into plagiarism. Then we also have the direction of Pascal Laugier It isn't anything we haven't seen before but he certainly is a man who knows how to build up and it shows during a lot of the scenes where he manages to keep the audience very tense and frightened. He is a man who takes a very poetic approach to the visuals and really some of the visuals are very beautiful. Just like Xavier Gens did with Frontires Laugier manages to give his film a very polished look while still keeping it dirty. The whole movie has some sort of atmosphere of dread just like Hooper's TCM had. Yes you have read it Martyrs is a very atmospheric movie. The acting is very credible especially from the two main actresses. I was sold. And then there's the gore  Laugier didn't want to make a bloodfest.Well it turned out to be some sort of a gorepic but obvious it wasn't the director's main target. The gore is NOT the kind of gore the audience likes to see. This isn't a film where you really are waiting for the next victim to be bloodily dispatched the violence in this film is much worse than anything that is shown in movies like HostelWrong Turn 2... It isn't as gory there are no geysers of blood and maybe this isn't real gore. Gore is supposed to be fun this is much worse  it is realistic violence graphic as all hell and incredibly difficult to stomach. Keep in mind that this isn't a happygoslashing slasherfilm but I will say there are some really disgusting scenes which are hard to stomach even for the real gorehounds like myself due to the way the violence is portrayed. Compliments for Laugier to create a film that really does shock us with its explicit violence just like Noe's Irreversible did.The soundtrack also is worth mentioning it is experimental but it really works. It is at times a very melancholic type of soundtrack but very memorable. I won't spoil anything for you but I will tell you something about the end of the movie. Making it through the last 20 minutes of Martyrs is a tough task. This part of the movie is extremely sad but ends up being very poetic and very beautiful. The very end of the movie is almost cynical without becoming comedic. The movies stays true to its dark roots and will leave you saddened. That being said people looking for an entertaining slasherfilm will be very disappointed but people looking for a film that will be remembered for a very long time and that will be talked about like they still talk about some of the shocking classics should give this movie a try. Like somebody already mentioned this movie veers closer to Irreversible than to lets say Inside or Haute Tension to which it has been compared. And I wonder what the MPAA would make of this. Again NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART !!!".

Special makeup effects artist Benot Lestang who passed away several weeks ago as noted by director Pascal Laugier during the QA session after the screening did a remarkable job to showing the brutal effects of violent physical injuries. The audience reaction is typical MM stuff audible gasps rolls of nervous laughter loud and appreciative applause to truly gruesome scenes and other good stuff.The last thirty minutes of the film held the audience in almost complete silence. The lack of any crowd reaction aside from the revelation of what happened to Anna in her final stage was due to the harrowing endurance test they and Anna played by Morjana Alaoui went through. The film turned from a highly engaging gore flick into a sad and rather depressing reflection of human suffering.I had a strong reaction to the film that lead me to appreciate it on its dramatic and production levels. The filmmakers and actresses obviously had a lot of trust among themselves to deliver this film. after the screening Pascal Laugier Morjana Alaoui and Mylne Jamano went up onstage to answer questions from MM programme director Colin Geddes and several members of the audience. Pascal fielded most of the questions while Morjana and Mylne nervously chimed in with their responses mainly because neither of them speak English natively nor are they accustomed being infront of such a massive crowd of people. The QA session did get a bit awkward because some killjoy decided to challenge Pascal on why he made Martyrs. As to the context in which Martyrs was first conceived Pascal mentioned he is going through deeply personal issues which unsurprisingly translated themselves quite graphically into Martyrs.I'm pretty sure Martyrs is too intense for the general public so don't expect a wide theatrical release of the film. I could go on much further but that would necessitate revealing plot points and specific scenes.".

No film since The Exorcist and Jaws has had such intelligence style great script relatable characters and shock value that had all that and worked. We've had a few that come close but nothing as to what I just witnessed with Martyrs. I heard a little bit about this film in 2010 and read about it in an article. The plot seemed kind of confusing from the way the author wrote about it so I decided to wait on seeing it. I have never been so disappointed with myself when it came to deciding to wait on a film. I saw this film 4 days ago and still I'm shaking and can't get it out of my head. Not to say that everyone will have this experience but Martyrs is a masterpiece of horror cinema that I've been waiting for.A young girl Lucie escapes from a factory where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for a lengthy period of time. Lucie is placed in an orphanage where she is befriended by a young girl named Anna. Anna soon discovers that Lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature a horrible disfigured emaciated woman. Fifteen years later Lucie bursts into a seemingly normal family's home and kills them all with a shotgun. Lucie calls Anna to tell her that she has finally found and killed the people responsible for her childhood abuse. Upon arriving Anna is horrified at the carnage and worries that Lucie may have murdered the wrong people. But after a vicious attack on Lucie from her ghost who turns out was a victim who she left before she escaped the factory when she was a child Anna finds out that maybe Lucie wasn't wrong and things take a turn from worse to the ultimate Hell.When the films Saw and Hostel were released they were dubbed as too hard to handle and given the new genre of torture porn I hate that term by way. Those films are a walk in the park compared to a lot of movies that I've seen to be honest. A lot of people are categorizing Martyrs in the torture porn genre and it's ticking me off. Saw and Hostel use the gore and violence as the plot devices Martyrs doesn't use the violence as a way to just make the audience squirm but instead you're taken into this dark world that you don't want to ever be apart of. The performances are just magnificent especially to Mylne Jampano who plays Lucie. Morjana Alaoui plays Anna and pulls in a heart wrenching performance. The direction the lighting the sets the script I couldn't find any flaws that are not nitpicking.I literally feel like I've been strangled with this film it actually made me cry. It was so much deeper than what I was expecting. I'm about to give away the ending so please don't read on because no one should know what is going to happen if they haven't seen this film yet. First off when Anna is tortured it's unbearable to watch her go through this for days she's force fed some weird unknown food that looks like gruel. Then some giant man comes in and just beats her nearly to death. When she's reached the final stage which is surprising to the people who are doing this to her they skin her alive. She lets go and comes back and you find out that the people who did this to her and the others do this because they want to know what happens after death. So Anna dies but comes back and tells the leader Mademoiselle what she saw but in a whisper so the audience can't hear. The society comes to the house excited to hear what is beyond death and when asked by a member outside Mademoiselle's locked door she simply replies keep doubting and shoots herself. Couldn't have been a more perfect ending because what happens after death should remain a mystery as everyone has their own interpretation. Martyrs is much deeper than I expected I underestimated this film and now it's one of the best horror movies I have ever seen in my life. As to the remake that is now supposedly in the green light now please see this movie first because I give a lot of remakes a chance but this one already is looking really bad since it was bought by the producers of Twilight. Martyrs should be respected and is a true masterpiece.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say  I am a grown up experienced person who is able to enjoy a good horror and can appreciate violence if it serves a purpose for the sake of the film. However this film is not horror. It represents a classic example of the type of film that is beginning to be labelled torture porn. So called because it is difficult for any reasonable human being to understand how anyone could gain enjoymment from it unless they are of the Jeffrey Dahmer ilk who actually get off on such subjects  films whose sole purpose is to gorge on graphic and deranged pain and suffering.There is a thin plot to the film which pretends to have some sort of deeper meaning. However don't be fooled by this or try to use it as an excuse to say I enjoyed it for its depth and the way it brings spiritual meaning to the ..... No. It's filth. Simple as. The type of filth that exists for the sole purpose of being filthy.What upsets me the most is that horrors of old used to have victims of both sexes who may have died in gruesome ways but the deaths were normally short and left a fair degree to the imagination or alternatively the special effects were so over the top that it actually sanitised the film by removing all reality such that you could enjoy the horror aspect but were not left feeling like you'd watched some sort of snuff movie. However Martyrs is of the style of recent voyeuristic dirt which involves slow tortuous realistic bloody scenes  all of women all with no reprieve all involving long slow close ups and whimpering and wailing that goes on for ever ... and ever. The scenes that Martyrs decides to specialise in here are either involving knives being pulled deeply through flesh or  even worse involve long agonising beating of a girl. One section of the film showed nothing but the methodical physical demolition of a girl. It went on for about fifteen minutes. During this time there was no dialogue. No changes to scenery. Just a large emotionless man who throws endless punches into the facestomach of a young girl. Even picking her up when she is unconscious only to throw ravaging punches into her as she flops down to the ground. Occasional bit of slow mo. Occasional long gaze at her face in between each set of beatings in order to show that this is in fact quarter of an hour of montage and to make sure we see the effect it has on her will and sanity as it all unfolds ... then back for some more savage beatings. This is a young girl. In fact all of the victims are young girls. They have done nothing to deserve their torture. They are just young innocent girls.What the fk is good about this? I mean for God's sake people!!! There is no humour no horror no intrigue no mystery no nothing of any kind other than the sort of sick filth that makes me worry about anyone who can watch this and say that they enjoyed it. One can only imagine that the title and the excuse for a reason for this torture were thought up later on in the development process since the reasonning makes no sense and at the one point where you think perhaps there may be something imaginative about to happen the hope is destroyed by a simple You'll never know style ending.Not that this matters but my reason for watching it was due to the film arriving as part of a film club package and I did no research before sticking it into the DVD player. I fastforwarded through most of the torture scenes but was still left with a nasty feeling even a long time after having watched it.If films like this can make it past film boards and not get banned or at least severely edited then what the hell are those associations there for in the first place? If you have read this and still think that it sounds like a good film then I pity you and I pity society for having people like you who call this sort of voyeurism entertainment".

	schema:headline " dark existential melodrama wrapped up in a Bwestern a stunning debut from one of the great mavericks";
	schema:reviewBody "It's one of the oldest Western stories Jesse James was a bigtime outlaw robbing banks left and right alongside his gang including Robert Ford. One day upon hearing of the huge bounty and possibility of amnesty for anyone in the gang for Jesse's murder Ford took it upon himself to kill him so that he could be free and clear to mary his wouldbe wife. But things didn't quite turn out right afterwords and Ford was considered moreso a coward a traitor for doing this act and any gunslinger who could gun Ford down would then be seen as the baddest dude in the west. At least that's the legend anyway that comes out of the main plot. But there's more to it at least under the surface that Samuel Fuller gets to in his take on the legend of one man's existential downfall from killing his best friend who happened to be the most feared and yet most admired bank robber in America for a short while. Fuller might be asking why he was admired when he didn't do anything that really merited praise only in hindsight. There's a sense of pure melodrama brimming with acting that is typical for the budget but somehow Fuller brings out the best in what might be a little limited in the character actors.John Ireland says a lot in the understated expressions on his face the tense feeling of rejection from the only one he can get close to once Jesse is out of the picture and likewise Cynthy Barbara Britton is very good at doing the 'actingconcerned' woman that is reluctant to be on Ford's sleeve. It's all the more compelling because Fuller could easily make the direction more into a black and white category that Ford is bad like Jesse was and Cynthy is more than in her reasoning for not wanting to marry him. But even in the pulpy world of Jesse James and Robert Ford there is room for compromise. I liked seeing the scenes where Ford goes through the humiliating act of doing a theater reenactment of the killing scene but suddenly seeing in a vision the actual act he performed superimposed over the pantomime. And immediately after as one of the very best scenes in the film a traveling singer who sings a song terrified in Ford's face about how much of a traitor he was for killing such a man like Jesse James.It's a sharp script considering what Fuller would have to work with but it's also the simplicity of his craft it might be one of those genre films where the style is so stripped down to bare essentials with necessary closeups consistent medium shots that when something 'stylistic' happens like in the last shootout between Kelly and Ford that it is shocking how Fuller pushes it into looking like a tale that on the surface as a conventional feature. But watch how the suddenness of violence sparks up interest in the craft how the opening bank robbery is timed and shot with the same level or even more tension than your average heist thriller. Or in the actual infamous scene itself which is preceded by Ford getting a chance beforehand when James was in the bath and the cutaways to the POV at the back. It's boldfaced type through a crisp fullframe lens.And while Fuller would still go on to make greater films I Shot Jesse James is a fantastic prototype for a great career where history merges with the human process of change and how love however a typical thing in a triangle situation complicates even the strongest of men.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's one of the oldest Western stories Jesse James was a bigtime outlaw robbing banks left and right alongside his gang including Robert Ford. One day upon hearing of the huge bounty and possibility of amnesty for anyone in the gang for Jesse's murder Ford took it upon himself to kill him so that he could be free and clear to mary his wouldbe wife. But things didn't quite turn out right afterwords and Ford was considered moreso a coward a traitor for doing this act and any gunslinger who could gun Ford down would then be seen as the baddest dude in the west. At least that's the legend anyway that comes out of the main plot. But there's more to it at least under the surface that Samuel Fuller gets to in his take on the legend of one man's existential downfall from killing his best friend who happened to be the most feared and yet most admired bank robber in America for a short while.

	schema:reviewBody "INCLUDES POSSIBLE SPOILERS The film debut of writerdirector Samuel Fuller I Shot Jesse James' is a tightly wound character study of Robert Ford played here by John Ireland the man who shot and killed Jesse James.  Ford a member of the infamous James Gang is Jesse's best friend he's reached a time in his life when he just wants to settle down get married and have a place of his own.  But more than anything he yearns for the one thing he'll never have as a wanted man  freedom.  He wants to be able to walk down the street like anybody else and just live his life.  He's in love with an actress Cynthia Waters Barbara Britton who will marry him if he can square himself with the law. She goes to a prosecutor on his behalf but the best deal they can offer if he turns himself in amounts to twenty years in prison.  About this same time there is a public offer from the Governor of complete amnesty to anyone including James Gang members who will bring in Jesse dead or alive. Moved to action by his love for Cynthia and knowing that no man could take Jesse face to face Ford shoots him in the back in Jesse's own home.  Ford gets the freedom he so desperately covets but the price he pays is far more than he ever bargained for. Filmed in stark black  white and with Fuller's deft use of shadows and night shots it combines with the content of the story to create a sense of atmosphere that gives it a Western Noir' feeling with a stoic inclination of predestination.  By pulling the trigger Ford condemns himself to the fate of Judas and ironically finds more ostracism within the parameters of his newly won freedom than he did as an outlaw.  Ireland does an outstanding job as Ford maintaining a subtle restraint throughout while going deep to get to the core of this man who is buoyed only by the love he bares for Cynthia through which he manages to keep the remorse of killing his best friend at arm's length.  He also brings a certain cocky menace to the character which gradually becomes more unassuming yet somehow more threatening as the story progresses and he reacts to the backlash he encounters in the wake of Jesse's murder an act viewed as deplorable by the many who considered James a hero.  One of the most memorable scenes in the movie takes place sometime after Jesse's death Ford is in a saloon when a wandering troubadour Robin Short comes in and offers a song for the price of a drink.  Ford buys and the man who doesn't know Ford begins a ballad that A lot of people seem to like.'  It's about Jesse James and Robert Ford that dirty little coward' who shot him in the back.  Watching Ford's reaction and in turn the reaction of the troubadour creates a  tension that is palpable.  Another outstanding and telling scene is the one in which Ford attempts to recreate the killing on stage and realizes too late that it forces him to face up to what he's done for the first time it's the moment of truth wherein the burden of guilt is made manifest at last.The supporting cast includes Preston Foster John Kelley Reed Hadley Jesse James Tom Tyler Frank James Barbara Woodell Zee James and Tommy Noonan Charles Ford.  An auspicious beginning for Fuller I Shot Jesse James' is a minor classic that heralds the more realitybased Westerns like The Wild Bunch' that would come some twenty years or so later on. Fuller delivers it in a manner that is thought provoking and has style definitely not your runofthemill Western it is deserving of acclaim that has thus far been elusive.  Hopefully one day the merits of this film will be recognized.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few DVD releases this year so far have been more exciting to me than this issue of Criterion's Eclipse series consisting of Sam Fuller's first 3 films. Fuller is no question one of the great American originals completely inimitable and perhaps indescribable at times. This his first feature opens on a stark tableau bank robbers and bank employees tensely standing each other off the robbers hesitating to shoot while the tellers try to waste their time. A signal is tripped a siren blares a shootout occurs a bandit is wounded and a teller killed  all in less than a minute. Jesse James and his henchman Bob Ford escape James saving Ford's life and in typical Fuller fashion foreshadowing his own doom as he tells Ford that now he's responsible for him.This has little to do with what is known of the real James and Ford brothers it seems pretty hard to believe that ruralwestern born Jesse was the cultured gentleman he acts in the early part of this film and the later scenes of Ford and John later Marshall John Kelley bear scant resemblance to the historical record no matter though if you're more interested in the taut exciting storyline that Fuller has crafted. Jesse lasts just a few minutes on screen and then it's Ford's turn to play on our sympathies as his cowardly actions haunt him for the rest of the film and he tries to no avail to redeem himself in the eyes of his sweetheart Cynthy who we know instinctively will wait for him  only so far.Many of Fuller's trademarks are already in place hardbitten dialogue though not so outlandish and overthetop here as it would be in some later films fairly heavy use of wideeyed closeups and an inyourface blunt yellow journalistic style that on first glance may seem to admit little subtlety. Poke around a little though and you'll find a lot of complexity in the character of Bob Ford especially and a fairly ambiguous attitude about both vigilantism and honor. The acting is surprisingly solid here given Fuller's penchant for picking hammy players though only Preston Foster as Kelly seemed entirely at home.".

After shooting his best friend in the back for love he must live with what he has done.  Ireland is great as the remorseful lovesick Ford. This is a neat first film by Sam Fuller a newspaper man at heart. And you can definitely tell he likes the newspaper.  He shows at least three sequences of headlines of newspapers to fill space in the narrative the classic spinning paper.  We can also see early on in his career that Fuller loves to mess with the audience.  It's a very entertaining trick. For instance after Ford has been shot at by the boy trying to become famous a rider comes along shooting his gun.  We think someone else is shooting at Ford.  However the rider is only excited because silver has been found in Colorado.  I love how he plays with the audience!  Fuller enjoys making you think for a split second that something bad is about to happen and then reveal that he's just joking around.  He does this countless times throughout the film. Check this out if you want to see an unconventional western from the 40s.  No classicstyle here just the beginning of a great independent director!  810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Jesse James gang was a group of Missouri farmers turned outlaws. Heading the gang was Jesse Reed Hadleyand his brother Frank Tom Tyler. Other members included Charlie Ford Tommy Noonanand his younger brother Bob John Ireland.While the law hunts him Jesse lives quietly in a rented house on the corner of Lafayette and Twentyfirst street in St. Joseph Missouri under the alias of Tom Howard. His wife Zee Barbara Woodell begs him to end his association with the Ford brothers. Before they can leave on a last bank holdup Bob learns that is childhood sweetheart Cynthy Waters Barbara Britton now an actress is in St. Joe and he brushes aside all caution to see her.Cynthy is beginning to realize that she is a liability to her manager Harry Kane J. Edward Bromberg because she will not leave Missouri. Meanwhile John Kelley Preston Foster has come into her life. She pleads with Bob to turn honest.Cynthy tries to get a pardon for Bob but the best offer she can get is for a 20year stretch in prison. Then the Governor offers amnesty and a 10000 reward to any member of the James gang betraying Jesse. When his chance comes April 3 1882Bob shoots Jesse in the back. He gets the amnesty but the reward is cut to 500. He also loses the love and respect of Cynthy but he blames John Kelley. Bob needing money joins Kane's show in an act showing how he killed Jesse James but the act is a miserable flop.Bob goes to crowded Creede Colorado scene of a silver boom.There he has to share a room with another prospector who turns out to be Kelley. The next morning Kelley and a diamond ring that Bob had bought for Cynthy are both gone. While hunting for Kelley Bob meets an aged prospector Soapy Victor Kilian who takes him in as a partner. They strike it rich and Bob sends for Cynthy who arrives accompanied by her maid Jeni LeGon and Kane and Bob meets the arriving party.Kelley also shows up dragging a hotel clerk who admits to stealing the ring. Kelley is surprised to find Cynthy with Bob and thinks they are married. He is relieved to learn the truth and soon accepts the job of Creede's town Marshal. Cynthy admits to Kelley that she does not love Bob but she feels responsible for his having killed Jesse.Frank James comes to her hotel suite demanding that Cynthy tell him where Bob is. Kelley disarms him and locks him in jail. Days later Bob and Soapy and others are celebrating in the hotel bar awaiting news of the verdict on Frank James. The news of his acquittal and Frank himself arrive simultaneously and Frank who holds the upper hand informs Bob of Kelley's and Cynthy's relationship knowing its effect on Bob would be worse than death.Bob leaves to have a shootout showdown with Kelley. This film was the third time Tom Tyler had played Frank James. Reed Hadley played Jesse James in this film and had the role Frank James in 1950's The Return of Jesse James making him and Wendell Corey the only two actors who had portrayed both brothers on the screen.".

Before they can leave on a last bank holdup Bob learns that is childhood sweetheart Cynthy Waters Barbara Britton now an actress is in St. Joe and he brushes aside all caution to see her.Cynthy is beginning to realize that she is a liability to her manager Harry Kane J. Edward Bromberg because she will not leave Missouri. Meanwhile John Kelley Preston Foster has come into her life. She pleads with Bob to turn honest.Cynthy tries to get a pardon for Bob but the best offer she can get is for a 20year stretch in prison. Then the Governor offers amnesty and a 10000 reward to any member of the James gang betraying Jesse. When his chance comes April 3 1882Bob shoots Jesse in the back. He gets the amnesty but the reward is cut to 500. He also loses the love and respect of Cynthy but he blames John Kelley. Bob needing money joins Kane's show in an act showing how he killed Jesse James but the act is a miserable flop.Bob goes to crowded Creede Colorado scene of a silver boom.There he has to share a room with another prospector who turns out to be Kelley. The next morning Kelley and a diamond ring that Bob had bought for Cynthy are both gone. While hunting for Kelley Bob meets an aged prospector Soapy Victor Kilian who takes him in as a partner. They strike it rich and Bob sends for Cynthy who arrives accompanied by her maid Jeni LeGon and Kane and Bob meets the arriving party.Kelley also shows up dragging a hotel clerk who admits to stealing the ring. Kelley is surprised to find Cynthy with Bob and thinks they are married. He is relieved to learn the truth and soon accepts the job of Creede's town Marshal. Cynthy admits to Kelley that she does not love Bob but she feels responsible for his having killed Jesse.Frank James comes to her hotel suite demanding that Cynthy tell him where Bob is. Kelley disarms him and locks him in jail. Days later Bob and Soapy and others are celebrating in the hotel bar awaiting news of the verdict on Frank James. The news of his acquittal and Frank himself arrive simultaneously and Frank who holds the upper hand informs Bob of Kelley's and Cynthy's relationship knowing its effect on Bob would be worse than death.Bob leaves to have a shootout showdown with Kelley. This film was the third time Tom Tyler had played Frank James. Reed Hadley played Jesse James in this film and had the role Frank James in 1950's The Return of Jesse James making him and Wendell Corey the only two actors who had portrayed both brothers on the screen.";

	schema:headline " Interesting departure from the usual Jesse James story";
	schema:reviewBody "Sam Fuller wrote and directed this unusual version of the Jesse James story from the perspective of his murderer the cowardly Robert Ford John Ireland. Although Ireland is billed beneath 30s oater star Preston Foster Outcasts of Poker Flat and his love interest Cynthy played by Barbara Britton he's definitely the star of this show and it's the story of Ford and not James or any other character. In fact James is shown as something of a trusting simpleton  unless you want to dig into the possibility that's implied in some of the film's images that James and Ford are lovers. In fact if you've watched to the very end there's sort of a stark recognition there depending on how you see it. But there's a definite note of tenderness when James touches Ford's injured shoulder and then there's that scene where James has Ford scrub his back in the tub....There's a lot of interesting character work from Ireland who doesn't do that well with the earlier scenes like where he's supposed to be dreaming of his freedom but who kicks into high gear as soon as his ladylove seems to reject him. Ireland is very convincing at conveying passion and also at playing a guy who's trying hard to hide his passion. That's never more clear than in the great scene when a wandering musician plays the song about the dirty little coward Robert Ford for him in the bar. I also really liked the scene with he and Foster when he held back from getting involved in the bar fight until the other man drew a gun.Foster himself isn't given nearly as much to do in the film but he was always a solid screen presence he's convincingly grizzled and worldweary. A lot of times in these types of movies the Foster character would have ended up getting the girl but things are a bit more unclear in this story. We don't get the sense that there's really much chemistry between them. Britton's work is pretty good I thought. She convinced me that her character didn't really know what she wanted.Good B movie glad to finally get a chance to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatya got to eat? asks Bob Ford who backshot his great friend Jesse James not too long ago. Says Joe the bartender at the Silver King Saloon in Creede Colorado Sweet corn cornmeal mush cornpone with cracklins and corn whiskey. I'll have it says Bob. Lukewarm corn cooked ambitiously is about all there is in Sam Fuller's debut as a director. Fuller had been writing scripts and story outlines in Hollywood for quite awhile. Finally he made a threemovie deal with a B movie producer If I can direct the movies and I won't charge you I'll write the screenplays. The first of the three I Shot Jesse James is a potentially intriguing story of a loser but told with a script that has little tension directed with little flair and acted for the most part with a dull steady cadence. A good deal of the dialogue and many of the actors are just competent. Still if you're a Fuller fan I Killed Jesse James may be worth watching. It's part of Criterion's Eclipse Series 5  The First Films of Samuel Fuller. The set includes The Baron of Arizona and Steel Helmet. Fuller in my view was not one of the great directors or screenwriters he usually wrote his own screenplays. He wasn't one of the great craftsmen either. What he had was a tough knockabout personal story a confident willingness to dance to his own music a streak of subversiveness that could undermine the fatuousness of Hollywood the establishment and the nervous and enough talent to take the commonplace material and actors he often was dealt and turn at least parts of his movies into something to admire. He was the kind of Hollywood nonHollywood director that some cineastes and film critics adore. It would take a person wearing blinders however not to recognize that his movies are at best variable. Most of them don't hold up very well unless the viewer has been first captured by Sam Fuller's iconic antiestablishment reputation. Pickup on South Street is probably his best work with fine performances by an Alevel cast an unusual script considering it was originally intended as an antiCommie screed and a story that Fuller keeps moving along. The Big Red One highly praised by many is an effective and realistic war movie dear to Fuller's heart. But it seems to me to go indulgently on and on and on. For the rest of his movies those that I've seen there's just excellent bits and pieces mixed into a Bmovie sensibility awkward dialogue almost any scenes involving a man and woman and too much discursiveness. Fuller in my opinion needed a strong editor to work with and a strong writer with whom to collaborate. I have a feeling that Fuller would find either prospect completely unsatisfactory. Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss anointed by Criterion for me aren't just pulp movies they're almost embarrassing examples of overwrought pulp movies. This is all just opinion. Watch The Naked Kiss and see what you think.But back to I Shot Jesse James. When Bob Ford John Ireland puts a bullet in the back of his friend Jesse James Ford hopes to gain amnesty and a large reward. He'd been befriended by James and had been part of James' gang. Ford wants to marry the love of his life the singer Cynthy Waters Barbara Britton. He thinks he can leave the criminal life and settle down with Cynthy. Instead she rejects him. He's called a coward and a backshooter. Most people hold him in contempt. He gets only a small part of the reward. He still thinks that if only he can make money he can win Cynthy. And there's that straight talking' guy who likes Cynthy too a man named John Kelley Preston Foster top billed who keeps showing up. There's a showdown and that's that. John Ireland in my view had a lot of screen presence but he needed a good script and strong direction to be at his best. Just watch him as Fantail in Raw Deal 1948 as Cherry Valance in Red River 1948 and as Jack Burden in All the King's Men 1949. Even in a piece of Brit noir schlock The Glass Tomb 1955 he brings enough quality and interest to make it worth watching. Here he's constrained by an uninspired script that gives him no opportunity to do anything but show what a sad sack loser Bob Ford is. But wait until that showdown. It only lasts a couple of minutes but John Ireland shows what he can do.".

I saw this as a followup to that. Like most Hollywood films of the era and most of today I Shot Jesse James plays fast and loose with the facts. In this film Ford John Ireland shoots James for the reward money so he can marry his sweetheart Barbara Britton. Unfortunately that cowardly act turns her off of him and she gravitates toward a man named John Kelley Preston Foster. Kelley is a fictionalized version of Ed O'Kelley the man who ultimately shot Robert Ford for nothing more than fame. It's pretty hilarious that he's more or less made into the hero of this picture. Jesse James is ludicrously depicted as an avuncular Abe Lincoln figure. Besides all of this hooha Sam Fuller whose debut this was does a decent job characterizing Ford. Too bad Ireland an actor I immediately recognized but couldn't say for the life of me where I know him from I looked it up  he also played the reporter and pretty much the lead character in the Best Picture of that year All the King's Men is a pretty boring actor. I usually associate Fuller with fast pacing and good plotting but this one plods along lamely with its romantic triangle melodrama. It does have a couple of good scenes though like one where a goofy looking teen Gene Collins tries to assassinate Ford and another where Ford encounters a folk singer performing the Jesse James ballad a scene which is echoed in Dominik's film.".

Over the decades many many films have portrayed James as sort of a Robin Hood of the West even though there was nothing to admire about the man. And after he was killed by a member of his gang songs were composed to the honor of James and declaring that the shooter Bob Ford was a coward. The way I see it cowardly or not shooting Jesse James in the back was a great day for mankind! Now I cannot compare this film to the recent film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford since I haven't seen ithopefully it sticks closer to the facts. However it's pretty obvious by the title that they take a very strong antiFord position. While Ford was a bad man I just can't see how his killing James was anything other than a glorious day for mankindjust as if someone had murdered Ted Bundy.I SHOT JESSE JAMES repeats many of the myths since they abounded even during the time of James' death but tries to explain Bob Ford's motivationsthough I am unsure just how much anyone today can explain this accurately. At least it doesn't try to show the conflict in the usual black  white termswith the myths of Jesse as the victim and Ford as a coward. Unfortunately while the film debunks some of the worst myths about James and Ford it creates some new onesparticularly how Ford died at the end of the film. Like the death of Jesse James Ford was shot in the back at close range in real lifewhy they made him die in an honorable shootout is beyond me. This is specially strange when the film appears to be an attempt to tell Ford's true life story.The part of Bob Ford was played in I SHOT JESSE JAMES by John Ireland. Ireland was an extremely effective actor in Film Noir pictures of the day and is one of my favorite actors in the genre. Here he's in one of the rare Westerns he made and he did a pretty good job. I couldn't believe that one reviewer admitted that although they didn't know much about Ireland said how much they hated his acting. This seemed like a cheap shot and I wish they'd see some of his other films such as THE GOOD DIE YOUNG or RAILROADED!.As for Sam Fuller's direction this was his first effort and was amazingly effective even if the script was full of holes and clichs. Apparently this was all filmed in only 10 days but the film appears complete tight and well thoughtout. For a 10 day effort the film SHOULD suckwhich it certainly does not.My advice is probably not to watch any of the films about Jesse Jamesafter all he was scum. Plus until they free these films from all the clichs and rhetoric I'm inclined to recommend that you instead read a book about him or Bob Ford.By the way the famous song about the sad death of James at the hand of Ford that you hear in the film wasn't written until the 1920s though there were other similar songs and stories written around the time of his death.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Take on the Legend";
	schema:reviewBody "I Shot Jesse James 1949 12 out of 4 Fuller's directorial debut takes a look at the life of Bob Ford John Ireland after his cowardly killing of Jesse James. Ford is in love with a woman Barbara Britton but goes out West to try and make some money but what he doesn't know is that she's in love with another man Preston Foster. The story of Jesse James in Hollywood has always been an interesting one because a lot of movies look at him as some sort of good guy when in truth he was pure scum who killed women and children. How this guy ever got to be looked at as a hero is beyond me but it's probably the same way Ford became a coward. People have debated on what Ford was but there's no question this Fuller film shows him as a weak coward and it even changes the ending of history to make him go out in a different way. This is technically a very well made film but at the same time there are quite a few problems with the screenplay. For starters the movie seems to be hit and miss in regards to what it's trying to say. I didn't care too much for the way James was shown because they made him look and sound like one would expect Abraham Lincoln to come off. I'm not sure why they built Jesse up so highly just to change things around on Ford. The film seems to want to show Ford for a coward yet the screenplay goes off in different directions as to center on other aspects of his life and it's the later stuff that makes the film swing off track for me. With that said the amount of talent on display here by Fuller can't be questioned. The visual style of the film is wonderful and he handles the action quite well. The psychological stuff comes off pretty well especially the scene right after the murder when Ford enters a bar only to have people looking at him differently than he expected. Ireland is very good in his role as is Foster. The two men work extremely well together and make the film worth seeing. There are many many film dealing with this subject and while this one here isn't the best there's still enough here making it worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from the archaic spelling of interns this Paramount feature is notable for Joel McCrea as an er intern in a New York City hospital. Well not for that really but for the fact that McCrea's doctor happens to be named Kildare. Yes this is where it all began for the series that would make so much money for MGM a couple of years later. There's no Dr. Gillespie here. A deskbound bureaucrat shows up early to lecture Kildare on trying a new surgical procedure without permission even delivering the immortal line I'd remind you this is a hospital and not an experimental laboratory. Was this the first appearance of that line? It would go on to a nice career in medical dramas and Carl Reiner's delivery of it in a spoof on Sid Caesar's show in the '50s is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. Of course we know before the picture is over Kildare will have to use that very procedure to save someone's life.Aside from no Gillespiefigure ICTM is also missing the Hardy Family ambiance of the MGM Kildares. The atmosphere here is much closer to Dead End. In fact those expecting a typical Kildare will be surprised at how noirish Theodor Sparkuhl's cinematography is  L.B. would never have allowed this many shadows. Especially eyecatching is Sparkuhl's lighting of Hans Dreier's art deco clinic set although we really only see it at the beginning. I've never been terribly impressed by director Al Santell though if you want to read a heartwarming story about him check out Niven's The Moon's A Balloon but he was clearly inspired by Dreier's clinic set opening the film with some flowing tracking shots.There seems to be one more thing I wanted to mention... Oh yeah  the female lead is played by no less a personage than Barbara Stanwyck. Indeed despite the title most of this is not really a hospital drama but a Stella Dallas soaper about Stanwyck trying to find her lost daughter. After the opening McCrea disappears for several reels as we follow Babs in her search including a tearjerking scene at an orphanage. This being the '30s she naturally gets involved with gangsters including Lloyd Nolan despite his third billing he only really shows up in the last act and sleazy Stanley Ridges who steals all his scenes with Stanwyck  she couldn't have been terribly happy about that  as the scumbag who agrees to find the kid in exchange for certain favors from Babs.A B picture story curiously given A picture production and stars Internes Can't Take Money and who is responsible for that terrible title? deserves to better known than as just Kildare The First. In fact while watching the film with its shadowy photography evocative sets and moody prenoir atmosphere the Kildare pedigree is one of the least interesting things about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film appears to take place somewhere after the first Dr. Kildare movie at MGM which established James Kildare as a recently graduated medical student chosen by the gruff Dr. Gillespie Lionel Barrymore to be his assistant. The grumpy elderly doctor isn't there neither is the stern but goodhearted nurse played by Alma Kruger her assistant played by Laraine Day and most missed the wisecracking receptionist played by Marie Blake. But this is obviously New York City late 30's and Gillespie is already a hardworking intern who is seen in an early scene defending a fellow intern about to be fired. He takes care of a burn victim Barbara Stanwyck and is drawn as he would be in the MGM series as played by Lew Ayres into her scandalous past which has her as the widow of a bank robber who had her baby taken away from her when she went to prison wrongly accused of being a part of the dead husband's criminal activities. Now out of prison Stanwyck needs 1000 to get information as to the whereabouts of her baby and gets help from Kildare who is probably the biggest hearted intern ever to step foot into a New York City hospital.In the short 78 minutes that this medical drama takes to unravel there is a lot of filler but most of it is simple slice of life drama with dollops of humour. One intern is seen telling an overweight socialite to exercise and suggests starting by pulling herself away from the dining table while later another matron is told when asked how to take care of sea sickness that when it happens she'll know what to do. Kildare breaks medical laws by treating gangster Lloyd Nolan's stab wound finds himself paid off which leads to a dramatic scene where Stanwyck tries to get the money from him so she can pay the crooked lawyer to find her baby. Stanwyck already a huge star by the time this came out admirably took on this B picture and comes off quite nicely. She is more the focus than McCrea's noble Kildare is although if anyone was going to play him other than Lew Ayres McCrea would be it. Such other wellknown character actors as Charles Lane and an eyepatched Irving Bacon have nice cameos and Ma Hardy herself Fay Holden appears briefly as the kindhearted nun whom Stanwyck consults to find her child. Overall an entertaining B melodrama that may not be as remembered as the MGM series which followed and the much later TV series but is definitely worth including in the study of this series and for the presence of its major stars who were an excellent onscreen team in several films.".

Of course Kildare fans will miss all the regular characters at Blair General Hospital called Mountview Hospital here the only familiar figure being Kildare himself. There is no Dr Gillespie. The head of the hospital here is a Dr. Pearson who bears no relation at all to kindly Dr. Carew. Joel McCrea's Kildare however is the same character as that essayed by Lew Ayres and the plot is the same kind of simplistic short story that tends to stretch mighty thin over a featurelength film which is long on dialogue and short on action.Nonetheless Alfred Santell's inventive direction manages to stir up audience interest particularly in the first halfhour. In fact he sets the tone for his subsequent technique right from the very opening shot  an extremely long take from a dolly in which the camera darts in and out of cubicles where patients are being treated. When Stanwyck enters he uses a very low angle tracking shot and the menace inherent in her whispered and elliptic conversation with Stanley Ridges is effectively put across by using a variety of angles combined with atmospheric lighting.Stanwyck fits the role the screenplay requires like a glove. While her closeups are attractive however her fans will be disappointed that her clothes are deliberately shabby. Combined with the large hat she wears to conceal her features her wardrobe most successfully imparts an air of mystery and concealment.Other roles are capably cast. Lee Bowman makes some impression despite the brevity of his part and Lloyd Nolan does his best to make his unbelievable character more credible. However Irving Bacon steals the alsoran acting honors with his portrayal of a shady oneeyed bartender.".

The film is at times creaky but it's understandable because it was made over 70 years ago! There are several standout scenes in MOROCCO including the famous kiss scene and the one when Marlene breaks a pearl necklace but what makes this Sternberg film so memorable is the stunning ending. Suddenly the creaky film looks positively contemporary. Are we really in 1930s and not the wild 1970s?!?! The brilliant ending MAKES the movie. Without it it would probably have been an enjoyably moody but average 1930s flick. With it MOROCCO becomes a timeless classic. It's probably the most stunning ending ever made with so many layers of meaning with that one prolonged static shot. It's visually brilliant and sexy on so many levels.".

Her love scenes with Cooper were ardent and unforgettable and her final surrender as she leaves everything behind in order to pursue her love for him clearly represents the creation of the undying femme fatale who kills for love but can die for love.'Morocco' comes off as a great movie between director and actress notwithstanding great performances by the others actors especially the sensual presence of Gary Cooper still a young man and a very charming one.Quite wonderful!".

Even without taking that delicious mindstep Morocco is a delectable cinema classic even if it isn't the finest of the SternbergDietrich collaborations.That hot kiss the whitetieandtailsclad Dietrich plants on the lips of a woman seated helplessly at a cabaret table is still breathtaking. Seeing that kiss still sizzle nowadays makes one wonder why so much hubbub ensued after 2003's gratuitous lackluster liplock shared by Madonna and Britney Spears which as it made me yawn also made me think of Madeline Kahn's Dietrichparodying Lilli von Shtupp dismissing Hedley Lamar's bouquet offering Oh. How odinawy.. Moreover Dietrich's Amy Jolly deliberately ignores the luststruck man who handed a flower to her following her cabaret act and instead humiliates him by kissing his startled but not at all displeased  and rather persuaded to complaisance date. No penis envy nonsense here its all Marlene being woman almighty flexing woman's timeless power.One ought not as one amateur reviewer has to judge myopically this film by today's anal PC standards by dint of sanctimonious judgments about colonialism  and by taking a badly mistaken swipe at Gary Cooper's character speaking American English instead of affecting a French accent when in fact Cooper was playing an American in the Foreign Legion did the character's name Tom Brown not clue that reviewer to Brown's nationality? further the uniform of enlisted legionnaires wasn't tailored to fit handsomely  it was made mostly of coarse wool and issued asis quite often illfitting to men who volunteered for arduous service. Instead one ought to see Morocco's characters for what they are broadlypainted archetypes of white colonialists behaving as white colonialists behaved indeed as people in archetypal roles since Sophocles still behave  albeit in the cinematic mannerist modality of the film's period.Missed too often but not to be missed here is how Morocco in its own stylized Sternbergian way deals with enduring human nature lust and love jealousy and covetousness pettiness and spite anger and beneficence harshness and tenderness not to mention the ineffable human wont to go head over heels round the bend over a lover what we have in Morocco is not a didactic narrative but an epochbridging fable. And despite the dated dialect of its dialogue language it's remarkable how much and exactly what this 1930 film dared to show and got away with showing. Anyone with a matured worldview ought to be aware that seventy years hence rap star films of the two thousandaughts  as well as films employing the standard English of the early twentyfirst century  are likely to be ridiculed or dismissed for their peculiarities of dialect.Give yourself a huge wink and watch Morocco and savor its seductive lenswork its atmopsheric sets and and costumes and lighting and its timeless classical themes which over all these years since its shooting remind us that Plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose.".

Cooper is carrying on an affair with the wife of one of the officers at his post when he meets Dietrich. The man must have had something going for him.

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to read other reviews of Morocco. Some people just don't seem to have a clue and it would be fascinating to learn what they think of as a good film from this era. Nevertheless I was surprised to see that only one reviewer mentioned the sound and that was to criticize it. Sternberg's use of sound as a tool jumped right out at me. There are numerous scenes in this film which have the possibility of being overly tedious and run the risk of being boring. Much is made of Sternberg's visual prowess and the rich texture displayed here but I'm surprised that everyone seems to be missing the effect of the sound. Throughout the film in scenes which need to build tension yet are visually somewhat tiresome Legionaires marching in the street for example Sternberg uses various sound devices artfully. We hear the monotonous drumbeat as the men march. The longer this goes on the more irritating it becomes and as a result puts the audience on edge. This adds to the tension of the scene immensely. The same thing happens in other parts of the film when we hear a short nearly monotone musical phrase repeated over and over ad nauseum or when the sound of the wind blowing through the trees also becomes irritating. Each time the scene is intended to build tension and each time Sternberg's use of sound perfectly complements the visual to achieve the desired effect. This movie is on my you gotta see this one list.".

	schema:reviewBody "MOROCCO is the second of seven collaborations between Marlene Dietrich and the director that discovered her and probably photographed her the best Josef von Sternberg. In fact it is Dietrich's first Englishlanguage film and she stars in it as the worldweary manweary French entertainer Amy Jolly. She's never had a reason to trust a man much less love one until she sees Legionnaire Tom Brown Gary Cooper defend her honour the first time she arrives onstagethis is surely a classic movie moment Marlene Dietrich arriving in full top hat and tails. Tom is just as cynical about women as Amy is about men but from their first encounter over the price of an apple you know that these two have met the one person of the opposite sex who could change everything. Much as he loves her however Tom believes that Monsieur La Bessiere Adolphe Menjou could bring Amy more happiness and stability through his marriage proposal... so he leaves to march off with the Foreign Legion. To be frank the story really isn't all that importantit's pretty onenote with the sole amusement being provided by the zings Amy and Tom trade each time they meet. That's a nice touch the slightly wry way in which they both approach the budding relationship both because they've been hurt before and because there's also no conventional way for the two of them to stay together. This is brought out very nicely by the ending of the film.Whatever other reason you might have to watch MOROCCO there's no denying that Marlene Dietrich is very clearly the star of the entire enterprise. The way von Sternberg photographs and captures her makes her appear mysterious beautiful and yet achingly vulnerable at the same time. You couldn't talk about Dietrich in this film without also mentioning von Sternberg in the same breath since she is so very evidently portrayed in the way he sees her at her best. Some shots of Dietrich more than others are breathtaking. Even if her character isn't particularly wellfleshedout and her lines not too great von Sternberg fed her most of her lines during filming partly because that's how he works and partly because Dietrich apparently knew very little English AmyDietrichboth creations of the same directorial geniusis a fine work of art. Whether it's Dietrich creating a furore of gasps when she emerges in her tux or when she plants a firm kiss on another lady's mouth this film was made in 1930! she is a simply captivating screen presenceCooper seems bland in his role in comparison and Menjou is adequate but certainly doesn't steal the picture. The sound for the whole film isn't that great and Dietrich does have to sing over the noise of the crowd so you really have to struggle to make out what she's saying... but just looking at her really is enough in this film.Watch this film for Dietrich the meticulouslycreated Moroccan atmosphere von Sternberg excels at this and evidently took great pains to make it as authentic as possibleto the detriment of plot and character the sweet romance with a nice final twist... but mostly for Dietrich. She makes it all worth it. 7.510.".

Following her triumph as seductress cabaret entertainer LolaLola in Germany's initial talkie THE BLUE ANGEL 1929 Von Sternberg worked wonders with her once again placing Marlene in the desert stirring up interest between a wealthy suitor and a womanizing legionnaire instead of building sand castles or earning extra tips parking camels by the oasis.Starting off in travelogue style with the camera on the circling globe before reaching a halt over the Northwest region of Africa. The introduction turns to legionnaires of the French Foreign Legion marching into Morocco with Tom Brown Gary Cooper attracting the attention of a couple of women awaiting his return. Next scene goes to the steamer outside Morocco about to dock where Mademoiselle Amy Jolly Marlene Dietrich one of the passengers awaits her new venture. Having made the acquaintance of Monsieur LeBessiere Adolphe Menjou a wealthy French artist he offers her assistance but is told I don't need any help. Wanting to know more about this mysterious woman he asks the captain who labels her as a suicide passenger one who travels with a one way ticket. After making a sensational debut in Lo Tinto's Paul Porcasi caf Amy encounters LeBessiere once again but draws her attention towards Tom Brown sitting with his legionnaire friends. After selling him an apple she gives him the key to her dressing room where they later get acquainted. Fearing Mademoiselle to be gaining power over him Brown leaves. As Amy follows she saves him from being found in the clutches of Madame Caesar Eve Southern wife of his senior commanding officer Ullrich Haupt who already has his suspicions. Cleared by Amy Jolly's testimony Brown is released from jail and sent on a dangerous mission in the Sahara. Thinking about deserting and going away with Amy Tom suddenly changes his mind again! leaving her to accept LeBessiere's marriage proposal. Learning that Tom may be wounded Amy breaks away from her engagement party to locate him. Amy does find Tom but not exactly recuperating in a hospital bed.As important was THE BLUE ANGEL for Dietrich's career in Germany MOROCCO was even more crucial for her in Hollywood. Had MOROCCO failed Dietrich might have become another one of several European imports at the time to either return to their homeland to further advance her career or fade away to obscurity with few films to her credit. Dietrich's performance made such an impact that she was nominated for an Academy Award the only time in her long and successful career. Lee Garmes was also honored for his fine cinematography.In spite of its slow pacing being the Von Sternberg style MOROCCO offers several scenes worth noting including Dietrich's vocalizing of Quand L'Amour Meurt and What Am I Bid For My Apples? by Leo Robin and Earl Hajos. For the first song sung entirely in French Dietrich makes history dressed in tuxedo bow tie and top hat stopping over to a female patron and kissing her briefly on the lips. This alone is what makes MOROCCO so memorable today. There's another interesting scene with the marching of the legionnaires marching out of Morocco with the camera remaining full focus on them and camp followers until their disappearance into the far distance as the drum playing is slowly drowned out by the howling desert winds.Regardless of others in the cast consisting of Francis J. McDonald as Corporate Barney Tatoche Brown's friend Juliette Compton Anna Dolores and Albert Conti Corporal Quinneviernes the sole interest falls on its central characters Dietrich's Amy Jolly is a loner embittered by men yet not afraid to take a chance making the first move especially with her exotic eyes Gary Cooper's underplays his role as the love 'em and leave 'em guy yet retains his usual screen personality to at one point reciting his famous catch phrase Yep. Aside from being an I don't care type he's also has self respect for refusing to accept a free apple from Amy claiming that he always pay for what he gets even when borrowing 20 francs for it Menjou whose career ranges from leads to secondary roles is properly cast as a suitor who offers a woman unconditional love knowing full well she cares nothing for him.MOROCCO is one of many films from the Paramount library to be available on home video and DVD format. Television revivals were frequent when shown on commercial or public television prior to the 1990s infrequent on cable television especially with few revivals on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered January 2003 as part of its star of the month tribute to Marlene Dietrich. The movie itself probably didn't promote tourism in Morocco but it sure helped place Dietrich on the Hollywood map. ".

Sternberg directs sumptuously and with adroit atmosphere of which 'Morocco' is rich in.There are many memorable scenes including Dietrich's ornate and deliciously outrageous first appearance one of the most erotic nightclub scenes on film a wonderfully romantic love scene and one of the most unforgettably hot kisses in cinematic history.Visually 'Morocco' looks great especially in the luminous lighting and ravishingly atmospheric cinematography. The music is very catchy with some parts ahead of their time. Most of the script is clever and sophisticated and there is still a huge amount to keep one engrossed despite the unexceptional story.In summary very good and rich in atmosphere film that has a lot that is hard to forget in the long run. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Why should we watch now this eighty years old film made in black and white slow moving forward with only latent developing story? I'll try to answer this question. The thrill of Morocco lies in the characters of the protagonists played by unforgettable Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper. I believe Voltaire said once that the most beautiful thing in the world is a human face and it seems to be true when you watch their faces.The sparkles between a legionnaire Tom Brown Cooper and a singer Amy Jolly Dietrich are immense it's love from the first sight we see this on his face and we see it in her handling him the key from her flat just in the first evening.While the rich gentleman Le Bessiere Adolphe Menjou is at the beginning just curious about her and her further fate and only later gets really involved with her the young legionnaire seems to be blown off by her first appearance on stage. Amy Jolly has certainly no stage fright she knows very well how to play audience and doesn't need any advice from the owner of the place. She attracts attention by wearing her extravagant costume and then by taking a flower from a woman's hair and kissing her rather teaching her manners than anything else. And then suddenly this flower will be given away to Tom Brown. So we see the very beginning of the romance and we see the reactions of the audience.The thrill is in the nuances in the play of shadows and light. Perhaps the pauses in the dialogs are as meaningful as the words when Tom Brown says Nothing... yet! we know already what kind of fellow he is or even more famous example Amy Jolly says after a long pause I'll be back... wait for me. It's more impressive than those dozen words she could fill in this empty time space. But the intensity of the scene would be lost! I must also stress the brilliance of the love dialogs in Morocco. For instance it's a wonderful line when Amy Jolly says to Tom Brown You should go now... I'm beginning to like you. It's a deeper insight into a woman's soul.About the rich man somehow he seems rather playing games with Amy Jolly so he provokes her by saying about the women following the legion into the desert that they love their men. I guess the meaning of his words was that she Amy does not love anyone really and then she belongs to him into his world. If she does she should make her choice.Cooper gives a genius imitation of the way Tom Brown speaks he speaks like a soldier in a hacked simple straight forward manner.At the end of the film Amy Jolly takes off her shoes to follow her man maybe this scene has influenced the other film makers The red shoes 1948 and The river of no return 1954.What is also interesting about Morocco is a multilingual surrounding we hear English French German Arabic and Spanish.In my opinion it's the best not only of Dietrich but also of the young Cooper because only after seeing Morocco I start to believe in him as a charming Casanova from Hollywood.".

Mademoiselle Amy Jolly is hired by Lo Tinto Paul Porcasi to sing in his nightclub and in her debut she meets Monsieur La Bessiere again having dinner with his friends Adjutant Caesar Ullrich Haupt and his wife Madame Caesar Eve Southern. He invites Amy to stay with him but the singer feels attracted by the ladykiller Legionnaire Tom Brown Gary Cooper. Amy invites Tom to go to her apartment after the show but their encounter does not work very well. Tom leaves her apartment and Amy follows him. Meanwhile Madame Caesar stalks Tom on the street but he returns with Amy to her apartment. However two thieves attack him and he selfdefends and kills the guys. Tom is arrested and Adjutant Caesar unsuccessfully tries to force him to confess that he had met his wife. Monsieur La Bessiere offers to help Tom but he is assigned to a suicide mission with the Foreign Legion. La Bessiere proposes marriage to Amy but she is divided between her true love with Tom and the comfortable life she might have with the millionaire. Morocco is the first film of Marlene Dietrich in America with a strange triangle of love among a cabaret singer a legionnaire and a millionaire. The romance has a daring scene for a 1930 film when Marlene Dietrich kisses Eve Southern on the lips and a magnificent conclusion unusual in Hollywood movies. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Marrocos Morocco".

So now we find our second Marlene Dietrich vehicle and also an AFI favorite in Morocco which also introduces us to a young Gary Cooper who we spotted in It and would have seen in Wings. I noticed on the map at the beginning that Morocco isn't too far from Casablanca. Anyway I liked this film a lot. The film gels much better than Dietrich and Von Sternberg's last collaboration Blue Angel. Cooper plays a different kind of character here than those that would make him famous he's not a downhome aw shucks nice guy but something of a scoundrel and a ladykiller. Dietrich's Amy Jolly is a more sympathetic character than Lola in Angel sorry I keep comparing the two just bare with me she doesn't go through life plowing through men and turning them to husks but is really capable of a little romance. For Von Sternberg's first Hollywood picture he really seems to scale back all the moody Expressionist mise en scene but he still knows how to catch Dietrich radiating that unique sexual energy she does so well such as in the famous scene when Amy walks into the audience in her tails and tophat and kisses a woman on the lips. With Marlene Dietrich it's all about the cheekbones. I loved the chemistry between Dietrich and Cooper who trade one smoldering oneliner after another when he tells her how light she is she jumps at the chance to tell him that she just feels light because he's so muscular. Perfection.KEVIN After a long break we return to the Odyssey and at last we come to a movie that's not all firsts. We have here our second Von SternburgDietrich collaboration Morocco also starring Adolphe Menjou and 29year old Gary Cooper. I enjoyed this film a lot more than Blue Angel which was actually kind of depressing. Morocco is a beautiful love story between clichd as it sounds two people from very different worlds. Marlene Dietrich was stunning in this one even more than in her last film we watched. I love the scene when she's performing in that wonderful tuxedo and top hat the way she looks out at the audience like she rules over every one of them how she walks through the audience with this strangely androgynous strut and kisses another woman on the lips. There is a great scene between Cooper and Dietrich in her dressing room a very romantic scene that begins with a kiss before they start flirting. As the film progresses we find that Jolly Dietrich doesn't go through men with the same sadistic indifference as Lola in Angel but is actually capable of falling in love. Dietrich shows so much of this with just her eyes and its great that the transition to sound film did not leave behind performers with that ability.Last film L'Age d'or 1930. Next film viewed Soup to Nuts 1930. Next film chronologically The Criminal Code 1931.".

He sings Thank Heaven for Little girls with all the captivating smile and enduring charm that kept him an international super star for four decades...

With her fleeting facial expressions she captures brilliantly the transformation of a teasing tomboy into the hesitant uncertain blooming of adult sexuality... Louis Jourdan behaves like a perfect Gaston Lachaille... He makes his offer in good faith before any emotional advance... His character is a harmonious mixture of worldly cynicism and romantic idealism...

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this film several times I definitely have to rate Gigi as one of the most charming musicals ever made.  The delightful score by Lerner  Loewe includes songs such as I Remember it Well The Night They Invented Champagne Thank Heaven For Little Girls as well as the title track Gigi sung with surprising candor and earnestness by Louis Jourdan. Although reminiscent of their work on My Fair Lady this score not only stands beautifully on its own but also grows in depth with each viewing.The three principals Leslie Caron Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier along with the Paris locales helps maintain a distinctively French flavor especially in the way the characters relate and interact.For everyone who has commented on the political incorrectness of the story a closer look will actually reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette's work which was groundbreaking for its time  1  the story is a commentary and observation of the limited social and economic options for women outside of marriage during the turn of the century Paris 2 Although Gigi Caron never fully masters her lessons and grooming she is able to capture Gaston's Jourdan heart precisely because of her imperfections and 3 most importantly it is Gaston rather than Gigi who is forced to truly transform himself and defy the social conventions of the time to bring the story to its resolution.Compare this to My Fair Lady which offers similar social commentary but resolves itself in a more standard way  For example  1  Eliza Dolittle only becomes noticeable and lovable after transforming her outward appearance and speech patterns 2  Although Professor Higgins finally realizes his love for Eliza at the end it is Eliza who is forced to submit her will by effecting a reconciliation that does nothing to resolve any of the issues raised in the scenes leading up to that point.Definitely see Gigi and judge for yourself.  By the way the widescreen version is sooooo much better.  This is especially apparent in numbers such as I Remember It Well where entire characters are forced to be cut out of the screen.".

Although reminiscent of their work on My Fair Lady this score not only stands beautifully on its own but also grows in depth with each viewing.The three principals Leslie Caron Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier along with the Paris locales helps maintain a distinctively French flavor especially in the way the characters relate and interact.For everyone who has commented on the political incorrectness of the story a closer look will actually reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette's work which was groundbreaking for its time  1  the story is a commentary and observation of the limited social and economic options for women outside of marriage during the turn of the century Paris 2 Although Gigi Caron never fully masters her lessons and grooming she is able to capture Gaston's Jourdan heart precisely because of her imperfections and 3 most importantly it is Gaston rather than Gigi who is forced to truly transform himself and defy the social conventions of the time to bring the story to its resolution.Compare this to My Fair Lady which offers similar social commentary but resolves itself in a more standard way  For example  1  Eliza Dolittle only becomes noticeable and lovable after transforming her outward appearance and speech patterns 2  Although Professor Higgins finally realizes his love for Eliza at the end it is Eliza who is forced to submit her will by effecting a reconciliation that does nothing to resolve any of the issues raised in the scenes leading up to that point.Definitely see Gigi and judge for yourself.  By the way the widescreen version is sooooo much better.  This is especially apparent in numbers such as I Remember It Well where entire characters are forced to be cut out of the screen.";

Gigi is a coltish teen in 1900's Paris who lives with her grandmother Madame Alvarez Hermione Gingold and who loves to hang out with family friend Gaston Lachaille Louis Jourdan an international jetsetter and playboy whose every relationship is documented in the papers. The pseudonarrator of the film is Henri Lachaille Maurice Chevalier Gaston's uncle and a notorious playboy in his own right who loves to give his nephew relationship advice solicited or not. Gigi is being bred by her grandmother and aunt to become a refined woman so she can become a mistress for rich and powerful men so it comes as both a surprise and delight to the women to discover that Gaston may be a suitable candidate. However Gigi's innocence may not allow this to happen as she struggles with making the transition between carefree girl to a refined lady with social responsibilities.Musicals are a rare genre on my films I adore list but Gigi has long been a favorite film of mine despite its sappy moments and sometimes corny jokes. What makes Gigi such a good film is its unmitigated Charm with a capital C one can't help but grin a little when Chevalier sings Thank Heaven for Little Girls because he doesn't stop flashing that high voltage smile himself. And I cannot get through the scene between Chevalier and Gingold when they sing I Remember it Well by the seaside without tearing up because it is just so damn cute. Sure the revelations and epiphanies are pretty easy and kind of out of nowhere but considering it is an MGM musical from the 1950's I would be surprised if there weren't these kinds of things. Everyone in the film looks like they are having a good time particularly Chevalier and the great LernerLoewe music against the Parisian backdrop is enough to sell me.Gigi while being a 10time Oscar winner including Best Picture has unfortunately been marginalized by some as a typical MGM fluff piece could be a hard sell particularly to the jaded Generation Y  and  younger audience. However since I myself am probably one of the most cynical filmviewers I personally know of take my word for it  Gigi is a lot of fun and a good way to spend two hours. 810 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "Although MGM and other studios would continue in the genre for several more years GIGI is the last great musical of Hollywood's golden age. It is also one of the few titles consistently mentioned when critics dispute which film should be considered the single finest musical ever created by Hollywood a film that rivals the likes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS.Based on a novella by Colette GIGI tells the story of a French family of the belle epocha family it seems of women who have made their living from the favors of famous men. Still something of a gawky schoolgirl Gigi Leslie Caron is being trained to become a courtesan and when she suddenly blossoms she captures the heart of Paris sophisticate Gaston Lachaille Louis Jourdan. But much to her family's horror when the arrangements are completed Gigi suddenly declines! The cast is absolutely flawless. Caron was born to play Gigi and is as charming as the awkward youth as she is as the suddenly beautiful young woman Jordan's appeal as the worldly and world weary Gaston is tremendous. But the real joy of the cast is in its supporting cast which includes Maurice Chevalier as Gaston's uncle Hermione Gingold and Isabel Jeans as Gigi's grandmother and great aunt and Eva Gabor as Gaston's current mistress. Chevalier and Gingold play their roles with precisely the right mixture of charm and severity and their duet I Remember It Well is among the highlights of the film while Jeans and Gabor give such great comic turns that their small roles become as memorable as the leads.The Learner  Lowe score is equal their great Broadway success MY FAIR LADY and offers such enjoyable and memorable songs as Gigi and The Night They Invented Champagne the script equals and merges with the music to considerable effect. Filmed largely on location in Paris the look of the film is incredibly rich and director Vincent Minnelli maintains a sprightly sense of humor with just enough darkness behind the bubbles to make us aware of the seriousness of the tale. Mixing intimacy with tremendous surface splash GIGI is a cultural treasure a film to enjoy and cherish forever and certainly a worthy contender for that disputed title of Hollywood's finest musical. A personal favorite and highly highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

While in my opinion the score does not surpass My Fair Lady in range and cleverness it certainly did well enough in winning nine Oscars including the one for Best Picture of 1958.

	schema:reviewBody "The capstone of Arthur Freed's brilliant career as producer of some of the best musicals around was this film which sadly marked the end of the musical era on film. You could never produce something like Gigi directly for the screen because the talent wasn't under contract to any one studio. Nor would any studio take a chance on something original for the screen. Musicals would continue to be made but they would be 90 adaptations from Broadway.Though the only thing original about Gigi was the musical score. The novel by Colette had been filmed twice before the first time a silent film from Brazil the second a dramatic version by the French in 1949. One of these days maybe TCM will broadcast that one and we could compare them.Just the fact that Gigi was done at all shows a cracking of Hollywood's all abiding Code. Let's face it we're talking here about a family that raises their daughters to be courtesans. They pray for daughters and at a last resort marry.Leslie Caron as Gigi is the last survivor and she's being raised by her grandmother Hermione Gingold and her great aunt Isabel Jeans to be the best Madame DuBarry she can be. They have a family friend in Louis Jourdan and the story of Gigi is the story of how Jourdan slowly but surely starts seeing Gigi in a different light as she grows up and kind of grows on you.Of course the French quality seal on this Hollywood but shot on location in Paris production is provided by that grandest boulevardier of all Maurice Chevalier. He plays Jourdan's aging rou of an uncle who gets from Lerner and Loewe three numbers that are now permanently identified with him. Chevalier thanks the Deity for the blessings of young nubile females in Thank Heaven For Little Girls he reminisces or attempts to reminisce about old times with Hermione Gingold in I Remember It Well and thanks the Deity once again for not having to go through the angst of youthful passion in I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore. Anyone who sees Gigi and sees Chevalier perform these numbers will be an instant fan of his the way I became when I saw Gigi on screen way back in the day.But the best song of the score is Louis Jourdan's title song which is the climax of a long musical soliloquy in which Jourdan analyzes his feelings for the audience. I'm sure that one of the reasons that Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe were attracted to the Gigi project was the fact that they saw an opportunity to write another soliloquy capped off with a hit song the way they did in My Fair Lady. The similarities between what Jourdan does in Gigi and what Rex Harrison does in I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face are readily apparent. I half expect Jourdan to end the film with 'Gigi where the devil are my slippers.'Gigi was nominated and won in 9 separate Oscar categories which might be a record in terms of percentage of Oscars nominated for and won. Even though the following year BenHur won a few more and has a record of most Oscars still standing after almost 50 years. Gigi won for Best Picture for Best Director for Vincente Minnelli and for the Best Song from a film for the title song. Amazingly enough none of the players got an Oscar nomination in any of the acting categories.That shouldn't have worried Minnelli though because in his Some Came Running which also was out that year Shirley MacLaine Arthur Kennedy and Martha Hyer all got nominations in those categories. 1958 would have to be the high point in the career of Vincente Minnelli.One ironic thing I always found with Gigi. It's set at the turn of the last century in Paris and unlike that other MGM Parisian classic An American in Paris Gigi was shot entirely on location in the City of Light. The Paris of the height of the Third Republic is captured beautifully at least our conception of it in the English speaking world. Maurice Chevalier was an adolescent growing up there at this time but this was hardly his world then. Chevalier grew up in dire poverty in a single parent household with a mother who sacrificed everything so her son could be taught the rudiments of show business where he became an immortal. I'm sure the irony never escaped Chevalier as he was filming Gigi.What's not to like about Gigi a wonderful musical score a magical setting and some fine performances in a perfectly cast company of players. Thank heaven indeed.".

Who else could take stories that don't readily lend themselves to musicals and not only turn them into one but to something with substance and depth.  I Thank Heaven that God saw fit to bring Lerner and Lowe together.Colette's Gigi is a young woman who bucks the trend in her family and makes the decision to be her own person rather than the woman that some might argue that she was born to be.  So does the Gigi of this movie. Just because Lerner adds to the story that Collette wrote he doesn't take away the essential spirit.  Lerner's Gigi is a woman who wants to be her own person.  The writing is wonderful and the performances that Minnelli was able to get out of the actors shows that he understood the script very well.Leslie Caron was 27 when she appeared in this movie but she was able to play a teenager and play it well.  Casting in this film is perfect down to the men that played Honore's valet and Aunt Alicia's butler. there is no performance that is wanting in this show.  This film has a timeless appeal.  Even though it is dated to the turn of the 20th century the dilemia that Gigi faces do I do what is expected of me or what I want with my life is one that others both male and female have faced at other times and other places.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong I love it  Leslie Caron and the whole cast. And the songs are superb. But let's face it this is Americanized Collette. She celebrated the deals and compromises within a sexist order that allowed a lucky few highclass prostitutes to become welltodo independent women in findesiecle Paris and a lot of others to at least make some kind of living. She empowered women at a time when there just weren't many other opportunities for them to establish real independence our current categories of PC and nonPC wouldn't have meant much then. It wasn't always pretty but there was reality in her writing about relations between the sexes that hasn't lost its relevance. Of course this had to be softpedalled for the American audience  hence the ending which conforms nicely with middleclass morality on this side of the Atlantic. This is the only politically unsatisfactory thing about the movie however. And it remains superior  both politically and as a film  to My Fair Lady where Eliza is implied to return and submit herself to Rex Harrison at the end whereas Gigi at least implies that it's Gaston rather than Gigi who is going to have to change his ways.My only other gripe Why no dancing from Leslie  and from Vincente Minelli that peerless director of dance sequences? I guess Lerner and Lowe must have been more in control of this one and weren't of a mind for rugcutting. Too bad  there really isn't nearly enough of Leslie dancing on film as it is!".

The presentation is reminiscent of My Fair Lady but lacking in a good story is not half as great.Maurice Chevalier as Gaston's Uncle Honore steals the show and gives the best performance due mainly to his special French charm and charisma. He lifts every scene.  His singing of Thank Heaven for little girls sets the spirit of the film as he advises Gaston on the importance of enjoying life. The main ingredients appear to be Paris Springtime and girls preferably young ones.Gigi Leslie Caron is taught the social graces and niceties of life by her grandmama and friends such as how to drink a glass of wine and how to choose a good cigar.  These scenes I found not particularly funny. Perhaps it was unconvincing because the actor was trying to be very naive and young and inexperienced.  Louis Jordan as Gaston the bored millionaire playboy was OK in a romantic role which was relatively undemanding.  I particularly liked his rendition of the song Gigi when his attitude to life is suddenly changed.  Gigi happens to be my favourite tune in the whole film.Paris life is captured in glorious technicolour.  Note that it is devoid of all shabbiness and poverty.  The film opens near the Bois de Boulogne in 1900 and wanders amongst the skating rink and places of great entertainment where money seems to be the least of their worries. This is escapism de luxe.Not a great film but quite pleasant to watch. I'll be singing Gigi a long time after the film has been forgotten.".

	schema:headline " Van Damme's renaissance!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Van Damme hits form again big time! Until Death is a dark dirty damn nasty and repugnant film but in a good way. In a Get Carter Death Wish Marathon Man kinda way. It's a 70's style thriller with all the grimy darkness pessimism and degeneracy of so many great flicks of that time. Sure Wake Of Death had that feel but somewhere along the way with director Phillipe Martinez's unsure hand it attempted artiness and relied far too heavily on the editing room while also playing and drawing out needless scenes. Until Death is honed grounded and above all consistent. All those who doubted Simon Fellow's because of his previous two films should note that both were filmed in Romania and that the notoriously iffy company Castel were responsible. Here however under the guidance of Moshe Diamont Fellows is given more freedom to express himself and he keeps things simple grounded allowing scenes to play out. He's far more sure of what he wants here and delivers. He adds in a few touches that feel experimental and a bit dangerous and that only adds to the 70's vibe. A 70's vibe does not a good movie make but it's a welcome part of an overall good movie.Now in my honest opinion I found this to be Van Damme's best film overall period! At the same time it's hard to even call this a Van Damme movie. It's like a lost movie from Bronson or Eastwood circa 70's. It's like Siegal and Peckinpah joined forces and took on the reckless abandon and excessiveness of Michael Winner. Those who want the new Bloodsport will not take this to their hearts as Van Damme's pinnacle but still they should enjoy Van Damme in a film with genuine atmosphere in a role he stamps real authority on. Van Damme minus the flashy kicks plays a walking turd! He's a degenerate drug addled morally abstruse cop and a borderline maniac. Van Damme has a role split into two halves if you like precoma postcoma. Pre coma is the dirty cop Stowe who's lost all regard for the people close to him and his coworkers. He lives only for himself and only to bring down expartner Callaghan Rea. He'd sell his own mother to get the collar. Van Damme gives his best performance. He's really playing an unlikeable character whose judgement has become clouded. He thinks he's doing right trying to do right but loses track of the right and wrong ways to get what he wants. Van Damme is just a mean badass machine in the first half of the film not a man to be crossed at all. When Stowe wakes from his coma having been left for dead by Callaghan he wants to turn his life around while he has to fully recover from his injuries. Here Van Damme is equally good. The film is a real departure for him. He really immerses himself in the role and vanity is so far from his mind here. Van Damme looks outta shape and should do and early on is really made to look dishevelled. Elsewhere Stephen Rea kind of flitters in and out in an extended cameo but he gets to really chew scenery in a great scene at the end when he and Stowe come face to face for the first time since Stowe's resurrection. Rea is simply picking up his paycheque but he gets the one scene to let loose and deliver and he leaves a lasting impression. Selina Giles as Stowe's wife enters the film with a bang! It's not a good one either cause she's not delivering a good performance. However no sooner than Van Damme gets shot in the head she begins delivering a fine performance. It's quite strange in that respect. There's also decent support from Adam Leese and Gary Beadle.The action is short and swift. It's supposed to hit hard and hit fast. They're simple scenes but they pack a punch in a way that The Hard Corps and Second In Command were lacking. Ditto Wake Of Death while supremely violent was a letdown in the action. Here though it's all about the violence. It's efficiently choreographed and edited and it has impact. When people die you know they're dead. Those eagerly awaiting plenty of handto hand will be disappointed it there's only a few quick little flourishes but for this film Van Damme is far better armed with a shotgun than unleashing his kicks. The action isn't meant to be over the top drawn out and excessive. It's about the forceful violence dished out. To see what I mean simply check the end action sequence in Straw Dogs.Simon Fellows does well here as I mentioned and he keeps the film ticking over nicely. Doug Milsome's cinematography is the best in a Van Damme movie for a while now. It looks great and really keeps that dank 70's vibe going. There's also great sound design and Matthew Booth does a good job piecing everything together in the editing suite. A real standout though is the score from Mark Sayfritz a blend of orchestra and synth effortlessly combining. Occasionally there's a real Massive Attack vibe in the music. It's arguably the best score in a Van Damme film and Sayfritz will be a welcome returnee for Van Damme's next film The Shepard. All in all those who like a good gritty action thriller with some vicious violence need look no further than Until Death. Those who saw Wake Of Death as a turning point were seeing a false dawn cause this is Van Damme's career defining moment. It proves he's now an actor and that WOD wasn't a flash in the pan. This is the best DTV film I've seen and as those who know my love of Lundgren's Mechanik will realise that means a lot. ".

	onyx:emotionText "Van Damme hits form again big time! Until Death is a dark dirty damn nasty and repugnant film but in a good way. In a Get Carter Death Wish Marathon Man kinda way. It's a 70's style thriller with all the grimy darkness pessimism and degeneracy of so many great flicks of that time. Sure Wake Of Death had that feel but somewhere along the way with director Phillipe Martinez's unsure hand it attempted artiness and relied far too heavily on the editing room while also playing and drawing out needless scenes. Until Death is honed grounded and above all consistent. All those who doubted Simon Fellow's because of his previous two films should note that both were filmed in Romania and that the notoriously iffy company Castel were responsible. Here however under the guidance of Moshe Diamont Fellows is given more freedom to express himself and he keeps things simple grounded allowing scenes to play out. He's far more sure of what he wants here and delivers. He adds in a few touches that feel experimental and a bit dangerous and that only adds to the 70's vibe. A 70's vibe does not a good movie make but it's a welcome part of an overall good movie.Now in my honest opinion I found this to be Van Damme's best film overall period! At the same time it's hard to even call this a Van Damme movie. It's like a lost movie from Bronson or Eastwood circa 70's. It's like Siegal and Peckinpah joined forces and took on the reckless abandon and excessiveness of Michael Winner. Those who want the new Bloodsport will not take this to their hearts as Van Damme's pinnacle but still they should enjoy Van Damme in a film with genuine atmosphere in a role he stamps real authority on. Van Damme minus the flashy kicks plays a walking turd! He's a degenerate drug addled morally abstruse cop and a borderline maniac. Van Damme has a role split into two halves if you like precoma postcoma. Pre coma is the dirty cop Stowe who's lost all regard for the people close to him and his coworkers. He lives only for himself and only to bring down expartner Callaghan Rea. He'd sell his own mother to get the collar. Van Damme gives his best performance. He's really playing an unlikeable character whose judgement has become clouded. He thinks he's doing right trying to do right but loses track of the right and wrong ways to get what he wants. Van Damme is just a mean badass machine in the first half of the film not a man to be crossed at all. When Stowe wakes from his coma having been left for dead by Callaghan he wants to turn his life around while he has to fully recover from his injuries. Here Van Damme is equally good. The film is a real departure for him. He really immerses himself in the role and vanity is so far from his mind here. Van Damme looks outta shape and should do and early on is really made to look dishevelled. Elsewhere Stephen Rea kind of flitters in and out in an extended cameo but he gets to really chew scenery in a great scene at the end when he and Stowe come face to face for the first time since Stowe's resurrection. Rea is simply picking up his paycheque but he gets the one scene to let loose and deliver and he leaves a lasting impression. Selina Giles as Stowe's wife enters the film with a bang! It's not a good one either cause she's not delivering a good performance. However no sooner than Van Damme gets shot in the head she begins delivering a fine performance. It's quite strange in that respect. There's also decent support from Adam Leese and Gary Beadle.The action is short and swift. It's supposed to hit hard and hit fast. They're simple scenes but they pack a punch in a way that The Hard Corps and Second In Command were lacking. Ditto Wake Of Death while supremely violent was a letdown in the action. Here though it's all about the violence. It's efficiently choreographed and edited and it has impact. When people die you know they're dead. Those eagerly awaiting plenty of handto hand will be disappointed it there's only a few quick little flourishes but for this film Van Damme is far better armed with a shotgun than unleashing his kicks. The action isn't meant to be over the top drawn out and excessive. It's about the forceful violence dished out. To see what I mean simply check the end action sequence in Straw Dogs.Simon Fellows does well here as I mentioned and he keeps the film ticking over nicely. Doug Milsome's cinematography is the best in a Van Damme movie for a while now. It looks great and really keeps that dank 70's vibe going. There's also great sound design and Matthew Booth does a good job piecing everything together in the editing suite. A real standout though is the score from Mark Sayfritz a blend of orchestra and synth effortlessly combining. Occasionally there's a real Massive Attack vibe in the music. It's arguably the best score in a Van Damme film and Sayfritz will be a welcome returnee for Van Damme's next film The Shepard.

	schema:reviewBody "OK before I saw the movie I had no idea it would be so different from what Van Damme has done in the past. Guys this movie is completely different from anything he has ever done. The movie is 90  95 drama and 510 action yup it's more of a drama than an action movie and it has a great story.The movie's main character is Anthony Stowe a Narcotics cop who was once partnered with Callahan a man who has since become one of the most important drug dealers in New Orleans and who began his involvement in the drug business during his time as a cop. Stowe still a cop is now after Callahan his former partner. The great thing about this story that is similar to others that we've seen in the past is the fact that we don't get the whole story only parts and pieces of it while the main story of the movie deals with the final part of the cat and mouse game between Stowe and Callahan. The movie looks great in fact with just 3 exceptions BUT these 3 scenes amount to only 15 seconds or around that so they can be easily overlooked.Simon Fellows is clearly a beginner at directing. In Second in Command he tried to create a feeling of revolutionwarchaos through the camera movement but he failed because he overdid it he tried too hard and in the end he made some viewers hate the camera movement and the overall style. Rest assured that he has improved tremendously with Until Death. He does some interesting camera moves that actually improve scenes and which ARE METAPHORS FOR THE STORY. YES people FELLOWS IMPROVES some scenes WITH THE WAY HE DIRECTS. The way the camera is placed or the way the camera moves makes some scenes feel more important bigger and BETTER than they are and enhances their emotional impact. If only Fellows would learn how to do the same for action he would then be a much better director.Van Damme has drastically improved as an actor in a very short time. And with Until Death he hits another one right out of the park he gives a great performance at a level at which others have won Oscars at and I am not joking. Unfortunately this is both good and bad. It's good because he can impress the audience and easily carry the movie and it's bad because EVERYONE else looks like an amateur when compared to him. Stephen Rea is GOOD but he clearly did this movie for the money so does not try very hard. The actress portraying the wife is awful she couldn't deliver any EMOTION any impact along with her lines. Her role was VERY IMPORTANT in the movie and her acting was terrible you can tell she either is an amateur which is not the case or not at all interested in the movie which is what really happened since actress Selina Giles has a long list of acting jobs on her resume. Unfortunately her performance is the weakest of them all and she brings the movie down by quite a lot. It is interesting to see the best actor in the movie Van Damme and the worst actor Selina Giles at the same time on screen.Had UNTIL DEATH had a better actress in the role of THE WIFE a good soundtrack and a more emotional style of direction it could have been a 1010 movie as it is at the moment it's at 8.510.It is a completely new and different role for Van Damme it has small amounts of action compared to his older movies and it is a DRAMA a type of movie that people might not want to see Van Damme in Until Death told me a great story a great dramatic story it showed to me that Van Damme can carry this type of movie and it also gave me a lot of hope for THE SHEPERD provisional title Van Damme's next movie which will be filled with action and which is directed by Isaac Florentine Undisputed 2 and produced by the same people with most of the same important crew behind it.This is why I respect Van Damme he has grown as an actor and has created and put in place all the necessary elements to make quality movies. He has improved himself even if he is a DTV star he keeps in great shape has become a great actor and can still do some cool action although he has evolved away from the action filled extravaganzas of the past which is a good thing. Any new Van Damme movie is guaranteed to be good and interesting and the very nice fact is that his fans are disappointed when his movies fail to be GREAT and are JUST GOOD as was the case with Second In Command.Also keep in mind that I saw an edited version so the DVD might have more scenes more action a tiny little bit more a better soundtrack and an even better visual quality as I saw the movie on TV in a TV format and aspect ratio. The DVD version could be drastically better but even if it isn't this is still a movie I would recommend to anyone who loves a great drama a great COP drama and some cool action from a classic star of the genre who has reinvented himself and who gave his best acting performance a performance that I dare say is great by ANY standards.8.510 on any scale".

He does and continues in my opinion to prove that he is better then the lowquality DTV movies that he has been unfortunately starring in for the past 7 years. Due to that fact if this movie were made as a theatrical release with better funding and better actors surrounding our star it would be amazing. Thanks to Van Damme and the director for at least trying to make this movie look the best it could this movie is very good. Some fans may be disappointed with the lack of martial arts but this movie doesn't call for it.

	schema:reviewBody "In New Orleans the abusive narcotic detective Anthony Stowe JeanClaude Van Damme is a dirty cop addicted in heroin and booze hated by his colleagues and divorcing from his wife Valerie Selina Giles. While trying to arrest his former partner and drug lord Gabriel Callaghan Stephen Rea the mission fails two undercover officers are killed and the drug the money and the monitoring tapes vanish. Later Tony is shot by a criminal in the head and miraculously does not die. After months in coma he wakes up trying to fix the errors of his past life.After many bad movies Jean Claude VanDamme finally makes a very good film. His character is very well developed in a story that uses clichs but is also interesting full of action and without a final redemption with a happy end. When the viewer sees this movie wait for the credits because there is an important footage of the missing surveillance tapes disclosing what happened in the house and how the officers were killed. I hope this movie be a milestone and a second chance in the career of Van Damme and like his character and Phoenix he raises from the ashes to please his fans. My vote is seven.Title Brazil At a Morte Until the Death".

While trying to arrest his former partner and drug lord Gabriel Callaghan Stephen Rea the mission fails two undercover officers are killed and the drug the money and the monitoring tapes vanish. Later Tony is shot by a criminal in the head and miraculously does not die. After months in coma he wakes up trying to fix the errors of his past life.After many bad movies Jean Claude VanDamme finally makes a very good film. His character is very well developed in a story that uses clichs but is also interesting full of action and without a final redemption with a happy end. When the viewer sees this movie wait for the credits because there is an important footage of the missing surveillance tapes disclosing what happened in the house and how the officers were killed. I hope this movie be a milestone and a second chance in the career of Van Damme and like his character and Phoenix he raises from the ashes to please his fans. My vote is seven.Title Brazil At a Morte Until the Death";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the greatest Van Damme movie i have seen in years. This is probably his best STV effort right next to In Hell. There is no classic Van Damme martial arts but the acting is insane! Def the best acting of his career. The last couple Van Damme movies sucked SIC  Hard Corps. so i had low expectations. But WOW...was i surprised at how well this movie was made compared to his recent crappy STV films. Seeing Van Damme play a totally different character was entertaining and reminded me of why i love Van Damme flicks so much. I lost faith in him after Wake of Death but after watching this and having his next film be a martial arts packed film costarring Scott Atkins The Shepard i have total faith in Van Damme once again. The acting is great the plot is new for Van Damme the action is better than expected no martial arts though and Van Damme looks awesome. The editing is great the direction is good and luckily the film does not feel cheesy or STVlike. Emotional film.It is a must see for Van Damme fans. You will be surprised by it.And it is a MILLION times better than anything Seagal has done STV.".

Stephen Rea is also playing his usual confusing and mean character who likes to screw up people's lives just like in Fear Dot Com which was a stupid movie unlike this one.

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of Jean Claude Van Damme since i saw him for the fist time in Black Eagle. I have always considered Jean Claude Van Damme as a great physical actor. His movement when in action or his body language out of action is unique and of a high quality. However as much as i am ashamed to say being a dedicated fan and all i have always held a view of his acting as if it is a pointless pretend. I use the word pretend because its what an amateur performer would use of how to be a character. I watched Knock Off and to be honest the title says it all i started to loose faith in my hero my god. To think i call my self a true fan i felt like Jeasus when he had been persuaded by the devil to jump off a cliff i had sinned. I decided that no matter how bad the acting became i will always watch any of Jean Claude Van Damme films and love them so i bought legionnaire and sat back and just watched. What i couldn't stop thinking about was the end of the film it was so powerful and such a small part of the film. I was shell shocked but it was still not enough for me to change my mind but it certainly opened my mind. The following films that he brought out put me at ease again Legionaire was just a glitch nothing had changed especially after seeing him as Eddie Lomax lol he was a good character though. Then for me Jean Claude Van Damme disappeared for a bit and all of a sudden replicant hits our screens. It was alright a bit different but still nothing to change my original thought of him. The order came out and i loved it he was doing one of his usual funfree characters he was back but the films he brought out next i never expected this result. I mean the films was slow especially In Hell not a lot happened but that Legionaire ending was all coming back to me were we all just about to witness a change in the winds or will it be just another glitch as i stupidly call these affects of Jean Claude's acting. In derailed J.C. showed a great love and care for his family that must be true in reality for it was too strong and moving. I couldn't wait for the next film i was literally on the edge of my seat and then it happened Wake Of Death. its a very dark and intense film but worth while. Jean Claude Van Damme was expressing himself in such a passionate way yet aggressive in manner. this was not a glitch this was acting i disregard my view of pointless however i keep the pretend as i need to see more of Van Damme in this way. Now the next two films Second In Command and The Hard Corps. they were not as powerful as the last few however they had great moments one of which ill share with you. the scene when J.C. pins the actor William Tapley up against the wall in Second In Command that was good. Now i don't know about you i am amazed about Until Death my view of J.C. being a pretend actor was blown out of the water he becomes the character which is something the best actors in Hollywood struggle to do today. Jean Claude Van Damme has done a 360 split kick and knocked us all on our bums and put us on the edge of our seats enjoy this film the acting is mental it is amazing have some Van Damage!!!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched Until Death. Oh my God it's a lot better than I expected!!! I was a bit scared because Simon Fellows is the director but at last it turned out to be a false alarm. What can I say about this good movie? Van Damme's best acting of all his career. He can be proud of himself. Stephen Rea is there just because our Belgian hero needs a villain to fight with. Fight here is a metaphor 'cause Van Damme doesn't almost use his fists or his legs in this one if he did he would destroy the tone of the whole plot. Selina Giles overacts in some scenes. When she is at a party with her new lover she smiles as if she was thinking oh dear this guy is so disgusting which I think wasn't what the director really meant. The prostitute... she is just in the movie to prove that Anthony Stowe is a despicable scumbag. She's hot but nothing else. Adam Leese plays a good role. He's convincing as an honest cop and as a dirty one a plot twist we find out in the climax. He's a hypocrite accusing Stowe of being a bad cop when he is in fact Callahan's man in the police force. I don't really know what to think about the waitress. What's her actual relationship with Stowe? It doesn't seem to be any kind of romantic well if there is something romantic in Stowe before he's shot in the head affair. This takes me to the PLOT HOLES. First of all I'd like to say something that I consider important. There've been some reviews in this board complaining about the holes in this film. Actually I believe all the flaws have to do with the distributors' wish to cut some of the sequences to make this movie shorter. The reason? Maybe they think a Van Damme movie is too long if it lasts more than 90 minutes. If you pay attention to the promo trailer that has been on the net for several months some dialogs and scenes are missing in the released version. What a mistake!!! This editing may be to blame for 1 The unexplained relationship between Stowe and Chad Mansen. Maybe the kid attends Valerie's school? Did the cop and the teenager know each other before their first meeting in the film? 2 The unbelievable return of Valerie to Stowe I can't believe a couple of compliments did the job 3 Why does Jimmy ask Stowe Remember me? when they meet at the diner in the shooting scene? I can't remember seeing Jimmy earlier in the film. 4 Why is Stowe so obsessed with Callahan? Did Valerie meet Callahan when the two cops were partners? 5 At the final shooting scene is Van Huffel trying to shoot Stowe or the thug behind him? 6 What's up with the waitress? Does she betray Anthony 'cause she works for Callahan? 'Cause she hates Stowe? 'Cause she is threatened by Callahan? 'Cause she's paid for? When she goes to the bathroom is her face one of repentance for what she's doing? I'd like to finish with a quote from the movie. Stowe to Callahan I was never a bad cop Gabriel. The best Van Damme movie actinglike. The lack of martial arts is not important. Superb cop drama. I hope Van Damme keeps on like this. Members of the board take care and don't give up on our Belgian hero.".

Don't get me wrong i love his previous action movies and they made him known in the world of movies but this is such a different and unexpected type of movie from Van Damme and a great effort at that. There was nothing wrong with the movie and it was 70 drama and 30 action which in this case worked very well. Props to Van Damme for this movie. Definitely wasn't an Oscar performance but who watches Van Damme movies for Oscar performances? Watch it as a middle of your list of movies to rent.".

Hopefully some of these reviews will help those who have any reservations about seeing Van Damme's films give it a look. Yesterday when I rented it even the Blockbuster manager quipped Let me know if that one's any good. I used to like Van Damme but have been disappointed in a lot of his films. I am happy to say that this movie is definitely not a disappointment.UNTIL DEATH is not a modern day chopsocky muscle man movie. It is an intense violent character driven copcrime thriller. Van Damme is no longer the pretty boy muscle head of Bloodsport. In fact the first time his character appeared on screen in this one the person sitting next to me blurted out He looks like sht! Yes he does. His complexion is pasty pale haggard and sweaty but if you watch the movie there's a reason for this makeup. His character is not your typical television show narcotics agent. This officer is a drug addict a womanizer and a turncoat. He's hated alike by pushers dealers prostitutes his estranged wife and even his fellow officers. His life is a mess and his face and behavior show it. Still he was a good cop at one time and as the film progresses he is given numerous chances at redemption.Van Damme is moving more and more away from making dumb action hero movies where his muscle man persona gets beat up and then miraculously wins fights later simply by yelling Come on! and making mad faces. Even though his recent movies are dismissed by some immediately because they are straight to DVD fare this is exactly why his movies have been progressing. He has a strong fan base and can still guarantee certain returns for his producers. At the same time since less money is on the line as far as box office returns he can experiment with movies that have more depth and artistic merit. If you liked WAKE OF DEATH then UNTIL DEATH will be right up your alley. I personally think it's his best film since that one. To give you a gage on the types of Van Damme movies I like I rank UNTIL DEATH WAKE OF DEATH MAXIMUM RISK UNIVERSAL SOLDIER and DEATH WARRANT up at the top.".

I don't understand why the original Hong Kong flick is mentioned nowhere in the credits but nearly every single scene and plot element and much of the dialog comes directly from the Hong Kong film. Until Death wasn't bad but the problem is that JeanClaude Van Damme isn't half the actor that Lau Ching Wan the star of the original is and director Stephen Fellows is no Johnny To. The love story between the recuperating police officer and his pregnant wife is handled much more effectively in the original. I highly recommend that anyone who enjoyed Until Death and can tolerate watching movies with English subtitles seek out the original version which was released last year on DVD in Hong Kong and can purchased from places like Ebay. It's a much better movie.".

Though what is left from those films in my memory is the respect and admiration the kid I was.If you are an actionthriller fan then you probably do not mind watching a Bmovie just for the action and the fighting. In that case Until Death may not be your favorite of the year. Until Death shifts track from the fast super martial arts moves such as in his films Double Impact and Lionheart. Instead this film has more dialogue more talking and still but less fights. Most of the fighting is the protagonist's Stow struggling to get his life back which is not that apparent until later in the film. Although there is more words and somewhat workedon dialogue Van Damme's English pronunciation did not develop much.Until Death seems like it wants to be counted as a major production but it does not quite reach there. The film simply is about a cop who may or may not be bad who needs straighten out his life and thus he must face the ruthless antagonist Callahan so very close to messing with Dirty Harry here played by Gary Beadle. Unfortunately the story line does not hold and it reveals itself more than it should.The editing and the scene shifts as time elapsing or progression is a little gore. I think it is more disturbing than being helpful with plot tracings. Therefore sitting down and watching the film is not most pleasant for me that is.Van Damme looks older than he ever was of course but the makeup did fine with hiding things. The lighting was fine the camera angels were fine. Besides Van Damme and Gary Beadle the cast was not an Academy Award selection however each played hisher part well enough.The time of early 2000 was an amazing era for JeanClaude Van Damme. He produces two good films In Hell and Wake of Death. Amazingly I did like In Hell much more than any Van Damme movie. It offered some serious depth and great cinematography. Wake of Death was not a bad film yet not superb but it offered more action and fights. I think that In Hell is what made me think that the level of Van Damme films has progressed unfortunately however Until Death only brought Van Damme and his movies back to the gallows where they belong. The only reason is I am awarding this film four stars is for effort.".

Most of them are simple revenge stories with Jean losing a loved one or several and then relentlessly killing everybody until he gets to the big bad guy.This movie is a different kind of Van Damme vehicle. At the risk of sounding ridiculous he gives a subtle performance here even if it is yet another revenge movie. As a broken down cop addicted to booze heroin and sex he's just not the hero. In real life Van Damme has had problems with drugs and his face is now aged and somewhat tiredlooking.There isn't as much physical action martial arts as you would expect but there is significant gun play.While Until Death is a little too long very common these days it's a revelation to watch Van Damme actually act. At a few points you still get that feeling that he's overreaching his abilities as an actor but for the most part his work in this movie is actually pretty impressive. I for one would love to see someone put him in a real A list movie playing a character role I really think he could pull it off after watching this one.New Orleans is practically a character itself in this one with practically every cop corrupted in one way or another. On a side note they should have gotten another actress to play his estranged wife as the actress here has marginal talent at best.

	schema:headline " I don't believe it. Van Damme actually can act!";
	schema:reviewBody "I really was pleasantly surprised by this little movie. I guess most of you know the plot already. Van Damme is a pretty good but sadly heroin addicted cop. His wife is gonna leave him. Everything is turning south. Then he get's shot and falls in a coma for 6 month. Then he awakens and rebuilds his life. Sadly his old nemesis hasn't let go. So it all comes to the inevitable showdown. What sounds like the plot to a nice little action movie is actually more a dramathriller than just a simple action movie. To be exact there isn't really that much action in the movie. Is it still worth watching? Definitely. Especially because Van Damme really delivered in this movie. Some of the other cast sadly seem a bit lost during the whole thing. Aside from that the movie is really compelling and you can really get into it. It's a real departure from the regular JCVD movies. The movie has a few negative aspects too sadly. First and foremost the production value seems really low. The movie cost about 15 Million but actually looks even cheaper. It really shows that most if it was filmed in Bulgaria. Many people have complained about the end of the movie. I saw the European version which had the dramatic ending not the mega happy ending. So I was pleasantly surprised that the ending even made me feel something. Final words If you are looking for a cheap action movie you better go with a recent Steven Seagal Film. This one is actually a compelling Drama with action Elements. Definitely worth watching.".

All the other actors do their best or at least not their worst! I could not stay myself from watching the through!!! Maybe it's not a McTiernan film and maybe not original but somehow it seems to work! And we don't see van damme as a martial arts fighting machine but as a normal cop with a bad history walking around with melancholic guiltridden face. Hey  what a welcome change !!

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Curtiz directed this largescale western.  Colour is used to great effect in this early experiment with the new process.  For the first half of the film while characters and storyline are being established the Technicolor palette is restrained keeping mostly to browns and ochres.  As Errol Flynn's character Wade Hatton emerges as the hero colour begins to reinforce meaning.  Wade wears a succession of impressive shirts prussian blue plum.  Others wear plaid but Wade's shirts are each of a single hue emphasising his monolithic moral certainty.  Wade is a bigger man than the others and he wears a bigger hat.Dodge is a wild cattle town.  The railhead for transport back to the 'civilised' United States it is the point to which Texan cattle are driven. The interface of rail and hoof is significant.  When the cowpokes hit town after weeks on the trail they have a strong inclination to kick up their heels and bulging pay packets with which to do it.  There is no effective law in Dodge and gunfights are commonplace.  Powerful cattle dealers like Jeff Surrett Bruce Cabot cheat the merchants with impunity.  Dodge City needs a strong principled man if it is to change its lawless ways.The film's opening image is a train hurtling westward at full throttle a symbol of the burgeoning industrial strength of the USA and of the Manifest Destiny which is already turning America's energies towards the Pacific and obliterating the frontier.  We see the train slicing across the magnificent Kansas plains and 'racing' the stagecoach.  Machines are supplanting horses and the train wins the race.Olivia de Havilland is at her wideeyed prettiest as Abbie Erving the young woman who treks north with the cattle and eventually falls in love with the handsome sherriff.  Flynn is an aussie actor playing an Irishman in Kansas and both he and de Havilland are terrific as the romantic leads.  A young Ann Sheridan plays Ruby the showgirl Alan Hale is Rusty the abstemious cowhand and Ward Bond is Taylor the minor baddie.  Victor Jory has fun playing Yancey the mean ornery villain with the straggly beard.Wade Hatton personifies the American Way.  An immigrant who has done well for himself by dint of hard work sharp intelligence and plenty of talent he is fearless when it comes to protecting the weak or righting wrongs.  When the call comes to pin on a badge and restore law and order to Dodge City he doesn't hesitate.  Wade stands up to an angry lynch mob even though the 'victim' is a worthless crook.A liberal alliance between the new sherriff and the town's newspaper proposes to bring down the evil Surrett.  The newspaper's office has a portrait of Abe Lincoln on the wall.  Appropriately a killer is brought to justice because his hand is stained with indelible printer's ink  serving notice on all bad guys that the Press will always be there to expose wrongdoing.The clowning is well done.  Watch for the cowpoke who has his head driven against a post or Flynn athletically tripping falling and being hit in the back by a swing door.  Rusty preaches temperance but is gradually overcome by the tempting sounds of the saloon punchup.Wade's cleanup policy is depicted skilfully in the scene where a newspaper headline dissolves into the arrival of peaceful settlers by train showing us neatly how Dodge is being tamed.Verdict  A goodnatured western with appealing performances by Flynn and de Havilland.".

Based around the story of Wyatt Earp Michael Curtiz's expensively assembled film charms as much today as it did to audiences back in 1939. All the genre staples are holding the piece together dastardly villains pretty gals wagon train cattle drive iron horse Civil War shoot outs fist fights and of course an heroic Sheriff. All neatly folded by the astute and impressive Curtiz. Aided by Sol Polito's fluid Technicolor enhanced photography and Max Steiner's breezy score Curtiz's set pieces shine as much as they enthral. A burning runaway train and the finest saloon brawl in cinema are the stand outs but there are many other high points on which to hang the hat of praise.Very much a male dominated film it's with the ladies that Dodge City fails to reach greater heights. Olivia de Havilland who is always a feast for the eyes in Technicolor disliked her role as Abbie Irving and it's not hard to see why. There is not much for her to get her teeth into it's a simple role that demands nothing other than saying the lines and to look pretty. Ann Sheridan as Ruby Gilman gets the more sparky role but she sadly doesn't get that much screen time. Which is a shame because what little there is of Sheridan is really rather great.Those problems aside it's with the guys that Dodge City is rightly remembered. Flynn attacks the role of Hatton with gusto and a glint in his eye. When he straps on the Sheriff badge for the first time it's akin to Clark Kent shredding his suit to become Superman. Yes it's that exciting. Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are growly and great villains while comedy relief comes in the fine form of sidekickers Alan Hale and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams. Dodge City sets out to entertain and entertain it does. In a year that saw other notable and lauded Westerns also released Stagecoach Jesse James and Destry Rides Again give credit where credit is due Dodge City deserves its place amongst those offerings. Most assuredly so as well. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Olivia de Havilland is really attractive here fresh faced and brunette with big dark eyes. She looks so thoroughly American. Any normal man would want to throw himself at her feet show her his bankbook and genealogical tree and beg her to marry him. Marry  not simply cohabit because she's not that kind of girl. It's strange too that she look like an ex prom queen when in fact she was born in where Tokyo? And into a famous British family responsible for the design of the superb DeHavilland Mosquito of World War Two fame. Errol Flynn came from a professional family too. His father was a marine biologist and a professor in Tasmania. But you'd never know it from Flynn's personal history. His autobiography My Wicked Wicked Ways is full of humorous anecdotes although the best revelations must have been edited out.Eg. he owned a house on Mulholland Drive with a glass ceiling in the guest bedroom so that he and his friends could creep into the attic and laugh at the goings on. He's an Irishman here with a brawling and rebellious past. It was the last movie in which they tried to explain his Brit accent to the audience.The rest of the cast will look familiar to any Warners aficionado  Frank McHugh Ward Bond Alan Hale Big Boy Williams. There is a great fight scene outrageously overdone resulting in the near total destruction of a barnlike saloon. The brawlers smash through the wall into the meeting of the Lady's Temperance Society next door. And nobody even gets a bloody nose no matter how many chairs have been smashed over his head. It isn't as comic as the saloon fight in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon but it's a big one and it IS funny.The movie features Frank McHugh as an honest and courageous newspaper editor who is about to expose the chief heavy who is by the way a complete stereotype with not a decent bone in his body. Victor Jory a slimy henchman comes into the office threatens McHugh and smashes him across the face with a small heavy whip. I wonder if Ford saw this before making The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence. Come to think of it before the fight scene some exUnion soldiers begin singing Marching Through Georgia which annoys the Confederate veterans who strike up Dixie. The two groups face off and sing at one another. The same sort of competition reappears in Casablanca under the same director Michael Curtiz.Flynn wears a broadbrimmed flattopped cowboy hat. This must have been a liminal period for cowboy hats. Before then cowboy hats were huge and round topped with a slight crease down the middle. Tom Mix wore such a hat in the 20s and John Wayne made a couple of Gower Gulch masterpieces wearing a fiftygallon corker. Ten years after Dodge City cowboy hats came to resemble ordinary fedoras with smaller brims sometimes twisted upward in odd ways like a vaudeville comic's. A little bit of hat iconography there.The plot's entirely conventional. The good guys versus the bad guys with nothing in between. Well  that's how the universe is really put together isn't it? Oh how I hate Alpha Centauri.One bothersome thing. A careful historiographical search reveals that the cast of characters in this movie notwithstanding absolutely no cowboy has ever been named Wade Matt Cole or Yancey. The historical record shows no evidence of the use of such names and goes out of its way to emphatically deny their existence in the Old West. It is also an established historical fact that the most common name among cowboys was Montmorency. Hadn't seen this for years but was able to relax and get a kick out of it.".

This one has a  clean up the town storyline plenty of action but perhaps too much comedy given the course of the plot.  For the most part it's a typical product of Warner Brothers' golden era with Flynn's usual supporting cast including Olivia de Havilland Alan Hale and Guinn Williams.The film does have one very interesting sequence especially in light of future movie history.  In a saloon scene about halfway through a group of cowboys with northern roots or at least Union sympathies start singing Marching Through Georgia.  Not to be outdone another group led by Williams begins to sing  Dixie.  Before long punches are thrown and a mammoth brawl breaks out. Sound familiar?  Except for the fight the scene resembles the song duel in Casablanca made at Warners three years later.  Although the screen writers aren't the same I have to think this was the inspiration for the battle between Wacht am Rhein and Les Marseilles.".

Ann Sheridan has a cameo role as the saloon singer girlfriend of Bruce Cabot the main villain of the piece. All of it is photographed in early technicolor that must have been a lot better than current video prints would have us believe. Some of the outdoor scenes are fine but the interiors have a muddy look. Max Steiner has provided a lusty background score for this very robust entertainment that will probably please fans of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havillandbut it is definitely not their best venture together. Their main love scene while on an outdoor horseback ride in the country is charmingly doneclearly their chemistry made them an ideal screen team. As usual all of the proceedings are directed with gusto by Michael Curtiz. One of the comedy highlights features Alan Hale who finds himself as the only male attending a women's temperance meetingbefore the screen's wildest saloon fight breaks out next door. Fair entertainment but not as solid as it could have been. Compare the color photography to another Flynn western 'San Antonio' seven years laterand observe the vast improvement in technicolor photography. Needs restoration for future video prints.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a terrific Hollywood Western that surprisingly stars the Tasmanian Errol Flynn. When I think of Western heroes I generally DON'T think about them starring someone from Down Under but this really wasn't a problem. Flynn was just fine.For me part of the reason the film worked was its marvelous supporting cast. My favorite of Flynn's leading ladies Olivia DeHavilland is back and Flynn gets TWO sidekicksAlan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams. Frank McHugh plays a rather restrained for McHugh supporting role as a newspaper manin probably one of his best performances. Bruce Cabot plays an excellent bad guy and there are many many more Warner regulars that make this a starstudded and familiar type film. Oddly you practically don't even notice Ann Sheridan despite her getting fourth billingshe sings nicely enough but doesn't have much to do in the film. In addition to all the stars you can really tell Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops because they secured the directorial services of a Hollywood Heavyweight Michael Curtiz AND they filmed the movie in Technicolora relatively rare thing for 1939.The plot involves the widespread lawlessness that come to dominate life in this cattle town. When Flynn and his two buddies return to the town after a long absence they are shocked to see that cattle tycoon Cabot has practically turned the town into his own private hellhole. The citizens live in terror and convince Flynn to become their new sheriff. There is so much more to the plot than thatincluding a subplot involving Miss DeHavilland and her brother. But finding out how this all unfolds is something best left to you.By the way the very end of the film is one of the few instances where they obviously set it up for a sequel. Flynn gets a telegram after he cleans up Dodge City begging him to now do the same for Virginia City and he and Olivia and his friends all announce their intentions to head there. However despite bringing back most of the exact same cast in the movie VIRGINIA CITY only one year later is really isn't a sequel at alljust the same formula rearranged quite a bit! Miss DeHavilland is inexplicably absent and this time Errol and his pals are not Confederate war veterans but secret agents working for the dang Yankees!! It's really a shame it wasn't a sequel as this followup film could have been a lot better if it had taken that route as its predecessor.Finally now that I think about it I did have one very very minor quibble with the film. When I saw the child actor Bobs Watson in the film as Harry Cole I figured correctly that he was dead meat. That's because this cute actor seemed to die in almost every film I've seen him in. His death scene in BOYS TOWN is almost legendary and he was also the cute little goner in ON BORROWED TIMEit seems his specialty was dying on film! So when I see him I know not to care much about him or I'll just have my heart broken in the end!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a real western with all of the needed ingredients in it but added to that are several Michael Curtiz elements that make the movie entertaining and even somewhat adventurous though its obviously not your average normal Errol FlynnMichael Curtiz swashbuckling type of movie.Westerns from the 30's and '40's were still much different than the later spaghettiwesterns. They were made more entertaining and had a completely different style. Most '40's westerns are even known to have a filmnoir kind of atmosphere and feeling all over it. And despite being also always formulaic they yet always felt like something new and original. This movie also feels totally fresh even though it features all of the formulaic elements such as a saloonfight cattledriving cardplaying a hero who becomes sheriff scruffy looking villains and stuff like that. The movie itself is extremely black and white and moralistic in which bad is extremely bad and good is extremely good. If this movie was being made in the '60's or '70's people would had uses laughed it off probably.For the first 50 minutes absolutely nothing notable happens in the movie. It's not that the movie is boring to watch or without pace but it just aren't the most interesting and compelling 50 minutes of cinema. However when the movie starts to take form and Errol Flynn gets his sheriffbadge the movie becomes interesting and also totally likable to watch. The movie gets even more pace and the action starts to hit the screen. It's the last hour of the movie that makes you realize that this is a real Michael Curtiz movie you're watching! Some of his trademark directing elements start to appear such as the fantastic use of shadows!Errol Flynn looks surprisingly in his element in the western genre. The role is more demanding than his usual swashbuckling type of role and he already sort of shows in this movie that he also knew how to act more seriously. He certainly doesn't look silly with a cowboy hat on! But yet he's above all of course still an hero in this movie who does everything right everyone respects and admire and whose clothes never get dirty. What I always like about Olivia de Havilland in her early movies is that despite being always the dame in distress she yet is a strong and independent character. The love story yet again between the two doesn't feel like its slowing done the movie or distracts from the mainplot. It's well done and makes sure that it's never featured too prominently into the movie but it also at the same time doesn't make a redundant impression.The movie itself is good and big looking. They obviously had some money for making this movie. It's shot in color which provides the movie with some nice looking images. It also definitely makes sure that this movie doesn't feel as much outdated as with many other '30's and '40's black  white westerns is the case. The movie has some nice action moments but you shouldn't watch this movie expecting big and spectacular action. It's more a movie that relies on its script and the actors playing in it. The musical score by Max Steiner is also quite good. It's a well made and constructed movie that I feel deserves some more recognition.It's not Michael Curtiz' only directed western but it's definitely his best known and most appreciated one. He made a total of 10 westerns in his career of which 2 more with Errol Flynn starring in it 3 more with Olivia de Havilland and even 1 with John Wayne in it! A good and quality movie that's very well worth watching even if you're not familiar with the work of Errol Flynn or Michael Curtiz or are not at home in the '30's'40's western type of movie.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Of course this is one of those films where the leadingman gets his girl.This is one of the early western films to be shot in Technicolor's and was one of several TCM showed recently in their tribute to films starring Flynn and de Haviland. I guess younger watchers haven't seen this film....I didn't even know it existed.It's importance is that after this film Ms. de Haviland began to let it be known she was very unhappy with the roles the studio was giving her. EVEREYONE was campaigning to appear in Gone with the Wind that same year  Ms. de Haviland knew where to go  right up to the boss' wife. She got the role she wanted Melanie and finally got the opportunity to show what a great actress she was.Director Michael Curtiz put scriptor Robert Buckner's story in an easy tofollow movie  these early films are a joy to watch simply because they have just this quality. I recommend for everyone.".

Indeed everyone from Vin Diesel to Jason Statham seems to take a page out of his book and watching Flynn's films only makes you appreciate even more his talent.Here Flynn takes charge in a Western as sheriff of a seedy cattle town in dusty Kansas as he attempts to overthrow the corrupt cattle buyers that also run the town of Dodge City. At his side are his friends from the cattle drive Rusty Alan Hale and Tex Guinn Williams. Bruce Cabot is good as the antagonist Jeff Surett but these kind of films are thin on plot and strong on lavish sets costumes and romance.To provide that romance we have the dashing Sheriff Wade Hatton and the lovely but stubborn Abbie Irving played by the remarkably warm and beautiful Olivia de Havilland. She and Flynn made 9 films together and it is obvious that they had chemistry as well as the ability to give us characters of people that we care about and want to see together. There may never be another movie couple like they. As for weaknesses the story lags a bit in the middle but it can be forgotten after watching an exciting climax featuring Flynn shooting it out on a burning train.This film reminded me a lot of My Darling Clementine the John Ford film from a few years later starring Henry Fonda. This isn't as strong but it's more fun and a joyous ride all the way through. Flynn shows here what a charismatic and charming actor he was and it is a shame there will never be another like him.".

	schema:headline " The town that knew no ethics but cash and killing";
	schema:reviewBody "He'd already been a pirate and an outlaw for director Michael Curtiz but in 1939 Errol Flynn was cast in the rather unexpected role of sheriff Wade Hatton in Dodge City part of the western boom of 1939.Dodge City is home to practically every western genre clich in existence  cattle drives covered wagons lynch mobs bar brawls and so on. It's been remarked that at the time these weren't clichs they were fresh ideas. But that would be to forget pictures such as The Big Trail 1931 The Plainsman 1936 not to mention a host of silent westerns in which all these typical goings on were well established. This isn't a criticism  after all genres are built on clichs and there's no shame in that. Dodge City merely appears to have been intended as a kind of rough homage to the western rather than trying to take the genre anywhere new. These FlynnDe HavillandCurtiz pictures were never meant to be anything more than simple fun. If you're casting Errol Flynn in his first western after audiences have accepted him as Robin Hood and Captain Blood you're not going to make something like Stagecoach.Having said all that in spite of its lack of depth Dodge City truly is a quintessential western in that its underlying theme is the most common idea that unites virtually every western ever made  the friction between the old and the new and the forging of the American civilization. This is set up in the very first scene in which a stagecoach and a steam train try to race each other. As the picture progresses the point is made that the price of progress is lawlessness and that the taming of the wilderness must be coupled with justice education and order.Dodge City also represents the high point or should that be low point? of Hays Code moralism in the western. At this time Hollywood was desperate to ensure the outlaws remained villains and that no crime went without punishment and this is one of the strongest statements of that. In his struggle to clean up the frontier town Flynn is virtually a puritan not to mention a strict authoritarian. The lines of good and evil are as stark as in any of his earlier adventures. The trouble is the western genre lacks the right feel that makes such fairytale ethics enjoyable. You can accept the hissable villain and dashing perfect hero in an overthetop swashbuckler movie but in the old west setting they don't seem to work so well.Errol Flynn would later play some great roles in westerns for example They Died with Their Boots On but here he is really just playing Robin Hood in a Stetson and only the vaguest attempt at an American accent although like Captain Blood he's supposed to be an Irishman here making his plummy English tones even more bizarre. Dodge City also features one of the weaker Alan Hale sidekick roles. He's a bit too much of a bumbling oaf for the majority of the picture then suddenly becomes incredibly competent and authoritative out of the blue for action scenes. There are no real standout performances and even great character actors like Henry Travers and Victor Jory are underused here.Still the Michael Curtiz mark of quality is definitely here. The big crowd shots are perfectly constructed as always. However the most breathtaking landscape shots appear to come from matt paintings and Curtiz doesn't handle the wide open spaces of the west particularly well. For me the only real standout moment is a massive barroom brawl with dozens of participants. Curtiz was great at handling these large scale action scenes but none of the smaller standoffs really get off the ground.Dodge City is a certainly watchable film but there are far better westerns from this period not to mention far better Errol Flynn films.".

	onyx:emotionText "He'd already been a pirate and an outlaw for director Michael Curtiz but in 1939 Errol Flynn was cast in the rather unexpected role of sheriff Wade Hatton in Dodge City part of the western boom of 1939.Dodge City is home to practically every western genre clich in existence  cattle drives covered wagons lynch mobs bar brawls and so on. It's been remarked that at the time these weren't clichs they were fresh ideas. But that would be to forget pictures such as The Big Trail 1931 The Plainsman 1936 not to mention a host of silent westerns in which all these typical goings on were well established. This isn't a criticism  after all genres are built on clichs and there's no shame in that. Dodge City merely appears to have been intended as a kind of rough homage to the western rather than trying to take the genre anywhere new. These FlynnDe HavillandCurtiz pictures were never meant to be anything more than simple fun. If you're casting Errol Flynn in his first western after audiences have accepted him as Robin Hood and Captain Blood you're not going to make something like Stagecoach.Having said all that in spite of its lack of depth Dodge City truly is a quintessential western in that its underlying theme is the most common idea that unites virtually every western ever made  the friction between the old and the new and the forging of the American civilization. This is set up in the very first scene in which a stagecoach and a steam train try to race each other. As the picture progresses the point is made that the price of progress is lawlessness and that the taming of the wilderness must be coupled with justice education and order.Dodge City also represents the high point or should that be low point? of Hays Code moralism in the western. At this time Hollywood was desperate to ensure the outlaws remained villains and that no crime went without punishment and this is one of the strongest statements of that. In his struggle to clean up the frontier town Flynn is virtually a puritan not to mention a strict authoritarian. The lines of good and evil are as stark as in any of his earlier adventures. The trouble is the western genre lacks the right feel that makes such fairytale ethics enjoyable. You can accept the hissable villain and dashing perfect hero in an overthetop swashbuckler movie but in the old west setting they don't seem to work so well.Errol Flynn would later play some great roles in westerns for example They Died with Their Boots On but here he is really just playing Robin Hood in a Stetson and only the vaguest attempt at an American accent although like Captain Blood he's supposed to be an Irishman here making his plummy English tones even more bizarre. Dodge City also features one of the weaker Alan Hale sidekick roles. He's a bit too much of a bumbling oaf for the majority of the picture then suddenly becomes incredibly competent and authoritative out of the blue for action scenes. There are no real standout performances and even great character actors like Henry Travers and Victor Jory are underused here.Still the Michael Curtiz mark of quality is definitely here. The big crowd shots are perfectly constructed as always. However the most breathtaking landscape shots appear to come from matt paintings and Curtiz doesn't handle the wide open spaces of the west particularly well. For me the only real standout moment is a massive barroom brawl with dozens of participants. Curtiz was great at handling these large scale action scenes but none of the smaller standoffs really get off the ground.Dodge City is a certainly watchable film but there are far better westerns from this period not to mention far better Errol Flynn films.";

	schema:headline " One of the Most Entertaining of All Westerns";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Dodge City is loosely based on the early career of Wyatt Earp the main character here called Wade Hatton is an Irishman who has served as an officer with the British Army in India taken part in a revolution in Cuba and fought with the Confederates during the American Civil War. That apart from the Civil War part might not seem like the typical curriculum vitae of a Wild West sheriff but Errol Flynn's inability to put on a convincing American accent was presumably the reason why this particular sheriff could not be portrayed as an American. In fact Flynn's accent does not seem very Irish either he sounds more like an upperclass English gentleman but the producers evidently thought that linguistic accuracy was less important in the context of the British Isles.The plot is one that later became something of a clich in the Western so much so that Mel Brooks chose to satirise it in Blazing Saddles the one about the stranger in town who leads the townsfolk in their fight against a gang of villains. At the time the film is set Dodge City was the West's leading cattle town the main rail depot for shipping cattle back to the East and Hatton is the leader of a group of cowboys who brings a herd into town. When he gets there he finds that the town is under the heel of a ruthless cattle baron named Jeff Surrett a man whose hired thugs will not hesitate to kill anyone who crosses him or even anyone to whom he owes money that he does not want to pay. There is nobody with the guts to stand up to Surrett or for that matter with the legal authority to do so the town's last Sheriff having been kidnapped and run out of town by Surrett's men. The people see Hatton as brave and honest and want him to accept office as their new Sheriff he is at first reluctant to do so but eventually accepts the challenge after a young child is killed in a brawl. The rest of the film tells of his fight to bring law and order to the town.Although the film deals with the serious themes of murder violence and law enforcement it is surprisingly light in tone. There is a good deal of comic relief such as the subplot about Hatton's harddrinking friend Rusty who finds himself getting involved as the only male member of an otherwise allfemale temperance movement and the singing duel between Confederates and Unionists which leads into the famous barroom brawl scene a scene which has been imitated in numerous Westerns ever since and even in nonWesterns such as Brannigan a film set in London. Michael Curtiz was to repeat the idea of a singing duel a few years later in Casablanca. By today's standards it is rather surprising that the Southerners are seen as the heroes and the Union cause identified with Surrett and the villains but this was the era of Gone with the Wind when Hollywood tended to treat the Confederates as romantic rebels if only because a film which treated them in any other way would have done no business anywhere south of Baltimore.The film relies heavily on its star being a typical Errol Flynn vehicle. Hatton is similar to many characters Flynn played during this part of his career his Robin Hood is another example a man of action debonair dashing brave and charming  a man who seems carefree on the outside but who underneath that exterior cares deeply about right and justice. He is also a romantic and in this film as in a number of others Flynn's love interest is played by Olivia de Havilland. Hatton's romance with the beautiful Abbie gets off to a difficult start when he is forced to shoot her quarrelsome drunken brother in self defence but the course of true love soon starts to run more smoothly.Dodge City perhaps lacks the depth of some of the truly great Westerns such as Stagecoach which came out in the following year or High Noon which deals in a more serious way with a similar theme a lone lawman's fight against a gang of outlaws but it is nevertheless one of the most entertaining of all Westerns with an excellent performance from one of the most charismatic stars of the era. 810".

Zanuck would denude their movies of their Technicolor  often using Technicolor previews as if to slap the faces of ticket buyers.";

To describe it as surreal would be like describing Salvador Dali as grounded in reality and it is one of those entries which conveniently for the director everyone will interpret in his or her own way. The central premise is that hoary old chestnut about the communications expert thrown into a strange universe which he finds incomprehensible. Montand is a professor of linguistics who lives with but is not married to a theatre designer played by an Anouk Aimee who seems strangely cold and unattractive in complete contrast to the role she played prior to this in Un Homme et un femme. Although they smile at each other rather a lot the relationship itself appears to have gone off the boil and when pressed he is reluctant to commit to marriage. Having established all of this the Professor takes a train to fulfil a lecture engagement in a neighboring country and having advised his mistress not to accompany him on the grounds that he will have no time to spend with her he is bemused to find her joining him in the train. He nods off wakes to find her gone. The train stops in the middle of East Jesus. He disembarks along with one older and one younger man. The train moves on leaving them stranded. Eventually they stumble on what at first sight seems a ringer for Oliver Goldsmith's Deserted Village. Somehow they find themselves in a movie theatre where the screen is full of images of freefalling people. For an encore they hit a hotel where no one least of all the linguistics maven can understand a word being spoken. And so it goes on. Apparently helmer Delvaux is a Flemish painter and the film abounds in Flemishtype paintings masquerading as frames of film. Mr. Bean it's not. They'll be 'teaching' this one in the varsity circuit for years but don't look for it in Loewe's State.".

	schema:reviewBody "The main attraction here are the amazing performances by Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. Jean Negulesco was able to capture it all in this tale of passion gone wrong.Lily Stevens arrives at Jefty's Road House to entertain in the lounge area. Jefty has offered her 250 a week a sum that in Pete Morgan's estimation is a lot more than the place can afford.

There are two things that kept me fascinated by this odd and satisfying little noir. One is the sultry presence of Ida Lupino as the silky smoothvoiced torch singer Lily her rendition of One for My Baby is itself precious. Without a doubt this is one of Lupino's best performances. The other is director Negulesco's intriguingly stylish direction the use of languorous long takes and deep focus particularly in the misty smokeinduced finale in the wilderness is quite haunting and expressive. This is the only Negulesco film I've seen. I'm looking forward to this other works.".

Why he has never received a Career Achievement Award from the Academy is mind boggling. No actor in film history has given so many memorable performances portraying sociopaths and psychopaths.I will skip the fine plot as so many others have explained it but will say that this is a great film noir that holds up exceptionally well even 60 years later. Cornel Wilde and Celeste Holm were also outstanding in less flamboyant roles. Holm was superb as the good hearted woman who was in love with Wilde who thought of her only as a good friend. Wilde gave a fine naturalistic performance as the stable and hard working good guy whom Widmark turned against out of jealousy and eventually hatred.The direction screenplay and cinematography were also top notch and Again is a classic song that has endured the march of time and is still played on jazz and oldie stations regularly.Come on Acadamy!

The setting is great out in some isolated and spectacular clubbar of a type once known as a roadhouse often out of town to avoid local laws about drinking and cavorting. The core is that the troubled and cocky Jefty played by the inimitable Richard Widmark wants the troubled Lily played by a tough Ida Lupino. Widmark as the roadhouse owner is pure Widmark so that even when he's charming he's scary and when he's not so charming he becomes demonic. This repels Lupino who though hard edged is decent deep down and she falls for the nice guy played by Cornel Wilde who is a sweetheart with an inability to stand up for himself. This gets him and everyone else into trouble. The steady downward drone of this movie from a just barely tense introduction as Lily comes to town to be the new entertainment to a love conflict and a frame up is subtle and effective. Don't look for fireworksit's all smoke until the very end. A full hour passes before you reach the movie's one major plot twist the bizarre parole conditions announced in the courtroom and then the gun has finally been cocked. Now all that we wonder about is how it will go off. And Lupino. There is no one in Hollywood quite like her one of the best women for making bitter arrogance smart and snappy. Her huskyvoiced singing is far more provocative than awful and perfect for this roadhouse in some unlikely mountain town fifteen miles from Canada. Not only is Lupino brilliant with her lines she has brilliant lines to deliver almost as though she invented them they fit so well. The fourth main character the second woman played by Celeste Holm the beguiling voiceover in Letter to Three Wives seems to have a smaller role but she's ultimately the sensible and good gal not as sexed up and headturning as Lupino's Lily but steady and practical and a key to everyone's salvation in the end. The camerawork starts out as pretty straight 1940s greatness aided by an astonishing series of period sets with Joseph LaShelle as cinematographer building up the drama through the last half hour to some searing dramatic face shots. The final scenes in the woods presage the similar foggy ending to Gun Crazy which has more of a cult following and which has visual innovations this one doesn't and these scenes are worth the ride by themselves. Director Jean Negulesco has only a few features of note to his credit but Road House along with How to Marry a Millionaire and Johnny Belinda makes a great case for his ability.It's easy to fault the film for some small things Pete seems inexplicably powerless to fight the frameup and even for larger ones the romance that holds it together isn't all that convincing but the moods and sets and lines are all great stuff. The plot has some gratuitous moments including an exhibitionist Lupino but taken another way they emphasize her difference from the others her insouciance and her confidence. It's curious and maybe defining that the natural match between the troubled characters the Widmark and Lupino leads is rejected but then Lily's shift to Pete ought to catch fire.In a way the film's theme of a man being overwhelmed by his wanting and expecting a woman is defined best in Lily's matter of fact line Doesn't it enter a man's head that a girl can do without him?

	schema:reviewBody "Not only was Ida Lupino a first rate actress but a pretty shrewd businesswoman as well. She purchased the rights to Road House for twenty thousand dollars then wound up with a tidy sum of a hundred thirty grand for signing on with RKO to do the picture. Now that's putting some credibility in 'One For My Baby'.You know I could watch Richard Widmark all day doing that maniacal laugh of his. It's great when he builds up to it like he does here starting out as the somewhat absentee owner of Jefty's Road House right through the complicated relationship that develops between himself singer Lily Stevens Lupino and business manager Pete Morgan Cornel Wilde. It's like he's building on his Tommy Udo character from 1947's Kiss of Death Widmark's first film role.Yet on the flip side there's not a whole lot about this story that makes sense if set in the real world particularly as it relates to that jury trial over the stolen money. How does the plaintiff get to go into the judge's chambers to seek clemency for the defendant? Didn't these guys have lawyers? And what about the 'proof' Susie claims she found when she spots the business envelope that contained the missing money? So? It was an envelope that Jefty had on him  why wouldn't he? He owned the business! But to get even that far you had to take it on faith that the police captain never even considered that Jefty might have been setting up his manager.

	onyx:emotionText "Not only was Ida Lupino a first rate actress but a pretty shrewd businesswoman as well. She purchased the rights to Road House for twenty thousand dollars then wound up with a tidy sum of a hundred thirty grand for signing on with RKO to do the picture. Now that's putting some credibility in 'One For My Baby'.You know I could watch Richard Widmark all day doing that maniacal laugh of his. It's great when he builds up to it like he does here starting out as the somewhat absentee owner of Jefty's Road House right through the complicated relationship that develops between himself singer Lily Stevens Lupino and business manager Pete Morgan Cornel Wilde. It's like he's building on his Tommy Udo character from 1947's Kiss of Death Widmark's first film role.Yet on the flip side there's not a whole lot about this story that makes sense if set in the real world particularly as it relates to that jury trial over the stolen money. How does the plaintiff get to go into the judge's chambers to seek clemency for the defendant? Didn't these guys have lawyers? And what about the 'proof' Susie claims she found when she spots the business envelope that contained the missing money? So? It was an envelope that Jefty had on him  why wouldn't he? He owned the business! But to get even that far you had to take it on faith that the police captain never even considered that Jefty might have been setting up his manager. You could go around in circles all night like this and not make sense of the story.But and this is the significant but all of this is set in a noir world that sucks the viewer in with it's flawed femme fatale with the gravel voice and the mugs who want her.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to like about ROAD HOUSE. The plot idea is very good and it's enjoyable throughout. The only problem is that the film really looked like the script should have been polished a bit first as there are just a few too many plot holesparticularly at the end.The style of this film is rather Film Noir though it doesn't feature the usual gangsters or cops. Instead Ida Lupino plays a worldweary lounge singer who acts much like your typical Noir femme fatale. She's a chainsmoking and smartmouthed dame through and through though later in the film she inexplicably changed to a nice girl in bad girl's clothing. This is a bit unexpected because I assumed the film was about how she trapped poor Cornell Wilde in her evil clutchesbut the film takes a much more unexpected detour. You see once Lupino catches Wilde their boss Richard Widmark oddly switches from a nice guy to a calculating psycho bent on destroying the lovers. This is where the plot really kicks into high gear and the next 20 minutes of the film are exciting.Unfortunately the ending where there is a final confrontation doesn't work at all because again and again there are plot problems. Widmark is obviously crazy and dangerous but once Wilde beats him up he doesn't even bother to tie up Widmark or plug him to make sure he doesn't return for round 2which he naturally does. Again and again they need to fight off this mad man even though one time should have been enough! Despite the holeriddled ending it's still worth seeing because of Lupino's and Widmarks' performances. She is great as the 2ndrate singer singing her own songs with a decent but obviously less than stellar voicewhich was perfect for the role and she exuded sleazy sex appeal. Widmark was interesting because he combined two totally different performances in one filmone a nice guy and the other highly reminiscent of his psycho from KISS OF DEATH! A great film? Nah. But an enjoyable bit of Noir that's for sure.".

In 1948 Richard Widmark had a patent on a certain kind of maniac the kind that giggles as he kills.He begins normally enough. Well normal for Widmark anyway. He's the impulsive owner of Jefty's Road House near the Canadian border an undistinguished place with deer heads on the wall. Cornel Wilde is his junior partner and Celeste Holm is the cashier.Widmark brings home a singer Ida Lupino whom he picked up on one of his jaunts to the city. He has designs on her. Wilde wants to get rid of her but in fact she turns out to be a terrific success. It's hard to see how because Lupino's voice is neither dubbed nor good. It's full of cracks and sounds smoke cured from years of Chesterfields. Well okay nobody ever accused Diana Krall of having an operatic voice and she's not a sex bomb either but Krall can at least play the piano while Lupino's skill is limited to the rudimentary.Come to think of it everybody smokes in this movie  a lot. If it were to be remade nobody would smoke because it's now politically incorrect to show cigarettes in use. Guns  yes. There'd be blood and brains all over the place in a remake but no tobacco. First things first.At any rate Widmark goes away for a week's hunting and guess what happens in his absence? When he returns he's determined to marry Lupino. He has the marriage license in his pocket. At this point it's easy to feel sorry for the deluded Widmark character. His friendship with Wilde aside it's the first sign of maturity that he's shown. Still it's Wilde's unpleasant duty to tell Widmark that he's out of the picture.Widmark resignation not being his strong suit frames Wilde for grand larceny and convinces the judge that Wilde should be paroled to him Widmark. The judge concurs. I didn't even know you could do that  I mean that a judge could decide on his own that a convicted man could be turned over to another ordinary citizen as a kind of slave.And a slave is what the sullen Wilde now becomes. He's restored to his earlier position only at a lesser income. He can't slug Widmark. He can't even talk back. And Lupino is tied to Widmark through her love for Wilde. Celeste Holm has the unenviable task of being the good sensible girl whom nobody wants.Finally at a cabin in the woods Widmark goes bananas and after being beaten senseless by Wilde  he was rude to Lupino  he grabs a pistol and chases Wilde and Lupino through the forest as they make for the Canadian border. Here the film could have used some location shooting. Studio forests are rarely convincing. There's never any wind the greenery looks phony and repetitive and sometimes there are echoes where there should be no echoes. There are instances though when studio forests become so stylized as to be  not convincing  but at least honest in their falsity. Battleground and Bataan are examples.Wilde is the nominal hero but he's pretty routine. The character is so straight that he's uninvolving. Lupino's role is more textured. She's had a past as they say and she's a willful and complicated babe. She's skinny and vulnerable but tough enough to belt Wilde when he tries to hustle her out of town with a few bucks. Widmark's character is by far the most interesting. A little unbalanced at the beginning he turns crafty and bitter before he loses it altogether. There's a good deal of pathos in the character.I don't know if this is a noir though it's very dark. A woman comes between two men but nobody slinks around the city streets and there is no sneaky betrayal by anyone. There's no city at all. The town near which Widmark's road house is located has a population of about 14000 and we don't see much of it beyond the hotel and the police station. Jean Negulesco's direction is pat. The musical arrangements are by Herbert Spencer and I thought he'd been dead for years.".

Widmark fresh from his careermaking role of Tommy Udo plays Jefty who owns a road house. His friend from the service Wilde runs the place. Jefty is gone on Lily Lupino but can't get to first base and hires her as a singer. Unfortunately she falls for Pete. Jefty frames Pete for robbery to keep him and Lily from leaving town to get married and then arranges with the judge to have Pete paroled to him.

Celeste Holm looks great and does her usual excellent job as a woman attracted to Pete who takes pity on him and Lily just the same.My only criticism is that there is a scene where Lily turns on the radio to a classical station where a soprano is singing Einsam im Truben Tagen.

Widmark fresh from his careermaking role of Tommy Udo plays Jefty who owns a road house. His friend from the service Wilde runs the place. Jefty is gone on Lily Lupino but can't get to first base and hires her as a singer. Unfortunately she falls for Pete. Jefty frames Pete for robbery to keep him and Lily from leaving town to get married and then arranges with the judge to have Pete paroled to him.

No one before or since can equal that deranged giggle and here it's worth waiting for. Just watch his little William Tell sporting event with Lupino Lilly in that nightmare forest where no birds sing or deer roam. In fact what I like best is the art department's contribution. That road house interior is a real eyecatcher sort of a postwar mix of woodsy cabin and singles recreation center where actual people set up bowling pins while a hulking brute wrecks everything else. Great role for Lupino. She gets to do her hard case with a soft heart as a torch singer all the way from big city Chicago. Her raspy rendition of One More for the Road is a riveting oneof akind and in her own voice too. What an immensely talented woman and why did Hollywood never honor her for that. Lilly's problem is not one man but two. But then by the time she slips into those white shortshorts we know she's decided on Wilde whose manly chest no doubt has something to do with it. The trouble is that leaves Widmark as oddman out and we know what that means. Question What's the point of Susie's Celeste Holm role in the movie? Maybe I missed something.Anyhow it's an atmospheric 90 minutes complete with rainy streets smoky rooms and that gloomy forest from heck. The movie may not rise to noir classic but in the meantime it'll sure do.".

Widmark is cast as the owner of the bowling alley who hires Lupino to sing in the bar. We learn that this is his way of meeting new women so his best friend convincingly portrayed by Cornell Wilde tries to dump Lupino at the railway station before she causes any trouble. Of course she refuses to leave and ends up in a love triangle with Widmark and Wilde.Lupino exudes star quality in a truly amazing performance as a sultry worldweary night club singer in search of redemption. Her mannerisms vocalizations and facial expressions are superbly nuanced and define her as one the best actresses of her generation comparable to Bette Davis. Widmark gives a mesmerizing performance as a repressed psychopath who naively deludes himself into believing Lupino will marry him then goes off the deep end when he discovers she is in love with his best friend. In the final scenes he explodes in a virtuoso display of controlled insanity that characterized his early career as an actor. The direction and cinematography are excellent with beautifully composed shots and lingering closeups of the stars. There is some sharp dialog and the rest of the cast deliver convincing performances making this an outstanding film noir. Highly recommended.".

He soon falls hard for her but she's got the hots for his longtime pal and righthand man Pete Cornel Wilde in one of the better performances he ever gave. Add to this mix the lovely Celeste Holm playing Ann who also works at Jefty's and is quietly in love with Wilde's character. Lupino and Wilde enjoy a weekend rendezvous when the controlling Jefty goes away hunting...but when he comes back all hell breaks loose.This noir has plenty of sharp dialogue and the stars deliver it with aplomb. Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark are always so darn watchableand their scenes crackle with force and fury. Lupino's just the right fit for Lily a woman who has been dragged through the gutter and with a voice to match but underneath is vulnerable. Maybe Widmark was told to overdo the psychotic laugh he introduced in the previous year's Kiss Of Death...he is terrific but has a tendency to overact in this film. Celeste Holm always equips herself well but her role is rather thankless. I liked this noir even if was very melodramatic. It's got plenty of atmosphere the cigarette burns on the piano mixedup characters blurry motivations and hot moments. There are many better noir films out there but Road House is well worth a visit.".

It is certainly George Hamilton's most memorable movie an overthetop spoof that never takes itself too seriously. This is NOT Jerry Lewis or the Three Stooges but an entertaining social commentary written and performed as slapstick. Of course they do all of it firmly tongueincheek.It does seem that a few people just don't get it. Well to each his own. But if you liked Hamilton's Love at First Bite or most of the work of Mel Brooks then this movie is for you. Personally it reminds me of Young Frankenstein Blazing Saddles Ghostbusters Groundhog Day and the Austin Powers movies. The writing is witty and the one liners are things you will remember and repeat for years. If you haven't seen this one then you don't know what you are missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to have a gift for the kind of cocksure buffoonery that's unleashed in Zorro the Gay Blade.  But you also have to have a special kind of gift to enjoy how wild and cockeyed it can be.  Hal Dresner and the rest of the writing team let loose with every conceivable bit of absurdity surrounding the Zorro legend and succeeded in giving what looks to be George Hamilton's most engaging work.  It was Hamilton's talk show with his exwife Alana that made me trust his essential good will.  He may have been a cheating goodtime charlie to Alana but it's just this willingness to let her at him over his own personal foibles that won me over.  It's there in spades in Zorro the Gay Blade.  Hamilton's not afraid to go all out playing the fool.  He grins and you can't help but grin back.  His tan may be legendary but it's that blindingpearlwhite smile that equals it.  It's what carries his performance I haven't seen a smirk this sardonic since John William Sublett flashed his in the number Shine from The Cabin In The Sky.  And Hamilton's mugging and playfulness is as masterful as Cary Grant's was in Gunga Din.  It isn't only talented actresses who get wasted in Hollywood.  Hamilton is an example of the actors who watched opportunities dry up their best years flit away and obscurity meet them headon in their old age.  It was nice seeing him on the Halloween edition of Talk Soup the face may be a little jowly and his hair grayer but that tan is still there and so is that trademark wantonness.  I hope it never dies.It would not have been very good for Hamilton to be playing at the height of his comic talents without a supporting cast meeting him jab for jab.  There are some who think Ron Leibman's performance is too much but I'm not among them.  Leibman knew he would have to chew a lot of scenery to make the humor built into his role work it takes a very astute actor to know when overacting overdoing is the right pitch at which to carry a scene or a part.  And I don't think Leibman ever misjudges the moment.  I can remember myself enthralled over Nehemiah Persoff's El Presidente on one episode of Gilligan's Island and Leibman's performance matches it accent for accent outburst for outburst.  It'll be a long time before I forget either.I've always thought Brenda Vaccaro a very funny actress.  It's hard to find actresses whose vibe puts you in a happy mood.  She's always reminded me of a primmer Susan Tyrell with her button eyes sharp profile the prim part and extra husky voice the Tyrell part.  As the Alcalde's wife Vaccaro has some smart lines and you wish director Peter Medak had let her go as far as Leibman had in his role.  And she seems wrong for the part that requires her to be vain selfabsorbed and sexstarved.  With Vaccaro you get the feeling that the woman she plays would be aware of how empty her existence was how to resolve her sexual frustrations She's accorded her husband's favor twelve times a year not once every month but twelve times in one night and then nothing for the rest of the year. how to pool her resources and become a foxy champion of the downtrodden herself. The movie is full of little surprises from the gap in Lauren Hutton's front teeth It's like an emblem of the absurdity this movie loves. to Donovan Scott's shaggydog costume or was he a bear? to Hamilton's alterego Don Diego's brother Ramon who throws off his Spanish heritage for a freer more suitable more English estate as Bunny Wiglesworth A name with a builtin comeon if ever there were one.  The fact that Ramon is better at wielding a whip than a sword points to how knowing the writers are it's things like this that make you beam at what Dresner and Bob Randall and others had cooked up.  Their efforts returned the word gay to what it used to mean and gave its new meaning well new meaning.  It's undiluted joviality and even that doesn't cover it.".

But at the same time like a good parody should Austin Powers it has its own theme its own compelling characters and plot. Nothing blows up but swordfighting doesn't need a 100m budget to be fascinating. Nor does a parody. It's wacky but accessible to people who don't like cult films. Don't expect a romance.If you liked Austin Powers definitely get this film. It's an intelligent and hilarious parody of the Zorro concept that yet is serious enough that we care what happens to the character. In getting this balance right it's much like the first Austin Powers film. Who should see this movie Everyone who's heard of Zorro and won't mind a little dosenot a large dose of wacky. Arty film types who won't find any compelling film drama herebut you owe it to yourself to explore the Zorro mystique.I'll give Zorro the Gay Blade a surprisingly timeless 9 out of 10.".

George Hamilton is perfect in his duel roles as the longabsent son of the legendary Zorro and his identical twin who has joined the British navy and flaunts his effeminate lifestyle. I don't understand why this movie gets such a low rating on IMDb. It may not be classic cinema destined for a spot in the Smithsonian but it delivers what it promises Lots of laughs. Sure the characters are stereotypes many of the scenes are over the top and the plot is perhaps a bit uneven. But in a farce there's nothing wrong with that and that is what this movie is. Ron Leibman as the corrupt alcalte and Brenda Vaccaro as his longsuffering wife add to the film with their wonderful overacting. The movie has a good comic pace and even manages to finish on a warm note. Sure it isn't perfect but not many movie comedies can manage to accomplish what it should This one does.".

I don't understand why this movie gets such a low rating on IMDb. It may not be classic cinema destined for a spot in the Smithsonian but it delivers what it promises Lots of laughs. Sure the characters are stereotypes many of the scenes are over the top and the plot is perhaps a bit uneven. But in a farce there's nothing wrong with that and that is what this movie is. Ron Leibman as the corrupt alcalte and Brenda Vaccaro as his longsuffering wife add to the film with their wonderful overacting. The movie has a good comic pace and even manages to finish on a warm note. Sure it isn't perfect but not many movie comedies can manage to accomplish what it should This one does.";

I have liked all the Zorro films and this comic spoof is yet another twist on the original Zorro plot.My favorite part of Zorro the Gay Blade is the masked ball at which the Alcalde hopes to catch Zorro only to have all his male guests arrive in Zorro costumes. The result is a dizzying house of mirrors effect as the Alcalde looks from one Zorro to another around the room and then finds himself unable to identify and arrest the real Zorro.Another favorite part is the soundtrack taken from Max Steiner's compositions for the soundtrack of Don Juan which starred Errol Flynn in the 1940s and The Danzas Fantasticas some Spanish classical music. Unfortunately Steiner's music is unpublished I do hope it will be published some day so that fans of Spanishstyle music can enjoy playing it.I would recommend the Zorro series by Disney and all other movies about Zorro. I also would recommend Don Juan starring Errol Flynn and Don Juan DeMarco starring Johnny Depp and the late Marlon Brando.".

The music is absolutely WONDERFUL....although I'm surprised to learn it's a MONO soundtrack! Most of the music was from Joachim Turina's Danses Fantasikas which persuaded me to go buy a recording of that work but the love theme which is BEAUTIFUL and makes me cry is not Turina's work. I wish they would have produced a CD soundtrack recording of the music from this movie...interspersed with quotes like 2 bits 4 bits 6 bits a peso all for Zorro stand up and say so! and the ships in the field...the little bababas etc.GREAT fun and a timeless classic!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Zorro the Gay Blade is one of trippiest movies ever. It obviously was made on the heels of the massive box office success of George Hamilton's comedic vampire movie Love at First Bite. They had a big success with Hamilton playing Dracula why not move onto another comedic version of an iconic character? And thus we get Zorro the Gay Blade! George Hamilton is hilarious in his dual role as Don Diego de la Vega and his flamboyant gay twin brother Bunny Wigglesworth one of the great camp character names ever.Lauren Hutton gives a cool performance too as Zorro's leading lady. She's not as good as Susan Saint James in Love at First Bite. But we couldn't expect comedic lighting to strike twice. Since Love at First Bite was good but one of those films that its success is more of a fluke than anything else. It's one of those films that shouldn't have worked but amazingly did. Ala films like The Blues Brothers Meatballs and Smokey and the Bandit.Zorro the Gay Blade is one of those off the wall flawed comedies that belong alongside other late night comedy classics like Jekyll and Hyde Together Again starring the amazing Mark Blankfield.Also Ron Liebman as Esteban Zorro's nemesis is hilarious here as is Brenda Vaccaro as Florinda Esteban's mondo sexually frustrated wife.Not the greatest comedy ever captured on celluloid. But far superior to most at your local mutliplex amigo.".

Following in his father's 'boots' the new Zorro George Hamilton takes over. Injured whilst fighting Estebans' men Zorro sends for his twin brother Ramon George Hamilton again. There is just one problem this new 'Zorro' is gay.Critique Sendup spoof of the legendary Zorro character was George Hamilton's followup to his delirious Count Dracula in 'Love at First Bite' 1979. A performance that revealed a hidden comic talent. Playing another fictional role his Zorro is a treat to watch. When we first see Zorro he is the dashing demeanor figure we've all come to know. But when 'Ramon' takes over the fun starts. It's fun to see him don a whip instead of the famous sword mixing his heavy Spanishaccent with a gay lisp and dress in an assortment of colorful getups he was dressed like a big banana. Though Ron Liebman's 'Esteban' is sometimes offputting with his overacting its still fun for the whole family.QUOTE Zorro That's right Zorro is back! To defend the defenseless! Befriend the friendless! And to defeat. . .the 'defeatless'.".

Everything is virtually perfect the script the actors and their performances the cinematography the various comedic zingers. Hamilton's dual role is a masterpiece of comedic acting as is Liebman's overthetop and subtle portrayals of the sexually repressed martinet Esteban. Hutton is more than gorgeous she presents the ideal of liberated femininity and power. The actors are having a contagiously great time with this and that alone is worth the viewing.I do not see a single wrong move in the film. Great farce is not easy to do and this is an example that should be appreciated on its own terms and not measured against other genres.".
