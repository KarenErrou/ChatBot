At first succeeding under the government of Isabel Peron their protests draw hostile attention from the military regime that overthrows Peron. The ensuing crackdown on student social activists is demonstrated when police break up a school dance wielding swords on horseback. Later six students are kidnapped in the middle of the night and the police deceitfully claim ignorance about their whereabouts. Pablo Alejo Garcia Pintos a seventh member of the group is later arrested and learns that they have been brutally tortured by authorities. He survives to tell their story but the six are never found numbering among the hundreds of students who were kidnapped and are still missing.";

This movie is poetic sad tragic but I think is very close to the truth. It's a movie of course with a plot screenplay...in a movie you can't necessarily see the whole story of a class of students.

I'm 15 now and until today I wouldn't realize the importance of a bus ticket i really wouldn't because i would think that that couldn't have history. But now i understood that since the most big thing until the most little thing in the world are here for a reason. I don't know if you people will understand my point here because i actually find it very confusing to explain here. The thing is these kids were around my age now. And until today i would not think thsat some kid could chamge the world not the way they did. I personally know Pablo Diaz the one who survive because he is a friend of my mom and i think this film impressed me this way because i actually knew one of them. I also want to say that this movie doesn't show all the facts because there wasn't only one surviver there were four of them. And i don't know why this film doesn't show them because they are part of our history and they changed the country too. And to MaryChase you can't say that a group of kids could be terrorists just by showing their ideas that in fact is what we do in a daily basis and no one would kidnap us and torture us and KILL us now. SO YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT. I'm sorry if my English is bad i hadn't practice in a long time.".

This year we are remembering in Argentina the thirtieth anniversary of the terrible dictatorship so the film was shown at my high school and I could see it for the first time. There are not enough words to express how I felt imagining I could have been one of the victims if I had lived thirty years ago. I am definitely against this dictatorship and I admire all the kidnapped and disappeared guys' mothers who continue struggling to find their sons daughters grandsons and granddaughters. But besides this I think the interesting side of the film is that despite our political positions as I'd previously said mine is against this dictatorship we can be sure that everything that's happened to these students is TERRIBLE. Terrible because they were standing up for their ideas they were asking for a decrease in the students' bus ticket price. Whatever our political position is we cannot deny the fact that everyone has their right to be judged as a human being. The very talented actors let us see feel and listen how badly unfairly and terribly those students were taken away from their homes and relatives tortured to insanity rapped and killed with no mercy on 1976. I recommend this film to everyone who would like to know what happened. The film only shows one episode of the whole horrible dictatorship. There were about 30.000 disappeared people between those years not only students but also Jewish people artists politicians journalists... and many more. La Noche De Los Lpices retells one of the if not the most horrible and terrible episode during the dictatorship. As an Argentinean I can tell you all that this film touched my heart and made me cry so hard I could hardly watch it through the tears at times. In spite of the pain the film may provoke it is a must for all those people who ever had a dream an ideal a wish. Knowing by listening to my parents by reading books and by watching this film the atrocities occurred that night and every night and every day during the dictatorship make my heart jump and my vocal chords shout as loud as I can NEVERMORE. Thank you for reading.".

It starts showing students who are enjoying their time until the plot switches and seven students are taken away into a secret prison. From there on the viewer feels some kind of apprehensiveness as the students are kept in cells blindfolded and handcuffed. It is shown that they are tortured with electric shocks and the screams one hears are really nerveracking. One cannot believe that these things all happened in Argentinia in the 70s for it is just unbelievable that human beings can do such cruel things to kids. Still there is a group of mothers in Buenos Aires whose children disappeared and a square in the city reminding of those horrible ages in Argentinian history. Most of the desaparecidos never turned up again and no one exactly knows what has happened to them.".

Since then I've had the opportunity to watch several flicks focused on showing torture and the darker side of human nature  and mostly they've come off as an angstridden teenager's sick and cartoonlike fantasies of what real horror is. There's no romancing the captivity they went through there's certainly no sugarcoating the subject matter is treated with solemnity and with a care that not even Sal could ever hope to achieve.

Freddie Bartholomew is engaging in the title role and the cast members as a whole work together and complement each other well.It would be hard even to list all of the good performances.  Edna May Oliver almost seems to have born to play Dickens's kind of strongwilled but caring female character.  W.C.

Characters like Uriah Heep Mr. Dick the Murdstones and several others could have come straight from the novel.  As the adult Copperfield Frank Lawton is sometimes rather bland but he is likable and is at least believable as Bartholomew's grownup counterpart.The story of necessity is episodic and moves quite quickly usually including only the highlights of the narrative.  But it does a very good job of this making each sequence work well and efficiently fitting each one into the story as a whole.  George Cukor certainly deserves a good deal of credit for making it work and fit together so well.  The settings which are always important in a Dickens story are also for the most part pretty good.The original novel David Copperfield is such a fine classic of literature that no twohour movie could be on quite the same level but this version is quite enjoyable and it does a very good job of depicting the atmosphere and most of the important events of the story.".

Of course W.C. Fields' Mr. McCawber was superb and has been cited time and again as a great characterization but it's also difficult to fault Basil Rathbone's Mr. Murdstone Edna may Oliver's Aunt Betsy Roland Young's Uriah Heep Freddy Bartholomew's young David Lionel Barrymore's Mr. Peggoty or Maureen O'Sullivan's Dora Spenlow. As well George Cukor's  direction and period details are topnotch as is the screen adoption of a very complicated novel. It's simply one of the greatest movies ever made.".

Fields' Mr. McCawber was superb and has been cited time and again as a great characterization but it's also difficult to fault Basil Rathbone's Mr. Murdstone Edna may Oliver's Aunt Betsy Roland Young's Uriah Heep Freddy Bartholomew's young David Lionel Barrymore's Mr. Peggoty or Maureen O'Sullivan's Dora Spenlow. As well George Cukor's  direction and period details are topnotch as is the screen adoption of a very complicated novel. It's simply one of the greatest movies ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "Of all of the films directed by George Cukor I think this is his finest achievement helped in no small measure by the perfect casting of all the Dickens characters.Freddie Bartholomew is flawless as the young David. Edna May Oliver as his stern but loving Aunt Betsy Trotwood gives her usual sharp characterization and nearly steals the first half of the movie. As for Mr. Murdstone Basil Rathbone is the perfect embodiment of that brutally wicked man. Born to play Mr. Micawber is W. C. Fields so uncannily right that it almost seems as if Dickens had him in mind when he wrote the character!Very atmospheric so much so that it seems almost incredible that an American movie company could have crafted this gem. One would think the British would have beat us to itbut Dickens would have approved of this version I'm sure.The only drawback is the length and the scenes involving David's wife Dora as played by Maureen O'Sullivan with a saccharine sweetness that becomes cloying at times. Thank God she didn't play Melanie in 'GWTW'. Some of the acting is a bit florid but to be expected when you consider this was made in 1935. Roland Young is well cast as Uriah Heep.Highly recommended. Anyone who cherishes the Dickens novel will not be disappointed. The only flaw is that the story has been compressed in order to limit the running time to two hours and ten minutes and it shows. All the essential characters remain but some of them have little dimension because of time constraints.".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of David COPPERFIELD is quite a good one in that it does trim the 800 plus page novel down to reasonable coherence. There are some characters that one misses but they are understandably cut due to length considerations. While Steerforth and his betrayal of the Peggoty Family is in the film including the dual tragedy at it's conclusion the substory of Little Em'ly's friend Martha and the business regarding Steerforth's mother Rosa Dartle and Mrs. Mowcher were dumped Mrs. Mowcher would have been hard to cast. Pity Mrs. Mowcher's famous speech to David about not confusing her physical attributes with her mental ones is missing. Also Steerforth's butler Littimer appears once but the film does not get into the ironic coda of his imprisonment. While Uriah Heep's villainy against Mr. Wickfield and his clients is shown his willingness to dig up dirt against other enemies is not shown. In particular his treatment of Dr. Strong David's second schoolmaster his young wife and Jack Dalton is not developed which is sad as it proves Mr. Dick is not simple minded.But those are minor points really. The best jobs in the film are the work of the performers under George Cukor's direction Edna Mae Oliver as the crusty wise Aunt Betsy Roland Young as the evil greasy Uriah Heep his best villain part and W.C.Fields as Wilkins McCawber Dicken's tribute to his lovable but improvident father is superb  the one time his comic personae met the proper dramatic role and Lionel Barrymore as Dan Pegotty determined to find his lost ruined niece. Freddy Bartholemew's performance as young David is wonderful. But I must admit that Frank Lawson is a trifle colorless as the grown up David although he has a funny moment at a dinner that Dora Maureen O'Sullivan tries to prepare. It is a weakness but a small weakness in a nearly perfect film.".

Although he is perfect as Mcawber to me it is Edna May Oliver who steals the picture. She is delightful as the dotty aunt  especially standing up to Mr. and Miss Murdstone with the loony backing of Mr. Dick a charming Lennox Pawle.Of course Lionel Barrymore always makes the most of a part and does so as the gruff fisherman Dan Peggotty. Freddie Bartholomew is excellent as the young David. Elizabeth Allen is gorgeous and delightful as David's mother while Basil Rathbone and Violet Kemble Cooper are cold and devious as the stepfather and his housekeeper sister.The entire cast is excellent including Jessie Ralph as Peggotty and Herbert Mundin as the 'willing' Barkis. My only complaint  and this is from one who hasn't read the book  is that the miscellaneous characters get a bit confusing. A guy who apparently had been nice to David in school runs off with and abandons the adopted daughter of Peggotty's brother. Then two men fight during a shipwreck and David sees his school friend dead. Perhaps things were better spelled out in the book.In any event it is a quite charming film. Oliver and Field are delightful along with the rest of the talented cast. I doubt that as better adaptation could be done today.".

	schema:headline " Copperfield gets fine treatment from Cukor.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead for some time Charles Dickens was easily the hottest writer in Hollywood in 1935 with four major releases of his works. Tale of Two Cities The Mystery of Edwin Drood The Old Curiosity Shop and David Copperfield were all released in that year and along with Two Cities Copperfield are the two finest American productions of the famed authors work.

The film starts out with Edna May Oliver with Elizabeth Allan I thought I was back to the even greater A Tale of 2 Cities which starred both along with Basil Rathbone who as the stepfather gives new meaning to cruelty. It is the latter subject of cruelty that dominated Charles Dickens' two masterpieces '2 Cities' as well as 'Copperfield.'The film shows the treachery of early England regarding how children worked forcibly in all sorts of difficult activities. No child labor laws here. The cast is excellent especially along with Bartholemew Oliver and Rathbone there is Jesse Ralph as a kindly devoted servant. Lionel Barrymore is rather subdued here.While this is a very good film it does lose some power once Copperfield grows up. It then essentially becomes a love story as well as greed and ultimate redemption.".

	schema:reviewBody "David COPPERFIELD MetroGoldwynMayer 1935 directed by George Cukor is one of Hollywood's many contributions in the world of classic literature transforming the literary works of Charles Dickens to the silver screen the best coming from the 1930s. With OLIVER TWIST Monogram 1933 and GREAT EXPECTATIONS Universal 1934 starting the trend it would be a matter of time before MGM the biggest studio in the business to turn out an expensive allstar production of American and British actors combined bringing the Dickens characters to life. One of the most interesting selections was having comedian W.C. Fields on loan from Paramount playing Wilkins Milcawber a role originally intended for Britisher Charles Laughton. Another interesting fact is that it is Fields and not any one of the studio's own contract players whose name heads the big cast in the opening credits though for the closing the names are categorized in order of appearance. With Fields pictured with the title character on both video and DVD packages one shouldn't assume David COPPERFIELD to be a W.C. Fields comedy. His spread out scenes are briefly performed not making his first appearance until 38 minutes from the start of the story. In short a movie rightfully belonging to the equally matched performances by Freddie Bartholomew David the boy and Frank Lawton David the young man. Regardless of the choir singing to Christmas songs The First Noel and Christmas Day in the Morning on the soundtrack in the opening credits David COPPERFIELD is not a Christmas themed photoplay in a sense of Dickens' A Christmas Carol but a story of a boy from the time of his birth to his youth as a young man.Played in biographical form the life story of David Copperfield is said to be the life of its creator with the opening title Like many fine parents I have in my heart of hearts a favorite child and his name is David Copperfield by Charles Dickens indicating that. Opening with the passage of a book reading Chapter One I Am Born the wonderful life of David Copperfield begins with his birth to Clara Copperfield Elizabeth Allan a young widow whose husband died six months previously. Over the years Davidthe boy Freddie Bartholomew has been reared by both mother and Nurse Paggerty Jessie Ralph. After Clara's marriage to the stern Edward Murdstone Basil Rathbone their once happy existence turns for the worse when David who has never liked his stepfather is abused with severe punishments by him. After Clara dies in childbirth Murdstone puts David to work in a London factory under the care of family man Mr. Micawber W.C. Fields. David finds happiness with the Micawbers until being forced to leave town after Micawber serves time in debtor's prison. Not wanting to return to Mr. Murdstone and his wicked sister Jane Violet KembleCooper David walks over a hundred miles to Dover to live with his Aunt Betsy Edna May Oliver who along with Mr. Dick Lennox Pawle a dimwit with common sense rear the boy. Educated in Castleberry and living in the home of Mr. Wickfield Lewis Stone David Frank Lawton now a fine young man with ambition to become a writer marries the pretty yet childish Dora Spendow Maureen O'Sullivan while being secretly loved by Wickfield's daughter Agnes Madge Evans. During the course of his wonderful life David is reunited with Mr. Micawber but encounters troubles along the way especially with the sinister Uriah Heep Roland Young.Others members of the cast include Lionel Barrymore Dan Peggotty Elsa Lanchester Clickett Una O'Connor Mrs. Gummidge John Buckler Ham Hugh Williams Steerforth Herbert Mundin Barkis and many others. Aside from Bartholomew Lawton and Edna May Oliver in standout performances Basil Rathbone as the coldhearted Murdstone and W.C. Fields one of the most likable and sincere characters associated with David have lasting appeal. Take note that Fields does Mr. Micawber in the manner of Dickens and in short Micawber being W.C. Fields as if Dickens had written Micawber entirely with Fields in mind. Look quickly for Arthur Treacher as the donkey man who takes away and goes off with young David's money.David Copperfield in book form is a thick novel and involving story with many incidents and characters not included in the final film print. In movie form David COPPERFIELD is at times a dark and depressing story with the boyhood portion of Copperfield's life more interesting than his adult years but overall in abridged form of 132 minutes an agreeable film that would have made Charles Dickens proud. Formerly presented on commercial and cable TV in the 1990s in both colorized and shorter versions David COPPERFIELD can be found intact in glorious black and white on Turner Classic Movies. Remade several times since 1935 there's no question that this David O. Selznick production in short remains the most beloved and critically acclaimed of them all. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the classic MGM version of David Copperfield I couldn't help but feel that too much was cut out of this film. It would have been better done in two parts with one part strictly dealing with David's childhood up to the point where he comes into the custody of his great aunt Betsy Trotwood. Another film would then pick up the slack and follow him through adulthood. MGM did it that way several years later in their life of Thomas Edison it should definitely have been done for David Copperfield.Too much of the story is left out and it's assumed since David Copperfield was and is required reading in most high school literature courses that the audience would be familiar with the story. Certainly the fine group of players that George Cukor gathered all do their best and are well cast in their parts.For the one and only time in his career W.C. Fields played someone other than W.C. Fields on screen. Borrowed from Paramount Fields is cast as the ever expectant Mr. Micawber who proves to be David's salvation both as a child and as an adult. He also indulges in a little bit of Fields like physical comedy please note that walk on the roof to enter his dwelling. Still in the key moments you do realize he's Micawber and not Fields in the film.Freddie Bartholomew followed up his first noticed screen role in Anna Karenina with a winning portrayal as young David the child. I'm sure that Frank Lawton might not have gotten the part had he had to carry a whole film as an adult. Still he's not bad as the adult David for his half of the film.Dickens's villains are as black as they come in literature and Basil Rathbone and Violet Kemble Cooper as the Murdstone brother and sister are as coldblooded a pair as you'll ever find. And Roland Young as Uriah Heep is one oily insinuating dude.Rathbone as Murdstone is young David's father who was cruel to his mother Elizabeth Allan who was a kindly but weak soul. When David grows up he remembers what happened and when another kindly but weak and also airheaded soul in the person of his first wife Dora comes into his life his protective instincts are aroused and he marries her. Maureen O'Sullivan who would usually be playing upper crust types plays the simple lisping airhead Dora. It's an unusual turn for her and a good one. Funniest moment in the film when she invites Edna May Oliver as Aunt Betsy and Lennox Pawle as Mr. Dick over and the meal is a disaster. I liked the film liked everybody in it. But MGM and George Cukor would have been better off doing it in two parts. Still it's a classic though don't use it as a substitute for reading the book or Cliff's Notes if you have to do a book report.".

David Copperfield 1935 . The script was adapted from the Dickens novel in 1935 by Hugh Walpole with aid from Howard Estabrook and Lenore J. Coffee uncredited. BW Cinematography was done by Oliver T.

Douglas Shearer's difficult work as recording director was handled brilliantly I suggest Dolly Tree was credited as wardrobe head.

Others in the huge cast include Freddie Bartholemew who is fine as young Davy Lewis Stone Lennox Pawle Elizabeth Allen Elsa Lanchester Herbert Murdin Una O'Connor Herbert Murdin Hugh Williams Frank Lawton and Madge Evans. This is a very wellmade film absorbing and cruel tender and interesting. It is Dickens' most respected work and dated in my opinion only by his use of a child as the victim of British imperial oppression. This is a very fine early David Selznick achievement in both purpose and detail also I credit this film with helping to cause Hollywood producers to make many Victorian films thereafter.".

	schema:reviewBody "This MGM adaptation of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield is adeptly edited as a means to illustrate the abandonment of young David Copperfield Freddie Barthlomew. An example is where the errant Micawber and his family leave London for pastures new. Here young Copperfield is left a lone figure of a boy standing by the roadside as he bids farewell to the Micawber family giving a sense of abandonment to the viewer. This sense of abandonment conveys Dickens' personal experiences when his errant Father let his family down via his own folly and weaknesses of gambling dept and imprisonment.The cast is a montage of actors who play their respective roles in David Copperfeild with a respect for Dickens' characters and work pertaining to the classic novel. StandOut performers include Edna May Oliver as the feistyyet humane Aunt Betsy Jessie Ralph as loyal Nurse Peggotty Lionel Barrymore as compassionate Dan Peggoty Una O'Conner as the effervescent Mrs Gummidge Lennox Pawle as the eccentric Mr. Dicks W.C Fields as the happygolucky Micawber Ronald Young as the obsequious unctuous Uriah Heep Maureen O' Hara as the infantile Dora Basil Rathbone  showing nuances of his famous role as Sherlock Holmes through his aloofness as sadistic Mr. Murdstone and of course not forgetting the outstanding Freddie Bartholemew as young David Copperfield. Bartholomew brought young Copperfield's sensitivity and anguish to the fore. Indeed the sensitivity was heightened by the anguish which turned to despair. Yet Bartholomew also illustrated that Copperfield had fortitude and determination to overcome the negative experiences which culminated in Copperfield the man. In this sense the film is inspirational to those who feel that at odds with the world..Meanwhile the actors who portrayed the characters of this MGM adaptation of David Coperfield have formulated the blueprint of the latter's which have become indelible portraits in the viewer's imagination. Hensefourth W.C Fields becomes the epitome of Mr. Micawber.What is also interesting is the way the names are apparent monikers applicable to their respective character's nature idiosyncrasies and deeds. An example is Mr. Murdstone Basil Rathbone is potentially the moniker for 'murderer' .Murdstone's character is a representation of the then acceptable Victorian discipline. In other words such discipline was supposed to shape character rather than to punish. But MGM are adept to convey Dickens' view of Victorian discipline as cruel sadistic punishment and thereby demarcating the rise of new liberal attitudes.Credit to this adaptation of Dickens' Copperfield also goes to acclaimed director George Cuckor especially for conveying the composite story into such a relatively short time span with great skill. This credit should be shared with Robert Kern for his adept editing skills.In sum this film is a credit to all involved and a great tribute to Charles Dickens the man and the writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Technically in most ways this is a very well made movie. It's obvious David O. Selznick and MGM put a lot of time and money into this production. However I also felt that some of the acting was a bit suspect and there was way way too much plot for a single movieas a result it all came off as very episodic.The film begins with young David losing his father. As for the mother she is a weak individualand so it's interesting that later in the film David marries an even weaker woman. Anyway this weak lady marries a man she thinks will make a good father Basil Rathbone. However Rathbone moves in with his sister and they are awfulcold and cruel. The weak mother soon dies and David is sent off to workthough he only looks to be about 8. From this point on in the film David bounces around a lotbut fortunately for his Aunt Edna May Oliver and a few good friends he manages to grow into a nice and reasonably levelheaded man. In this film portion of the film lots of very episodiclike things happenalmost like we're seeing a highlights reel of his life from age 1835 or so. Much of it was entertaining much of it made me feel lost trying to keep up with all the characterssome of which weren't all that interesting such as David.Now the film did have some excellent aspects. A few of the actors were very very good. In particular Edna May Oliver was as usual greatvery entertainingso much so I wish the movie had been a story of her life! Basil Rathbone was greatand he was always wonderful in villain roles. W.C. Fields was pretty goodespecially since his role was not a comedic one. As for the lowpoints the mother Elizabeth Allan and David's wife Maureen O'Sullivan were supposed to be very weak charactersbut the film managed to also make them pretty annoying particularly O'Sullivana definite weakness in the film. As for Una O'Connor she too was weak in the filmway too whinyand a bit too much like the characters she plays in The Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein.It's obvious from my review that I had very mixed feelings about this film. Perhaps it could be I just don't like Dickens all that much but part of the problem is that although the film was set in the 1800s it came off as too antiquated and stilted at times. And the episodic nature sure didn't help. I'd really rather see this as a miniseriesthe type the Brits make so well. I'll check and see if there is one as the basic story wasn't badjust flawed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This swirling memorable adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic novel might have become a classic itself had it been given a halfhour longer to run and fewer subplots to carry. Still it is an entertaining exemplar of what helped to make Hollywood's Golden Age.After his father's early death English boy David Copperfield Freddie Bartholomew is exposed to various hardships that test him and sort out true friends from false ones. Grown to adulthood David now played by Frank Lawton pursues a career as a writer while looking out for those he loves.The best thing Copperfield has going for it is a marvelous range of characters representing with one major exception the cream of Hollywood's secondtier players. That exception is W. C. Fields who plays David's early friend the foreverindebt Mr. Micawber. Micawber is not a drinker and he takes well enough to the boy David but this is otherwise a role that fits Fields like a glove and he adds distinction to the proceedings.He's not the most distinctive actor here nor the funniest. That would probably be Edna Mae Oliver as Betsey Trotwood a deceptively unaffectionate woman who upbraids her expectant daughterinlaw when she dares suggest her unborn child could be male. I have a presentiment it will be a girl she declares and swats the doctor who delivers news to the contrary. Yet Trotwood is far from disagreeable as we and David come to understand.Also wonderful are Jessie Ralph as David's warm governess and one constant Peggotty Basil Rathbone as the chilly stepfather Murdstone and Lennox Pawle as the lightheaded polestar of Betsey's life Mr. Dick. Her Tarzan fan base will find Maureen O'Sullivan frightfully overdressed but she's quite fun as the sexy and completely unserious Dora Spenlow.For half the movie you also have Bartholomew as David a child actor who provides an empathetic center to the proceedings. Dickens was a writer of both muscular sentimentality and whimsy qualities Bartholomew's precocious performance helps bring across here. But the second half of the film is not as lucky with the sticklike Lawton in the title role. Nor is it as engaging juggling as it does several subplots in often awkward always foreshortened fashion.One subplot dealing with David's friend Steerforth and his ruination of a family friend could have been dispensed with entirely as it has no bearing on the rest of the story. Director George Cukor seems to lose his balance by letting things get too maudlin.David Copperfield can't help but be a little twee being a product of the Victorian Age rendered here into an entertainment for the middleaged aunties who found Cagney and Gable too uncouth. Poor Freddie spent years unsuccessfully trying to shake the sissy image he got stuck with here saying lines like Ooh mother you do look pretty tonight! Even W. C. has to deal with a teacozy aesthetic exclaiming Shades of Nicodemus! instead of his usual lessgenteel Godfrey Daniels!I would not recommend this David in place of the novel which is emotionally far more powerful and complex. But for those who have read the book the movie is a kind of theatrical revue with some impressively expressionistic cinematography David awaiting word on his mother's health as lightning flashes across his face Murdstone's scowling and pungent readings of familiar lines. All in all a diverting entertainment that could have done with some pruning but has its heart in the right place.".

But that's no reason to dismiss the many many things that writerdirector Olivier Assayas gets absolutely right.  In the end DEMONLOVER is a fascinating mirrorworld reflection as William Gibson would call it of where our global society might be just five minutes from now  the fittest who survive will be multilingual careerconsumed and ridiculously chic but also soulless as if missing the gene that supplies a sense of loyalty and ethics.  The movie is a cautionary though entirely plausible tale of humans debased by their own lust for ungoverned capitalism.  Every line of dialogue is about the business merger at hand in the rare instances where feelings are discussed they're usually about how work affects those emotions.  The big wink here is that the characters don't even discuss business honestly because each has duplicitous motives.Technically DEMONLOVER is a feast.  Denis Lenoir's widescreen photography constantly dazzles  many of the tracking shots are sustained in closeup creating paranoia and the color spectrum appears as if filtered through corporate fluorescence.  The neondrenched Tokyo sequence is particularly hypnotic.  Jump cuts keep the narrative one step ahead of the audience. Sonic Youth's atonal guitar score creates the same mutant environment that Howard Shore pulled off in CRASH.  Most significantly Connie Nielsen's face and hair and wardrobe mesmerizes more than any CGI I've ever seen. Considering the labyrinthine motives of her character Nielsen's exquisite subtlety may be lost on firsttime viewers on second look her emotionless gaze speaks volumes.Audiences and critics have unanimously attacked the problematic' second half as an example of directorial selfindulgence.  While I agree that it's not as satisfying as the first half I don't think it's a total crashandburn pardon the pun.  Clearly the ending is open to thematic interpretation but I think Assayas is just saying that if our species isn't more careful we'll end up like onedimensional characters in a video game of our own devising  sure winner takes all but the rest of us suffer enormously.Narrative ambiguity aside DEMONLOVER is the great HitchcockianCronenbergian espionage fantasia I've been waiting for.  It makes sense that it would come from Europe since Hollywood forgot long ago how to make their assemblyline genre exercises intellectually stimulating.  Like the anim porn within the story Hollywood movies today represent no more than a calculated corporate commodity.  More than any other film from the last 2 years DEMONLOVER seems a product of the post911 world  a notsodistant future where overwhelming paranoia goads us to preemptively eliminate any form of potential competition before it can do the same to us.  And how in doing so we devour our own tail.I expect this movie's reputation will grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off the movie's plot DOES make sense.  I'll address that below after the Spoiler Alert. It's a very interesting movie thematically visually aurally. I summarize the theme as Who's the top now.'  By top' I refer to the sadomasochistic term for the dominant partner.  It sees corporate life in particular and modern Western culture in general as a soulless contest for dominance among individuals who have no meaningful connection to other people beyond the dominancesubmission relationship.  Life has been reduced to a video game in which winning is everything consequently life has been reduced to something as spiritually and socially empty as a video game. Demonlover is a serious condemnation of the culture we shaped and which in turn shapes us.Much of the camerawork is relentlessly closeup. There are even relatively long tracking shots where you never have enough distance to see in any one frame much more than a hand or a skirt or a car door.  It makes the movie exciting to watch even when all you're watching are yuppies negotiating or driving from one place to another. It also helps present the theme of characters with no moral distance from what they're doing with no perspective.' It makes everything GoGoGo just like in a video game where something is always coming at you or like in the gogo' makeabuck corporate world.Nobody has faulted the acting. Nielsen is great a desirable top in the first half if ever I've seen one! And I've never seen Berling before but I'd be happy just watching that pleasant slimeball eat and talk for thirty minutes straight.  If you cast HIM in My Dinner with Andre it would instantly have a voluptuously seamy quality!As for the pornography scenes Assayas shows almost nothing. It's an especially NONexplicit movie. Not only is it neither erotic nor titillating it actually shows less graphic violence sex and nudity than the average Rrated movie these days. It is not at all exploitative.' Critics are taking offense at the meaning and implications of what is shown not at the graphic content.SPOILERS BELOWI've seen reviews that think the plot falls apart after the first half' which means after Gershon and Nielsen fight. What happens is that both women black out and then Sevigny and cohorts clean up the mess perhaps dispose of Gershon it doesn't matter and rescue' Nielsen. Then she finds out that Sevigny ALSO is an undercover agent. Sevigny in the meantime while Nielsen is knocked out has managed to climb the corporate ladder so that their roles are reversed  both at Volf AND as spies for Magnatronics. Maybe Sevigny worked for Magnatronics from the start or maybe she was coopted later it doesn't matter.  As someone playing her role in a dominancesubmission relationship she is then stuck as a submissive and acts it. It's not out of character. She is just no longer the top she thought she was.  The plot doesn't go haywire it's just that Assayas has fun with us as we find out that Karen is familiar with the ways of Magnatronics and then finally that Sevigny actually works for Berling. In other words EVERYONE we've met at Volf except Volf himself is actually an undercover agent. The company is a shell full of people who are not on its side who are only out for themselves and are through greed and deceitfulness actually in the employ of their employer's enemy.  Just as the society is shown to have no values outside of individual success and dominance so it is shown to an absurd extreme within the analogue of the Volf Corporation. The DNA molecule at the end of the movie fits this theme stripped of the overlay of cultural illusions it's all just survival of the fittest each geneset for itself.Finally I want to comment that Nielsen's reaction to Berling in the bed scene makes sense too. While who is the dominant is undecided she seems to be into the sex undoing his belt etc. But then he asserts his dominance and the scene turns into a rape. They couldn't really have balanced consensual sex since it's about winning not about love. Hence he takes the dominant role forcing intercourse even though she clearly was heading there anyway!. Next it's her turn to win' his having just trumped her with male physical strength she uses the equalizer.".

Suffice it to say this is not a movie for the squeamish or for fans of the character building qualities of a life in business. What the film shows is how much of a construct modern identity is how much it depends on role on possessions on our relationship to the pecking order of whatever tribe we find ourselves in. The film also suggests that the price we pay for hanging on to this fragile identity is nothing less than the seeds of our destruction  a doorway in fact to depression madness and perversion. Lastly the film is a devastating look at the way big media corporations hide their involvement in antisocial projects under the veneer of 'just business' or if they went to the Harvard Business School 'shareholder value'. Its a rare thing to make an interesting movie with NO sympathetic characters but demonlover achieves this. Many complaints have been launched against the incoherent plot but the fact is that the plot is not incoherent at all it just lacks credibility which is a different matter altogether. But no matter its still an interesting take on a very real set of contemporary circumstances. The performances are also quite compelling which suggests that no matter how dubious a character's morality is if she's beautiful we men that is will hang on her every word.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING  SPOILERSOlivier Assayas' Demonlover begins as a handsomelooking corporate techno thriller that ranges between France Japan and the US and involves cutthroat executives from all three countries speaking all three languages who start out cutting deals and wind up cutting throats. Two products are involved softcore porn Japanese anim of which the new version is 3D and a well concealed S  M website that appears to provide the infliction of real physical pain to order. It's a beautiful but too selfindulgent film that ends in utter confusion.As the film begins a few executives of a French conglomerate called VolfGroup go to Japan and arrange to buy out TokyoAnim whose new 3D manga porn films are going to wipe out all competition.  TokyoAnim needs the French money to develop their new 3D technology.  Diane Connie Nielson drugs a rival in the company to operate beside Herv Charles Berling in these negotiations.Meanwhile two companies are battling for the  rights to Volf's new images on the Web Mangatronics and Demonlover and it turns out Mangatronics has recruited Diane to sabotage Demonlover from the inside.This develops after the French return from their deal in Tokyo and are visited by Demonlover representatives from the USA who're a boorish lot dominated by Elaine Gina Gershon seen here as a tattooed pot smoking babe.  Diane sneaks up on Elaine and tries to off her  or maybe she succeeds  but no because she pops right up again as in a video game.The S  M website known as The Hellfire Club' also belongs to Demonlover although its reps vehemently deny that. The Hellfire Club keeps coming up and figures prominently at the end  which is strange since Herv has told the Japanese VolfGroup cannot be into anything illegal and you wonder why a big conglomerate would allow such a marginal and questionable thing to invade their deal.Once Diane starts stalking Elaine the action becomes violent dreamlike and confusing perhaps it's all become a video game but we're not told that.  Diane flirts around with her lowerlevel associate played by Chle Sevigny but it's never clear whether they are rivals enemies or potential friends. The action becomes a matter of cars corridors beds bars seductions and voyages in the rain. The surreal atmosphere is reminiscent of Cocteau or the JeanGabriel Albicocco of the mysterious 1961 Girl with the Golden Eyes. Visually it's beautiful and the sound track is lush but the plot which was rather complicated at first now becomes incomprehensible. A promo piece by the film's US distrubuters openly acknowledges this and excuses it thus Demonlover proves most compelling when it feels the least coherent or grounded in reality. Rather than keeping up with exactly which side of the game each major character appears to be playing on at a given moment in the story viewers are almost better served just going along for the ride letting the film take them where it will.' Yes but the ride unfortunately goes nowhere.Demonlover makes skillful use of extreme closeups and intense sound. The wedding of image by Denis Lenoir and music by Peter O'Rourke and Sonic Youth creates a dreamlike hypnotic effect. But what is happening? Somewhere half way through the plot virtually disintegrates before our eyes. The same promo sheet says it's no more complicated than James Bond movie but this is unfair because in Bond movies the good guys and bad guys are usually quite clearly defined and here they distinctly are not. There is something mean spirited too in the way every nationality is abused  the Japanese are patsies the Americans are boors and the French are rude and exploitive.The latter part of Demonlover in short gives the appearance of having been edited more for audiovisual effect than for narrative coherence. Despite the intriguing audiovisual experience the film offers our interest in the plot and the characters with which the film begins is never satisfied.Another source of dissatisfaction comes from pretensions to timeliness and significance.  The filmmakers seem to think that buying and selling anim with the Bpicture tiein of illicit S  M porn sites is a significant indicator of media manipulation.  But whether it's magazines or 3D manga pornography and the imaginative or financial involvement in it are nothing new.  The way media is getting into the hands of a smaller and smaller number of mega companies is significant but that's not Assayas' interest. Anyway it's usually better not to try too consciously to be cutting edge as Assayas' declarations show him to have been doing in Demonlover.The actors are working hard but their efforts are largely wasted. Connie Nielson who has the bulk of screen time is wonderful to look at. Her face is elegant and teases is it a comehither or a buggeroff look she is flashing to Charles Berling all the time? One never quite knows. Perhaps she herself wasn't told. Her ambiguity works for quite a while. One gets lost in that face. But it doesn't tell us anything and since there is no sense of an ending the later scenes fall flat.For a movie that has a clearcut and relevant treatment of cyber crime themes and really has some bearing on the danger of global takeovers and media manipulation  but also provides the entertainment value of a clearcut thriller plot take a look at Peter Howitt's 2001 AntiTrust with Ryan Phillippe and Tim Robbins.".

Before I begin to scratch the surface of the ineptitude of this film let me explain the few things Demonlover does right.Demonlover does some things very well. It has individual scenes that work on their own either as erotic vignettes Chloe Sevigny playing videogames in the nude  an Asian girl seducing a French man at a club after his lover leaves. or plot actions dosing a bottled water with Halcion before the film ventures down the rabbit hole twenty odd minutes in.The general plot of Demonlover is a French conglomerate is looking to buy an adult anime company. Because of this a rival Adult anime distributor has sent a corporate spy to put a kibosh on the proceedings. That is the story there is some silliness about a forpay torture and bondage site but ther story in a nutshell is an Anime buyout scheme.So how can a thriller dealing with bondage and Hentai and starring Chlo Sevigny Gina Gershon and the hot redhead from Devils Advocate Connie Nielsen possibly go wrong? Well for one thing there are cloistered nuns that know more about marketing animated porn online than writerdirector Olivier Assayas does. I often complain about movies where the writers and director have clearly never worked in an office 13 Going on 30 for example but this is over the top. The French as an example are worried about a secret website that makes lots of money. If the website makes lots of money wait for it it probably is not a secret. Moreover I am sure that cornering the online Hentai traffic is an unattainable goal. After all how hard is it to draw new tentacle porn? In addition I doubt many corporate spies scale the sides of buildings or poison colleagues. Moreover with the silliest script this side of The Core you cannot depend on the ever confusing and contrived plot.I know I praised the sex scenes above but with this cast I was expecting more a lot more. Also I often did not know where the movie was taking place. are they in Tokyo or France is a popular game you can play. Then there is the car chase at the end that looks like an outtake from Vanishing Point. As Tom Servo would have said Meanwhile in another decadeThe film is overlong very confusing somewhat boring and the characters IQs seem to drop every scene. After the fifteenth fade to black transition I actually screamed end already at the screen.In reality this seems to be a badly done remake of Videodrome. Olivier Assayas is clearly no David Cronenberg. He cannot even tell a simple story in a believable and entertaining manner. Or take advantage of three of the hottest actresses in the business.".

Corporate power double crossing hentai anime and interactive torture websites all come together to form something that might mean different things to different people. The performances are great though. Gina Gershon ShowgirlsBoundFaceOff looks better then ever only problem I wanted to see her more.

And she does somewhat of a good job trying to keep it together. But it must be hard when the director intentionally cuts crucial parts of the story leaving the audience guessing and the character development nonexistent. Instead we get unmotivated scenes with porn or nudity. I guess the director wish to say something with that but to me this is not more of an intelligent challenge it is far less.

That was ultimately not what this movie is.The movie starts out interviewing tons of frantic glee fans about who they like most and then one by one you see a few of the characters and they talk. From there it is just one huge jumbled mess there is three stories that are being told throughout the movie. Three stories that I felt played no part in the glee concert at all and could have should have been left out. The movie jumps a lot. It goes from a very short performance fades to black and then starts something else whether that be a story or a backstage thing. What really bothered me is that they really didn't perform that many songs and I doubt the real audience was watching these three kids lives.Overall I don't think that the movie was as good as it could have been. They didn't perform more than maybe 13 songs all of which were shortened versions the majority of scenes used in the trailer weren't in the movie they emphasized too much on these three kids who had nothing at all to do with glee and to my surprise there was a lot of lip syncing it was really obvious. Other times the record playing in the background would be louder than their microphones so you couldn't hear them. Only their voice recorded in the studio which is still lip syncing. Only one performance really stood out in the whole film and the rest were really boring. The best part of the movie was getting the free cheap ironon glee 3D totebag.Were the performances good? Not really. I feel that one night could have been spent filming this. Instead of filming at a ton of different locations. A few of the performances were badly lip synced and sounded exactly as they did on TV. Was it funny? Not really. The only funny parts were the 2 or 3 scripted backstage scenes where they went into character surprisingly most of the characters were left of for these scenes.Does this substitute for the real concert? Not at all. I can't imagine them really singing 12 or 13 shortened songs and playing a bunch of videos for a concert. This should have been called Glee 3D The concert documentary. If this would have been a concert I would be furious and request a refund.Do I recommend seeing it? No. This was a waste of money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Glee the movie has arrived in theaters and has been receiving sensational reviews some stating it to be one of the best movies of the summer. Various reviews mentioned brilliant song and dance numbers fun and witty dialog and behind the scenes shots showing the cast getting ready for the concert. I'm here to give my insight on the tale about the 3D event of the summer centering on the musical T.V. show.Glee 3D starts out showing thousands of fans of the popular TV show standing in front of the camera and giving the loser sign the show has made popular. The audience unfortunately is subjected to watching various die hard fanatics in their Glee attire as they tell the audience who their favorite characters are and in some cases why they are. Once we get through the sea of Gleeks we get a backstage look at Rachel Berry Lea Michele as she shares how she keeps her vocal chords in shape for the show. A few backstage shots which are mainly the characters getting their makeup put on and saying a few lines. After about ten minutes into the movie the audience gets to hear their first song which believe it or not is Don't Stop Believing by Journey and in a pretty awesome opening we get an intro to cast of characters.It's here I'll say that a majority of the songs in this movie are only excerpts from the live stage show. Fans looking to hear the complete versions of songs and fantastic dance numbers will be disappointed to hear that most of the songs are only about a minute long. A few numbers are almost the complete song but these songs are few and far in between. Although I'm not a big fan I have to admit that the songs they picked have a catchy bumpy beat. A few of the numbers even have a good blend of dancing and special effects but it is still not enough to call this the best movie of the summer. I'm also here to tell you that the dance numbers the commercials have shown are constantly interrupted with shots of the Glee fans going insane in their seats as they scream in excitement at seeing the cast on stage. To tell you the truth about half the cinematography focuses on the fans a majority of which are screaming girls.In between the shots of screaming fans and show excerpts the audience is subjected to one of two different scenarios. One scenario is the backstage preparation you were promised. The backstage is really nothing more than one or two members of the cast acting as their characters in the show making a couple of quick remarks to the camera which are weak attempts to get a laugh out of the audience. There is no backstage rehearsals no warming up dialog and no good luck rituals so if you're expecting to see this you'll be disappointed. The other scenario the audience is subjected to is getting an insight into three real life stories about die hard Glee fans who state Glee has changed their lives. Throughout the movie the audience gets to hear about how hard these three kids' lives were and how they were considered freakslosers. However a shining ray of hope Glee in this case came to their rescue and now they are better people because of it. Although it is meant to be emotionally stimulating and inspiring most of the editing accompanying music and what the kids say is more eye rolling than anything else. I'm glad the kids' found happiness and acceptance by friends but the fact their stories were in a movie about the concert made me feel that these stories were used to pump up the already over inflated egos of the Glee cast. These stories really just didn't seem appropriate to be in a concert movie and instead should be in a documentary or a news clip on T.V.Perhaps the biggest thing that made me mad about this movie was the fact that it was only shot in 3D. The whole time I watched the film I found the 3D pointless as it provided no special benefits to the movie i.e. better depth in shading or things flying out of the screen. In fact I found the 3D more distracting than anything else as I saw the constant shadows of the screaming audience move across the screen taking my eyes away from the film. Thus the only reason I could think of shooting this film in 3D is that they wanted to make more money at the boxy office.To finish up this review Glee 3D seems to be more of a fan glorification movie than an actual concert movie. Although the songs are sung in the fashion that fans like and some of the dance work is still as vibrant as ever the screaming fans and small song excerpts were really not that impressive. Tie in the fact that the back stage shots are weak and the fan stories that take up the rest of the time feel overacted and you have the mediocre film that is Glee 3D. The Robbie score for this movie is somewhere between a 4.55.0 and I suggest going to see the live show the editors of the movie threw together to make this movie it's probably a better use of your money. Until next time my friends this is Robbie K signing off.Please email me at rgkarimmail.roanoke.edu to provide constructive criticism.".

I really didn't mind the skits on those three fans and how glee changed their lives being in the movie I think it made it even more enjoyable. I agree the timed used for those could have been used to show us more songs and allowed us to hear the full songs instead of those 1 minute tracks but as I said it was good.My only problem that I had with the movie of not seeing Mr Schooster. I was like expecting him to pop up any moment in the movie and everything would be just perfect I've not heard why he was not there but I supposed something might have happened for him to not been able to come.So what I will say to the producers please give us another movie and this time bring in Mr. Schooster and more music.Oh and let's not forget that little kid who was singing to Blaine's songs was the hit of the movie for me. I just loved it. And Rachel Berry and Finn are just awesome singers.One other huge thing I loved was when Artie got up from the wheelchair and was dancing I just got up from my bed and started dancing with himlol.So glee fan or not and you just watch the series because you like watching TV series or you are a music lover then I recommend you to go watch this movie and don't listen to the bad comments people say about this.This is my first ever review so guys don't be too hard on me.".

It was also nice to see Dianna Agron on a big screen out of the entire cast I think she is one of the only ones who will have a sustained career once the show finishes.I'm surprised that this movie is such a box office flop considering what a juggernaut Glee is it's just plain weird to see it failing the way it is. I went to a 3pm session on a Monday at a very popular cinema in Sydney and me and my partner had the entire theatre to ourselves not one other person was in the cinema. So we basically had our own private screening we just got into it thoughwe had a bit of a sing and dance.Another thing I will point out is I think the use of 3d worked very well this is probably the first movie I've seen where the 3d was good and not just blurry and the surprise cameo by Gwyneth is excellent.So yeah Just go with it there's a lot if fun to be had if you just take it for what it is. Long Live Rachel Berry!!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a Glee fan. I don't like or dislike it. I hardly knew anything about Glee before watching this movie. To cut a long story short on why I chose to see this film at the cinema is because we had time to kill in the day had money and wanted to see a movie. Yes so out of the likes of 'Harry Potter' and 'Super 8' currently showing why to choose Glee? We wanted a new experience. And that's what we got.I was aware that concert movies are... bad. I'm referring to 'Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience' and 'Hannah Montana  Miley Cyrus Best of Both Worlds Concert'. Neither of which I've seen but have got bad reviews. They both boast about the fact they are in 3D like Glee 3D. However don't judge a book by it's cover.Whilst settling down in my seat aware of how many of the opposite sex and crowded the cinema had been for a long time I was wondering Is this a film only Gleeks will benefit from seeing?. The lights were off and it begun.One thing I noticed about the movie is that it's not just about the concert. It's halfconcert halflooking at fans and how Glee 'changed their lives'.The concert. It was very well choreographed. The dancing was great and so was the singing. All of the cast were very friendly with the crowd and I enjoyed that.The fans. Their stories were original and they were touching. However it didn't make much sense. Admittedly they were saying how Glee helped them in life but it seems it may have been a way to fill up 45 minutes.The content was good. But you need to think. How is the concert shown to the audience. The camera angles changed frequently and the concert effects i.e. smoke were good.The movie boasts about being 3D. So just how good was that? Average. The microphones popped out of the screen and some bits like right at the end where the cast released streamers were impressive.Unfortunately only the concert scenes were in 3D. So only half of the movie feels like you're there. But I suppose the experience is like you're at the concert watching Glee at the arena not in your cinema seat. Still shooting the fans' stories in 3D would have been a nice touch.Overall if you're looking for a concert movie better than the others where the 3D effects are OK watch Glee 3D. However more could be done with the actual CONCERT. It is Glee The 3D Concert Movie after all. If you don't know Glee and want to become a Gleek or if you are one already Glee 3D is for you.510.".

To cut a long story short on why I chose to see this film at the cinema is because we had time to kill in the day had money and wanted to see a movie. Yes so out of the likes of 'Harry Potter' and 'Super 8' currently showing why to choose Glee? We wanted a new experience. And that's what we got.I was aware that concert movies are... bad. I'm referring to 'Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience' and 'Hannah Montana  Miley Cyrus Best of Both Worlds Concert'. Neither of which I've seen but have got bad reviews. They both boast about the fact they are in 3D like Glee 3D. However don't judge a book by it's cover.Whilst settling down in my seat aware of how many of the opposite sex and crowded the cinema had been for a long time I was wondering Is this a film only Gleeks will benefit from seeing?. The lights were off and it begun.One thing I noticed about the movie is that it's not just about the concert. It's halfconcert halflooking at fans and how Glee 'changed their lives'.The concert. It was very well choreographed. The dancing was great and so was the singing. All of the cast were very friendly with the crowd and I enjoyed that.The fans. Their stories were original and they were touching. However it didn't make much sense. Admittedly they were saying how Glee helped them in life but it seems it may have been a way to fill up 45 minutes.The content was good. But you need to think.

This movie deserves more good reviews than it has been receiving. Also it's another chance to hear the beautiful voice and talent of the late Cory Monteith. For me? That makes this movie worth buying too see his shining face. Ever star shines on the screen.

	schema:reviewBody "Glee The 3D Concert Movie 2011 Dir Kevin Tancharoen  Cast Dianna Agron Lea Michele Darren Criss Chris Colfer Cory Monteith Glee has become a phenomenon on the TV circuit where its characters all associate with music while presenting a message where everyone has a place. In this film adaptation we are given a 3D concert by those associated with the show and they perform various popular songs that we know from superior talent. If you're a Glee fan then you will likely embrace its attempt at the box office. If you're not a Glee fan then you will find yourself glancing at your watch constantly. The music numbers are performed with great passion and energy but none of the stage performers are remotely interesting. We are given glimpses of fans expressing what the show represents to them. There are two segments that save the film. One involves a homosexual who tells of a crush he had in school and how his journal was misplaced and eventually exploited. Now he is able to accept his sexuality thanks to a character from the show. Another entry involves a cheer leading female dwarf who tells of her date to the prom and her becoming prom Queen. These stories are largely predictable but they hold together better than anything performed on stage. Gwenyth Paltrow appears for an on stage cameo where she performs. The point of the film is to celebrate the popularity of the TV show and its impact upon its fans. It attempts to touch our emotions through music and confessions with celebrated music yet contains no substance. Those unfamiliar with the show may not be gleeful towards attending. Score 6  10".

Watching the entire cast of Glee perform is very entertaining and the  3D effect makes the movie so vivid and lifelike. I felt like I was  there enjoying the concert! The movie is very highspirited and gives  off good vibes and delivers positive messages such as have  selfconfidence and it is okay to be different. I like how the movie  goes behind the scenes of the Glee cast because Gleeks and the rest of  the audience can identify themselves with the various personalities of  the characters. The movie has several scenes where Gleeks are  interviewed about who their favorite character is or tell experiences  about how relating to a certain character on the show helped them pull  through a tough time.  I recommend this movie to children 7 and up. It does not have  inappropriate language sexual scenes and is not complicated or  difficult to understand for children since there is not much of a  storyline. The movie is also rated PG. Glee The 3D Concert Movie is a  fun movie pick to see with friends but is also an engaging family film  connecting both parents and kids through music. The wait is finally  over! This movie will be coming out in theaters August 12 2011.".

The 3D affect made the dances pop. If seeing them sing and dance on T.V. fills you with glee you will certainly get a rush seeing them in 3D. It was awesome! The glee cast shines as usual. If you are a person who can not wait until the next show each week you definitely want to see this. I am glad I did. I hope they do this concert and movie at the end of each remaining season and of course hope there are many more seasons!".

My friend went to the concert and still loved the movie as the cameras can get a better view as well as multiple views of the stage. This is the first movie that I really appreciated 3D in a movie. The 3D affect made the dances pop. If seeing them sing and dance on T.V. fills you with glee you will certainly get a rush seeing them in 3D. It was awesome! The glee cast shines as usual. If you are a person who can not wait until the next show each week you definitely want to see this. I am glad I did. I hope they do this concert and movie at the end of each remaining season and of course hope there are many more seasons!";

The basic story was a good idea and the acting was good but the execution of the story was dreadful. It has so many holes and so many ridiculous and unrealistic parts that I found myself screaming at the TV and not in a good way. The fact the killer escaped in the first place was bad enough but what follows is tedious 'tom and jerry' like sequences that made no sense at all...why didn't she have police protection from day one why could killer run and jump around 2 days after been shot in leg why didn't he just kill her on any of the 10 times he was in her house...the list goes on but the biggest question is why was this film ever made?".

	schema:headline " Shamefully Rejected Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Released through United Artists THE UNFORGIVEN 1960 is an engaging drama set on the Texas Panhandle of the American west. Nicely photographed in Panavision and colour by Franz Planer it was skillfully directed by John Huston who it has to be said was something of a stranger when it came to directing westerns. Written for the screen by Ben Maddow it was based on the novel by prolific western writer Alan LeMay The Searchers. Burt Lancaster not only headed a fine cast but he was also producer of the project with his partners Ben Hecht and James Hill.Lancaster is Ben Zachary the inscrutable and patriarchal elder son of the Zachary family who are raising cattle on their barren land. Together with his two brothers Cash Audie Murphy Andy Doug McClure and his partner Zeb Rawlins Charles Bickford they are preparing to drive their herd to market. Then appearing out of the blue one day comes an old sword wielding saddle tramp James Wiseman who begins to spread the story that the Zachary brothers sister Rachel Audrey Hepburn is in reality an Indian who was adopted by Ma Zachery Lillian Gish as an infant. On learning this the local Kiowa tribe want her returned to them resulting in the Zachary's unbridled resistance leading to an all out battle to the death.Performances generally are excellent throughout! Lancaster as usual is superb and gives a perfectly measured portrayal of the man left with all the decisions. Audrey Hepburn in the most unusual role of her career is also excellent though her London accent does sneak out now and then. But the surprise performance comes from Audie Murphy who eschewing his matine B picture cowboy image is quite amazing as the Indian hating brother hellfire Ben we can kill them before breakfast. This was the actor's second best ever performance! The other being his brilliant portrayal as the young troubled Yankee trooper in The Red Badge Of Courage 1951 which was also directed by his director here  John Huston. Also notable is the appearance of Lillian Gish 18931993 as the mother. The female star of such great silent classics Birth Of A Nation and Intolorance is terrific as Mattilda Zachary an old woman who for years has concealed a crucial secret. But it is curious that John Saxon's striking portrayal as the half breed Johnny Portugal gets to be written out of the picture! His part looked very promising in the early stages of the movie but all of a sudden and without any reason he disappears and is never seen again.Adding greatly to the atmosphere is the marvellous score by Dimitri Tiomkin. With an attractive and lingering main theme the piece was a minor hit in the early sixties when a cover version was recorded by piano duo Ferrante  Teicher. Also there is some exciting cues for the cattle and horse sequences and ominous music underlines the scenes for the Indian attacks on the Zachary's humble sod cabin. It is one of the composer's best scores! Unfortunately however it is not very well recorded. There is a pervading echo quality from the music throughout the picture which at times is a tad irritating. Tiomkin conducted the score in Rome with an Italian orchestra.THE UNFORGIVEN wasn't a particularly well liked movie by critics. Even Huston himself didn't like it. But over the years it has slightly gained a cult following and gets better with each viewing. For me its high production values its great cast performances and its racist undertones make it a compelling movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This splendid film is an accurate picture of postCivil War Texas life  much as John Ford had earlier done with Alan LeMay's The Searchers . The neighbors of a frontier family named Zachary Burt Lancaster  Audie Murphy  Doug McClure and their mother excellently played by Lillian Gish turn on them when it is suspected that their adopted daughter was stolen from the local Kiawa tribe . Then  the battle between white men and Kiowas go on the warpath . Problems emerge when a secret about a mestizo results to be discovered . As a Kiowa tribe claims that the daughter it was Audrey Hepburn's only Western is one of their own  stolen in a raid and she will be excluded for both races .Offbeat Western about racial intolerance focuses an enjoyable family and the dramatic deeds happen when a dark secret surfaces . It's an interesting western with exceptional interpretation from protagonist duo  Burt Lancaster and Audrey Hepburn . However  Audrey Hepburn was seriously injured when she was thrown by a horse between scenes spent six weeks in the hospital healing from a broken back and when she returned to the set was able to complete her role wearing a back brace John Huston blamed himself for the mishap and hated this movie and Hepburn bore no ill will towards the director  while Audrey was in hospital Huston filmed scenes using a double . Furthermore  a likable Doug McClure as his kind brother  he is very fine as well as Audie Murphy as Cash the hotheaded brother who reacts violently to learning his sister is a red skin Indian . Special mention to Lillian Gish as their affectionate mummy and Joseph Wiseman as the crazy Kelsey . The picture was well produced by Harold HechtJames Hill Burt Lancaster  they wanted to ensure its commerciality and change the film's direction  they wished to cast Kirk Douglas as Lancaster's brother which would throw off the balance in the brothers' relationship. The first effort at a rewrite did not work and after fifty pages into the second rewrite the original writer  J.P. Miller  quit the film and broke off his relationship with the producers and being hired Ben Maddow who wrote the script based on the novel written by Alan LeMay . Glittering and shimmer cinematography is perfectly reflected on spectacular outdoors and colorful interiors by cameraman Franz Planer  though Oswald Morris says in his memoirs he was offered this film. Emotive as well as thrilling musical score by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin .The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Huston who saw the film as an opportunity to make a serious comment on race relations but the company thought anything along those lines should take a back seat to making it a commercial success as actionadventure . The flick was made in a good time of the 50s and 60s when Huston resurged as a filmmaker of quality films and with the momentum in his favor as John hung around in Hollywood this time to write andor direct some of the finest American cinema made including The African Queen  The jungle of asphalt 1950 Red badge of courage 1951 Moulin Rouge 1952 Moby Dick 1956 The unforgiven 1960 Misfits 1961 Freud 1962 The night of the iguana 1964  they were for the most part wellregarded but certainly not close to the level of his earlier revered work . He also experimented behindthecamera with colour effects and approached topics that most others would not even broach including thoughtprovoking themes and psychoanalysis . He subsequently directed successes such as Fat City 1972  The man who would be king 1975 and Wise blood 1979. He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano 1984 Honor of Prizzi 1985 and Dublineses 1987. Rating  7'5 above average  worthwhile watching . This odd western  The unforgiven  is one of John Huston's main films  a model of his kind  definitely a must see if you are aficionado to Western film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie  providing exciting scenes and unforgettable dialogs .".

Go beneath the dialogue and watch the body movements facial expressions and withheld unspoken emotion of these superb actors esp Gish and Lancaster. Check out the incredible performance of the wraithlike howling itinerant evangelist Joseph Wiseman who seems to know the secret. The score by Dmitri Tiomkin is terrific with a minimum of Hollywoodstyle Native American drumming and flute playing. Indeed the music played by the Kiowas during the break was fascinating. Although the story is set in 1800s Texas panhandle the theme is universal and hardhitting racism and a family divided by their differing views. I found the portrayal of the Kiowa culture to be accurate esp the use of costumes and rituals. Remember this film was made in 1960 a time when racial intolerance was rarely put on film and the fair presentation of Native Americans was almost nonexistent. Indeed this is why Huston wanted this project. Remarkably this film is NOT proIndian or prosettler rather it's an honest depiction of a clash of cultures. My only disappointment a minor one was that the film ended rather abruptly for my taste almost as if they ran out of film. But then again I'm not a director!

The idea is quite unique and works well allowing a western a psychological and dramatic depth that otherwise would hardly have reached. The question is deeper than it seems one of the men in the family who grew up thinking that he was the girl's brother shows that he feels all that feelings that are usually condemned between siblings. Luckily for him she's not really his sister...The film is quite interesting has a sufficiently well structured story doesn't stretch too much in sentimentality nor it's absolutely cold. The location of the footage scenarios and costumes are convincing and appropriate to the historical period. The problem with this movie is the cast. Although none of them have a performance that I can clearly label as bad the choice was thought out without regard to the script. Thus we have an extremely white and European Audrey Hepburn in a character who is Amerindian Indians who are Caucasian men painted... an out of season carnival. It may not seem like it but it takes a lot of quality out of the film.".

	schema:headline " The Most Ambitious Western Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Not to be confused with Clint Eastwood's 1992 film Unforgiven THE Unforgiven is a 1960 John Huston film that is almost worthy of joining Eastwood's as one of the top ten westerns of alltime. That it falls slightly short of that status could be because Huston withdrew from the project in postproduction after the studio insisted on toning down his message of racial tolerance to give the film more commercial appeal. Although this tampering tends to cloud his political message it is still there if you do conduct a little analysis. The Unforgiven does lay claim to the distinction of being the most ambitious western of all time.Based on an Alan LeMay novel as was John Ford's The Searchers The Unforgiven presents the flip side of the search for a missing sister. Here it is an Indian looking for his sister who was abducted as a baby by a white man and then adopted by his family. The obvious complaint is that the Indians are the villains in both films by a kind of damned if you dodamned if you don't logic. But there is a distinction as the little girl in The Searchers was abducted when she was nine years old and she retained a desire to be reunited with her white family. The girl in The Unforgiven Rachel played by Audrey Hepburn has only known her adopted family.John Huston once said that a good story should have excitement color spectacle and humor adventure high drama tragedy good conversation truth and irony. Even the studio version of The Unforgiven does a pretty good job of bringing all these elements to the screen. The most obvious sign of studio tampering is the inconsistency in John Saxon's character Johnny Portugal a halfbreed who is often harassed by the local cowboys and is meticulously set up to be Ben's Burt Lancaster rival for Rachel's affections. But Portugal mysteriously disappears from the film by the halfway point and there is no attempt to resolve his situation with Ben and Rachel.Ben is the eldest son of a ranching family. Audie Murphy is the middle brother Cash. Doug McClure is Andy the youngest brother. Lillian Gish is their mother Mattilda. Since their father's murder by the Kiowas Murphy has been a violent racist.The film's title refers to the attitude of Abe Kelsey Joseph Wisemanlater to play Dr. No a bearded halfcrazy avenger who has tormented the family for many years ever since his son was abducted by the Indians and Ben's father refused to trade Rachel for Abe's son. The twist is that only Wiseman and Gish know that Rachel's biological parents were Indians everyone else including Rachel believes that she was the only survivor of a massacred settler family.Rachel has grown up to be a loving and happy young woman. Huston's intention is to demonstrate that one race is not inferior to another that while cultural differences are very real there is no biological reason for racism. When Rachel's actual parentage is revealed it divides the family Cash leaves to go on a wild bender the other two brothers distance themselves from Rachel and she from them and the surrounding settlers shun the family.One scene is absolutely riveting Rachel is comforting the mother played by June Walker of the boy she was to marry. Walker slowly looks up at her and then suddenly goes absolutely ballistic. Hepburn's stunned reaction appears to be absolutely genuine as if Huston had altered the script and not told her about the change.Interestingly the climax actually occurs just after this and before the final shootout. The Indians come to the homestead to take Rachel. She attempts to join them reasoning that they will spare her family once they have her. Ben physically restrains her and has Andy shoot one of Indians rendering Rachel's intended sacrifice useless because the Indians will now attack to avenge the killing. But more important this demonstrates to Rachel that they still consider her their sister the first sign of this since everyone learned of her Indian parentage.You can quibble that Hepburn is physically miscast at a minimum they should have made her hair darker but the story requires that the character look nonIndian as she has been successfully passing for a white girl for many years. Watch for the scene where she is on the corral fence watching the cowboys break horses. She simply glows in this shot. How ironic that someone who was so closely associated with high fashion and glamor would look her most beautiful as a dusty tomboy and a dirtyfaced flower girl.My only real criticism of the film is the moronic nature of the final shootout. There was no need for a war party a handful of Indians would have been better. Otherwise this is a thoughtful and entertaining story that moves along briskly as Huston nicely crafts a number of rounded characters. He utilizes a variety of camera angles and positions which enhance the story without drawing attention to the technique. Lancaster is excellent as man of character and conviction who manages to convey the conflict between brotherly love for his adopted little sister and the growing sexual attraction between them. Gish is amazing and Murphy turned in the best performance of the whole ensemble playing against type and showing an unexpected range..Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The person in question is Audrey Hepburn who's been raised by Lillian Gish as her own daughter and sister to her three sons Burt Lancaster Audie Murphy and Doug McClure.It was an unwritten law of Hollywood that no one shoots a film in Monument Valley except John Ford.

Audrey Hepburn fell off a horse and was injured for a few weeks. Audie Murphy nearly drowned in a river. Topping it all off according to a recent biography of Burt Lancaster was the fact that Lillian Gish served as a kind of back seat driver to John Huston. She was forever telling him that D.W. Griffith did this or that a different way. But apparently Ms. Gish was satisfied with the finished product because she acclaimed Huston as another Griffith when it was over.The story really gets going when some Kiowas come knocking on Lillian Gish's door demanding Audrey Hepburn's return. When it's discovered that Hepburn in fact is an Indian the reaction of the neighbors and some of the family is to send her back. Lancaster Gish and McClure aren't having it though.The Unforgiven was butchered in the editing department. One role that was mostly left on the cutting room floor apparently was John Saxon as a halfbreed named Johnny Portugal. Standing out though is Joseph Wiseman as the crazy excavalryman now turned preacher who has a hate for Audrey Hepburn.

	schema:reviewBody "This literate firstclass philosophical western about racial intolerance on the frontier from Maltese Falcon director John Huston Asphalt Jungle scenarist Ben Maddow toplining Burt Lancaster Audrey Hepburn and Audie L. Murphy as the leads ranks as a classic concerning survival of the fittest and the challenges that a family of liberal Texas settlers face against their peers when one of their own is exposed as a Native American. Reportedly Huston abhorred the final project and the production was not without its many controversies between Huston and Lancaster. Hepburn broke her back during a rehearsal when she fell off a horse. Sources say that Hepburn took responsibility for the accident but like Huston she had no fond memories of the movie. Nevertheless despite their clashes and Hepburn's medical problems The Unforgiven qualifies as a superlative adultoriented horse opera about the complications that arose between the Native Americans and the settlers one of whom is a sad elderly horseman Abe Kelsey Joseph Wisemanwho later played the villain in Dr. No who creates all this chaos when he outs the Hepburn character as a Native American. It seems that he holds the Zachery clan responsible for the death of his son.Maddow's screenplay is a sophisticated narrative about the Zachery clan that carefully sets up virtually all the incidents such as the racial truth about the heroine and pays them off. The Unforgiven in other words is a realistic downtoearth oater that still packs its share of surprises. Audie Murphy delivers a standout performance as Lancaster's brother who is dead set against Native Americans and can smell their stench. As usual Lancaster is his stalwart confident self striding purposefully throughout the film while Charles Bickford makes quite an impression as a patriarch of a nearby family that splits up after they learn about Hepburn's heritage. John Saxon is good in a supporting role as an Indian cowboy named Johnny Portugal. Of course Lilliam Gish of Birth of a Nation 1915 is outstanding as the mother of Lancaster and Murphy. The Unforgiven was derived from Allen Le May's novel Le May wrote the original novel that director John Ford used as the basis for his classic horse opera The Searchers with John Wayne. The Big Country lenser Franz Planer provides gorgeous widescreen cinematography with several interesting pictorial compositions. At 125 minutes The Unforgiven has been skillfully and carefully written and staged for maximum impact right up to the last five minutes of the action when the Indians have destroyed the ranch house and are poised to kill everybody.".

	schema:headline " A Clash Of Visions";
	schema:reviewBody "The Zachary's are a proud family of five on the Kansas frontier. Mattilda is their mother and she rests easy. Ben is the eldest son he is charming and well respected within the community. Rachel is his adopted sister who is carefree. Cash is quick and easily made angry. Andy is still a boy yearning to experience manhood. Their father was murdered in a Kiowa raid so they hold a grudge against the tribe. One day Rachel sees an old one eyed man who stares at her peculiarly.When the man visits her home her mother picks up a shotgun and threatens to kill him. She doesn't and in no time her brother Ben comes home from a cattle drive to Wichita. They hold a dinner for a neighboring family and Ben's partner in the cattle drive. Flirtations abound and Charlie Rawlins a neighbor asks Ben permission to date Rachel. He begrudgingly agrees as he loves his sister.Then one day a local Kiowa tribe shows up on the Zachary's doorstep claiming that Rachel is one of their tribe. The racist town quickly begins to turn against the Zachary's and even the family itself begins to question their loyalties.As you read above the film had a tough time making it through production and Huston and Lancaster were constantly at odds. One meant for the film to be a straight up western while the other meant to make a serious commentary on racial relations in America. Obviously their visions clashed. This could have made for a very interesting hybrid but unfortunately it was Lancaster's vision that reigned supreme and the film was a pretty ordinary western stylistically.I do wish that Huston could have had his way with the film and created something different. However some of Huston's vision still remains. These parts feel stylistically different from the rest of the film which made the film a little muddled. However it is still an interesting film.I am a big Hepburn fan and this was a very interesting performance. She gave her typical charm in the first half but in the second half she showed her shame and confusion at her circumstances. It reminded me of a similar performance in The Nun's Story. Lancaster has always been an interesting actor at least for me. At his best he shows man ferociously in love with his sister and yet ashamed of her roots. At his worst well he is stilted and his delivery feels forced. Thankfully he is at his best for most of the film especially during the thrilling climax.War veteran Audie Murphy gives the best performance of the film however. Cash is a force of nature his blithe hatred of the injun runs deep. He is the most fully realized character in the film. Lillian Gish is good as well and her performance reminds me of her similar character in The Night Of The Hunter. The cinematography perfectly captures the sunbaked landscape of the west as most westerns do. I found nothing particularly special in the way it was shot nor in its overall look.The score is over the top on strings in the way all Tiomkin scores are. It is unmemorable to say the least. Huston's direction is good but I feel as if he was holding back a little. The film was certainly ambitious for a western at the time and I cant help but feel as if the film had great potential but it wasn't carried out in the way it should have been. I really do wish that Huston could have had his way it would have made a much more interesting film.There are of course two things that some may find shocking. For one Ben's love for Rachel. It goes farther than brotherly love. I understand that they are adopted siblings but I find it shocking that this kind of taboo subject was seemingly okay in 1960. Still that was the year of Psycho...The other concern of mine applies not only to this film but most westerns of the period as well. The racism is so rampant and seemingly accepted that I felt incredibly sorry for the native Americans who are killed because one of them wants to see his sister. Indeed the prejudice is so shocking that it even surpasses The Searchers which is incredibly racist as well. I don't want to seem all PC but at points it can be shocking. Cash threatens his sister whom he loved and grew up with and knew all his life just because of her origins.I do wonder what the title has to do with the film. Who is The Unforgiven is it Rachel can she not be forgiven because of her roots? Is it the town for rejecting a respected member just because she was born of native American parents? Is it Ben for wanting his adopted sister? I guess given the date and context the first explanation is the one that is most applicable. Or perhaps they just thought the title sounded really cool it does.Anyways I am not saying the film is bad. It is quite watchable even entertaining. It is suitably dramatic at points and light at other. The climactic shootout and the first hour are a bit too long but it gives you time to meet the characters. It may not be Huston's best film but it is interesting enough to hold your attention for 121 minutes. It sounds like a failure but it feels like what it is a western.The Unforgiven 1960 Starring Burt Lancaster Audrey Hepburn and Audie Murphy Directed by John Huston 710 BThis is part of an ongoing project to watch and review ever John Huston movie.

But Audrey Hepburn could never sound like she should be in a western. She does seem to try hard at it but she can't shake away the FrenchPosh EnglishCockney accent. But who really cares in the end. It must be really difficult for an actress to look really good on the set of a western with all that dust and everything but she looks real good.Another reason why I like this movie is because of Audie Murphy. Sure ol' Burt is a pro at this kind of thing but he'll never be as cool as Audie Murphy. He's the one with the most conflicts My sister an injian!?!?! then he goes off drunk to his girlfriend Georgia. When she begs him to marry her I'm Drunk but I not THAT drunk. Ha! Ha! The film also has genuinely tense and frightening moments and we owe most of these moments to Joseph Wiseman playing Abe the guy with the sword. He didn't even blink and that eye just stares right at you but seems to be out of focus at the same time like it's looking right through you. It wouldn't be that surprising to see something like that in recent films because they've done psychos and demonpossessed aplenty since the seventies. But in 1960 it probably was real scary.Saying it like the 'injians' FILM GOOD YOU GO SEE FILM.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many respects The Unforgiven is a dreadfully stereotypical 1950's western. Forty Indians attack hundreds are killed and forty ride off sadly this would have represented most of the ablebodied warriors in the Kiowa tribe at the time this film is supposed to have occurred. Most seem to be played by Italians. Values are again stereotypical but the film has aged in a rather unusual way the lead characters who were written and directed to be sympathetic and largely admirable people are changed in the light of modern values into the role of antiheroes. Lillian Gish here recast in her Night of The Hunter role of a shotguntoting grandma has hidden a dark secret allowed innocents to die in her efforts to preserve it and won't reveal it even to her daughter until impelled by her entire family. It is a lie that poisons her life and that of her family for years. She is cast as virtuous for keeping that secret but clearly she would have had a better hope of happiness if she had not kept the lie. Burt Lancaster here reprises Gregory Peck's role of a strong but obsessed cowhand in Duel in the Sun a film that also starred Lillian Gish with a role for Walter Huston this time with his obsession focused on Audrey Hepburn but bottled up even tighter. His madness and his moral vacancy is revealed when he threatens to kill men for saying something that he knows may be both true and important and still more when he kills an Indian under a flag of truce because he would rather die with Audrey than surrender her to her birth family. Audrey finally surrenders her nobility when she starts to kill her family starting with attacking warriors and ending with her own brother who has braved death several times just to meet her and has never raised a hand against her. He the only heroic character in the film never speaks to her. I could go on to discuss the gaping character flaws in some other characters  played by Audie Murphy and Charles Bickford  or the sparks of nobility seen in the tortured villain Kelsey played by the early television star Joseph Wiseman  but the pattern is clear Huston aided by the passage of time and the recasting of social values has turned virtue and vice around in this film until the stars are all antiheroes.".

	schema:headline " Very little to like about this film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is an unlikable mess and somehow I got suckered in to watching the whole stupid thing. No wellordered review here I'm just going to list things about the movie I hated which is just about everything.At the beginning of the movie there is a weird old man who wanders in. He knows a scandalous secret and comes to tell it. The secret is that one Rachel Zachary living amongst her adopted white family for all her life is not white herself but an Indian.That's right the film would have us believe that Rachel Zachary Audrey Hepburn is a fullblooded Indian of the Kiowa tribe somehow living amongst her adopted white family for a number of years before the secret is out. I could accept that she is a halfbreed and indeed I was under that impression for most of the film which would go a long way towards explaining how the secret could be kept for so long but really to reveal that she is a fullblooded Indian and that she needs to be stripped down in order to confirm this is simply an insult to the intelligence. BTW the weird old man ends up getting hung but I couldn't for the life of me say why.This movie is making some sort of statement about racism. Well if it wanted to give the idea that whites were racists against Indians mission accomplished. Everybody in this movie hates Indians and that includes Rachel even after she finds out she is Indian. And at one point after she makes the point that she is a Kiowa her adopted brother Ben Lancaster declares only in blood not in anything else. Let's just say my sympathies were not with the Zachary family from this point.Actually they had already lost my sympathies when Ben orders his youngest brother to kill a Kiowa who had come in peace. The Indians also learn Rachel's secret and want her back into the tribe. They're willing to barter for her and come to the Zachary home under a flag of truce. Then Ben gives his order which effectively ends any peaceful negotiation. The Indians then besiege the Zachary home. But here I find even if my sympathies somehow were with the Zacharys I would have little need to worry. Because every single shot the Zacharys fire hits and kills and Indian. Every. Single. Shot. Even Rachel conflicted over her heritage and loyalty to her family manages to kill one without even trying. The Zacharys meanwhile suffer one fatality Mother Zachary. And the Kiowas don't seem to have a single firearm. Later when the Zacharys are cornered in their cellar by a fair number of Kiowas another brother of Rachel's comes to the rescue and turns the tide all by himself. It's another insult to the intelligence.The reason Ben orders his brother to kill an Indian is because Rachel intended to go to the Kiowas willingly and Ben did as he did to prevent this also his family became ostracized after Rachel's secret was revealed so Ben felt there was no way out in any case. But Ben's love for his sister is revealed to be more than fraternal which is disturbing despite the obvious fact that Rachel is not his biological sister. Rachel meanwhile ends any doubt that she hates Indians when she murders one who turns out to be her own biological brother at point blank range.There is happy music at the end of the movie when the Zacharys sans Mom Zachary walk out of their house and stand awkwardly in the sunshine beholding all the dead Indians and a flock of birds flying in V formation symbolizing...something...Anyway I detest this film. It makes me feel ill just thinking about it. I can completely understand why director John Huston didn't like it either.".

Well if it wanted to give the idea that whites were racists against Indians mission accomplished. Everybody in this movie hates Indians and that includes Rachel even after she finds out she is Indian. And at one point after she makes the point that she is a Kiowa her adopted brother Ben Lancaster declares only in blood not in anything else. Let's just say my sympathies were not with the Zachary family from this point.Actually they had already lost my sympathies when Ben orders his youngest brother to kill a Kiowa who had come in peace. The Indians also learn Rachel's secret and want her back into the tribe. They're willing to barter for her and come to the Zachary home under a flag of truce. Then Ben gives his order which effectively ends any peaceful negotiation. The Indians then besiege the Zachary home. But here I find even if my sympathies somehow were with the Zacharys I would have little need to worry. Because every single shot the Zacharys fire hits and kills and Indian. Every. Single. Shot. Even Rachel conflicted over her heritage and loyalty to her family manages to kill one without even trying. The Zacharys meanwhile suffer one fatality Mother Zachary. And the Kiowas don't seem to have a single firearm. Later when the Zacharys are cornered in their cellar by a fair number of Kiowas another brother of Rachel's comes to the rescue and turns the tide all by himself. It's another insult to the intelligence.The reason Ben orders his brother to kill an Indian is because Rachel intended to go to the Kiowas willingly and Ben did as he did to prevent this also his family became ostracized after Rachel's secret was revealed so Ben felt there was no way out in any case. But Ben's love for his sister is revealed to be more than fraternal which is disturbing despite the obvious fact that Rachel is not his biological sister. Rachel meanwhile ends any doubt that she hates Indians when she murders one who turns out to be her own biological brother at point blank range.There is happy music at the end of the movie when the Zacharys sans Mom Zachary walk out of their house and stand awkwardly in the sunshine beholding all the dead Indians and a flock of birds flying in V formation symbolizing...something...Anyway I detest this film. It makes me feel ill just thinking about it. I can completely understand why director John Huston didn't like it either.";

	schema:headline " A troublingly realistic look at racial bias in 19th century Texas!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read the comments posted about this remarkable movie and have to wonder if the writers watched the movie. If they did it reflects an appalling lack of historical knowledge. Audrey Hepburn plays Rachel Zachary a Kiowa Indian girl stolen during a raid on a Kiowa camp. Abe KelseyJoseph Wisemansays it was a vengeance raid because renegade Indians had massacred some settlers. He says we killed and we killed til we had to lay down tired of the killin. It did not matter whether the village they raided had anything to do with the killing of settlers or not. Will Zachary who does not appear in the movie prevents Abe from killing a tiny Indian girl and takes the baby to his wife who is grieving the loss of her own newborn girl. Will is later killed by the Kiowas in an attempt to retrieve the baby. Rachel is raised as a white girl by Matilda Zachary Lillian Gish a cultured Southern woman who hates the desolate North Texas ranchland where she has finally settled after many moves to escape the vengeful Abe Kelsey. He rides vengeance on the Zachary's because Will would not give him the girl to trade for a son that he refuses to believe is dead and not captured. Matilda in an effort to hold back the ugliness of the country and it's people has taught all of her children to read and to have an appreciation for classical music. Cash brings her a piano when he returns from a cattle drive which she later plays to make Medicine against the Indians. Ben Zachary Burt Lancaster and his brothers Cash Audie Murphy and Andy Doug McClure have made themselves and their neighbors rich by rounding up the plentiful supply of wild cattle that roamed Texas after the end of the Civil War and driving them to the railheads in Kansas. All of the people of the region share a common hatred of Indians and halfbreeds. That is where the title The Unforgiven comes from. A vicious back and forth war has been waged for the vast amount of land along the Red River and the Indians have been defeated and placed on Reservations in Southern Oklahoma. Up until the early 1900's there is a legal bounty on Indians just as there is on coyotes. The Kiowas and the Comanches in particular are considered by the settlers to be less than human. With no real knowledge of the culture and traditions of their enemies there are a lot of mistaken ideas about Indians. This is evidenced when the women are told to strip Rachel and look at her body. The belief at that time was that Indians had no body hair. Ben and his brothers do not know that Rachel is not their sister until they find a buckskin page from the Kiowa Book Of Days in their dugout cabin after they return home from the hanging of Abe Kelsey. Mother confesses and Cash who is an extreme example of the local hatred toward Kiowas leaves his family to face the Indians alone. Rachel who has hidden a guilty love for Ben who she believed was her brother tries to go out to her Indian brother and stop the killing. Knowing that there is no way that Rachel can fit in as a native and realizing that he loves her Ben prevents her from going by killing a messenger from the Kiowas who is under a white flag. The story ends with the death of Matilda atoning for her sin of first stealing and then concealing the origins of her adopted daughter the return of Cash to aid his family and the death of Rachel's true brother by her hand. All of the family has made their choice. Rachel will marry Ben there is no other possible match for her now that it has been revealed that she is Indian and the Zachary family will stand alone until times and attitudes change. The only flaws I found in the movie were minor. There was no explanation of how Ben was able to read the Indian signs on the buckskin page left in the cabin. There was not enough development of the character of the Kiowa Chief so that the expending of blood for the sake of one girl seemed excessive. One had to assume that the Indians were trying to regain some of their pride by retrieving the stolen girl and were willing to die for that reason but that was not explained in the script. The movie is beautifully filmed. The supporting cast was exceptional. Audie Murphy gave the performance of his life. A movie well worth watching if taken at face value.".

If the white settlers were to do the same thing they would be considered heroes for doing so  they'd make a movie about it with John Wayne as the hero  call it The Searchers!

All in all a well constructed narrative from Alan Le May one of America's best western writers of old. Hence I was very impressed when I saw it long ago.Not so today...Now I think that the casting of Audrey Hepburn as Rachel just doesn't fit with the milieu and the story she's still too genteel for the likes of the rough settlers of those days  way too clean overall. In fact that's a criticism of most westerns of that time they all tended to show the people of that era as being very clean cut and wholesome when in fact any glance through some photographs in history books show them as they really were  men unshaven all men mustached dirty dusty and illfitting clothes for men and women totally decrepit looking houses Hence there is a lack of authenticity to this and others  for example Vengeance Valley 1951 Vera Cruz 1954 and too many others. But that's Hollywood I guess... However the production values of this movie were not as bad as TV's Bonanza for example.The story however is interesting  what you might think of as a reversal of fortune. In this narrative the girl Rachel is Kiowa stolen by white marauders twenty years earlier. Now the Kiowa turn up to buy her back but the Zachary family refuses Ma Zachary played by the great Lillian Gish knows that Rachel is not white. So when the truth comes out  everybody finds out that Rachel is Kiowa  the Zachary family is ostracized by the other settlers. Inevitably the Kiowa return to do battle with the Zachary family at their farm and the killing begins.From one perspective the theme is that of Family what does it mean to be who you are and how and why do you belong to the people around you? The story shows naturally that there are points beyond which those values become confused resulting in prejudices taking over.Paradoxically a more important question is this once in a family situation what is the better moral choice given diametrically opposed value systems? From one perspective it seems that Rachel makes a sensible although somewhat calculated choice. And yet by doing so she seems to reject her own true identity. Which in turn brings into question the whole concept of identity. The story avoids  perhaps suppresses is a better word  that dilemma completely relying instead upon the Family as being the triumphant icon upon which to base true values for the proper functioning of society. Identity after all is a very personal thing  and the implication is that it should remain so.The cast apart from my observations about Hepburn whom I greatly admired as an actress is very good Lancaster bares his ivories with great gusto as usual Charles Bickford shows how well he could act  again a very young John Saxon infuses a small role with dignity and competence Joseph Wiseman is perfect as the mad soldier wandering the desert Lillian Gish shows steely determination as befitting a settler matriarch and Audie Murphy gave maybe the best performance of his too short career.Overall however I have a feeling that Huston's heart wasn't in this one although the direction is competent as you would expect. His forte was in dark moody intricate expositions of the human condition and human comedy in a Balzacian sense  The Maltese Falcon 1941 The Treasure of Sierra Madre 1948 Heaven Knows Mr Allison 1957 Reflections in a Golden Eye 1967 and many others. The genre of western he did only seldom The Red Badge of Courage 1951 being the closest prior to this The Unforgiven. So I wonder whether he signed up simply because it was a production from HechtHillLancaster?Having said that it's worth seeing as an above average western... for the times. I still prefer The Searchers 1956 however.".

	schema:reviewBody "by the way I'm not going to spoil the whole story I just state certain characters in this movie. Do not worry about this review even if you haven't watched this film yet!The movie starts off from old rangers from Goranger to Goseiger fighting against Zangyack main antagonists of Gokaiger. And whole plot takes place after the Big fight between old rangers and Zangyack.Protagonists of the film are main rangers from Gokaiger and Goseiger. Antagonists are Zangyack and villains from old super sentai series.The story was good and appropriate for children there was no hardcore violence scene and such. Some scenes of the film were very funny and I and people in the theater were laughing. And 2 things that I was very impressed about film were...1. Some fight scenes showing my favorite rangers YES! All of rangers show up in this film! 2. touching moments of DenjiBlue from Denjiman and RyuRanger from Dairanger.Even though I never grew up of watching Denjiman and Dairanger unfortunately Power Rangers series only included white ranger and thunder megazords from this TV show DenjiBlue and RyuRanger played significant rules in this film. Without them and old rangers this movie was going to end up as a normal movie packed with full of action. Especially for people who watched Denjiman and Dairanger you gotta grab tissue paperhandkerchief. And there are more old rangers that appear besides DenjiBlue and RyuRanger and I won't tell you! By the way the reason I didn't give 1010 vote is because there are some scenes that bugged me. There was a fight scene that Gokaiger and Goseiger teams up and fight against some characters I'm not going to say who they are and the scene gave me huh? how the heck they manage this? types of questions especially for people who believe MMPR or other old rangers are the strongest rangers then the scene will bug you a lot LOL. Other reason was they used old footage from old Super Sentai series and I wished a film director and his crews made new footage based on old footage old footage is very noticeable.Overall this movie is fantastic!!! I highly recommend this movie for people who grew up watching Super Sentai series Power Rangers series and Dynaman was introduced in old TV show Night Flight in US. If you have children it's your chance to let your children know how AWESOME and COOL your favorite rangers are!!! I can't wait for Gokaiger vs. Gavan coming up in 2012!!!I appreciate for creators and actorsactresses involving this film!!! Forever Super Sentai Series!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Forgiveness or Revenge When faced with the criminal destroying everything you stand for which path would you choose? What leads to spiritual enlightenment following a preacher formally educated in a religious discipline or a peek into a heart filled with childlike innocence. Can a human truly be classified as being God or Devil or are both entities inside each of us and only the circumstances dictate who manifests outside? With a biblically inspired tale set in the backdrop of the lives of Christian fishermen in Southern Tamil Nadu these are some of the questions director Mani Ratnam seems to be asking.While the ideas of sin redemption revenge forgiveness in cinema have been around since the beginning of cinema itself the choice of the sea as a backdrop allows the director to use the various moods of Mother Nature to elevate the emotions in the depicted events and credit in this regard is due to the cinematographer Rajiv Menon. For a movie with seemingly lofty intentions the actors do not disappoint. Arvind Swamy as the pragmatic priest who uses carrots and sticks to straighten a boy with an adverse past Gautham as the enigmatic young hero in constant struggle to grapple with his place in the society around him Thulasi the young convent girl who refuses to grow up and Arjun the man who made a deal with the Devil and would stop at nothing to get ahead all of them play their characters convincingly. The disappointments in the movie are the under utilization of some songs in the excellent soundtrack and the final showdown which although shot splendidly could have packed a stronger emotional punch either through better dialogue or by tweaking the storyline. Part of this could have also been an outcome of editing and one hopes that an uncut version of the movie releases on DVD at some point that better explains these problems.Following Thalapathy and Raavan this is the director's third venture to be inspired by a religious epic. While the other two movies were more direct retelling of the Mahabharata and Ramayana Kadal is not quite a reinterpretation of an epic but characters and events were certainly inspired by the stories from the Christian faith the betrayal crucifixion resurrection. Is it mere coincidence that the hero born as a child to a woman named Mary and constantly referred to as God's son in the movie sported longish hair mustache and beard on his thin visage almost reminding us of the Biblical son of God. Of course if indeed the purpose was make a movie inspired by the story of Christ then unlike Raavan and Thalapathy why is religion an explicit element in this movie. Perhaps since the question posed is that of choosing a path for life a religious backdrop is inevitable. In a tale about forgiveness Christianity may have provided the ideal landscape.Director Mani Ratnam it appears has indeed traveled a far distance from his evergreen hits such as Mouna Ragam Roja Anjali where the movie takes you through an emotional journey without necessarily asking you to stop and think about what you just saw. Movies such as Raavan and Kadal have through their subtextual intent made us question our premises about their stories and possibly our own.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Raavanan Mani Ratnam has returned behind the camera and has delivered us Kadal English The Sea a drama film which revolves the story of the life of IndianTamil Christian fishermen. It features an ensemble cast that includes Aravinth Swamy Arjun Sarja Ponnvannan Lakshmi Manchu and dbutantes Gautham Karthik son of actor Karthik Muthuraman and Thulasi Nair daughter of actress Radha. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by the two time Academy Award winner A.R Rahman and the voices were lent by A.R Rahman Vijay Yesudas Sid Sriram Abhay Jodhpurkar Harini Shakri Sri Gopalan Haricharan Chinmayi Tanvi Shah and rapper Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam. The lyrics were penned by Kaviperarasu Vairamuthu his son Madhan Karky and rapper Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam. The film was written by Jeyamohan while Rajiv Menon and A. Sreekar Prasad handled the cinematography and editing. It was produced by A. Manohar Prasad and Mani Ratnam.The film has two story lines that become one. The one features Father Samuel Fernando aka Sam Swamy and Bergmans aka Meesaikaaran Sarja while the other one features Thomas aka Tom Karthik and Beatrice aka Bea Nair. The film marks a comeback for Swamy. He was last seen in Mani Ratnam's Alaipayuthey which was released 13 years ago. We can say that Aravinth Swamy owns the film even if the main actor is Gautham Karthik. The film's strongest point is the screenplay which was handled by Jeyamohan. The screenplay was simply amazing specially the childhood scenes of Thomas. Both the child and the teenager who portrayed the younger Thomas have done a fabulous job. Both Karthik Muthuraman and Radha can be proud of their children. They have delivered a wonderful and neat performance. Specially Gautham Karthik. His acting skills dance skills and action are pretty impressive. Thulasi Nair is natural but I didn't feel that Beatrice was a suitable role for her. Aravinth Swamy was at his strongest performance after Bombay 1995. He was simply the perfect choice to portray Father Samuel Fernando. Arjun Sarja the action king who has delivered a bunch of successful action packed films in the 90's has portrayed Bergmans the main antagonist. Sarja has played a role with negative shades and has shown us another side of his acting skills. Ponvannan who portrayed Thomas's unknown father has also done a good job.Rajiv Menon the cinematographer has pictured the whole film beautifully specially the songs Elay Keechan Moongil Tottham and Adiye. You will still have the shots of Thomas as a teenager when he surfs in the ocean in your mind even when you leave the cinema. A. Sreekar Prasad the editor deserves to be praised for his work as well.A.R Rahman who has been Mani Ratnam's usual composer since Roja 1992 has given the film a soundtrack with different genres. Chittirai Nila describes the difference between life and death Elay Keechan has a farmerhumpback tune Adiye has a jazz feel Nenjukkulle a romantic touch Anbin Vaasale a religious song Moongil Tottham a slow tune of Nenjukkulle and Magudi Magudi a HipHop track which gives energy in the action scenes. Kadal is the third best album of the Mani Ratnam  A.R Rahman combination.Overall Kadal is a beautiful journey you never want to miss. It is a story that tells us about the good versus the evil. It has emotions action love heart melting music extraordinary shots of jumping waves a good message and a small piece of comedy. It may not be a usual Mani Ratnam flick but if you want to look and experience something different then Kadal is definitely the right choice. Strongly recommended for everyone. Specially nonMani Ratnam fans.".

	schema:headline " Mani Ratnam concept is still strong";
	schema:reviewBody "So it's time we saw a Mani Ratnam film again. The director appears once every three years with his insurmountable reputation and brings along a ton of critics Mani Ratnam tells a grand but simple tale this time that of the Christian concept of god vs the devil. As usual manis conceptualisation skills is still untouched and gets better over the years His film metaphors the sea Kadal in Tamil to great effect.Watching a Mani Ratnam film you inevitably compare 'Kadal' with his earlier films.But the the canvas of Kadal is bigger than a mere coincidence of the scenes from some of Maniratnam's earlier movies with familiar childhood nayagan visuals of kannathil muthamittal emotions and ideology of Thalapathy and the familiar romance from Alaipayuthey. Again we cannot find any hint of the director rehashing his old work although segments of the movie have similar themes to his past work . Of course no ratnam movie is complete without his trademark events should be imagined through words and dialogues rather than shown scenes which u will find aplenty in this movie.Kadal is a story of good versus evil of retribution and forgiveness told in the inimitable style of Mani Ratnam. Every single member of the cast and crew have acted very well in Kadal The impressive part of the movie is the attention to detail of the rural landscape attitudes scenery and the mannerisms portrayed. Only Ratnam has an eye for little details borrowed from life. The cinematography in kadal is the best Maniratnam has ever produced since his 1992 magnum opus movie Rojathanks to the ever roving camera of Rajiv menon. You will feel that u are actually there as part of the story and the sea.The dbutante young lead stars are surprisingly excellent for first timers in their performance .The former heart rob of the 90s and a favourite cast of Maniratnam Arvindswamy carries the movie with a coming of age bold and divine persona. The movie marks the comeback of the actor in a graceful way.Its probably the first time Arjun has been put into a seemingly villain role and a first in a maniratnam movie and it was a pleasure to see him and his excellent mannerisms which are true to life on the big screen.If u are the kind who prefer to walk in to the trashy mainstream masala cinema and happen to dislike the movie due to its unconventional story and theme then mani has a way of enjoying the movie  that by giving u a movie of his which has the best cinematography editing and acting scenes and an accurate portrayal of a Christian fishing village .Having said that you have to actually sit through this film to experience the godsend combined effect of Rajiv Menon's stunning visuals and AR Rahman's soulful compositions. Overall well done flick but some may be too harsh to put the movie down afterall it does take intelligence and appreciation to watch a movie that borders thinly on commercial cinema and that of arthouse variety which maniratnam does exceptionally well  more so than other other director in the Indian movie industry today.We know his ability to churn out masterpieces which will never go wrong even if they are commercial flops and Kadal is the Maniratnam movie just like his past movies which lingers in your mind long after u leave the theatreDon't have to think twice . Just watch it.".

	onyx:emotionText "So it's time we saw a Mani Ratnam film again. The director appears once every three years with his insurmountable reputation and brings along a ton of critics Mani Ratnam tells a grand but simple tale this time that of the Christian concept of god vs the devil. As usual manis conceptualisation skills is still untouched and gets better over the years His film metaphors the sea Kadal in Tamil to great effect.Watching a Mani Ratnam film you inevitably compare 'Kadal' with his earlier films.But the the canvas of Kadal is bigger than a mere coincidence of the scenes from some of Maniratnam's earlier movies with familiar childhood nayagan visuals of kannathil muthamittal emotions and ideology of Thalapathy and the familiar romance from Alaipayuthey. Again we cannot find any hint of the director rehashing his old work although segments of the movie have similar themes to his past work . Of course no ratnam movie is complete without his trademark events should be imagined through words and dialogues rather than shown scenes which u will find aplenty in this movie.Kadal is a story of good versus evil of retribution and forgiveness told in the inimitable style of Mani Ratnam. Every single member of the cast and crew have acted very well in Kadal The impressive part of the movie is the attention to detail of the rural landscape attitudes scenery and the mannerisms portrayed. Only Ratnam has an eye for little details borrowed from life. The cinematography in kadal is the best Maniratnam has ever produced since his 1992 magnum opus movie Rojathanks to the ever roving camera of Rajiv menon.

Bergman Arjun and Sam Aravind separate after Sam exposes Bergman of his illicit ways. Bergman vows to avenge Sam. As with most Mani's movies there is the theme of relationship story presented in the backdrop of a larger issue.

Not convincing. Thomas Gautham and Beatice Thulasi are the young couple. Thomas is the only character that is well developed and convincing. The under tone of wanting to be loved the anger of being orphaned and the arrogance of growing up all is well melded. However the acting is quite mediocre. The experienced guys  Arjun and Aravind definitely attempted to produce good acting  but end up just average. The new comers  Gautham and Thulasi are just so so.What's up with Beatrice's character? A mentally under developed girl training to be a nurse delivers a baby  with just another guy from road while the family of the women watches on. Mani wants us to believe that? At the beginning why was she in the hospital? Why would the protective Mother reveal that Beatrice is Bergman's daughter? Too many stereo typical movie moments  Sam removing bullet from Bergman with a simple tweezers Beatrice helps child birth without any other elders help Beatrice has no memory of her childhood but once she visits her home her memories return. Why would Sam climb up the bell tower to get away from his assailants?Everything else is great  beautiful locations fluid cinematography music etc. Many scenes of the ocean and fights in the ocean has a heavy CGI feel  at least for me. Seems like Mani has made this movie on auto pilot  not paying any attention to the critical parts of any movie  story and storytelling. Not worth the time. Stereo typical 3rd grade movie.".

A true genius. Yes Mani Ratnam is truly the wizard of Indian Cinema and he continues his magical journey with his latest offering Kadal. A gem of a film in all ways.Kadal marks the comeback of the 90s heartthrob Arvind Swamy and as expected he delivers a brilliant performance as Sam Fernandoone of his best roles ever. Arjun Sarja the GentlemanMudhalvan of Tamil Cinema is just terrific as Bergmans. He is a treat to watch in Kadal.The film also marks the debut of Gautham Karthikson of yesteryear actor Karthik and Thulasi Nair daughter of yesteryear actress Radha. Needless to say these star kids can be proud of this incredible debut forever and they are indeed very very impressive. Special mention should be given to Ponvannan Lakshmi Manchu and the child artistes who played the childhood of Gautham Karthik. They were really mesmerizing.AR Rahman started his musical journey with Mani Ratnam long back in 1992 in the sensational Roja.When it comes to the songs of Kadal i felt like the Rahman of 90s has come back. Truly one of his best work.The BGM is too good and it provides the needed emotional depth to Kadal.Kadal mainly deals with the conflict between good and evil which for sure has been approached by many filmmakers in the past but not as impressive and authentic as Kadal. Each and every frame of Kadal is captivating. Thanks to the amazing work by Rajiv Menon who cranked the camera.Absolutely it's Rajiv Menon the cinematographer at his best.Kadal is truly a film that deserves multiple viewing.Beautifully written by Jeyamohan Kadal is a masterstroke of Mani Ratnam. Hats off to the legend.".

I mean for past many years Mani Ratnam has been churning out bad movies with his previous outing bombing big time! I used to be a big fan of Mani Ratnam. Notice I said 'used to'. That was the time when he made great movies like Mouna Ragam Nayagan Agni Natchatram Anjali Idhayathai Thirudathe Thalapathi and finally Roja! Any hardcore Mani Ratnam fan will freely admit these movies were the best he ever made. So when was the time I stopped or rather reduced being a fan of Mani Ratnam. It was with a movie called Thiruda Thiruda. Prior to that many felt Mani can never go wrong and any story he films will be very good without any doubt! Thiruda Thiruda changed that mindset. It proved even great filmmakers can go wrong! After Thiruda Thiruda not many of his films could match upto his best. I feel Iruvar sort of matched upto it but that movie went through lots of cuts that the final product didn't make any sense and one couldn't help feeling they watched a half baked product. So apart from Iruvar almost all of his movies have been downright horrible. He has been lowering the bar with every movie he has released after Roja!So now you understand that I went with zero expectations to watch Kadal. I felt like I don't think he can make a badder movie than Raavan! Alas! Alas! How wrong I was! This one is far far worse than raavan so much so that Raavan seems like a classic in comparison! Why Mani Why do you keep lowering your standards as a filmmaker with every new one you make! Are you having some anger against the audience that you keep torturing us with every new release of yours?I was also under impression Mani was a secular cum atheist person. I don't think prior to Kadal he has ever touched a subject related to god in any of his movies! But kadal felt like a 3 hour marathon on Christian beliefs and it didn't help the movie in anyway except leaving one in shock that a person like mani made such a film! There have been many movies prior to this with Christian backdrops  Bobby Saagar come to mind instantly but those movies didn't preach religion! It just so happened Christianity was incidental to the movie and not the main issue about it! But Kadal seems more like a movie preaching Christianity with some characters thrown in to justify it! By the way let me mention I have nothing against Christianity. I am a secular person who believes and accepts all religions as they are! So if anyone felt offended by my saying the bit about Christianity in this movie I apologise if I remotely even hurt your feelings in anyway. It's just that when you go to watch a movie advertised as a love story made by a filmmaker like mani ratnam you just don't expect to see such things!".

	schema:headline " Kadal  Sincere attempt by Maniratnam to break his own clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "Maniratnam movies always evoke a loud 'boo' from supposed massoriented audiencefor the characters of his movies are usually upper middle class intelligentsia who speak in measured tone and this pattern is fitted on to characters from other social classes as well.This clich is broken for the dialogues are written by acclaimed writer Jeyamohan and the screenplay is jointly sketched by Maniratnam and Jeyamohan. They bring out the raw energy through usage of slang that is prevalent in Christian fisherman villages of South Tamilnadu.The initial scenes in Seminary and the dialogues sets the landscape for the story of 'Kadal' which is essentially a clash of ideologies between God seeking Aravindswamy Sam and self proclaimed son of SatanArjun Sarja Bergmans. The dialogue of Arjun wherein he sayshe came to Seminary just to escape poverty does make the intent of the antagonist much clearer and also reflects the realism. The first 15 minutes of the movie essentially portrays what to expect from from the whole movie itself. The love affair of Maniratnam with Raavanan is not yet over for Arjun is portrayed as a well learned biblical scholar who engages in wishful sins.The Hero of the movie Gautham Karthik Thomas is introduced as a bastard son and the social interactions push him towards becoming Antisocial. The scenes in village transport you there as an observer and makes you realize the effort the director has put in artist selection for supporting and background roles. One of the background roles which get etched in your mind is a fisherwoman who hawks in the market and picks up a duel with Aravindswamy.Religion itself has to play a major role in the movie and the reality of how the religious functions are commoditized is brought out. The tape recorder which Aravindswamy uses to connect the people with God travels along with the movie till the very end. For the first time Maniratnam completely deals with people who live in the fringes of society and morality.The immersive experience that the movie offers can be attributed to the picturesque cinematography of Rajiv Menon who has unobtrusively sewed vast unending landscape of ocean and ocean associated land and the haunting background score of AR.Rahman. 'Magudi' song by Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam a Sinhalese Rapper sets the tone for the movie in either halves of the movie by showing how the character of Gautham Karthik develops itself from child to brash teen and his experiences with Sins.The milestone scenes includes the scene were the young Gautham breaks down before the tape recorder the first experience of Ocean by Gautham the scene were Aravindswamy is implicated in the sin of flesh When Arjun proclaims himself as Satan before Aravindswamy When Gautam experiences the first blood of birth on his hands The mental torment of Gautam when he tries to explain about what is Sin to Thulasi  the climax in mid of rough seas and of course the rousing song near the end credits.One cannot stop admiring the energy in dbutant Gautham Karthik and the comeback performances of Aravindswamy and Arjun Sarja. Thulasi Beatrice fits the limited scope offered by the story and Ponvannan as usual brings out a standout performance.The story can be pushed aside by many as a classic Truth Alone Triumph formulaic film but what makes it stand out is the layered treatment which the makers have brought in to make it more realistic. Though a fairy tale ending it brings out the grey nature of human wherein do gooder saintly Father Sam is pushed to kill Bergmans Proclaimed Son of Satan Bergman's inability to kill his estranged daughter Beatrice and the sinner Thomas insistence in saving Bergmans. The movie ends with the supposed Angel Beatrice spending her time in a rehabilitation institution.Overall a truly immersive visual aural experience and watch it for the wonderful acting performances of lead and supporting artists.And Yes Kadal is not a Romantic movie.And with respect to the ad films that were played before movie titles the news ads for National Sample Survey Office NSSO shows the desperate need for creativity among government based public relation offices. The syntax and the template of the ads are so shamelessly the same that I can recall the mid 90's ads for oral contraceptives in Doordarshan which once monopolized the broadcasting industry in India.Actors Arjun Sarja Aravindswamy Gautham Karthik Thulasi Nair PonvannanDirected by ManiratnamEditing A.Sreekar PrasadCinematography Rajiv MenonProduced by Madras TalkiesMusic Composer AR RahmanReleased languages Tamil as Kadal Telugu as Kadali ".

I was really really disappointed about some of his previous outing. At the same time I have not forgotten some of his great works like Agni Nakshatram Mouna Ragam Keethangali and Alaipayuthey. I like this Mani a lot not the one who made movies like Ravanan. I am well aware that this movie is not well received by his fans. But if you go by their reaction you are certainly going to miss a fantastic work.Everyone in his crew has given their best shot including the new comers Gowtham and Thulasi. And what a powerful comeback for Arvindsamy. For Arjun it s a very different role as he has never tried negative characters in his film career I guess. Ponvannan is amazing as always. I don't need to say much about the technicians as Mani Ratnam would hire only the best in the industry. Beautiful camera beautiful locations and some beautiful songs. So drink Kadal sip by sip.".

Too much characters in the film is another disappointment AR Rahman has done his duty. The song Adiyae is the worst ever I watched A song repeated 3 times is way too much.

	schema:reviewBody "KADAL  2013 Saw this on the release date itself. Normally it doesn't happen with Tamil movies as far as my movie watching habit is concerned.KADAL is a pretty simple story. The life of a boy who grows up among the illiterate fishermen on sea shores. But that's not just about it. its also the story of good vs evil fight. Good represented by the priest  played by Aravind Sami  and evil represented by rich bad guy played by Arjun. That's not it about it its also about how love can change someone into good and bring them close to god. Now that's it about the movie.All clichd plots no unseen situations or anything. KADAL is a normal average movie. There is nothing mind blowing or supergood story wise. But in terms of making there are few things I really loved.Songs of a movie play a huge role in pulling the audience to it. KADAL album is already a huge hit and there would be people coming in also to see those beautiful songs. I was also waiting for it to come on screen and I am totally surprised!! The sound track of the movie had different genres of songs and I was wondering what placement or picturisation they would have in a movie related to sea.Right from the moment when my favorite track MAGUDI unfolded on screen I realized that the experimentation begins then onwards. When you see the songs with the movie I felt all of them doesn't blend well. But if the songs are viewed alone they would look good and different. I liked the ' adiye.. enne enge ne' song picturisation very much for that was never what I had imagined that song would be like. MAGUDI also could have been better.As always Rajeev Menon's cinematography is beautiful and stunning in the climax scene. The climax scene in the sea reminded of Hollywood movies like Pirates of the Caribbean. I was so stunned to see that quality of vfx making it so real!!Coming to the actors in this KADAL marked the debut of two starkids. KARTHIK's son GAUTAM and actress RADHA's second daughter TULSI. They could not have asked for a greater opening than this. Gautam has some allu arjun mannerisms but other than that he looks promising. Tulsi needs an acting workshopcourse before she moves on . it was so delighting to see the wonderful actors ARAVIND SAMI and ARJUN on screen again.KADAL has very few characters only and they were very limited in the script. It seemed as if they had not much to do in the story. Screenplay could have been much better and powerful. May be the Director Sir wanted to concentrate more on the emotion side of the story rather than the actual story.. who knows?? I am no one to talk about it.".

Screenplay is little dragging. It is absolutely dull in the scenes following Sam's conviction. The concept of hero joining Bergman is unconvincingly told. I thought hero is avenging. Direction is nice. The scenes like Thomas taking the newly born baby into his hands and looking at Jesus Christ's idol are excellently shot and they show the class of Maniratnam.Music  Background Score  Music by A.R.Rahman is godly. It is divine sweet eclectic soul stirring and adjectives are insufficient. Every song is a gem. This is easily the best album from ManiARR combo since Alaipayuthey. Background Score is excellent again. Rahman has bought in the global music feel to the background score. The orchestration is superb. In short the music and background score out shines the movie itself.Other Departments  Cinematography by Rajeev Menon is topnotch effort. Watch the climax and know how good the cinematography of this film is. Editing is okay. Artwork is excellent.Final Piece  This is typical Maniratnam movie. It is dark silent and has little commercial elements. But Maniratnam's fans like me may like this film. I liked it. Plus points are some extraordinary scenes excellent music performances by Arjun and Aravind and world class cinematography.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie isn't bad at all despite shallow negative reviews by some press media who failed to see the goodness of this film. It was not meant to be the usual run of the mill entertainer in the first place From any other film maker and we'd term it an average film and pass it off without much ado but this is Mani Ratnam.

These are things we see happening in the world everyday in various forms. Mani Ratnam has handled these subjects quite a lot in the past and he has moved on to the Bible this time and has adopted a universal theme. He has identified a troubled soul a Satan an angel to lead the troubled soul from darkness to light. Mani Ratnam's Satan is unidimensional but in a strange way the unidimensional nature of the character is acceptableMuch of Kadal is a visually beautiful spectacle thanks to Rajeev Menon's superb camera which captures the sea in its many moods from serene to menacing. We have known in the past that maniratnam's movies contain beautiful visuals like in Roja . With new advances in technology his visual imagery just gets getting better and better with his recent films .Kadal is superior product in so many ways. Rajiv Menon's DIheavy cinematography achieves a really interesting look for the film. If Mani Ratnam is not quite what we remember him to be the other maestro AR Rahman shows he has lost none of his magic.The score by A.R. Rahman is eclectic and has yet proved again that he gives his best to his mentor maniratnam who introduced him to the movie industry in 1992 with the movie Roja .AR Rahman's music simply sparkles just like it did twenty one years ago for his first venture Roja with Mani Ratnam. Kadal is a solid comeback for actor ArvindSwamy the once poster boy of Maniratnam who had been missing in the industry for more than a decade Watch it because even on a bad day a Mani Ratnam is a far superior film maker than most of the film makers in India.".

	schema:reviewBody "WAY DOWN EAST was an oldfashioned melodrama even in 1920 when D.W. Griffith decided to film it. It's the kind of story that leaves itself open for spoofing but Griffith approaches the story of a mock marriage and its aftermath with earnestness and a great eye for detail.Aiding Griffith in bringing this story to life are three great stars Lillian Gish as Anna Richard Barthelmess as David and Lowell Sherman as caddish Lennox. The supporting cast includes New England types that almost parody Dickens. Kate Bruce is the staunch mother Creighton Hale the ditzy professor Vivia Ogden the town gossip Burr McIntosh the intolerant squire Emily Fitzroy runs the hotel etc.The story of love betrayal tolerance and redemption is slow moving and has as usual in a Griffith film subplots but like the very river all the actions and events slowly come together for the finale that left 1920 audiences in a frenzy. Indeed the ending is among the most famous in all silent films.Gish is quite beautiful here. In her opening scene she is in her parlor with her mother making a broom holding up the straw so that we see only her white cap and large expressive eyes. She's stunning. As Anna she goes through the gamut of shy maiden young lover wronged woman timid servant and town jezebel. Barthelmess is solid as the young and innocent David who falls in love with the servant girl.Their final scenes in the blizzard filmed on Long Island in a real storm on the icy river filmed in White River Junction VT are totally amazing. And they did not use stunt doubles. As Gish lies exhausted on the piece of ice she may or may not know that it's heading for the falls. There are scenes were her hand and hair trail in the icy river. Just amazing. Barthelmess uses the breaking ice as a trail so that he can reach Gish before it's too late. There are several shots where he falls off the ice or the ice breaks under him and he plunges into that wintry river. The entire sequence is as thrilling today as it was in 1920.Gish once wrote that her long hair froze solid from being in the river water and snapped off with the ice.WAY DOWN EAST is a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This enormously successful film lives up to its legendary reputation. But it's also disappointing. The atmospheric splendor of the cinematography and the melancholy mood set by the original musical score on the Kino Video release lull the viewer into the sense of reverie essential to appreciating this charming representation of countrified America facing the encroachment of big city evils.The story is welltold by director D.W. Griffith and the moral message of Woman's spiritual virtuosity is exploited without the sermonizing of some of his other pictures. There is a sensitivity and naturalness exhibited in the unfolding narrative of Way Down East and a graceful style seen in none of his other epicscale ventures. In bringing the sweetness of his famous onereelers to a major feature film Griffith captured an almost magical tone and ambiance that distinguishes Way Down East as a masterful piece of intimate storytelling rivaling Broken Blossoms 1919 in its intensity and sheer beauty.However it must be said that Griffith's sideline excesses in plot development are many and varied hindering the progression of the central tale of Anna Moore's struggle to escape her past and search out a new life. Annoying bits of slapstick humor totally at odds with the romance and tragedy of the main story are indulged in while overly sentimental touches like long wistful closeups are equally aggravating. Though otherwise superbly acted by Lillian Gish Anna her role is marred by the fact that some of her more emotional scenes are unnecessarily drawn out by Griffith. This is particularly true in the sequence of the death of Anna's illegitimate newborn.Richard Barthelmess as David Bartlett Anna's sweetheart and savior is outstandingly effective as is Lowell Sherman as the decadent cad Lennox Sanderson who deceives Anna. Not all of the supporting cast was as competent or convincing due largely to outofplace comedic impersonations. One huge stand out is Mary Hay who leaps onto the screen with a refreshing vivacity. The wit she imparts to her small role is the only really clever humor in the movie.Longforgotten today but much discussed at the time was the cameo appearance in the movie's prologue of popular New York society girl Mrs. Morgan Belmont who played Diana Tremont one of Anna's snooty Boston cousins. To do justice to her part as well as to form an exciting contrast to the pastoral images to follow Griffith went all out in the costume department hiring top fashion designer Lucile Lady Duff Gordon to design glitzy gowns for the garden party and ball scenes.Despite some errors in continuity Way Down East's celebrated climax of Anna's rescue from an iceflow as it drifts toward a roaring waterfall is perfectly paced and as thrilling as it must have been to audiences in 1920. Considering the limited special effects of the day the scenes are amazingly realistic. Gish lying unconscious on an ice cake as it zooms to destruction her arm trailing in the current is one of the most familiar silent film shots even to people who know next to nothing about the genre and although it has become almost clich its power is undiminished. As a story Way Down East is both fabulous and frustrating but its photographic beauty and emotional resonance are almost unparalleled in the Griffith oeuvre.".

Technology run wild turns the screen into an advertisement for a future we ought to be wary about. How refreshing it is to stop the clock and enjoy D.W. Griffith's Way Down East.  A friend who loves silent film lent me her tape last night and I've seen it twice putting aside for four hours everything from nonsense at work to the grim reality of war in Iraq.D. W. Griffith's name comes to the fore most frequently and not necessarily in a complimentary light with often polarized discussions of America's history as depicted in movies especially with regard to race.  Way Down East doesn't touch on historical themes but he does candidly and openly explore moral issues that in his time were either evaded or resolved with harsh condemnation of those who strayed from the path of religious dogmainspired righteousness.The wonderful Lillian Gish is Anna Moore who loses her mother and seeks being bereft of money shelter from rich relatives.  A very familiar story most recently brought to the screen in the latest adaptation of Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby.  Taken in albeit grudgingly by a rich aunt and treated with lighthearted contempt by two sisters she meets Lennox Sanderson played by Lowell Sherman.  Sanderson is a cad a seducer of innocent virgins.  Rather than the sneering evildoer so familiar to devotees of silent films Sherman invests his role with a mixture of cruel cunning and stupid incomprehension of the harm he causes to Anna. He stages a mock wedding to get her into bed and subsequently abandons the pregnant Anna. The depth of his acting starkly brings the shallowness of his character to life.After losing her baby Anna is taken in as a house servant by a sanctimonious farmer who blindly adheres to the literal letter of  biblical law.  Of course his wife is a near saint.  What next?  A love interest for Anna which she spurns believing herself unworthy of a good man's attention. Richard Barthelmess who brings a manly but compassionate character to life chases Anna demurely and respectfully from parlor room to  ice flow adrift in a raging torrent of water approaching music increases in tempo a waterfall.Anna's peril on the ice is one of the most famous silent film scenes and almost eightyfive years later it still works.  Largely that's because no one  no one  could film a scene like that as did D.W. Griffith.Incidentally in a barnyard dance scene is a very young Norma Shearer.A remarkable film that holds a viewer's rapt attention mine at least and which proves both the sometimes superfluity of words to tell a story and the lasting legacy D.W. Griffith gave us.1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Way Down East will probably be a hard pill for many filmgoers to swallow as it's a silent and very long but I would recommend you give it a try as it's also pretty entertaining.Lillian Gish gets put through her melodramatic paces by the granddaddy of modern cinema D.W.

Gish is at her best and while she may take getting used to if you've never seen her before because she is a bit twittery she is also a unique beauty with enormously expressive eyes and nervous mannerisms that make her perfect in this role as the poor innocent done wrong by the sophisticated older man. Like they say the story's as old as the hills and I was surprised but pleased at the happy ending considering she had a baby out of wedlockusually women were punished in the old films even if it wasn't their fault. Little things like Richard Barthelmess petting a pigeon on the head blossoms bouncing gently in the breeze the play of light at sunset through Gish's hair as she stands by the river.... There's an appreciation of the beauty of nature and the gentle aspects of the human soul that's not much seen anymore. Just watching the men haying in the fields the old barn dance a horse and sled heading down a long avenue of tall trees is a pleasure a record of days gone by that we don't get much chance to see anywhere else. Of course Gish floating down the river on the ice in the denouement is a classic. I highly recommend this film to any sensitive movielover.".

	schema:headline " Classic D.W Griffith Melodrama With Gish";
	schema:reviewBody "D.W Griffith's outstanding 'Way Down East' is one of the best films produced by America in the silent era. It is a monument to epic filmmaking and the talents of it's director Griffith and it's star the great Lillian Gish.In a plot very similar to that of Thomas Hardy's famous novel 'Tess Of The D'Urbervilles' Gish portrays Anna Moore a poor farm girl who must leave her relatives in search of assistance from her rich city cousins. Upon arrival it is obvious that she is in an unfamiliar dangerous world with these wealthy pleasureseeking people just look at the juxtaposition of Anna's costume at the party and the oversized door that both greets and dwarfs her. Anna meets the cad Lennox Sanderson at said party given by her relatives and the villain seduces the innocent girl. Lennox tricks her into a fake wedding in order to bed her. Anna is shocked to find out later the wickedness of his deeds. She returns home to her family a disgraced pregnant single woman. She is cast aside by her relatives and her weakling baby dies. Finally she must take to the road in search of help. On the Bartlett family farm she finds salvation and a man that could be true to her the idealistic dreamer son David Richard Barthelmess. But escaping the past will prove difficult for if she is to achieve happiness in the end.Gish is absolutely brilliant in the role of the poor simple farm girl. She was the first truly 'modern' actress of the cinema and she shows her talent here running through the gamut of emotions and looking achingly torn in every beautiful closeup. No posturing like we saw from silent exotics Pola Negri or Theda Bara Gish is truly natural. Their was no one better than her at the playing the suffering betrayed girl in the D.W Griffith Victorian melodramas. Perhaps her position as a symbolic of Victorian purity and virtue is the reason her film career in the talkies was largely reduced. Gish still had a successful film and television career in character parts for many many years after the induction of sound but her silent work will always be her lasting contribution.Richard Barthelmess who Gish regarded as the bestlooking man ever to grace the screen gives an equally fine performance as David. He is the sweet lover we all would like to have honest and true. The love scenes between David and Anna are tender and believable Lillian and Richard certainly shared remarkable chemistry.I love how D.W made this film the filmic devices he employed. Wonderful symbolism with David stroking a white dove another image of purity. The pastoral images bathed in natural light contrasted with the darkness of Anna's 'seduction'. The juxtaposition of the rich and poor. The light comic relief in the midst of drama. Oh and that 'iceflow' scene.That scene is one of the most remarkable you will find in the cinema and it was shot entirely on location. Yes that IS Miss Gish's freezing hand dragging in the ice and Barthelmess WAS the one who rescued Gish from certain peril. Remember these were the days where actors did their own stunts so kudos all round.This film is a true example of Victorianism. I actually studied it indepth in school last year as a Victorianinfluenced film and it's not hard to see it's place as one. The treatment of women unmarried mothers is revelatory the image of the 'seducer' figure is prominent and the divide between the rich and poor is clearly evident. Yes it's almost like picking up one of those hefty Victorian novels a viewing of WDE.It is not without it's faults however. It's gloriously overlong and melodramatic such was Griffith's style. Also the moralizing can get really tedious at times. You have to appreciate the context Griffith made in this in and Griffith's unique reputation as a filmmaker to properly enjoy WDE.It is a marvelous experience.910.".

His lack of sound money management is probably the major reason for his eventual failure in the movie industry he helped create and it likely is much of the cause of his artistic decline as well which I think was beginning around this time. The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance revolutionized motion pictures severalfoldan enormous peak for a career doubtless but henceforth he made some lousy derivative and prosaic filmsonly flashes of brilliance like those in this film make the remainder of his filmography worth investigating.The 182000 he paid for the rights to Brady Parker and Grismer's horseandbuggy play seemed absurd and the melodrama itself is overly sensational and ridiculous yet it's impressive how Griffith's inspired direction and Lillian Gish's performance somehow manage to make that not always seem the case. Many problems remain in the film. The message of monogamy regardless of one's standpoint on the issue the staginess and especially the comic relief add to the already inherit disadvantages of the genre. The comic relief is unnecessary ill placed and unfunny it undermines much of the picture which is overlong as a result.As for Gish this has to be some of her best acting. Aside from the competent and this time careful filmmaking she is the saving grace of the picture. She is pitiful and beautifulcomposing Griffith's ideal woman. She rises above the storylines that require her to faint four times.There's a particularly picturesque scene where Richard Berthelmess's character first admits his attraction to Gish. And I always like when Griffith rallies against busybody gossipers. The most acclaimed sequence however is of course the film's climax including the great icebreak scene which has Richard Barthelmess saving Gish from death thankfully not rape this time. It is an exceptionally welledited and photographed dnouementone of the more memorable and exciting moments in film history. Too bad it and the other virtues of Way Down East lie beside their conversely negative parts.".

	schema:headline " An old fashioned melodrama with a universal message";
	schema:reviewBody "D.W. Griffith followed up the majestic Broken Blossoms with this epic melodrama. The subtitle A Simple Story Of Plain People tells only half the story. Way Down East is a parable with simple values told on a bravura scale. At the time of release the story Griffith offered seemed out of kilter with a society on the cusp of a decade of decadence. However the Victorian messages of tolerance charity understanding and forgiveness seemed more pertinent than ever. And as much as the film is an affirmation of love honest living and general goodness it is also takes a swipe at the puritanical aspects of Christianity. It became one of the highest grossing films of the 1920's. The story is one of hardship and of suffering. Anna Moore Lillian Gish is a naive country girl sent to stay as a poor relation with her cousins in the city where she falls under the influence of a cad Lennox Sanderson deliciously played Lowell Shermann who sets up a false wedding and tricks the infatuated Anna into sleeping with him. Inevitably Anna quickly falls pregnant and Sanderson absconds leaving her to face her fate alone. And it is a terrible fate. She returns home but her mother soon dies and then in one of the films most poignant scenes the illegitimate newborn child that will be her curse dies in her arms in a boarding house. It is soon realised that Anna has no husband and she becomes a pariah unable to find work and told to leave her board. She is forced to wander to find work and finally she stumbles across a farm owned by the puritanical Squire Bartlett. At first he turns Anna away but his wife speaks to him of Christian scripture and they take her in. She lives a blameless hardworking life with the Bartletts and slowly finds herself falling in love with the Bartletts son David Richard Barthelmess but the cross she bears prevents her from giving in to her feelings. This is only amplified when she discovers that Sanderson owns an estate adjacent to the Bartletts and he puts pressure on her to leave. However her secret is only eventually when she is recognised by her old landlady. She is cast out into the blizzard by the Squire but not before she exposes Sanderson who is present as the architect of her doom. Wandering into the freezing night she finally passes out on a drifting glacier leading to one of the most exciting and jawdropping climaxes of Silent cinema. Way Down East was a labour of love for Griffith. The photography is some of the finest he was to ever produce whilst he waited for the seasons to change and for nature to flourish in order to capture and represent the changing moods and emotions of his characters. Similarly the final moments on the ice floes of the Mamaroneck river is one of the great location sequences. Gish herself who died in 1993 aged 99 never regained full feeling in her hand from having it draped in the icy water for so long. This film is open to accusations of being old fashioned but I feel anybody who levels such claims would be missing the point. This is melodrama of grand proportions and it carries within it messages and morals that are universal and timeless. And when these messages are carried by an actress as mesmerising and as dignified as Lillian Gish then as Way Down East undoubtedly proves no amount of generational drift can render them obsolete.".

To me the true judgement of a silent film's effectiveness is the ability to stir up emotions in viewers just by watching the actor's face and body movements. Lillian achieves this beautifully. I think if this were a talkie the effect would have been less.Overall this is a great film but a bit long in some parts. For example that Perkins woman with the ringlets was quite annoying and the film sometimes focused a little too much on her antics. I give it a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gish and Barthlemess are great though the latter is probably not on screen often enough and the former might have been on too long. At moments it seemed that Griffith was overindulging in closeups of Gish's wonderfully expressive face. The title cards are typically moralistic and tend to force the story into Griffith's allegory. The main problem though is the introduction of comic relief. The scenes are simply not funny and needlessly strain our attention span. And if one asks  didn't people think they were funny then?  maybe. But the Keystone Cops Keyton Chaplin and Lloyd are still funny. I was intrigued by the Gish character's affinity with Ophelia. Both young women are wronged by their lovers though the HamletOphelia relationship is never clear. And Gish seeing the river receives the titlecard Frenzied  Tortured  The calling river. Fortunately she does not drown in that wonderfully crosscut and gripping sequence. The only Hamlet director I know of who puts Ophelia into a winter river is Branagh in his film. Kate Winslett finds a hole in the ice in which to drown herself  assuming she does so intentionally. One reviewer has noted the relationship between the Gish character and the typical Hardy heroine. The reviewer cites Tess but Eustacia in Return of the Native actually drowns in a river. I also note a parallel between the Gish character and the hapless Roberta Alden of Dreiser's An American Tragedy. Although that novel did not appear until 1925 poor Roberta also drowns pregnant and in a lake. The music of the copy I watched on TCM was lugubrious but it was fun to hear some of the songs my grandfather sang  the recurring theme Believe me if all those endearing young charms along with In the Gloaming and Love's Old Sweet Song.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of D.W. Griffith's last big commercial successes 'Way Down East' represents much that was good in Griffith's directorial style and much that was wanting in it. Overall it is a very solid movie and leaves the viewer satisfied in the end. It is certainly not the ideal film to show someone who has never watched a silent feature film however.Anyone who has studied film history knows about the famous ice flow scene in which Lillian Gish put herself at tremendous risk in reallife blizzard conditions. This is the climax but it comes only after a long and occasionally dragging journey.The lovely Ms. Gish plays Anna Moore a nave small town girl tricked into a fake marriage by notorious womanizing playboy Lennox Sanderson Lowell Sherman. Finding out about the sham only after telling Sanderson she is pregnant she is abandoned and later evicted after both her mother and the baby die. Her past later catches up with her after she has established herself as a beloved maid in the Bartlett household where son David matinee idol Richard Barthlemess is in love with her. It is when her past is revealed and Squire Bartlett Burr McIntosh throws her out into a blizzard that the famed ice flow sequence takes place.There are some faults in 'Way Down East.' It is long  probably a bit longer than it needs to be. Plenty of time is spent in establishing the various characters both major and minor and the locales. There are a few spots where things seem to drag a bit. Of course Griffith strongly moralizes as usual too. One fault that some critics have flagged that I do not necessarily agree with is Griffith's insertion of comedy relief. In many films of the era this did indeed mar films. In 'Way Down East' though the bumbling minor characters have a charm of their own and are naturally enough melded into the story that their actions do not seem to be at all intrusive to me. Vivia Ogden as the gossip Martha Perkins is quite good and her interaction with Seth Holcomb Porter Strong a goateed old goat who always seems to be at the Bartletts is enjoyable. We are told Seth has followed her around for 20 years and she doesn't seem to mind his attention. Shy 'Professor' Creighton Hale is amusing at times flirting clumsily with both Martha and the squire's niece Kate Mary Hay. Perhaps rolly polly hired hand Hi Holler Edgar Nelson could be dispensed with but his screen time is limited and not a distraction. The music is at times heavy handed but is appropriate in mood setting  including the forays into comic relief.True this is a potboiler melodrama with some heavyhanded Griffith preaching. Still it also includes Griffith's famed buildup of intensity and speed as the climax is neared. It is also pictorially attractive with snowcovered New England countrysides and landscapes. Also Gish and Barthelmess never looked better. As other have noted Gish by 1920 had fully come into her own as an actress and could make a very strong argument for being the best of all silent screen actresses.There are other silent films much easier to sit through in their entirety. This one is worth the effort though. Griffith warts and all could tell a good story.".

Such sagas of innocence abused are the sort of thing sophisticated audiences love to hate forgetting perhaps in the real world there are plenty of cases of innocence abused but Gish somehow makes the melodrama believable from her joy on her wedding night that even makes her caddish seducer feel momentarily guilty to her grief over her dead baby and most famously her fleeing into a blizzard after a local gossip has revealed the truth of her past to the farm family that has employed her. This last part in particular could have become very contrived in the hands of a lesser actress the ice flow scenes practically beg for snide comparisons with Uncle Tom's Cabin but perhaps because Gish in general avoids overemoting we don't get the feeling that our feelings are being milked for the sake of sensationalism but rather that we are seeing a woman whose circumstances have earned her the right to lose emotional control. Gish is also helped by a good supporting cast including Lowell Sherman as the cad and Richard Barthlemass as the decent farm boy who courts Anna but particularly memorable is the gossip whose open glee when she learns the truth about Anna is chilling here as in Intolerance Griffith recognizes that the zeal of the righteous often has more to do with the pleasure of crucifying wrongdoers than anything else.

	schema:reviewBody "Way Down East 1920  12 out of 4 Anna Lillian Gish a naive country girl travels to Boston to ask her rich relatives for some money but once there she meets a rich man Lowell Sherman who likes to play the ladies. Soon the rich man cons Anna into a fake marriage but when he learns that she's pregnant he informs her that the marriage is fake and he leaves her. After the baby dies she's kicked out everywhere because people see her as an unwed mother. She lands a new job with a family but keeps her secret from everyone including a young man Richard Barthelmess who falls for her but soon gossip reaches the town and Anna's secret comes out.Being a huge fan of the director I'm really not sure what took me so long in watching this film. I've read countless books on the director silent era and Gish and everyone of them have mentioned the ending to this film which has Anna stuck on a sheet of ice while is quickly goes down river and nearing a waterfall but more on this later. The story itself deals with hypocrites in religion and one of Griffith's favorite subjects of the rich taking advantage of the poor. The story itself really isn't all that original but there's certainly magic all over the film. Lillian Gish the greatest of all silent female actresses turns in another marvelous performance as the poor girl who doesn't know when her heart is being played with. There's a short but heartbreaking sequence where Anna is taking care of her dying child and the tenderness and heartache in the eyes of Gish says more than any words could. The power that this scene contains is just one reason why I think silent films are more powerful than sound ones. Richard Barthelmess is also terrific as the young man who sees Anna as a virgin wife and the changes his character goes through are perfectly captures by the actor. Lowell Sherman is also terrific in his role which has to be one of the greatest villains in film history. Griffith certainly builds up the hatred towards his character and it's quite powerful. The cinematography by G.W. Bitzer is among the best of his career.You can't say Griffith today without getting into a bullshit debate about race but this is a damn shame because there's no doubt in my mind that he had the greatest mind in the history of cinema. We could talk about the battle scenes in The Birth of a Nation or we can talk about nearly any scene in Intolerance but there's no question that Griffith knew how to create suspense and really push a scene for everything it's worth. The famous scene here is the climax where Anna is stuck on the ice and it's just downright remarkable at what they were able to pull off. Various people nearly died in Griffith's 1915 and 1916 epics and that holds true here where both Gish and Barthelmess nearly died pulling off this scene. I've read countless books that talked about how this stuff was filmed but it still seems impossible that they were able to pull this off. The epic scenery and the way it's shot shows that there isn't any trickery going on which is just downright remarkable. It really blows my mind at how Griffith could pull all of this stuff off and watching it on screen is just something truly remarkable. Apparently Gish suffered permanent injuries to her hand while filming in the cold water which is just another reason why silent stars were so remarkable since they had to do their own stunts and without the benefit of CGI. Considering that the term special effects weren't into play when this was filmed it's really breathtaking to see something like this take place. It's amazing but 88years later I can't think of a scene that matches this.".

Lillian Gish the greatest of all silent female actresses turns in another marvelous performance as the poor girl who doesn't know when her heart is being played with. There's a short but heartbreaking sequence where Anna is taking care of her dying child and the tenderness and heartache in the eyes of Gish says more than any words could. The power that this scene contains is just one reason why I think silent films are more powerful than sound ones. Richard Barthelmess is also terrific as the young man who sees Anna as a virgin wife and the changes his character goes through are perfectly captures by the actor. Lowell Sherman is also terrific in his role which has to be one of the greatest villains in film history. Griffith certainly builds up the hatred towards his character and it's quite powerful. The cinematography by G.W. Bitzer is among the best of his career.You can't say Griffith today without getting into a bullshit debate about race but this is a damn shame because there's no doubt in my mind that he had the greatest mind in the history of cinema. We could talk about the battle scenes in The Birth of a Nation or we can talk about nearly any scene in Intolerance but there's no question that Griffith knew how to create suspense and really push a scene for everything it's worth. The famous scene here is the climax where Anna is stuck on the ice and it's just downright remarkable at what they were able to pull off. Various people nearly died in Griffith's 1915 and 1916 epics and that holds true here where both Gish and Barthelmess nearly died pulling off this scene. I've read countless books that talked about how this stuff was filmed but it still seems impossible that they were able to pull this off. The epic scenery and the way it's shot shows that there isn't any trickery going on which is just downright remarkable. It really blows my mind at how Griffith could pull all of this stuff off and watching it on screen is just something truly remarkable. Apparently Gish suffered permanent injuries to her hand while filming in the cold water which is just another reason why silent stars were so remarkable since they had to do their own stunts and without the benefit of CGI. Considering that the term special effects weren't into play when this was filmed it's really breathtaking to see something like this take place. It's amazing but 88years later I can't think of a scene that matches this.";

Her timid Anna is beaten down at every turn by the amoral upper classes who in Griffith's eyes are defying God with their whoring and luxurious indulgent lives.

	schema:reviewBody "When the young country girl Anna Moore played by early big movie star Lillian Gish for the first time goes to the big 'moder'n town things go from bad to worse for her. She gets tricked into a fake marriage gets pregnant her fake husband leaves her the baby dies in other words this is a melodramatic movie alright.Lillian Gish definitely shines in this movie. I'm not her biggest fan guess I'm more of a Mae Marsh person but I have to admit that she was totally great in this movie. The movie is filled with many more great and strong written and played characters with also especially some great roles from Richard Barthelmess and Creighton Hale.It was surprising to see how actually humor filled this movie was despite its melodramatic undertone and story. D.W. Griffith also had comical moments in it but this movie is almost a comedy at times. Especially the middle is mostly filled purely with humor. Quite in contrast with the melodramatic beginning and spectacular ending. It certainly goes at the expense of the drama at times.It's a well written movie in which always something is happening. Especially the drama gets well developed and always keep things close to home with real sensible emotions and feelings. It keeps both the characters and emotions always real even when they're being overthetop. It's also one of the many reasons why the ending works out so well.Definitely true that the last 20 minutes or so are the reason why this is an absolute classic and memorable movie. The breaking ice sequence with a drifting Lillian Gish heading towards a waterfall is probably better known than the actual movie itself.The movie is great looking visually with its sets and costumes but also with its camerawork and environments. The movie has some good looking establishmentshots set in the beautiful nature.Not among D.W. Griffith's best works but in 1920 perspective this is an absolutely brilliant and also really enjoyable movie nevertheless.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

She gets tricked into a fake marriage gets pregnant her fake husband leaves her the baby dies in other words this is a melodramatic movie alright.Lillian Gish definitely shines in this movie. I'm not her biggest fan guess I'm more of a Mae Marsh person but I have to admit that she was totally great in this movie. The movie is filled with many more great and strong written and played characters with also especially some great roles from Richard Barthelmess and Creighton Hale.It was surprising to see how actually humor filled this movie was despite its melodramatic undertone and story. D.W. Griffith also had comical moments in it but this movie is almost a comedy at times. Especially the middle is mostly filled purely with humor. Quite in contrast with the melodramatic beginning and spectacular ending. It certainly goes at the expense of the drama at times.It's a well written movie in which always something is happening. Especially the drama gets well developed and always keep things close to home with real sensible emotions and feelings. It keeps both the characters and emotions always real even when they're being overthetop. It's also one of the many reasons why the ending works out so well.Definitely true that the last 20 minutes or so are the reason why this is an absolute classic and memorable movie. The breaking ice sequence with a drifting Lillian Gish heading towards a waterfall is probably better known than the actual movie itself.The movie is great looking visually with its sets and costumes but also with its camerawork and environments. The movie has some good looking establishmentshots set in the beautiful nature.Not among D.W. Griffith's best works but in 1920 perspective this is an absolutely brilliant and also really enjoyable movie nevertheless.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow  this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak action packed special effects driven SciFi blockbuster about an alien invasion  what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis Bill Murray classic was obvious given the time loop premise but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily it is all the better for it.Most unexpected of all the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well is Tom Cruise's character Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey forget his usual stern poster boy heroes here he plays an entirely different character  and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an actionpacked special effects driven SciFi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion the trailers got that right albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which the rest of the cast is also very good especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does she always comes across as genuine and real here she succeeds in portraying her character  a tough seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as full metal bitch no kidding!  with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie and while they are great as usual characterwise they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. As for the SciFi spectacle that the trailers promised I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated not the Transformerstyle blur where you can't make out anything anymore and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan'  without the gore obviously after all this is PG13. The design of the aliens  the production design in general  is incredibly well done although I would lie if I said it was something groundbreaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was it IS breathtaking though.So my verdict With one of the most inventive adapted scripts for an original megabudget film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films httpwww.imdb.comlistls054200841Lesserknown Masterpieces httpwww.imdb.comlistls070242495Favorite LowBudget and Bmovies httpwww.imdb.comlistls054808375Favorite TVShows reviewed httpwww.imdb.comlistls075552387".

McQuarrie is a wonderful screenwriter and these two seemed like a perfect pair.I got what I hoped a movie that doesn't treat me like a 10year old. Edge of tomorrow is smart entertaining exciting and fun. It's an original movie as well not a sequel or a remake although I hear it might be inspired by a novel or graphic novel.Tom Cruise  who plays a slightly different character than usually  is good he always brings his best. He cares about his projects and demands to do as much stunts as possible. His passion can be seen here too and he is again a joy to watch but this isn't a movie for Cruise to carry. Liman and McQuarrie carry this movie with smart pacing transitions and that certain magic good filmmakers seem to be able to harness at will.Emily Blunt isn't a useless sidekick but a strong and likable character. Not annoyingly strong on the surface like some feminist ballbusting fantasy but a real character and deserves every minute of her screen time. Bill Paxton was fun to see as a hardass sergeant and Brendan Gleeson was good as well  even though his screen time is limited. All the main actors work well together if a scene is shared.The movie flows in an interesting way and it likes to surprise you. I'm not talking about forced twists I'm talking about that special situation where you don't know what happens next. I've missed that feeling. I didn't have to pretend to care about the movie I was interested in every minute of it. This happens rarely. And when it ends you're satisfied. No setting up sequels no ambiguous crap just a solid fitting ending.Unlike Cruise's last scifi film Oblivion this is definitely an action movie. At first glance it may look like a generic scifi action film  and granted sometimes suits aliens it does  but there's enough personality of its own. Action looks good and the camera doesn't shake around senselessly. Also the action never goes into that overblown mode where your senses get tired and you just don't care anymore. Well done.Edge of tomorrow is a thoroughly entertaining film. It's just a summer movie but it's a smart fun and exciting summer movie. You don't have to make excuses for its shortcomings to enjoy it. It's quality filmmaking and certainly a positive surprise.910 will buy on bluray. I recommend this to everyone. Avoid as much spoilers as you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day Starship Troopers Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage played by Tom Cruise with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow  Physical funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel or time resets if you will. Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes especially in the training segment. I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fastpaced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and XMen Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.".

But on the other side i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended up. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or Ilisium with much cgieffects and bad story and no real story andor characters. So i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But then right from the beginning i knew this movie would be fantastic. The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny filled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from the beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general but this role just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really satisfied with everything. Two main characters who played perfectly a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i watched in a while and i watch pretty much movies. Even though i don't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her favorite actresses of all time.Oh well 1010".

	schema:headline " You see this isn't the first time that we've had this conversation. ";
	schema:reviewBody "Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained to laugh to be amused to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today's film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise's films you can be damn sure that that film won't disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly I have to say that I haven't seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers. The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The timeloop allows the Cruise's Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over which is many times very funny. At films with timeloop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don't have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.Tom Cruise doesn't act as his usual self here he plays against type. He always tries to come up with something new in his films. So in what role you haven't seen him yet? A wimpy coward. He once again shows what a versatile actor he is. Emily Blunt as the kick ass Rita has never been more likable in any of her films than here. she handles the action and the drama perfectly. Bill Paxton mostly just repeats his commands and lines about victory but he is just so great at that he ends up as one of the funniest characters in the film To me this comes as no surprise that Edge of Tomorrow is yet another scifi Tom Cruise film which kick ass from start to finish. What rollercoaster ride! This will be hard to top in the upcoming summer season. There is nothing wrong with this film. It's got everything. Even a helicopter crash!".

	onyx:emotionText "Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained to laugh to be amused to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today's film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise's films you can be damn sure that that film won't disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly I have to say that I haven't seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers. The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The timeloop allows the Cruise's Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over which is many times very funny. At films with timeloop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don't have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.Tom Cruise doesn't act as his usual self here he plays against type. He always tries to come up with something new in his films. So in what role you haven't seen him yet? A wimpy coward. He once again shows what a versatile actor he is. Emily Blunt as the kick ass Rita has never been more likable in any of her films than here. she handles the action and the drama perfectly.

	schema:reviewBody "Edge of Tomorrow EOT for me will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year maybe along with XMen Days of Future Past for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the same things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.I wont spoil anything because the movie is full of valuable twists surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt Full Metal Bch and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences. The first one in the movie is totally amazing. But the rest is as that good. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal.Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance in so many time. Maybe I'm not joking this is his best performance ever. For the first time he is not doing an smiling hero. He is a coward. He is a scared and inexperienced soldier who has to learn to be more skillful and to escape from his personal loop every time he returns to the same day. And Cruise is wonderful in that role. You really don't recognize him. Forget his frequent smiling his heroic or possible macho topics. This could be a new and groundbreaking role inside his career even if you are not a big fan of him I'm not going as far as saying that this is his best movie or the most enjoyable one of all but this movie could be one of his best ones too. And when a movie has a star doing his job properly and much better than expected a great script and a riveting pace the movie is never boring the whole concept has the job done. And that's the case of EOT. Also the stellar performances from Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are truly good.In fact I'm glad that this one came after Oblivion. That one was good but this one is different and much better. Don't expect Oblivion 2 or its same style because you will be wrong.Please trust me and go to the theater to enjoy this wonderful original and surprising entertainment. It delivers much more than you could expect delivers the best Cruise in so many time that I personally think that this is Cruise at his best and delivers a clever story with a good twist. Enjoy!".

The trailer also didn't give me a clear idea of what this movie was about which made it even surprisingly good to experience it! The thing about movies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same things over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However every time there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were also elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be admired.Without giving too much away I'll say that Tom Cruise Major Cage is an absolute novice in warfare who is involuntarily picked for an assault on aliens who have taken over Europe. To combat these aliens the joint forces around the world have developed a armor suit laced with heavy weaponry. He is baffled as to why he was picked when he knows nothing about warfare. That part wasn't satisfactorily answered. The first day after combat he begins to develop symptoms of living the same day over and over again. Baffled he tries to explain the situation to others who disregard his views. In Rita he finds someone who can understand his situation.There on it's a thrilling ride of finding out what's causing these repetitions and finding a means to put an end to it. The movie is fast paced so no mulling over. Little details of changes in the scenery how Cage modifies his behavior both to convince others and to find an answer and how events unfold are put forth excellently. I'm sure enthusiasts can find plot holes aplenty but I found this movie thoroughly entertaining. If you're in the mood for watching fastpaced action scifi then I definitely recommend this movie!".

Though Cage is killed in minutes in a spectacular battle sequence that echoes the opening sequence in Saving Private Ryan he finds himself starting over in a time loop repeating the same mission and being killed. Each time Cage discovers and remembers the timed events that he experienced and decides to learn better to fight the aliens he teams up with Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski Emily Blunt to defeat them but he will learn why as well he has this power and that he was not alone.The storyline was strong all the way and it never loses itself or goes overthetop the acting from Cruise and Blunt is both epic and really a game changer for both people have complained about the lack of emotion in the characters but I can admit it was not needed here much casting as well includes Bill Paxton Brendon Gleeson and even Australian actors Noah Taylor Game of Thrones and Kick Gurry Speed Racer and they all provided excellent performances.The visual effects are really top notch and even at times remind me of Elysium and even Battle Los Angeles. The actionset sequences are very well choreographed and are even tense in the opening minutes of the film. The aliens they fight are really incredible looking scary and even remind me of something out of a Guillermo del Toro film think Hellboy 1 and 2 or even Pacific Rim. The ExoSkeleton suits are being more and more awesome whenever they are used in film I just wish they had invented real ones by now.Overall EoT is a movie that will not only enlighten SciFi fans but it will keep the action junkies glued to the screen and if you like or hate Tom Cruise you may be in for a surprise".

The viewer is hooked like a trout.Three viewings so far and I expect to revisit it again.Blount's possibly best role she doesn't have a lot of dialog but her face is like a watermark on the various scenes making them unforgettable.As a scifi actioner it's a 9. As possibly the most existentialist love story ever filmed it is a 10  in the course of the entire film he propositions her and gets turned down he tries to chat her up in a car and gets turned down and then she kisses him just before she dies. All the elements of BOY MEETS GIRL are there. They are just really really really compressed.".

In my case this film will always be viewed through the lens of Groundhog Day one of my all time favorite movies my favorite film to share with my English students and most definitely my 1 RomanticComedy of all time! But despite the fact that I have seen Groundhog Day from beginning to end at least 2 dozen times this is supposed to be a review of EDGE so let's turn our focus thereIt is easy to understand why so many IMDbers have awarded 9 or 10 stars to this EDGY SciFi near classic I suppose if it hadn't been for the reason so clearly spelled out above I undoubtedly would have done the sameStill EDGE possesses many standalone qualities that have motivated me to give it a welldeserved 8 Stars! FIRST Here Tom Cruise's character Cage is a diehard desk jockey PRMarketing maturemedia prettyface type who seems at least initially to have an anaphylactic shock reaction to any and all bellicose activities encoded in his DNA! I find this an extremely amusing tongue in cheek poke at himself in some of his earlier Mr. Invincible Super Macho Ethan Hunt and Jack Reacher type roles!Another critical factor working in its favor EDGE is anything BUT a leave your brain at the door mindless ActionSciFi flick unlike so many of your typical Hollywood ActionSciFi counterparts! If your focus wanders you could be asking yourself OOPS! What just happened!?!? This film almost constantly challenges you to reevaluate your opinions and the relevance of what has transpired on screen! But don't get me wrong EDGE has enough mindnumbing action to satisfy even the most exigent of action movie junkies! At the same time it also presents us with some rather inspired and original plot twists. Don't worry No Spoilers AHEAD! Speaking of originality perhaps this is the perfect moment to mention that despite that its driving force idea seems to be a blatant ripoff of Groundhog Day at least EDGE manages to impart a good deal of fresh spin to the concept so as to give it quite a life of its own. From a technical standpoint as is the case with most Hollywood big budget productions nowadays Cinematography sound sound mixing editing effects pretty much everything is extremely professionally done. Screenplay three people with long names listed is actually engrossing and quite engaging. For those of you who usually PASS on this genre I would venture to say that quite a good number of you might find putting yourself on EDGE might be more than worth your while!

	schema:headline " A SciFiAction Gem Lost in the Summer Shuffle of 2014";
	schema:reviewBody "I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget scifi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept scifi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel that I've never read the story follows Major Cage Cruise in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens dubbed Mimics are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage an official with the military's public relations department is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt Operation Downfall. Panicked he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' Alphas but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies covered in the Alpha's blood and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day reliving events. Cage is now on an endless loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the Angel of Verdun a celebrated soldier named Rita Emily Blunt who has experienced the same phenomenon.Tom Cruise once again proves that while I'm baffled by his personal life he is a solid actor. His character Major Cage has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the nearinvincible action hero he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mindblowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer bigbudget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional mostly and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics they will need to locate and destroy their Omega an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.I have never read the novel on which EDGE OF TOMORROW is adapted All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazakaand arguably a way cooler title so I don't know who all deserves the credit for crafting such an awesome story structure whether it be Sakurazaka screenwriters McQuarrie and the Butterworths or director Doug Liman. Cage dies a lot in this film in fun and creative ways and we're exposed to a lot of the same material over and over. But it never becomes repetitive or gets old. Each trip back through the day only shows what we need to see and advances the plot. It's a creative plot device that sets it apart from the usual linear storytelling and cookie cutter plot structures the theaters are inundated with during the summer months. EDGE OF TOMORROW will do down as 2014's most underappreciated movie as audiences didn't exactly flock to see it and the hype machine died down real fast despite critic's praises. I recommend this to anyone in the market for some blockbuster entertainment that isn't the same old grind. If I were to lobby any complaint against EDGE OF TOMORROW aside from that horrible Live Die Repeat tagline that became the movie's unofficial second title it would be the alien design. The Mimics are masses of writing tentacles and do little to impress or frighten. But that's a minor complain for a movie that is otherwise incredibly solid with terrific performances from Cruise and Blunt. If you haven't seen EDGE OF TOMORROW go do so and see if you agree.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this movie i remembered last year's Now You See Me which was an unexpected and entertaining movie.This is very well paced and executed film. Tom Cruise seriously fits the character. I know the main character in the Japanese novel is a young man but man i'm glad they cast Tom Cruise in this. I'm not a fan of Tom but to me he always give 120 in every film. If Hollywood wanted it to follow the original material they would cast some pretty face teenagers that would have the same personality as the rest typical teenagers characters Stupid ignorant selfish arrogant for no reason. Thank God they didn't do that.The story is excellent and it is nowhere similar to Groundhog Day except for the day loops. it is action packed and there are plenty of funny moments. You may expect the looping days would be boring after a while but you'd be wrong.I cannot comment on the CGI because i think there is too much good CGI in every movies nowadays that i am not impressed anymore. But it does not mean the CGI int he movie is bad or anything. On the contrary it felt pretty real to me.My recommendation  GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it.PS  The only bad experience when i was watching this movie in cinema was the guy beside me who constantly open his brightly lit phone and even answered a call. another is a group of stupid teenagers behind me who keep commenting loudly on every scene thinking they were funny. SO PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE OR TALK LOUDLY IN THE CINEMA DURING A MOVIE SCREENING. Thank you.".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching this movie i remembered last year's Now You See Me which was an unexpected and entertaining movie.This is very well paced and executed film. Tom Cruise seriously fits the character. I know the main character in the Japanese novel is a young man but man i'm glad they cast Tom Cruise in this. I'm not a fan of Tom but to me he always give 120 in every film. If Hollywood wanted it to follow the original material they would cast some pretty face teenagers that would have the same personality as the rest typical teenagers characters Stupid ignorant selfish arrogant for no reason. Thank God they didn't do that.The story is excellent and it is nowhere similar to Groundhog Day except for the day loops. it is action packed and there are plenty of funny moments.

The whole LIVE! DIE! REPEAT! thing is well established with unlikely humor it really draw me into the shoes of Cage not Nic Cage it's Cruise's character sometimes it is just too interesting to look at and you almost forget the big threat they are facing. Liman did a great job here to maintain audiences' interest without being repetitive. 3. Emotional development is somehow weak comparing to the action and plot. We know there is an alien invasion coming but we just know it we don't feel it. Probably because we don't really know what Cage Again not Nic nice try cares about we don't see him care about anything except wining the war maybe at some point we feel that he loves Rita but it was not very well developed things happened a little bit rush in emotional development. As a male audience I wasn't stunned but still completely satisfied maybe I just care about the plot and action more than the emotion Just like Liman's first Bourne emotional development was lacking while the plot and action are stunning. But as a female audience my girlfriend may fell a little hard to feel for the characters to care enough for the plot and action.".

I didn't care much for that film at all but Edge Of Tomorrow is a very welcome addition to the scifi genre. I enjoyed it so much I felt like I didn't care if the end was going to come anytime soon. They could have made this film longer in my view and it would have been just as good or maybe even better.I can honestly say that Edge of Tomorrow ranks up there with the very best scifi films since the turn of the century. I did see it in 3D and I felt the 3D didn't really add anything great to the film but that really seems to be the case with all the newer 3D films. The only film I've ever seen in which the 3D actually did add something extra special to the film was Avatar. Personally I think the 3D fad can mostly be chalked up as another Hollywood gimmick that really does nothing at all except add extra cost to tickets and extra in their pockets of course. This film itself however is not a gimmick it's solid action scifi that even does have some real thought provoking moments. The writing here is good far better than most Hollywood action films. There is even a nod to Mr.Kubrick in the film. Do yourself a favor and check this out.8.510".

Okay now forget about aliens gadgets a war to save Earth.The movie is about redemption but consider this with more depth.

Interested viewers can observe the karmic underpinning of being reborn an endless number of lives the successive round as Buddhist samsara a cycle of reincarnation powered by delusion and ego.

He gets killed every time. No he will have to improvise a new self in the flow of endless lives this is sparked by a woman he meets and tells him to find her when he wakes up again. Now comes the great part.Along the way there's another shift even more powerful this is during the drive to Lyons when we suddenly notice that he's been further down the story than we have able to anticipate events because he has been down there before.Something great happens.

It all builds up to a last mission one last chance to get it right except this time they can both die. The filmmaker delivers the expected climax doing it well but also delivers something else that is completely marvelous.She kisses him as action heroes do sometimes. But she kisses him for the first time having known him for only a day trusting it is much more. He watches her go possibly for the last time having spent with her an eternity.He comes back of course at the beginning of the very first day now redeemed except no one knows he did it. It's her image being celebrated on the wall.He goes to see her one last time a first time for her she remembers nothing but now he knows her as more than an image in a story an image he made famous as part of the publicity narrative that inspires at the start of the film.She greets him now her superior with the same defiant tone as ever. Will he stay or go? Is it a first day in this affair a last day is it even one? It's all in Cruise's baffled laugh both the first day and last and having spent a lifetime together.This is absolutely breathtaking stuff but something you'll deepen with love as deep as you've known or can imagine the pieces perfectly arranged for you to do so.

The pace really done well by describing Cage deals with timeloop. There are many possibilities of a man's mind could think to take advantage of a powerful curse and I think they explore this well just like Groundhog Day.Good thing comes from the characters. They are lovable and some of them have great quotes. Emily Blunt really nailed the character of a hardsoldier that shared same fate with Cage in the past. She really balanced Tom Cruise's performance.But enough exaggerating shall I? There are minuses too. Always. The first one is the lack of preinvasion imaging of EarthI am not really sure for this one because I missed first five minutes of the movie. Damn they should have made the detail about the mimic's purpose and maybe a little twist in the credits that could open a gate for sequels duh!. The second well I think there is no second minus.Even it is not perfect I believe they have exceeded the edge of making a scifi wellbalanced either from the storyline and action.

	schema:headline " Terrific introduction for those new to Keaton";
	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to what you may have read Seven Chances 1925 was made before Buster Keaton signed with MGM and relinquished artistic control over his own films. His gifts of extraordinary agility timing and visualizing the comic potential in the most mundane situations are everywhere in evidence.The plot of Seven Chances is ancient. A young bachelor stands to inherit millions if he can find a bride by a certain day and marry at a certain hour. The date is invariably the same as the day the will is read and in the hands of Keaton his writers and cast the comic possibilities are brilliantly exploited. The same premise was the basis for at least three other films before Keaton's and was remade abysmally  from what I've read as The Bachelor with Chris O'Donnell in 1999. The chain of events that flows from news of the inheritance just builds and builds over the course of the film the gags growing increasingly clever as time grows shorter. Seven Chances clocks in at less than an hour but the final 15 minutes which Buster Keaton reportedly reworked several times are among the most hilarious in all of silent film perhaps in the history of screen comedy.Initially only Buster his business partner T. Ray Brown and the lawyer Snitz Edwards who was so terribly homely he was cute are aware of the dilemma. After Buster botches a proposal to his longtime girlfriend Ruth Dwyer he pops the question to several more female acquaintances with predictably embarrassing results. It is then that Brown and Edwards unbeknownst to Buster decide to place a newspaper announcement advertising his plight.Once the newspapers hit the streets the chase is on. Keaton is pursued through 1920s Los Angeles by dozens then scores then seemingly hundreds of wouldbe brides. They come in all ages shapes and sizes makeshift veils trailing after them. No obstacle is too great in their pursuit to beat out each other for the prize of marriage to a man they don't even know and Buster throws out plenty of roadblocks in his wake.In 1979 Walter Kerr wrote the definitive book on silent comedies The Silent Clowns. One of the jacket blurbs reads I found myself laughing out loud at routines from movies I have never seen. I don't have Kerr's gift but I can tell you that Seven Chances is the most consistently funny movie Buster Keaton ever made. All of his movies include inventive sight gags but Seven Chances more than most of Buster's movies relies on character comedy as well as situational comedy for its humor. And it scores a bull's eye on both. A sheer delight.".

	onyx:emotionText "Contrary to what you may have read Seven Chances 1925 was made before Buster Keaton signed with MGM and relinquished artistic control over his own films. His gifts of extraordinary agility timing and visualizing the comic potential in the most mundane situations are everywhere in evidence.The plot of Seven Chances is ancient. A young bachelor stands to inherit millions if he can find a bride by a certain day and marry at a certain hour. The date is invariably the same as the day the will is read and in the hands of Keaton his writers and cast the comic possibilities are brilliantly exploited. The same premise was the basis for at least three other films before Keaton's and was remade abysmally  from what I've read as The Bachelor with Chris O'Donnell in 1999. The chain of events that flows from news of the inheritance just builds and builds over the course of the film the gags growing increasingly clever as time grows shorter.

The first half of it is quite good if imperfect but the second half is a tourdeforce of sustained humor and creativity. Keaton plays Jimmie Shannon a young man who learns that he stands to inherit a fortune but only if he marries by 7 PM that very day. It's the kind of goofy premise that in lesser hands could be a complete flop but Keaton gets all kinds of possibilities out of it.For most of the first half of the film Jimmie is busy racing around proposing to every woman he can find. His true love Mary tries to find Jimmie herself but he is already off on his frantic search for someone to accompany him to the altar. The search is always funny at times extremely so. This first half has a handful of things that don't quite work such as the blackfaced servant who was though probably intended as a sympathetic character but if it were not for that and a couple other small details this would be a nearly perfect film.In the second half all of the complications set up a frantic chase sequence with literally hundreds at least of angry women pursuing Jimmie through the city while he tries to get to Mary. This might be the best comic chase sequence ever filmed. It is hilarious and incredibly inventive with careful choreography a great variety of backgrounds and a huge collection of gags both obvious and subtle. No description could do it justice  it has to be seen at least once to appreciate it.If you are a fan of Keaton or of silent films in general make sure to see this one.".

If any one of these objects were to strike him down he would certainly be killed by the impact. He is almost escaping the rocks now just a few more seconds of frantic sprinting is required. Suddenly Keaton looks up only to find a massive horde of woman striding purposefully towards him. He is stuck between a rock and a hard place an avalanche behind him and a flock of wouldbe brides ahead. Quickly and delicately weighing his chances of survival either way Keaton turns determinedly towards the barrage of boulders. It is hilarious little moments like this that make Buster Keaton's silent comedies such a joy to watch and 'Seven Chances' is certainly one of the funniest I've seen brimming with the talented actor's trademark deadpan humour.The premise on which the story is based is singularly ridiculous and so this allows Keaton to have a great deal of fun placing his character in appropriately bizarre situations. Young Jimmy Shannon Keaton loves his sweetheart Mary Jones Ruth Dwyer but can never quite muster up the courage to tell her and most certainly could never take that plunge into marriage. However one day he discovers that his grandfather has left him the princely sum of 7 million but only if he gets married by 7 PM that day! After he is rejected by Mary due to an unfortunate misunderstanding Jimmy seeks out another wouldbe bride ultimately realising that finding a wife isn't as easy as he had hoped. The first half of the film is admittedly light on Keaton's patented stuntwork but it remains a clever and witty situation comedy with poor Jimmy suffering the laughter of onlookers as he moves from one girl to the next tentatively asking for their hands in marriage.When all this fails an advertisement in the afternoonedition newspaper brings hundreds of women to Jimmy's side but by now he's realised that Mary is the only girl he could ever marry. As he struggles desperately to get to her home by 700 he is pursued by a horde of moneycrazy ladies big and small young and old beautiful and ugly. This is truly where Keaton comes into his element and a hectic scramble down a hillside  pursued by an avalanche of rocks  is the film's most memorable moment the idea for this scene came by accident when Keaton inadvertently dislodged some rocks while he was running. The preview audience responded so favourably that he decided to reshoot an extended sequence. The papermch rocks look quite convincing and I was pretty much fooled into thinking that Keaten was really dodging the real thing until I noticed him get bowled over by one of the boulders without any apparent illeffects! 'Seven Chances' moves by at such a frenetic pace that there isn't a moment that could be trimmed. Though it runs for just 56 minutes I had a huge smile on my face for every single one of them.".

But there is a catch Jimmie must marry by 7pm on the evening of his 27th birthday which is the same day he is notified of the possible windfall. He asks his girlfriend Mary to marry him and she says yes but then he bungles the proposal when he tells her the reason why he must marry her today. No girl likes to think she is being married just to obtain a fortune and Mary spurns Jimmie.This leads to Jimmie's partner Billy convincing him he must marry some girl since he owes it to their friendship and partnership to obtain the money to salvage their business. The madness then ensues where Jimmie proposes to every female in sight including famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge. The second half of the film is Buster's brainchild entirely and will have you laughing nonstop as Jimmie escapes the wrath of an entire city of thwarted brides who all wanted a shot at his 7 million and were denied. The most famous shots are the runningdownthemountainswiththeboulderschasingyou scenes invented by Buster but there are many other deliciously funny moments as well and a suitable happy ending complete with a Dalmation's kisses.See Seven Chances before you pass on. You owe it to yourself. One final note a previous commentator here wrote that Buster did not care for his Seven Chances. That is not quite true. The business situation surrounding the planning of the film did not suit him since the vehicle was chosen for him by Joseph Schenck and he preferred to do his own material but Buster did have creative control over the 2nd half of the film and it shows. When the film was restored and reshown starting in the 1960's before his death Buster Keaton was able to realize how much of a crowd pleaser this film was and he changed his mind about it. If you are a student of the 1920's and love comedy you will find lots to love in Seven Chances. It's sweet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Chances 1925  out of 4 Buster Keaton's greatest comedy is also one of the greatest comedies ever made. This film has huge laughs one of the greatest chases ever not to mention some of the greatest stunts ever captured on film. In the movie Keaton plays a shy fellow who can't build up the nerve to tell his girlfriend that he loves her. He gets a letter stating that he will inherit seven million dollars if he gets married before seven that evening but there's a mix up between him and the girlfriend but the biggest problem is that every other woman is willing to marry him for the money. I had forgotten what a wonderful gem this film is but I was laughing harder and more often than any other film that comes to my mind. I'm not sure where to start with the laughs because each scene contains one and the majority of the scenes contain multiple laughs. The film's 56minute running time feels like the matter of seconds because everything is just happening so incredibly fast. There are three great things about this film but I'll start with the laughs. I might go as far as to say that there isn't a joke in the film that doesn't work. The wonderful moments inside the country club where Keaton tries to find a wife the politically incorrect joke of Keaton accidentally asking a little girl to marry him the racial joke of Keaton almost asking a black woman to marry him and of course the wonderful gag with the dummy in the barber chair. That's just to name a few because there are at least a hundred other jokes. The second brilliant thing about the film is the fact that Keaton hired hundreds if not over a thousand women to chase him when they discover he will inherit millions. The scene inside the church with all these women trying to pile in is just something incredible on the eyes. This stunt leads to the third masterpiece of this film and that's the final twenty minutes where these hundreds of women chase Keaton either trying to marry him or kill him. Anyone who knows anything about Keaton knows that he would put his life at risk to pull off a stunt and there are at least eight different stunts here that could have or even should have killed him. Watching him perform these stunts is truly breathtaking and him running into the barbed wire is also quite painful. Oh yeah Snitz Edwards is brilliant as the lawyer and you've also got Jean Arthur in an early performance. Certainly one of the all time greats.".

It perhaps makes Seven Chances seem less original than it in fact truly is of course.The movie uses a lot of title cards. I mean basically every line that gets spoken in the movie gets shown in a title card. It also makes the dialog part of the comedy of the movie. It isn't a much visual comedy meaning that it doesn't really feature much slapstick or things like that. It's more a movie that relies on its comical situations and of course on the acting comical talent of Buster Keaton. Also the supporting cast is really more than great.The movie begins a bit standard and perhaps even a bit slow but when the movie its story starts to take form the movie turns into one great laugh fest with the last 20 minutes or so as the ultimate highlight when things start to get really crazy and paced and the movie gets turned into one big nonstop comical chase! It's the one great fun moment after the other with also some great and dangerous stunt work again from Buster Keaton himself!A great Buster Keaton mustsee from the silentera!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The trouble is he has trouble committing.The story is preface by showing his lingering engagement to a girl Ruth Dwyer but nothing ever happens. He races to her house to finally pop the question and inherit the money but he blurts out nonsense and she says no.So with partner and lawyer in tow T. Roy Barnes and Snitz Edwards they go to the country club where Buster sees 7 women he knows. They all say no. So Barnes takes out an ad in the paper this attracts every woman in town.The scene is brilliantly set up with Buster falling asleep at the church while the scenes cut back to the oncoming brides first just one here and one there and then HORDES of brides coming from every direction. Keaton wakes up in church and spies the hundreds of rides. He runs away with hundreds upon hundreds of brides in full chase.No one could run like Keaton and he takes full advantage of his athleticism here as he races across the city to Dwyer's house with the brides in pursuit. Nothing can resist the forces of the pack of brides all done up in makeshift veils and hats. They plow down a college football team leaving the boys trampled. Next they disperse a squad of cops who run for their lives from the horde.Finally Buster is running down a hill in a famous sequence in which the boulders start to avalanche down after him. They get bigger and bigger as they cascade down after him. At the bottom of the hill awaits a pack of brides but they are chased off by the boulders.Buster finally makes it to Dwyer's house but the time seems to be up.....Hilarious film and one of my favorite silent comedies. The sight of the city streets teaming with bride is just too funny. They come in all ages and shapes and sizes and colors and most of them are actually men but it is just one of the great sight gags of all time.Jean Arthur plays the office operator. Louise Carver is the lead bride. And Constance Talmadge has a cameo but I didn't spot her.The copy I have starts out with a redtinted scene and then turns to a beautiful crisp and clear sepia color. Great film.".

And Seven Chances is certainly no exception. What starts off as a romantic comedy with a witty and simple premise soon morphs into a lengthy bizarre and almost surreal chase scene that makes this movie one of the funniest and most creative comedies of all time. Although slapstick and romantic comedies are normally looked down upon in modern cinema the silent masters knew how to execute these genres with perfection and Keaton was perhaps the most perfect. The slapstick in this movie isn't just dumb pointless injury it's chaotic and complex as it escalates in insanity and humor getting funnier and funnier. Half of the film doesn't even contain slapstick and its still laugh out loud hilarious. Silent comedians may be most well known for their slapstick but they were also masters of visual situational comedy as is evident in much of this movie's running time.If you're ready for an insane laugh out loud ride you cannot go much better than this hilarious and only 50 minute long Keaton classic!".

Then his business facing ruin he discovers he stands to inherit a fortune if only he gets married that day. He proposes to Mary but she's put off by his apparent insincerity. So Jimmie is left to find a woman any woman who will marry him. Will love prevail?The film is an odd one for Keaton starting off with a brief color sequence in 1925 and moving quite slowly for Buster through the first third. The story was one Keaton had handed to him rather than one he worked on himself and feels at times like a ladies' picture focusing as it does on Jimmie's frustrated feelings and Mary's unhappiness.For a while Buster's not even the main laughgetter in the film. For a while he plays a kind of straight man to trollvisaged Snitz Edwards playing the lawyer bringing the news of Jimmie's inheritance. Snitz chases after Jimmie and his partner who think he's a processserver and dodge him but Snitz prevails. Buster still pines for Mary saying he can love no other woman which she happens to hear over a telephone connection changing her mind but agrees to bring to bring a woman to church before the deadline out of loyalty to his partner.In case two show up I'll marry the other Snitz declares.There are other oddities about Seven Chances like racial humor Jimmie almost proposes to a black woman a blackface actor plays a thickheaded hired hand and the Sapheadstyle character Buster plays. It would seem like a lesser Keaton for that but instead emerges as a masterwork of pacing and narrative. Just as you begin to settle in to Seven Chances teacozy aesthetic it ramps things up for one of the great doublerally endings in movie history.There's also a charming sequence where Jimmie tries to find a bride among a list of female members of his country club the seven chances of the film's title. He burns through those chances in six minutes and then gets rejected by a receptionist Jean Arthur and a hatcheck girl Rosalind Byrne for good measure. The sequence plays with set design and framing to keep you always wondering as to what will happen next.One amazing thing about the film you might not notice is the clever use of panning. Camera pans were still fairly new in cinema framing was often stationary. But Buster is always in motion and the camera moves with him. One clever shot of Buster finding a turtle attached to his tie apparently employs a treadmill in order to achieve an overhead camera angle.The gags here keep coming and give Seven Chances the feel of a classic Keaton short. Except there's a real story here to be told and the humor always works to move the ideas forward. It's a classic demonstration of Keaton's ingenuity  even if he didn't have a hand in the film's conception or writing he directed it and it shows  as well as his ability to find as many ways of making you laugh in as little time as possible.".

With a slow and steady build to an ending that ties everything up in a rather satisfying way you'll be asking yourself why can't most thrillers make this much sense? Fermat's Room is not original but it puts an interesting and wellwritten spin on tired plot points and movie gimmicks. Directors Luis Piedrahita and Rodrigo Sopena have a good sense of space and depth when it comes to shooting in the room itself and the tension and pacing will have you staring at the screen with anticipation.

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about this film ages ago in Empire Magazine in an article that was really talking it up in regards the use of mathematics as the base for the plot and how smart the film was like the geek of the school was also the captain of the football team. It was a long time before I got to see it for myself but I was looking forward to it because the article had made me interested in it. In reality the film is not this math and theory heavy film that the magazine had suggested because although it does use this as its base it is quite superficially done. This sounds like a criticism but it is not because the veneer of maths makes the film feel smarter and the novelty makes it feel more engaging and it works because it draws the viewer into the world without making one feel like an idiot for not being a genius mathematician. What it then builds on this is essentially a Saw movie but aimed at those who long ago gave up on that franchise for simply being one cruel gory sequence after another.The plot is engaging because it doesn't give you a gory release but rather keeps the pressure mounting in the same way as the moving walls keep the pressure mounting on the characters. Instead it gives you the overall mystery of why the characters are in the room and who put them in there but also keeps things pressurised by throwing puzzles at the characters as they move along. These puzzles do have an element of magazine puzzler about them rather than being mathematical formulae but again this keeps the film accessible for the viewer. OK the puzzles are maybe a bit in contrast with this bed of mathematics but the general tension of the film stops you picking holes in this regard. Meanwhile the walls keep closing and the characters are constantly reacting to the pressure while the audience do the same. I'm not sure how many repeat viewings it would stand up to and to be honest I'm not totally sure that the whole plot would stand up in the cold light of day either but what it works the tension really well so that on your fist viewing it is a gripping and engaging affair.The director makes very good use of the room always managing to make us feel like we are in there even as the room shrinks. There are also a couple of cool shots such as the couple of times the camera looks from directly above pulling away to show things in a different way. The cast are a driving force within the film. OK perhaps their reactions are not always totally realistic within the context of the situation but they are almost always realistic by virtue of how well they deliver. As the pressure mounts in the room they do a good job of showing it and they stay reasonably true to their characters. Are they Oscarwinning performances? Well no but they are very good at doing what the film demands and doing their bit to add to and increase the tension which is what hooks the viewer.Fermat's Room is not a brilliant film because it is not without its flaws but it covers them really well by delivering in the key area of tension. The concept is simple but effective and is built on by several layers of mystery and good performances these suck the viewer in and prevent you picking too many holes while you are watching it. Comparing it to the Saw franchise is perhaps not a fair comparison because the two are only similar in concept but it does make for an easy tag because Fermat's Room is a smarter and more enjoyable version of the Saw movies  with real tension instead of just gore it engages the audience rather than trying to gross them out and we care about the characters rather than just wishing to see how they are killed. It is perhaps not as smart as it would like to be but it is still an enjoyable and engaging film.".

And the opening scene sets the tone for a movie full of math riddles. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment after that. The riddles the 4 of them have to solve to stop the room from shrinking are not math riddles at all. Those are the kind of riddles you probably did in your high school certainly not the kind of riddles a math genius would set for others. Now about the characters  For couple of them when they were telling their back story you would have preferred some flashback scenes. Little bit of character building would have helped. Now for the big plot holeContains Spoiler So if you have watched the movie you know that one of the four actually setup the room and he had a escape route planned. However I still can't figure out at what point he was planning to escape. The other 3 would ave died only when the room would have crushed them and at that time this guy would have died too. If he was planning to escape earlier others would have escaped with him. So what was the point of this elaborate planning by supposedly a math genius?Another small plot hole some of the answers to the riddles were descriptive and it would have been difficult for the program on the PDA to check the correctness of the answer. For example how would the program check the correctness of the answer if the reply was in full sentences or broken sentences with incorrect grammar. Except the first two riddles and the one towards the end answers for all others would have been difficult to verify by an automated program.Rating it 5 out of 10 for an interesting plot.".

Of course when it comes to Math I make Forrest Gump look like Stephen Hawkins!

Ah and therein lies the rub! Like its 1 CoDirector FERMAT is just TOO busy trying to pack in too much too quickly in its 85 minutes! At times it wants to go in 5 different directions all at once! To save themselves four Math prodigies are forced to solve a slew of math problemsriddles. Another reviewer mentioned the problems shift gradually from leftlogic to right intuitive brain function...Yes that's right but I didn't really get it during the film...and I'm still in higher Math overload! Of course when it comes to Math I make Forrest Gump look like Stephen Hawkins! FERMAT needed another 20 minutes for more character development and to re work its pace so that viewers could better absorb more of what's going on without feeling so stressed and lost. I liked the name of the boat. Did you catch it?...Pythagoras! 6.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA! Any comments questions or observations in English o en Espaol are most welcome!....";

But the problem begins right there they are only given one minute per question which makes it damn near impossible for the audience to keep up. Not to mention when they begin to work out the problems on the chalkboard the camera hardly ever puts it in frame which would have been great for the audience to kind of sole the problem along with the characters. But instead the movie shifts focus away from the riddlesenigmas and focuses on them trying to figure out who has put them there and why. This is where Fermat's Room becomes derivative and generic this is very familiar territory for this type of movie and it is spun in an unengaging way. I personally would have enjoyed focuses more on the enigmas and trying to include the audience more possibly by giving the characters more time to solve them. And the unfortunate aspect of the movie is the Spanish subtitles they were very fast moving which didn't help things Just something that was unavoidable sadly. Like when the characters are dissecting the enigmas the lines of dialogue moved too quickly to follow along with how they were solving the problem.

	schema:reviewBody "La Habitacin de Fermat or Fermat's Room to us English speakers is a Spanish thriller that focuses a great deal around mathematics and problem solving in order a tense sequence of events in its own unique manner. Fermat's Room utilises concepts from various sources in particular there is quite a similarity between it and the American crimedrama that is Numb3rs were you to heighten the interpersonal action and tone down the mathematics. It also features an intertwining story line where characters are not always who they appear to be in a similar manner to those found in films such as Fight Club or Memento. Unfortunately for directors Luis Piedrahita and Rodrigo Sopea it leads to the film coming across as highly unpolished and indeed somewhat garbled in parts as it becomes apparent they clearly had their minds determined to include certain set pieces and key moments without any real idea how to properly link them together through the dialogue to create a coherent plot.Detailing the meet of four strangers under mysterious circumstances and the promise of solving the worlds most complicated enigma the mathematicians follow a cryptic series of events which leads them to an abandoned warehouse in the middle of the country. Of the four we have two young protg's a grizzled toy manufacturer and an elderly mathematician who is tired of life and is intrigued by the prospect of one last great outing. They find themselves entering an vibrantly decorated room containing a blackboard table chairs sofa several bookcases worth of material and each other for company as they await their promised enigma by the elusive Fermat. What follows is a sequence of events where they find themselves locked in this already claustrophobic room being forced to solve puzzles in under a minute and if failing finding the room closing in on them with the aid of four hydraulic compressors. As a thriller Fermat's does create moments of genuine tension as the score underlining the enclosing room does set the heart racing in a Hitchcockian ratcheting up of nerves which is superbly conveyed by two of the outstanding four cast members in Llus accent included Homar and Santi Milln. However despite the promise Fermat's Room never delivers on the expectation and finds itself stumbling along without enough plausible gravitas in the dialogue to make the revelation an openmouthed experience. Once the games begin the film settles into an all too formulaic pattern of when a puzzle is transmitted one of the four will begin working on it while the other three engage in heightened communications to try and push forward the relationships between the four characters and how they may or may not be connected. Lacking the necessary xfactor to thoroughly engage the audience the film itself also falls foul of an unforgivable sin and that is not being tight enough to make such a far fetched story even remotely believable. The film creates its own plot holes and casually drops in lines one in particular about Oliva enjoying illegal activities yet never following through on what those specific activities are. What is the point in having a character say something which potentially could further the interest in that character only to not provide resolution? If Pascal finds out that Fermat is the father of a daughter he accidentally killed why does it take the photo of his daughter after he has left the room for him to recognise him? How does the culprit plan on escaping the tightening dungeon when his proposed means of escape is perhaps the least subtle that he could imagine? Why do characters pick up pieces of information which would lead to the identity of the culprit and not follow through? The individuals within do not act with any rationale or reason especially given their logical backgrounds and lead to an all too frustrating experience indeed even more so when one of the problems that is presented within the film is answered incorrectly and that's supposed to be its main selling point.Fermat's Room was and is an unfortunately disappointing experience which promises the viewer a unique thrilling rollercoaster but presents the metaphorical equivalent of a log flume ride it's wishywashy and all down hill after the start. It is not polished enough to hit the heights that the directors have wished to achieve it comes across too often as set pieces which have been linked together and a nonsensical run of twists and interactions which are underdeveloped or not worth having been developed in the first place. I truly wished to enjoy the experience yet the more that you think about the film the more it continues to disappoint not because it is that awful but simply because it had potential to be much more than the sum of its parts. This Spanish thriller sets itself out to be a thinking mans thriller to attempt to achieve a cinematic comparison to that of a rubix cube yet after serious critical analysis comes across more like a defunct abacus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldbach's conjecture an enigma that puzzled great mathematician minds is the basis of this tale about the solving of this old riddle. Four people are summoned to come to Fermat's home for a dinner. There are three men and a woman who don't know one another but they have at one time or another tried to make sense of the poser that even greater minds throughout history have not been able to get it right.The mysterious Fermat an older gentleman is an attentive host but kind of aloof. After dinner Fermat and his guests who are given names of famous mathematicians Galois Pascal Hilbert and Oliva go into a room where they are probably going to be given drinks. The host receives a cryptic phone call on his cell phone and excuses himself because he must go to the hospital where his daughter has been taken.The four math geniuses are left with another cell phone where they begin receiving PDA messages that asks them to solve different difficult math problems going from easy to more difficult ones. As a condition if the solutions are not found in time the room will begin shrinking. Revelations about the four participants begin to emerge and the claustrophobic atmosphere begins to take its toll on the four. The menace of being crushed by the walls create tension among the four minds knowing full well they are doomed unless they find a solution that might be beyond themselves.Luis Piedrahita and Rodrigo Sopena wrote and directed this film that was a surprise when shown recently on cable. The realm of the work of Goldbach weighs heavily in the narrative. Little is known about the mysterious host whose name is also that of one of the most distinguished minds in the world Pierre De Fermat appears to know the inner souls of the people he invited to play with their minds or does he really? LLuis Homar Alejo Sauras Santi Millan and Elena Ballesteros make an interesting combination in this Spanish film that makes one wonder about what really is going on in it. Federico Luppi is only seen briefly yet his presence is all over the place.".

The host receives a cryptic phone call on his cell phone and excuses himself because he must go to the hospital where his daughter has been taken.The four math geniuses are left with another cell phone where they begin receiving PDA messages that asks them to solve different difficult math problems going from easy to more difficult ones. As a condition if the solutions are not found in time the room will begin shrinking. Revelations about the four participants begin to emerge and the claustrophobic atmosphere begins to take its toll on the four. The menace of being crushed by the walls create tension among the four minds knowing full well they are doomed unless they find a solution that might be beyond themselves.Luis Piedrahita and Rodrigo Sopena wrote and directed this film that was a surprise when shown recently on cable. The realm of the work of Goldbach weighs heavily in the narrative. Little is known about the mysterious host whose name is also that of one of the most distinguished minds in the world Pierre De Fermat appears to know the inner souls of the people he invited to play with their minds or does he really? LLuis Homar Alejo Sauras Santi Millan and Elena Ballesteros make an interesting combination in this Spanish film that makes one wonder about what really is going on in it. Federico Luppi is only seen briefly yet his presence is all over the place.";

	schema:reviewBody "More a psychological thriller than a horror Fermat's Room flatters to deceive you into believing it is something cleverer than it really is and like all who attempt such a ploy ends up falling flat on its face. The farfetched story has a group of four mathematicians  all strangers to one another  meeting at the invitation of the mysterious Fermat after each managing to crack a puzzle he has given them. They are guided to a deserted building in which there is only one room that has been furnished and decorated. Shortly they are met by Fermat and enjoy a civilised meal before their host is suddenly called away to the hospital where his daughter lies in a coma. After he has left the remaining boffins find the door to the room is locked and soon discover that the walls of the room will slowly close in on them if they fail to solve within one minute a series of puzzles texted to them on the mobile left by Fermat. The film's opening credits show a miniature replica of the room in which the mathematicians are to be imprisoned being furnished by a gloved hand so it's clear that some sinister force will manipulate what it considers to be 'little' people and immediately movies like Cube and Saw spring to mind. Of these three films Saw is arguably the most successful because it manages to maintain a level of believability no matter how farfetched its story might be while Cube and Fermat's Room do not.While this film is reasonably entertaining as you watch and at time creates some moments of high tension as the plot holes mount the slowness of the supposedly intelligent prisoners to find a way out of their cell starts to grate after a while. Surely one of them would have thought to knock on the walls in search of the giveaway hollow echo of a space beyond? Perhaps the writers were relying on the fact that even highly intelligent people can overlook the obvious but I suspect they came up with an intriguing idea  albeit one that wouldn't be out of place in a 1970s DC horror comic  and couldn't figure out a plausible resolution. And quite how all four walls and the roof of the room are supposed to close in at the same time is beyond me. Maybe there's a mathematical formula for that sort of thing. Either way the film becomes increasingly silly as the story unfolds with a number of surprisingly mundane twists and red herrings arbitrarily thrown into the mix so that by the time the end credits roll the viewer is left feeling disappointed by it all.".

Immediately after diner however Fermat leaves the group and the remaining guests soon find themselves trapped in a hitech shrinking room.

Fermat's Room has a wellwritten script and definitely features a number of very intense and unsettling sequences but personally I have some severe concerns regarding the film's plausibility factor. Is it realistic that mathematicians eagerly accept this kind of invitation not knowing the exact purpose or any of the other attendees of the meeting solely to meet up with people of their own intellect? The plot truly becomes implausible  ludicrous even  once the mysterious culprit reveals his identity and particularly his motivations.

In order to build excitement and quicken the pacethe movie makers have to on occasion abandon reality. I am perfectly willing to overlook some flows or leaps of faith but this disappointing movie asks just too much. Foolish puzzles characters so irritating that you wish those walls move quicker and squish them and suspensless suspense defy the mere function of this genre. Sillysilly and not even funny.";

In such a tenement Pettaikaaran Jayabalan leads a very respectable life with his key aides Durai Kishore and Karuppu Dhanush along with others. His main adversary in hen fights is Rathinam the police inspector. Pettaikaarar is known to have an impeccable track record of successes when it comes to fowl fights especially with Rathinam's. In an unexpected situation Pettaikaaran challenges Rathinam to a fowl contest which witnesses Karuppu violating his mentor Pettaikaarar's word but emerging successfully with enviable proceeds. This results in the swelling of his status among his folks which plants the seeds of animosity in the minds of Pettaikaaran. What follows is an interesting and unexpected path with twists and turns highlighting on the way the multiple layers of human emotions with sense playing truant.";

The second half of the movie is totally new for Tamil cinema industry. It deals with the dark side of a man who once used to be good and a governess. Humiliated by his wrong decisions and greediness how a good man turns self centered and egotistic is what Aadukalam deals with.Dhanush as an actor is at his best after Pudupettai. He has done a lot of hard work for this movie. Topsee the female lead has shown good performance for a new comer. Vetrimaran this man is really clever and he knows how to make a splendid entertainer which will be considered a good movie even after many years. The characterization of the movie is so fine that they stay in our hearts for a longtime. Some very important events that happen in the movie are not filmed as part of the movie but the way they are been conveyed it to the audience it is wonderful for example the Pettaikaran getting beaten by the policemen and when Karupus's Dhanush mother dies.With regards to the graphics used in the movie it is very well made and has come out natural that does not make you feel that its graphics but there is a notice in the upfront very beginning of the movie that the rooster fights shown in this movie are graphics. The interval sequence WOW it is an edge of the seat thriller. I nearly wondered what could be there in a movie after such a wonderful interval sequence. But there is really something thoughtful even after the interval. Finally the climax of the movie which made me think for at least two weeks whether I have seen a similar climax in any other movies so far. My answer was NO I haven't come across this kind of climax. But to make clear the climax is not so huge or entertaining it is very soft subtle and accepted which makes the film more appealing.There is everything in the movie rage egocentric humor love warmth and passion. This is definitely a must watch!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie reminds me about the Deep Play Notes on the Balinese Cockfight written by anthropologist Clifford Geertz. Deep Play Notes on the Balinese Cockfight is an essay included in the book The Interpretation of Cultures by anthropologist Clifford Geertz. Considered the most seminal work of Geertz the essay addresses the meaning of cockfighting in Balinese culture. Cockfights were generally illegal in Indonesia when Geertz was doing his fieldwork there in the 1950s. The first cockfight that he and his wife viewed was broken up by the police. The experience of hiding from the police in the courtyard of a local couple allowed Geertz to break the tension between himself and the villagers and perform all of the interviews and observation which make up The Interpretation of Cultures. The essay describes how cocks are taken to stand in for powerful men in the villages and notes that even the doubleentendre sense of the word cock exists in the Balinese language as much as in English.1 The last half of the essay describes the rituals of betting and concludes that the cockfight is the Balinese comment on themselves as it embodies the network of social relationships in kin and village that govern traditional Balinese life. The title of the essay is explained as a concept of British philosopher Jeremy Bentham 17481832 who defines deep play as a game with stakes so high that no rational person would engage in it. The amounts of money and status involved in the very brief cockfights make Balinese cockfighting deep play. The problem of explaining why the activity prevails is what Geertz sets out to solve in the essay.".

Considered the most seminal work of Geertz the essay addresses the meaning of cockfighting in Balinese culture. Cockfights were generally illegal in Indonesia when Geertz was doing his fieldwork there in the 1950s. The first cockfight that he and his wife viewed was broken up by the police. The experience of hiding from the police in the courtyard of a local couple allowed Geertz to break the tension between himself and the villagers and perform all of the interviews and observation which make up The Interpretation of Cultures. The essay describes how cocks are taken to stand in for powerful men in the villages and notes that even the doubleentendre sense of the word cock exists in the Balinese language as much as in English.1 The last half of the essay describes the rituals of betting and concludes that the cockfight is the Balinese comment on themselves as it embodies the network of social relationships in kin and village that govern traditional Balinese life. The title of the essay is explained as a concept of British philosopher Jeremy Bentham 17481832 who defines deep play as a game with stakes so high that no rational person would engage in it. The amounts of money and status involved in the very brief cockfights make Balinese cockfighting deep play. The problem of explaining why the activity prevails is what Geertz sets out to solve in the essay.";

Dhanush's acting was marvelous. Casting was apt. The movie was nice up till the interval other than the scene in which Dhanush cuts his hand to prove his love and the song followed by that! I think that wasn't much realistic. Second half is actually the beginning where Director Vetrimaran got mixed up with the steadiness of characterization and logic which is proved when both Karuppu and Durai doesn't listen Pettaikaran during the rooster fight but in the second half theykaruppu  Duraisimply follow whatever Pettaikaran tells. And nowadays Tamil heroines are always in love with a person who doesn't have a job who has no idea about his future or even don't think about it. It's now has become a clich. Come on directors girls aren't like thatthey're wise too. This movie is not even close to this team's previous work polladhavan. Anyway since this movie is first of it's kind for the Tamil audience and for Dhanush's actingit's worth a watch!!!".

Whilst the movie speaks for itself in the departments of entertainment and dialog one glance at the list of previous winners is sufficient to put a frown on your face.Vetrimaran the director and Dhanush the actor are good at what they do but DO NOT deserve nationwide recognition oh and definitely not for this movie. But i guess there is another way to look at this result  Indian movies in the year 2010 specifically were only as good as Aadukalam or lesser...?? Is that the answer ? Hmmm by all means possible...but not very likely.Anyway I am in a sense happy that a Tamil actor director and film have been recognized as being competitive but on the other hand i feel sad that the appreciation has gone overboard. Now about the movie  it deals with the novel subject of rooster fights and related issues in Madurai. Once again Tamil's madness for Madurai is out in the open  what with typical accents suggestive language behavior etc etc. Phew ! Enough of the temple town and its people ! But what catches the viewer is the interesting human subplot that is well woven into the rooster battle. It flows with ease and poise surprising us and delighting us at the same time. Dhanush's expressions are honest and true which in turn makes Tapsee's seem all the more fake. Nice ensemble of capable actors. GV Prakash's music may not be too bad but seems a tad inspired uh..the real word should be copied from Raaja and Rahman the latter being his uncle.Personally i thought Leader 2010 should have won for original screenplay but nonetheless Aadukalam's screenplay deserves mention. We have seen many unbearable Entertainers and Adhiradi Movies we have cried in agony and bankruptcy afterward. We have seen movies that insult our intelligence and twist the laws of human existence we have seen some of the most irritating actors and actresses to have ever come on film and we have survived. Aadukalam causes no such trouble survival at the end of the film is guaranteed if not natural. But the National Awards Panel needs to get its act together.".

	schema:headline " Bergman perfects his direction of photography and actors";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought I had seen every Bergman film ever made so I was thrilled to stumble onto this one the week after he died. I had no trouble following the intertwining stories because I kept track of the characters' names and their relationships. So what confused many viewers seemed totally justified especially compared to films in our postAltmam era where more and more we see stories where seemingly unconnected people's lives crisscross and are junxtaposed Magnolia and Babel to name a few.The filming is fantastic for the time and prefigures the use of close ups in Through a Glass Darkly. Very different from Port of Call just before and To Joy just afterwards. I found the film less bleak than Prison its lyrical moments prefiguring Summer Interlude one of my favorite early Bergmans.The lesbianism was blatant enough for me much more obvious than in Young Man With A Horn made around the same time in the US. Curiously this section of the film helped illuminate Bergman's use of the theme in The Silence and this makes me want to view that film again. The fact that this is a film Bergman didn't write is intriguing because he harmonizes his visual language to the rhythms of the screenwriter's oral one. The dialog was rather light for the seriousness of the situations. Perhaps Bergman himself would have been heavierhanded.Lastly there are the actresses and here Bergman's direction of actors seems to solidify as I find his previous films much more uneven on this score. Here the women especially the young dancer show real depth.Keep in mind that this is not his first film but still an early work a seed that will grow into later masterpieces. Then you won't be disappointed even after the mediocre last minutes of a work that definitely showed promise.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thought I had seen every Bergman film ever made so I was thrilled to stumble onto this one the week after he died. I had no trouble following the intertwining stories because I kept track of the characters' names and their relationships. So what confused many viewers seemed totally justified especially compared to films in our postAltmam era where more and more we see stories where seemingly unconnected people's lives crisscross and are junxtaposed Magnolia and Babel to name a few.The filming is fantastic for the time and prefigures the use of close ups in Through a Glass Darkly. Very different from Port of Call just before and To Joy just afterwards. I found the film less bleak than Prison its lyrical moments prefiguring Summer Interlude one of my favorite early Bergmans.The lesbianism was blatant enough for me much more obvious than in Young Man With A Horn made around the same time in the US. Curiously this section of the film helped illuminate Bergman's use of the theme in The Silence and this makes me want to view that film again. The fact that this is a film Bergman didn't write is intriguing because he harmonizes his visual language to the rhythms of the screenwriter's oral one. The dialog was rather light for the seriousness of the situations. Perhaps Bergman himself would have been heavierhanded.Lastly there are the actresses and here Bergman's direction of actors seems to solidify as I find his previous films much more uneven on this score. Here the women especially the young dancer show real depth.Keep in mind that this is not his first film but still an early work a seed that will grow into later masterpieces. Then you won't be disappointed even after the mediocre last minutes of a work that definitely showed promise.";

I could not bring myself to care for any of the characters and the plot is rather awkward to say the least. Interestingly this Bergman film has the unusual quality of not been written by the Swedish great himself so Bergman cannot receive much blame for the storyline which consists of different events with different characters in different time periods all put together in an unclear fashion. The story is hard to decipher but what I could work out I did not find very exciting at that. Even so this is satisfactory viewing as the camera follows around the characters very well and Bergman shows some skill for setting up shots even if not as greatly as in some of his later efforts. And if not much else the music choices are fitting. I am not sure whether I would recommend this to other Bergman fans but I would definitely advise nonfans to proceed with caution.".

It's kind of a precursor to Scenes of a Marriage where the story follows a married couple played by Eva Henning and Birger Malmsten on a train trip through wartorn Europe. The tumult of the film comes not from the mostly ignored outside world but from the rocky marriage itself. We also get glimpses of the couple's former lovers. The film is at its best when sticking to the couple. When it strays to the stories of side characters it's weaker. Since the film is so short just over 80 minutes you have to wonder if some of the tangential stories were added as padding. But even the scenes that don't add much are well written acted and directed. Henning gives a masterful performance and Bergman was really coming into his own by this point.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to see that the late Ingmar Bergman only directed Thirst and didn't write it. Even with its flaws like the Virgin Spring it seems authentic to the filmmaker's intentions with the characters and the dialog especially. Bergman through the writer Birgit Tengroth makes it his own even as he's still trying to get together completely the rhythm of the storytelling. It's strange to see him effortlessly direct within the realm of getting the camera moving around and still going at a realistic tempo most of the time anyway. It's a story of lovers and lovers gone to pot with the life of one the woman in the relationship Eva Henning as Rut revealed in flashbacks to a past rotten relationship and other friendship while the husband Birger Malmsten as Bertil has only his ex shown in dire straits after the fallout.The latter part was the only scene that didn't quite work for me despite Bertil's 'dream' later on in the film which is rather great within the experimentation of his mood expressed violently we never see much behind his past life with the person. Viola played by Tenegroth herself is better than expected in the part as a fragile soul who breaks away from being committed and runs into also old school friend and the ballet friend of Rut's at least I think it was Valborg though her better more dramatic work comes later on in the film.Still it's a very good drama with Bergman leading it along in a sort of quagmire for the audience likely also to be found in Strindberg one of Bergman's biggest influences about how people who meet for the reason of comfort end up feeling torn away by that same reason. Rut's relationship with Raoul winds up cruel and a mark on her psyche though she's also got her own quirks and obnoxious side yet she'll stay with him or try to at the very end. It's quite bleak despite the happy ending however i.e. the fate of Viola and the ideal of happiness in this world is always out of reach discoveries when stuck together as on a train only bring about more pondering. In 83 minutes time it can't be nearly as probing about how men distance women or vice versa sometimes unintentionally or through vicious deeds or thoughts as other Bergman films.But for a short while there are some tense moments and even a couple of surprising light ones the scene showing Rut and the dancers having fun on stage with some folk music is one of Bergman's most joyous scenes of any movie he's done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thirst is an early and forgettable Ingmar Bergman wrought with overheated melodrama abrasive performances and a subplot that fits like a square peg in a round hole.Ballet dancer Rut and husband Bertil are on holiday making their way across war torn Europe and back to Sweden. Rut like nearly all Bergman protagonists is experiencing a dark night of the soul and doubt about her artistic abilities. Some explanation is given in flash back an affair with an arrogant military officer a confrontation with his wife a sadistic and predatory lesbian dance instructor and a possible abortion. Very loosely tied in is a subplot of old ballet school chum Viola whose fragile psyche is being exploited by a psychiatrist and another classmate.Bergman covers a lot of ground in under ninety minutes very little of it coherently. There's visual commentary about the war in which Sweden was a spectator. Rut feels for the starving refugees at train stops and gives them food while others simply pull down the shades. She has a series of outbursts that become cloying after the first and her husband like the other male characters seems unable to cope or connect due to either their aggressive or passive chauvinism.

	onyx:emotionText "Thirst is an early and forgettable Ingmar Bergman wrought with overheated melodrama abrasive performances and a subplot that fits like a square peg in a round hole.Ballet dancer Rut and husband Bertil are on holiday making their way across war torn Europe and back to Sweden. Rut like nearly all Bergman protagonists is experiencing a dark night of the soul and doubt about her artistic abilities. Some explanation is given in flash back an affair with an arrogant military officer a confrontation with his wife a sadistic and predatory lesbian dance instructor and a possible abortion. Very loosely tied in is a subplot of old ballet school chum Viola whose fragile psyche is being exploited by a psychiatrist and another classmate.Bergman covers a lot of ground in under ninety minutes very little of it coherently. There's visual commentary about the war in which Sweden was a spectator. Rut feels for the starving refugees at train stops and gives them food while others simply pull down the shades. She has a series of outbursts that become cloying after the first and her husband like the other male characters seems unable to cope or connect due to either their aggressive or passive chauvinism. Evening the playing field lesbians also get worked over with a little Bermanesque gay bashing.

	schema:headline " Homosexuality in Bergman's films.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a subject rarely brought up and I am doing so after seeing 'Thirst' for the first time. It is pivotal in understanding themes which recur among his later films. One of these themes in his early films less so in the later except for 'Persona' and 'The Hour of the Wolf' is that of homosexual motifs and imagery. It is also there in 'From the Life of the Marionettes' where it is as I see it the core reason for the killer's psychology. In these latter films there is no homoeroticism as such just undercurrents and thematic reasons. But why are the themes there at all? My intuition on seeing his films especially 'Thirst' is a horror of samesex attraction. The lesbian in the film is portrayed as a damned character to such an extent that she is portrayed as being demonic. Look at the final images of her and you will see a character out of a horror film. I was disgusted at Bergman for this and it prevented me from giving a full 10 to this film which is otherwise extraordinary. But to return to the eroticism. Has anyone bothered to see how he shows off the bodies of some of his better looking young male actors? The male lead in 'Summer with Monika' is as equally erotically presented as the female lead. Images of the young male lead in 'Thirst' almost writhing halfnaked is comparable to any current gay film. This is here to be read visually and also extends to 'Port of Call'. It is interesting to note that women are not as erotically portrayed in the standard sense of any film dealing with sexuality and stay within the mainstream. The young men go beyond the normal presentation of the time. And what of the great 'The Silence' where the male is seen as the erotic force that separates the two women possibly in an emotionally lesbian relationship? Homosexuality is the dark side of sex in Bergman's films. Was it the dark side of him? We will never know but the question even unanswered can be posed.".

This is NOT a criticismjust a fact that Bergman chose to make films about unpleasant thingsmarital infidelity alienation mental illness and deathsuch was the repertoire of Bergman. Many people adore the man's work. As for me I appreciate his films especially Wild Strawberries Autumn Sonata and The Seventh Seal but would like to see more films like The Devil's Eyea much more lighthearted and occasionally fun sort of film.Thirst is oppressively dark and unpleasant. And typical of many of his films you really don't like anyone. Instead it's like you are a fly on the wall staring at people who are miserablewith no resolutionjust alienation and unhappiness.The film is about a married couple who really don't like each otherbut in an odd way they love each other. Both have had affairs and both seem resigned to living out their lives togetherlike it or not. I could say more but frankly don't feel like itsuffice to say they are miserable and illmatched and desperately in need to therapy.This is an odd movie because later in the film there is another plot involving alienation and depression. But oddly this plot appears out of the blue and never really is fleshed out at all. It really looks like the film originally had two parallel stories and they edited out much of the second one. It should have either been removed completely or developed properly. Either way it just didn't work and I wanted to a lot more about the weird therapist the lady saw as well as the lesbian anglebut both appear and disappear just as quickly.This is a film for lovers of Bergman. For others if you want an unpleasant film see one of Bergman's better films. Life is too short to watch a stead diet of films like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you were to take the Harry Potter film franchise and remove all the memorable characters fun adventure and coherent narrative storytelling you would get The Seeker The Dark is Rising. While not completely unwatchable and competently made the film has no sense of wonder. That's quite an amazing feat when you consider it centers around a kid with numerous superhuman powers and surrounds said kid with themes of time travel villains who can summon swarms of crows and snakes in an instant and an apocalyptic snow storm that could bring about the end of the world.Our young hero is Will Shanton Alexander Ludwig. Will is your average awkward teen struggling to fit in after his father's job forced the family to move overseas from America to England. He's just turned 14 and has also just discovered that he's part of a prophecy that he never knew about. Supposedly thousands of years ago there was a great battle between the forces of Light and Darkness for control of the world. Light won out in the end but Dark is vying to make a comeback. The Dark is represented by a villain called The Rider Christopher Eccleston named so because he rides around on horseback. The Rider keeps on appearing before our young hero and sending demonic mall security guards and evil grannies who can summon snakes after him. He claims to be looking for the Signs but Will doesn't know what he's talking about. Fortunately there are some people to help explain Will's destiny and explain the plot but do little else. They represent the Light and inform Will that he is the Seeker and that only he has the power to seek out six Signs  powerful artifacts from the past that hold the fate of the world. As the Seeker Will gains various powers including super strength and traveling through time of which only the time travel one seems to be of any use to him in his search.All the ingredients are here for a fun fantasy adventure but The Seeker The Dark is Rising doesn't even seem interested in itself. This movie has such a shocking lack of wonder and whimsy two things all fantasy adventures must have. The incredible keeps on showing its face throughout the story but the movie forgets to allow the characters to react or even respond to it. At one point Will's younger sister discovers her brother's power first hand when she accidentally travels through time with him. How does she react to this? She doesn't. She finds herself transported thousands of years in the past in the middle of a battle and all she cares about is that she rescued a kitten from the battlefield. She doesn't even ask her brother what's going on nor does she ever bring it up again in a later scene. She does however keep on clutching to that little kitten she found for the rest of the movie. I guess time travel super powers and the fate of the world itself just can't hold a candle to the adorableness of a kitty cat.The storytelling employed here is of the most basic and episodic quality. Things happen out of sheer coincidence or dumb luck. I mean what are the odds that all of these Signs Will is supposed to be looking for all seem to be within a three mile radius from his house? He doesn't so much seek these things out rather he stumbles upon them. He goes to church for Sunday service and wow there's one of the Signs he's looking for! Whatever the case can it really be qualified as an adventure if the hero is hardly forced to leave his own house? For all the characters' talk of prophecies and darkness destroying the world everyone in this movie sure seems to be taking it in stride. They even still have time to celebrate Christmas even the ones who know the world could end in five days.For all its mistakes The Seeker is not without some merit. The opening moments has a mysterious atmosphere and got me interested before the movie decided to brush off its own explanations. It's kind of like finding a beautifully wrapped package opening it and finding a ball of lint inside. It's at least interesting before the disappointment hits. The first 20 minutes or so have hope and the promise of wonder then the movie just kind of craps out and loses interest in itself. It's odd to think that The Seeker is more comfortable dealing with the ordinary rather than the extraordinary. If the people behind this film were behind the Harry Potter series the Muggle world would be more interesting than Hogwarts. I don't think I even have to explain what would be wrong with that picture.The Seeker The Dark is Rising is based on a very famous children's novel by Susan Cooper. I have not read this book but I have a feeling that this adaptation is missing what made the story so interesting in the first place. Here is a story that cries out for the fantastic and gives us people who don't even seem to notice it. Those kind of people don't deserve to inhabit a story like this. We need a hero who shares our sense of wonder. All we get with Will is someone who discovers he has the power to change the world and says that's nice then walks away.".

Key elements left out characterizations gutted the mythos it was based on trivialized.After such great adaptations as LotR Narnia and the Potter books to see this classic ruined was a sad sight.The books concepts depend on British folktales and legends Arthurian based and the movie seems to have tossed that aside in an attempt to woo American audiences. The family is changed leaving out the close knit structure that is the basis of the story.Don't see this movie. Don't let your kids see this movie.

The family is changed leaving out the close knit structure that is the basis of the story.Don't see this movie. Don't let your kids see this movie. Do yourselves a favor and read the book.Someday someone will make this movie with an eye to the source material.";

It is not enough that we must be subjected to onedimensional characters painfully predictable dialogue hackneyed plot lines clich villains headacheinducing camera work and one of the worst climaxes ever recorded. No. Not by a long shot. The atrocity here runs deeper. Our intelligence is insulted our tastes are ridiculed and our freedom of choice turns on us and squeezes its fist around our throats. This film registers as a negative a black hole in the canon of cinematic creations. There were parts where I imagined the producers saying Just leave it that way. They'll never notice or You don't have to explain that it'll fly right over their heads. I understand that the budget for this film was gasp a measly 20 million dollars but lack of financial resources is NEVER EVER an excuse to feed goldplated crap to the masses. Christopher Eccleston fans may get a slight quiver of a laugh out of his failed quirky turn as The Rider the wraithlike shape shifting ambassador of The Dark. But in all seriousness I think he may have just needed a few extra bucks for a down payment on an Aston Martin he might have had his eye on. Otherwise the acting is not even a subject to be brought up since cardboard cutouts don't require much effort to portray. The special effects are where all the money went and they're fairly decent. Though I refuse to count this as praise any more than I would appreciate a smattering of whipped cream on the top of a rancid pile of stinking eightweek old peach cobbler.In any fantasy there are rules that must be set and limitations where magic is to be found. Otherwise the whole thing becomes a freeforall that never holds any kind of credibility. I don't think I have the time or the energy to describe all of the problems violations and inconsistencies I saw occur within this film that barely topped two hours. It would be a real challenge for someone to sit down and try to catch them all. There was no respect for the genre here just a seemingly voracious need to exploit the current fantasy craze. If after The Lord of the Rings The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter the bigwigs in the studios think that this sort of thing can pass as acceptable then the legacy of Story is over already. Yes I am being overly dramatic but at this point it's too late to turn back. Time once lost is not recoverable money once spent requires more labor to regain and the wish to walk away from a story feeling like we've been entertained had our minds and hearts opened once dashed is hard pressed to be soothed back again from boundless feelings of deep discontent and a sense that we have been robbed. It breaks my heart and I left this film genuinely livid.".

Above all it is quintessentially English and far from being dated it is a timeless masterpiece as relevant to children now as 30 years ago.

What I remember as a powerful novel full of magic good versus evil and suspense bears no resemblance to the movie. What a waste of time and effort.I can't believe for one moment that Susan Cooper has authorised this movie which is supposed to be based on her book. I just hope that people new to this series will want to read the books if the first taste they have is this abysmal looking film.It seems the studio which produced this film have come up with the golden goose egg of formulas for those too stupid to appreciate the myths and legends in the book. Of course they would change his name from Jack to Jaqueline and get rid of the bean stalk for a rocket to the stars. Oh and not to forgot replacing the giant with a basketball player. But hey all in the name of making a quick buck.....".

Although I don't think I'd recommend it for children under 4th grade or so  there were some quite frightening parts.I thought Christopher Eccelson did a good job as the Rider. The elements of good and evil were pretty well marked out to see. The action if anything went too fast. Will zipped from sign to sign without anyone really explaining to him why he was The Seeker. The editing may have been too choppy. The Old Ones themselves weren't explained very well which left me a bit confused. They show the dogs growling at Will and the television going fuzzy but don't explain why.Even with the confusion and choppy editing I think for kids who have never read the books it could be a fun movie to see  and possibly lead them into the books.THAT SAID.....I am a huge fan of the books and am personally disappointed in how much has been changed. I felt that Walden had a wonderful opportunity with this film to bring the richness of Cooper's books to life  but all the timeless qualities of her book are gone in this very dated piece. The magic of the loving Stanton family the small English village life Arthurian Legend and Celtic lore have been lost and in their place is a shopping mall a missing twin and a possessed brother. What happened to Herne the Hunter? The Old Ways? Huntercombe Way? The Farm? The Lady? The Walker? All in all I guess the best that can be said it that it could have been worse!!".

This has nothing to do with the fact that the movie departed from the books it's a very bad movie period. I don't blame the actors I think they did the best they could with what they had. I would sum up this movie as an awful lot or a lot of awful effects and camera stunts being used to hide the fact that there is no story.The camera switches from closeup to dangling high overhead repeatedly. It jumps around in battle scenes apparently to make up for a lack of action. The special effects are clich more distracting than dramatic and the battles turn into yet another CGI superhero cartoon scene. But this is really just obscuring the fact that there is no story. The history is contrived the family is pathetic the Old Ones are rather useless it's fortunate for Will that the enemy is inclined more to drama than to action. Once again we see the womanastemptress toolofthedevil theme. The final battle is mostly against a lot of black dust. Will is driven by selfpity and only gets interested in the battle when he finds he has real power  and then he becomes a rather selfrighteous little jerk. None of these characters are likable or interesting except possibly to 13yearold boys.Which brings me to the review by the Truly Moving Pictures judge. I notice that the reviewer did not use a real name and the website does not list judges that I could find. The fact that this organization gave this film any kind of award can only indicate some kind of financial interest since there is clearly no merit whatsoever evident in this film. I would agree that you can see the budget in the film but I would add that you can also see that it was wasted. I was highly gratified that on opening weekend there were perhaps twenty or thirty people in the entire theater. Hopefully there won't be any attempt at a sequel and perhaps someday someone will do justice to Susan Cooper's books.".

Not only do they take him back in time but he hallucinates the symbol for the light wherever a sign is located. So his job is to be involuntarily transported back in to to an empty room see a transparent symbol and put his hand where it was. That's it. I never thought you would get this far. You've got to be kidding! This movie plays out like a little kid's video game!The villain is the complete opposite of intimidating every time he is on screen I chuckled. His weapon of choice? Crows. Yes that's right you read that correctly. He uses crows to attack people. Yeah he's here to destroy all light on the planet and he uses crows to scratch people. Yes this makes me very scared indeed. The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen but after the third time of these action sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was Give me the signs boy! No I won't! Fine Have it your way you laugh at the bad guy for his terrible aptitude for being a bad guy and how easy it is to defy this evil power. Then the villain rides off into the distance.

	schema:headline " A lazy stupid piece of moviemaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Movie adaptations of muchloved books can rarely satisfy the fans but even making allowances for that this is a deeply disappointing film. People not familiar with Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising cycle will find this simply another lackluster and occasionally bewildering teen fantasy film while anyone who read and enjoyed Cooper's books would be welladvised to steer clear of the film altogether it will simply make them angry.The attraction of Cooper's books is that they are both mythologically and psychologically powerful. Her characters are welldrawn complex and believable and the story is deeply rooted in British mythology. The film has none of that the mythological aspect has been entirely excised and the psychology reduced to the lowest commondenominator of teen alienation. Even the quintessentially English character of the stories was apparently judged too threatening or complex for American audiences so the protagonist has been Americanized and the setting reduced to some cutesy chocolatebox Hollywood vision of rural England.Probably the only bright point of the movie is Alexander Ludwig in the part of Will Stanton. He isn't Cooper's Will Stanton but he turns in a respectable performance. In this he's in marked contrast to the adult actors who seem mostly to have phoned in their work.Granted the script writer hasn't given any of them much to do. Ian McShane's Merriman a pivotal character in the books has been reduced to intoning portentously ... for you are the Seeker ... at regularlyspaced intervals. Naturally in a film that assumes that the audience must be spoonfed everything has to be telegraphed repeatedly if necessary. It's not enough to have fancy visual effects and abrupt changes of season someone has to actually announce that the characters are traveling in time. Apparently the filmmakers don't think the audience are going to be able to figure that one out for themselves. It's educational to contrast the subtlety and effectiveness with which Cooper reveals her world in the books with the kind of hamfisted layitonwithatrowel exposition that the makers of the film considered necessary.The result is a rambling mess where the hero stumbles through his required tasks  all of which fall more or less into his lap without any great dramatic tension  until the predictable lastminute rout of the forces of darkness. Even someone with no prior exposure to Cooper's work is likely to find it dull. It can't be judged good or enjoyable by any standard.Quite how the movie came to be such a travesty is difficult to say. The source material had anyone associated with the movie bothered to read it is compelling and wellstructured such that simply following the story faithfully and preserving some of Cooper's dialog would have made for a much better movie. In the hands of for example the BBC it could have made an excellent miniseries. Screenwriter John Hodge must take much of the blame for his insipid and amateurish screenplay yet his track record  including the excellently written Shallow Grave and Trainspotting  makes me wonder if he contrived this disaster all himself or if he was under pressure from director Cunningham whose own resume might have led one to predict that he would make something like this to dumb everything down for the benefit of some imaginary audience of American teenagers with singledigit IQs.There's no reason to waste time on this film I saw it on an airplane. If you know how to read you'd be vastly better off spending the time and the money on the original books.".

Even the quintessentially English character of the stories was apparently judged too threatening or complex for American audiences so the protagonist has been Americanized and the setting reduced to some cutesy chocolatebox Hollywood vision of rural England.Probably the only bright point of the movie is Alexander Ludwig in the part of Will Stanton. He isn't Cooper's Will Stanton but he turns in a respectable performance. In this he's in marked contrast to the adult actors who seem mostly to have phoned in their work.Granted the script writer hasn't given any of them much to do. Ian McShane's Merriman a pivotal character in the books has been reduced to intoning portentously ... for you are the Seeker ... at regularlyspaced intervals. Naturally in a film that assumes that the audience must be spoonfed everything has to be telegraphed repeatedly if necessary. It's not enough to have fancy visual effects and abrupt changes of season someone has to actually announce that the characters are traveling in time. Apparently the filmmakers don't think the audience are going to be able to figure that one out for themselves. It's educational to contrast the subtlety and effectiveness with which Cooper reveals her world in the books with the kind of hamfisted layitonwithatrowel exposition that the makers of the film considered necessary.The result is a rambling mess where the hero stumbles through his required tasks  all of which fall more or less into his lap without any great dramatic tension  until the predictable lastminute rout of the forces of darkness. Even someone with no prior exposure to Cooper's work is likely to find it dull. It can't be judged good or enjoyable by any standard.Quite how the movie came to be such a travesty is difficult to say. The source material had anyone associated with the movie bothered to read it is compelling and wellstructured such that simply following the story faithfully and preserving some of Cooper's dialog would have made for a much better movie. In the hands of for example the BBC it could have made an excellent miniseries. Screenwriter John Hodge must take much of the blame for his insipid and amateurish screenplay yet his track record  including the excellently written Shallow Grave and Trainspotting  makes me wonder if he contrived this disaster all himself or if he was under pressure from director Cunningham whose own resume might have led one to predict that he would make something like this to dumb everything down for the benefit of some imaginary audience of American teenagers with singledigit IQs.There's no reason to waste time on this film I saw it on an airplane. If you know how to read you'd be vastly better off spending the time and the money on the original books.";

This book is one of my all time favorites and one of the best things about it is how wonderfully Susan Cooper manages to paint pictures with her words. When you are reading you can visualise everything she is describing in minute detail  and I have often thought that it would be so easy to translate it into film. It doesn't need 'adapting'  just filming.... verbatim. This film has absolutely nothing to do with the book and I am devastated that anyone would think that it has. It should have been so easy! I can understand them wanting to update it a bit for modern audiences and that could have worked just fine. The kid they have to play Will seemed OK too  he looked right and seemed to give off the right 'feel'. But why change the plot? What's the point of using a book as a starting off point if they change it into a completely alien beast? Why did they have to destroy something that so many people hold so close to their hearts? Why? Why? Why?".

The swirling camerawork is overdone. The screenplay is a mess and the characters are nothing noteworthy. The performances are miserable. Even Christopher Eccleston couldn't save this film. The reason why I ended up watching the whole thing is because I was at a friend's who rented it she likes fantasy films and I didn't want to be rude by walking out. I almost dozed off but managed to keep myself awake out of courtesy. Cunningham probably tried to cash in on the success of fantasy films like the Harry Potter series and the many fantasy films released in the last years but his product is a huge disappointment.

Special effects notwithstanding I still believe that the older movie comes out a winner. There is just that much of a better story telling coherence actor play and a general ambiance that makes Freejack a movie one would want to watch over and over again. The movie is WELLDONE. It's driven by a simple plot yet its imagery is clear and consistent and the characters have enough development for the audience to care for. A definite must for any scifi movie collection.".

It has some entertaining action good humor and a great cast to keep you watching. As much as I love Emilio he's not really the action star type. That being said he managed to pull it off with his natural charisma. He borders on cockiness at times but his charisma manages to keep him likable and easy to root for. Mick Jagger is terrible as the villain. He should have kept his day job in lieu of dabbling into acting. Anthony Hopkins is here for a paycheck nothing more. Rene Russo is classy as usual. She takes a onedimensional part and makes it worthwhile. That's what genuine talent is able to do. I enjoy it for what it is! Then again I dig anything that is enjoyably cheesy. This movie falls under that category. They were obviously aiming for much more but they weren't able to pull it off. Keep your expectations low and you'll have a decent time5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many movies about time travel but Freejack is quite unique. It portrays racecar driver Alex Furlong Emilio Estevez getting unwillingly transported to 21st century New York where some people want to give his young body to aging Ian McCandless Anthony Hopkins. Estevez Hopkins and Rene Russo all do fair jobs with their roles but it's really impressive seeing Mick Jagger as the villain's henchman Victor Vacendak. I mean every once in a while a rock star shows up in a movie but Jagger is really neat here. Gravitating between menacing and jolly this must have been a role through which he got some satisfaction.So this movie does have an interesting plot but it's mostly worth seeing just to see Mick Jagger as a bad guy.

This movie and the Keanu Reeves movie Johnny Mneunic or however you spell it are very similar to me though I have to give the edge to the Reeves one cause it had the more anime look however this one looks more polished than that one did. The action is pretty good and it has a nice conclusion to it as well. The acting is solid as Emilio Estevez is good as the protagonist and there are a couple of nice scenes with Anthony Hopkins but then again anything he is in and any scene he is in is usually a good scene.

	schema:reviewBody "This silliness is the sort of thing that you can sit down and enjoy without having to worry about paying close attention to what you're watching. There are some great action sequences the stars are fun to watch and the premise which focuses on a New York race car driverEmilio Estevez who is kidnapped and brought to the year 2009 so that his body can store the mind of a terminally ill billionaire Anthony Hopkins is silly and done without much imagination. There really isn't any cleverness or novelty to be found here but the movie really works as mindless entertainment and is never boring. Every member of this movie's cast fits his or her role very well even Emilio Estevez whom I don't typically care for but Mick Jagger really steals the show as the bounty hunter or bonejacker hired to catch Estevez after he escapes from his captors. He's never been much of an actor and this was his first movie in twentyone years but he conveys an enormous amount charisma as the movie's smug villain. Another stand out cast member is Anothony Hopkins who as usual plays a very sophisticated bad guy and does an excellent job of it however it is all to clear that he was in this movie for the money alone giving a good but very brief performance. Although the performers give it their all they are unfortunately not provided with a script interesting enough to help make their appearances memorable. Most of the dialog is derivative and silly. One can't very well sit down to watch a movie like this and expect a good script but it fair to hope for some memorable one liners and this movie really didn't offer any. Another problem I had with this movie was the fact that it was set in 2009. If your going to set a movie in a desolate future where the majority of New York City is crime infested hellhole make sure the future is far enough away to seem plausible. Having a world like this seventeen years after the movie was released just seems ridiculous. If you are in the mood for an undemanding entertaining guilty pleasure give this movie a look. The good performances action and special effects should be enough to keep you interested throughout the movie's hour and fifty minute running time but probably won't make the movie stick with you for very long after you have finished watching it.".

Every member of this movie's cast fits his or her role very well even Emilio Estevez whom I don't typically care for but Mick Jagger really steals the show as the bounty hunter or bonejacker hired to catch Estevez after he escapes from his captors. He's never been much of an actor and this was his first movie in twentyone years but he conveys an enormous amount charisma as the movie's smug villain. Another stand out cast member is Anothony Hopkins who as usual plays a very sophisticated bad guy and does an excellent job of it however it is all to clear that he was in this movie for the money alone giving a good but very brief performance. Although the performers give it their all they are unfortunately not provided with a script interesting enough to help make their appearances memorable. Most of the dialog is derivative and silly. One can't very well sit down to watch a movie like this and expect a good script but it fair to hope for some memorable one liners and this movie really didn't offer any. Another problem I had with this movie was the fact that it was set in 2009. If your going to set a movie in a desolate future where the majority of New York City is crime infested hellhole make sure the future is far enough away to seem plausible. Having a world like this seventeen years after the movie was released just seems ridiculous. If you are in the mood for an undemanding entertaining guilty pleasure give this movie a look. The good performances action and special effects should be enough to keep you interested throughout the movie's hour and fifty minute running time but probably won't make the movie stick with you for very long after you have finished watching it.";

First unlike the other reviewers I care not at all for Adriano Celentano his music or his popular persona. So what I like about the role he plays is that he makes fun of himself. At least I hope for his sake that he was making fun of himself and not playing himself in any way. The title in Italian is the masculine equivalent of The Taming of the Shrew and the story is more or less turning that play on its head. Maybe a little less in that both the man and the woman play the object of the humor at various points but the point being that the unconquerable man is in the end brought down by love. And Ornella Muti is at this time at the top of her game in every way. I couldn't help noticing that mole right in the middle of the bridge of her nose though. Was it just for this film? The dialogue is great in Italian and Celentano's deadpan delivery hits it just right as does Muti's as a rich spoiled Milanese man eaterI hope it translates OK.I have to say that the ending with the very unrealistic basketball game was cartoonish and somewhat ruined the structured comedy charming but rude which preceded it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The main advantage of the film The Taming of the Shrew is an outstanding actor's play. Adriano Celentano was excellent in the role of lone farmer misogynist Elia. And Ornella Muti irresistibly played the role of Lizzie Silvestri who wanted to win the heart of a brutal bachelor. Celentano created the incomparable image of a wayward man who does not understand humor. I really enjoyed it. I think Elia's role is one of the best roles of Celentano in his entire career. Ornella Muti brilliantly played the role of a liberated seducer too but Adriano overacted her. By the way thanks to the film The Taming of the Shrew the littleknown actress Ornella has gained worldwide fame she was invited to appear in foreign film projects.Also very funny original humor became a great plus of the movie The Taming of the Shrew. The jokes in the movie are extremely funny. For example Ornela appears in the evening dress as the queen of the ball. Andriano with boundless astonishment rises from his chair approaches Ornella bends down and raises a black beetle from the ground. You see what a beautiful  this is a rare species of scalywinged. And he brings this beetle to Ornella's face she was indignant and walked away.In conclusion I want to recommend to all fans of excellent comedies to watch the film The Taming of the Shrew. My score on a tenpoint scale is ten with a plus. I advise everyone who has not seen this movie to see it. You will not regret.".

Quarantine 2 was not a movie I had my heart on seeing basically because I didn't think it could live up to the standard of its predecessor or the Spanish original. On that count I was right. This isn't as good as the first movie. Having said that one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works in other words. That fright quality isn't as sustained as it is in the first movie though. In fact this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they're not feeling too well. If you've seen the first movie then you know what's happening or more to the point what's going to happen so you're basically just waiting for it.One thing that I noted was that the events of this movie were taking place at the same time as the events of Quarantine. In fact one of the airplane passengers is using the airplane's wifi to watch a news broadcast about the quarantined building in Los Angeles. While the disease and its effects are pretty much the same there's more of an effort made here to get to the background and origins of the disease which is really dealt with only in a few hints toward the end of Quarantine.Quarantine and Rec are filmed in a Blair Witch style  hand held cameras recording the action as it takes place. Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to moviemaking. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death quite frankly so I didn't miss it. It's clear that the ending of this movie was also intended to set up another potential sequel. That was just a little too obvious. Basically I'd say this isn't as good as the movies that spawned it but as a horror movie it's still very effective. 710".

There are the typical characters good bad stupid etc... but it has a good flow.The acting was OK not a high budget film but you get to feel for them and relate to the dilemma.I guess it's not a zombie movie no one is dead but more like the Crazies still it does keep you watching no need to fast forward some parts.Now there are some parts that are hard to relate to in Canada I don't think someone would have a hand gun in their stuff and how did the bad guys bag get to a locked office Hmm..Anyway worth renting if you like this type of movies if you are looking for a cult classic.. not happening.thanks for reading ".

	schema:reviewBody "A plane is taken over by a mysterious virus. When the plane lands it is placed under quarantine. Now a group of survivors must band together to survive the quarantine.A sequel to a remake... that is the first thing that will come to your mind. First they remade Rec and now they have made a sequel to that remake. Oddly enough Rec 2 has a preview on this DVD. But do not be fooled... this film diverges from the remake and has nothing to do with Rec so trying to compare them is more than just a tad unfair.Many people consider this film to be better than the first one including Fangoria's Michael Gingold which initially came as a shock to me. But those people may just be more vocal. The silent majority those who vote on IMDb currently August 2 2011 have the first film at 6.1 and the sequel at 5.5  neither are numbers to brag about but one hopes to get at least a 6 right? I will remain silent on this debate though I will say this film was better than expected.In fact let me lay it on the line this might be the most pleasant surprise of the year. While I feel as a horror fan I was obligated to at least check it out and not necessarily like it I found the film kept my attention very well even in the wee hours of the night. I would recommend this to just about anyone  even if they never saw the first film! The connection is mild and easily explained so you need not be intimately familiar with the first. The DVD is not much to speak of  there are no special features whatsoever aside from some previews which are more annoying than anything considering that if you watch the movie five years from now they will not be new anymore. But the film itself has enough action gore and more to sell itself at least for a rental.The plot is thin pretty much Night of the Living Dead or The Crazies but in a different location. But then most films especially horror are derivative so I will not harp on them too much for this. They make up for it with some decent gore blood and vomit one headbashing scene is pretty great. I am sad the director chose to tastefully censor a suicide but oh well.The scene that will stick in your mind? A needle sequence that might make many viewers squeamish! I will say it is the best needle scene I can recall since Dario Argento's Opera. If you watch this film for no other reason let this be why. I give it my seal of approval.".

It wears its influences on its sleeve being highly derivative of 28 Days Later which itself was already fairly derivative. If this is a big problem for you I'd suggest that you avoid Quarantine 2 because you're just going to get mad at how little originality is on display.Instead of remaking Rec 2 this movie is more of a standalone story set in the same universe as Quarantine. This time instead of being set in an apartment complex it's briefly set on an airplane then a terminal. Rec and Quarantine the American remake was notable for being shot first person while this movie is not. That might disappoint some people but I wasn't really fond of the trend in the first place. The story is contemporaneous with the story of the first movie with brief references to it here and there. You don't need to have seen the first movie but that's partially because this movie is so derivative of other movies you've already seen this plot several times before. That said as far as these sorts of movies go this was fairly well acted and competently directed though the director falls back on using extremely loud noises as a rather annoying crutch. Just when you think there might be character development extended dialogue or a moment for reflection there's an extremely loud noise and a rabid person bursts through a wall. Often first time directors will err on the side of slow pacing though I think the characters obviously suffered a bit for the relentlessly fast pacing. The writerdirector also wrote Ghost Ship which was laughably bad. Unfortunately he hasn't really progressed as a writer since then. I guess if you didn't mind Ghost Ship you won't be offended by this either. However as silly as I found Rec 2's supernatural aspect it was an interesting twist to the whole rage virus subgenre of horror movies. Quarantine 2 plays it straight and just lets loose a bunch of rabid humans on a clichd group of people who perpetually seem to populate the scripts of hack writers.If I seem overly harsh it's only because I'm tired of watching the same movie over and over with very little variation. If you're a fan of scifiactionhorror movies you've seen this all before right down to the characters the action sequences and the supposed homages. Why bother being original if nobody calls you on your lack of creativity?".

Quarantine the remake of REC I found was a faithful adaption of this fantastic franchise. Complete with semicliffhanger ending I was eager for the sequel.REC2  Fear Revisited is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. It does not steal anything from the first movie and expands the storyline and mythology beautifully.The movie Quarantine 2 single handedly violates everything that was special and unique about the original films.....even the first Quarantine movie.The first and most unforgivable mistake is the directors choice to do away with the first person ShakyCam direction style. I understand that this style of film is not a favourite among movie goers but ShakyCam and its sense of reality was the main charm of REC. its this style what made it stand out from other horror movies and pulled you into the story. Quarantine 2 opted for the traditional Stage Perspective view which makes about as much sense as casting Mr Bean to play Citizen Kane.Mistake number 2  The zombies are far too orchestrated. In the prequels the zombiesmonsters were mindless manically savage and unconsolable This new take on the film seems to have given them somewhat of a consciouness. . . . they pause before their attacks and almost seem to analyse before striking it brings nothing to the film and again steers the film in the wrong direction.Mistake number 3  the acting. Before I rip the performances apart I have to say some of the acting was reasonably good. My quarm is again with the zombiesmonsters. I may just be nit picking here but there is a scene where they climb a stair well and I asked myself Would an unstoppable savage flesh eating monster really need to use the handrails?Mistake number 4  Instead of following the story of REC2 which is set immediately after the first movie and continues from the same point. This story line has tried to be independent from its original material and fails epically! The basic premise is that the virus has broken free on a plane which is forced to land in a quarantined terminal. The new story changes the mythology to the virus being a biological weapon. This is completely the opposite direction of story line that was created by REC2. This plot adds nothing to the mythology in fact it tarnishes it. Fortunately REC's future should be safe from the stain that has been made by Quarantinte 2Do I have anything good to say? There are good points to this movie. The makeup effects are really quite good. . . . erm . . . .thats about it.My Final Words If you are a fan of REC and Quarantine avoid this movie at all costs!".

	schema:reviewBody "Well Quarantine 2 The Terminal was nothing like Rec 2.It was a really good thing that they had not chosen to do yet another frame by frame remake of the original Spanish Rec 2 as they did with Rec which turned into Quarantine. The way Hollywood need to Americanize and turn foreign successful movies into American adoptions is just beyond my comprehension. Anyway thankfully they had decided to go a total different way with Quarantine 2 The Terminal contra Rec 2.There wasn't much new thinking to this movie which made me wonder was this movie really necessary? Basically you have the same ingredients from Quarantine just set at a different location  this time being an airplane and an airplane terminal. And with most of the movie filmed in the dark and in maintenance area it seemed like they had taken that from the Resident Evil movie and just realigned it for usage in this movie. It was very unoriginal and very unnecessary.Now moving on the story itself was not bad actually was an adequate continuation of the story told in Quarantine. And the characters were good and believable and were played well enough as well. I just had a problem with the lack of lighting in the movie. I hate horror movies that are shot almost completed in the dark. It is so 80's and so annoying.I was not familiar with any of the people in the movie and I think it is nice to see a movie being made without major Hollywood names on the cast list to lure you in. And with the cast they had put together here they actually made to get a good end result with the acting.Personally I am more of a fan of horror movies in their original versions and languages be it Spanish Japanese Korean etc. The way Hollywood need to cash in on the success of foreign movies ticks me off. Mostly the results of the movies turns out to be an insult to the original language version. Quarantine 2 The Terminal however was as far from Rec 2 as could be and as such it was not a bad experience. It was an overall average horror movie though it lacked new ideas and concepts it was all a bit too old and stale  used before.Quarantine 2 The Terminal will be a good addition to the Quarantine series if you liked the first one. If you like me prefer the original Spanish Rec movies then Quarantine 2 The Terminal doesn't come up to the knees of those. But for an Americanized version it wasn't too shabby.".

Never make assumptions or compare any movie with other movies you have never seen! Quarantine is a American clone from the original REC. Movies like Ringu the ring had a great base western audiences may have connected with the story despite it being filmed within a different culture. I strongly feel a remake was plausible. Most JapaneseAmerican remakes have become distinctive and popular in their own right. However my first problem with the Quarantine series the script was reused the movie was shot with the same feel The set design was identical the characters all looked the same etc etc etc. I find it hard to contrast the movies in anyway. Except the language. Quarantine offered no new insight however it did present what was great in REC to a American audience. I rate both movies highlyThe difference between both REC and Quarantine is where the sequels begin to detour. REC 2 follows on from the events and gives insight into some unanswered questions whilst remaining humble to the original movies aesthetics. Quarantine 2 shows the virus spread within a small airport terminal. Inside the terminal the movie shifts dynamic and centers on a terrorism storyline which seems very common in movies of late that contributed to ruining the movie and distorting how great the original movies were. If you are a fan of REC 12 and Quarantine avoid this movie like a plague. It bares no resemblance to these horror movies except by name. It is a badly made Bmovie. It features sparse amounts of zombies popping in frame like a really bad zombiepantomime. The set design was reused resembling a scene in Sesame St. This has to be worst horror movie of 2011 utterly disgusted it is a sequel to Quarantine. Robert".

Both REC and the first Quarantine movie were primarily known for being shot entirely through the use of handheldfirstperson video footage. However in the sequel they do away with the 'point of view' aspect for the most part and what you're left with is a pretty standard zombie movie.And the zombies are the 'infected' type if you haven't seen 28 DaysWeeks Later that means they run and are generally a lot faster as opposed to the classic 'shuffler' zombies. So a flight is grounded in a terminal and the plane's passengers have to survive inside a terminal while zombies pick them off one by one.As a standard zombie movie it does the job. It has a few moments where the fast zombies jump out and grab someone. However it's never more than average. You'll find it hard to recognise any actor and the characters are also the standard clichd types you'd expect from a straighttoDVD release.If you're not completely tired with zombie movies you might like this one otherwise stick with an early George Romero movie or the Walking Dead.".

	schema:headline " A Fraudulent Sequel so good I don't care that it's fraudulent.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the best Fraudulent Sequel I've ever seen. Legitimate sequels are where you either continue the story of the first film or take the characters from that movie and put them in a new adventure. Then there are Fraudulent Sequels like Quarantine 2 Terminal. This is one of the most common varieties where they take the same plot as the original plug in new characters and sometimes a new location and simply remake the first film. As you might have guessed from that description these kind of derivative flicks are almost exclusively directtovideo and they usually stink. It's a formula for a base cash grab from anyone who liked or merely heard about the original motion picture.Given its essentially deceitful status Quarantine 2 Terminal is shockingly good. It's not as smart or as scary or as well made as Quarantine and it was clearly produced on a much smaller budget. Quarantine was an excellent horror film however and you can fall a lot short of it and still be a fun ride. That's what happened here. Writerdirector John G. Pogue was handed the assignment of mimicking a great movie and not only did a fine job he brings enough imagination to the chore to make this thing enjoyable in its own right. Pogue's outstanding effort here and has made me interested in seeing other work from him.Set at the same time as Quarantine this movie follows a planeful of people as they go through almost the exact same situation. They're trapped in an enclosed space with a supervirus that turns human beings into slavering beasts and the government is determined to sacrifice them in order to contain the outbreak. Instead of being stuck inside an apartment building these poor souls are first in a passenger jet and then in the locked down terminal trying to figure out what's happening and make it out alive. The only real difference is that this movie dispenses with the real video convention of Quarantine which was supposed to be the footage shot by a TV news team that wound up trapped in the claustrophobic terror. Quarantine 2 is shot like a normal film though it's imitating the style of handheld video. But don't worry the camera remains steady enough that motion sickness won't be a problem for any viewer.The characters here are pretty much the definition of disposable and generic but the cast effectively portrays them and Pogue intelligently puts them through their predictable paces. He also enlivens the dj vu by adding in some clever little wrinkles like turning the start of the film into a guessing game as to where the virus is going to come from and taking advantage of his set to put together a chase scene that's damn near as exciting as anything from the first movie. And while Quarantine 2 as a whole isn't nearly as visually inventive as its progenitor Pogue uses some POV thermal imaging at the end to fine effect. He doesn't do a wonderful job of bringing to life the doomsday cult that's only referenced in Quarantine but he still comes up with a better bad guy that you normally get in a Fraudulent Sequel.Let me be clear. If you've seen Quarantine or its Spanishlanguage predecessor Rec you don't need to watch this movie. If you haven't seen either of them you should watch both instead of this movie. If for some reason you can't watch either of them Quarantine 2 is an entertaining substitute. If all Fraudulent Sequels were this much fun I'd stop calling them fraudulent.".

It is forced to land and a group of passengers fight off infected passengers as they are isolated and cut off by the military in a terminal. They quickly understand that help isn't coming and the infected dead try to viciously kill the living. This simple idea is stretched from the first film into this one and sets it in a airport terminal instead of an apartment building. Fortunately we have a group of survivors we can root for and WriterDirector John G. Pogue makes this movie tense and truly scary. The movie also benefits from moving away from the shaky camera style the first film used. Plenty of blood and jump scares pack this surprising sequel that is a worthy follow up to the original.".

The gore was prevalent but not that over the top for a zombie killing film...with the exception of the antedote scene when you see it you'll know what I'm talking about.With all that said I really only had two problems with the plot....so here is where the spoiler comes in.SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERT 1 The guy in the wheelchair with Parkinson's....how was he able to survive the carnage in the plane? The pilot copilot infected rat big fat infected guy etc...were all left behind on the plane. And the guy in the wheelchair was left in his seat as everyone else escaped to the terminal. It was not until they all came back later that we see that the fat guy broke free and infected them all...but somehow the immobile and helpless old man was spared.2 Since the CBDT knew they were never going to let the people inside the terminal out alive especially since they murdered their own men when they tried to leave why did it take them so long to firebomb the building? If they were serious about containment they would have burned it down right away...not give some a chance to escape.".

Note that the 7 star rating is to compare it with other Bmovies. The movie starts off quite well and right from the beginning you start to like the characters except for the hooded frowning kid that looked like Justin Bieber as one of the reviewers rightly pointed out. I'd say such a built up is necessary for movies like this because if you don't care about who lives and who dies the movie gets pointless much like the Final Destination 4.The flight attendants were likable and the movie had a real feel to it. It didn't look artificial and was much more believable than what you get in REC. There's plenty of gore and a few headshots if that's what you're looking for. The fast moving zombies really make adrenaline rush through your vessels. The plot is believable and while I've seen the same scenario a hundred times it didn't make the movie boring. It's got something to do with the way the movie is structured. Good dialogues satisfactory performances fastpaced action scenes and an unpredictable ending.It wasn't clich as far as I'm concerned. If you're into zombie movies and if you liked RECI recommend this title to you.Final score 710".

The POV camera is exchanged for a more traditional cinema camera style which is decently done considering the lower budget. Further the acting is toned down slightly from the first and is delivered with relative believability. The sound effects at times are God awful namely the cheap cat screeching one of the zombies makes about 1 hour into the movie you will know it when you see it. Now there are some gross scenes but overall the movie is not excessively gory. Overall for a zombie film it managed to be relatively enjoyable holding onto moderate suspense and keeping away from all the guns and rambo action that plagues most films of the genre these days. For zombie fans I would give a recommend for horror fans I would say maybe check it out but for everyone else enter only if you know what your getting into.".

It's set initially on an Airplane as a virus breaks out and follows what happens as the virus spirals out of control. This is a fast moving film which supplies effective scares from early on. There is a nice air of tension throughout and the characters are more rounded than the average low budget horror. I wasn't familiar with any of the cast but they all do a very good job with no amateur performances so often associated with these films. It may occasionally be a little predictable but it actually has a plot that makes sense and is very entertaining. This is far superior to most low budget horrors and indeed better than many with a higher budget. Well worth a watch.".

That is to say I looked at the majority of the characters on screen and thought please don't let me end up like that.The plot is thin  that is not meant pejoratively it's not a plotdriven film  but the performances of the cast simply roar off the screen. Peter Mullan and Eddie Marsan are fantastic but then again they always are as an aside does Marsan not tire of playing scumbags? but the real revelation in this film is the performance of Olivia Colman.She is perfect in this absolutely noteperfect incredible acting. Awesome in her delivery. So good in fact that you forget this is just a movie. Her performance here is definitely going to propel her into the upper echelons of British acting  if she is not already there.Tyrannosaur is not faultless there are some scenes that linger too long and others that linger not long enough but for an early effort from Considine this promises much for the future. This is Considine's 'Taxi Driver' and I will queue around the block for Considine's 'Goodfellas'.Superb writing and gritty direction performances better yet and Colman delivers on every level. Bravo Ms Colman and bravo to everyone else associated with the best British film of the decade.See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will keep this simple.It has been quite a while since a movie has shook me to my very core rattled my sense of security and left me deeply scarred when I got out of the theater.Tyrannosaur for me personally is one of the best movies of the year. The year's not over and it may as well hold a top 3 spot on my list until the end.First and foremost the acting in this movie was outstanding. Mullan Colman was incredible as the two forces that move the movie. Marsan was genuinely terrifying. These three people should be considered for Oscars when the time comes.There were a few moments where I almost...almost turned my head away and not many movies can claim the privilege of making me squirm and feel uneasy Not even the fairly recent A Serbian Film.I guess the strongest strength of this movie was the uncanny sense of realism. I've spent enough time learning and observing just what emotions and bursts of rage can do to people. And every bit of rage and anger in this movie seemed all too real. I'm sure some will counter me on this but for me I didn't consider any actions reactions in this movie to be overthetop. They flowed seamlessly taking us to bleak dark places sprinkling a bit of hope and light along the way only for us to be shocked again. By god it was VERY suspenseful in some parts.In the end a few hours after getting out of the screening I'm still reeling trying to find my composure. No it's not an easy movie to watch and yes some will probably dismiss it as an unnecessary glorification of domestic violence and brutality. But for me it's more than that it has soul one that's not easy to capture with a subject as difficult as this but Considine certainly managed to do just that.Watch it if you get a chance.9.510".

The year's not over and it may as well hold a top 3 spot on my list until the end.First and foremost the acting in this movie was outstanding. Mullan Colman was incredible as the two forces that move the movie. Marsan was genuinely terrifying. These three people should be considered for Oscars when the time comes.There were a few moments where I almost...almost turned my head away and not many movies can claim the privilege of making me squirm and feel uneasy Not even the fairly recent A Serbian Film.I guess the strongest strength of this movie was the uncanny sense of realism.

Grim in every way but where there is despair there is always a chink of light and Tyrannosaur is all about that little chink of light.Joseph is an angry man . A very angry man. A man who's life is not good. When he's life is at it's worst he accidentally comes across a good Samaritan in Hannah who see's the good in people yet in reality is having a far worse time than Joseph.I have to say that the performance of Olivia Colman has to be the best i have seen by any actor this year. A quite stunning portrayal of a battered woman who has nothing good in her life yet always has a smile for someone. Peter Mullan is fantastic also and it goes without saying that Eddie Marsden is brilliant.Writer and director Paddy Constantine should be proud of what he has done here and i cant recommend this film highly enough and if this does not pick up awards in the new year then there is no justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paddy Considine's directorial debut has been a widely anticipated event. With his excellent performances throughout his British cinematic career most notably his work with Shane Meadows a dark churning piece of cinema was what we have been expecting. We have not been let down. Tyrannosaur is as gritty as it is gripping. The setting in a Northern industrial working class community  the estates of Leeds creates the imprisoned physical environment for Joseph Peter Mullen an alcoholic selfloathing widower who meets a Christian charity worker Olivia Coleman and we are drawn into their troublesome worlds. The films workings of violence and desperation draws another influence to my mind which is Gary Oldman's directorial debut 'Nil by Mouth'. Both are lavished in gritty deglamorised violence. Both have a tendency to stare the darkness in the eye unlike some audience members including myself that will have an undeniable urge to look away. It's a representation of life on the underside where it often is difficult dark testing and sometimes evil in its twists of fate.The film has a strong link to animalistic representations an element to which instantly brought Andrea Arnolds award winning short film 'Dog' to mind. The idea of trapped animals and the capabilities of those pushed too far is a powerful and dominating theme.Needless to say the challenging viewing nature of this film forms the base of its appeal. Its unflinching and unapologetic brutality could be deemed too prosaic for the majority of mainstream cinema goers. You will need to be ready for the challenge to fully take in and be moved by the film it's not one to watch on a Sunday morning put it that way.The direction and acting are the notables in this production. Most notably Olivia Coleman whose supporting role threatens to overshadow that of Mullen's if it wasn't for his own exceptional performance. Mullen portrays Joseph in such a way that despite his loathsome qualities he remains human and even relatable at times when other characters don't.But it is Coleman's character and performance that really underpins and illuminates the rest of the feature. Her character is an almost polarised opposite in comparison with Joseph however as the plot turns we are exposed to an array of character transformations. It is these that actually help support the minimalistic plot which allows us to focus and be consumed by these iridescent performances.Considine has excelled himself in his writing and direction with very few criticisms that could be levelled at each other than those looking to nitpick. Whilst somewhat preoccupied with the grim and depressive side of the characters the film triumphs as it chase's the ray of light at the end of the tunnel. For all its depressing and challenging nature it mirrors the lives it portrays and the personal struggles of the characters as they keep pushing and fighting. An excellent first feature from Considine and I personally cannot wait for his next offering.".

The graphic representation of these themes in visual terms is also common to both films. And finally both contain outstanding performances from their cast.But writerdirector Paddy Considine brings his own stamp to this project in his bold portrayal of an odd couple fleetingly driven together in extreme circumstances. Joseph is a selfloathing harddrinking loner haunted by past failures particularly in regard to his wife whom he hit. He tries to make up for his character failings with displays of loyalty to a dying friend. It smacks of too little too late.Hannah is a devout Christian who works in a Charity Shop during the day and enjoys a large glass of rioja at night. Her faith is built on less stable foundations than Joseph assumes when they first meet. His attack on her character may well prove to be the last abusive act of his life such is the scale of regret it will bring in the longterm.Peter Mullan as Joseph is convincingly lost playing a character removed by only a few degrees from the father he portrays in Neds. Olivia Colman is simply immense as Hannah a brittle front easily broached by Joseph's bile unleashing a fear and unhinged reaction that even the volatile Joseph struggles to comprehend. In between there is a touching vulnerability and unnerving humanity. Eddie Marsan as the depraved James once again proves why he is fast becoming Britain's preeminent character actor.This is characterdriven social realist filmmaking to a certain extent though there is a prominent threeact structure exhibited more than in most films of the type including a quite shocking but satisfying 'surprise' at the end. Tyrannosaur forces you to think about how we treat each other and about the lives unraveling around us that we choose to turn a blind eye to. A mature debut from Considine who sets a very high bar for himself.".

	schema:headline " The actor Paddy Considine produces a powerful writingdirecting debut";
	schema:reviewBody "In Tyrannosaur the relatively young but wellestablished actor Paddy Considine he's 37 directs a group of superb British thespians in a searing drama about a rageoholic widower in the town of Leeds. Basing his protagonists on unspecified but intimate experiences and aspects of his own mother in the dead wife Considine has written a film that's intense brutal and compelling. It takes us to the deep end of violence and cruelty but leads us through to a sense of redemption. A gray grizzled lonely angry pub denizen widower Joseph Scot Peter Mullan a scary lifeforce with both violent and sensitive sides displays nothing but drinkingfueled violence in the early scenes of the film in which he beats his own dog to death smashes the window of a bank and assaults three rowdy youths in a pub when we're barely past the credits. He runs into a charity shop to hide from the youths and it's here he meets Hannah Olivia Colman complex and heartrending with whom he will be involved throughout the film. Considine strains the audience's ability to stomach violence and ugliness but hardly strains our credulity. He has made what is very close to a great film.When Joseph hides behind a rack of clothes in the shop Hannah calms him and prays for him. He begins things on an honest basis with her declaring My best friend's dying of cancer. I killed my dog. I'm fked. Visits to his friend and a funeral punctuate the action and add perspective. The next day in a desperate emotional state Joseph returns to the shop again but is abusive and nasty about Hannah's religiosity and what she later ironically calls her cozy life in the Manors housing estates. Now the film's point of view shifts to Hannah. We learn she too drinks whenever the bus takes her home to her suburban house. First it may seem this is to deal with the violent emotions she has absorbed from Joseph but it soon emerges that she lives in a horribly abusive relationship with her jealous cruel and desperately unhappy husband James Eddie Marsan whose return home is anything but a pleasure. There's a surprising rolereversal that gradually develops between Joseph and Hannah.James' behavior makes Joseph's violence seem simpler. He urinates on Hannah for falling asleep on the sofa before he gets home and other cruelties she reveals later that prevented her from childbearing are disgusting and some of her experiences may strain credulity. Joseph's mood swings are scary while Joseph seems his own worst enemy but not entirely a bad man. For one thing he has one warm relationship with a kid across the street Samuel Bottomley who must live with his irresponsible mother Sian Breckin and her aggressive punk boyfriend Paul Popplewell  but maintains good humor and friendliness toward Joseph. There's some humor if of an insensitive kind too in Joseph's explanation to Hannah of how Tyrannosaur came to be his nickname for his overweight diabetic wife but the word suggests that part of him is a prehistoric raging animal. The film's final scene offers hope for both Hannah and Joseph.Considine seems just to be establishing character and situation halfway through the film but when Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence inflicted on self or by others events become tense and suspenseful and desperate though the characters are we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Semicomical rants from Joseph's drinking scragglyhaired drinking partner Tommy Ned Dennehy add flourishes and the death of Joseph's friend and his funeral which family and Hannah now very battered and taking refuge with Joseph provides a temporary pause before final revelations. Considine is as strong in the plotting as in the character areas and his choice and directing of actors can't be faulted.There is intensity and bitter truth in Considine who steers clear of the edge of wild fantasy one finds in the Irishman Martin McDonagh. His harshness verges on the crude. But considering how well all the elements are managed here Considine has produced a very impressive debut. He knows how to grab you and hold you all the way through. If you're looking at your watch it just because you're terrified. Brutal and ugly this world may be but Considine seems to know it and love it enough to show its truth and humanity.

	onyx:emotionText "In Tyrannosaur the relatively young but wellestablished actor Paddy Considine he's 37 directs a group of superb British thespians in a searing drama about a rageoholic widower in the town of Leeds. Basing his protagonists on unspecified but intimate experiences and aspects of his own mother in the dead wife Considine has written a film that's intense brutal and compelling. It takes us to the deep end of violence and cruelty but leads us through to a sense of redemption. A gray grizzled lonely angry pub denizen widower Joseph Scot Peter Mullan a scary lifeforce with both violent and sensitive sides displays nothing but drinkingfueled violence in the early scenes of the film in which he beats his own dog to death smashes the window of a bank and assaults three rowdy youths in a pub when we're barely past the credits. He runs into a charity shop to hide from the youths and it's here he meets Hannah Olivia Colman complex and heartrending with whom he will be involved throughout the film. Considine strains the audience's ability to stomach violence and ugliness but hardly strains our credulity. He has made what is very close to a great film.When Joseph hides behind a rack of clothes in the shop Hannah calms him and prays for him. He begins things on an honest basis with her declaring My best friend's dying of cancer. I killed my dog. I'm fked. Visits to his friend and a funeral punctuate the action and add perspective. The next day in a desperate emotional state Joseph returns to the shop again but is abusive and nasty about Hannah's religiosity and what she later ironically calls her cozy life in the Manors housing estates. Now the film's point of view shifts to Hannah. We learn she too drinks whenever the bus takes her home to her suburban house. First it may seem this is to deal with the violent emotions she has absorbed from Joseph but it soon emerges that she lives in a horribly abusive relationship with her jealous cruel and desperately unhappy husband James Eddie Marsan whose return home is anything but a pleasure. There's a surprising rolereversal that gradually develops between Joseph and Hannah.James' behavior makes Joseph's violence seem simpler. He urinates on Hannah for falling asleep on the sofa before he gets home and other cruelties she reveals later that prevented her from childbearing are disgusting and some of her experiences may strain credulity. Joseph's mood swings are scary while Joseph seems his own worst enemy but not entirely a bad man. For one thing he has one warm relationship with a kid across the street Samuel Bottomley who must live with his irresponsible mother Sian Breckin and her aggressive punk boyfriend Paul Popplewell  but maintains good humor and friendliness toward Joseph. There's some humor if of an insensitive kind too in Joseph's explanation to Hannah of how Tyrannosaur came to be his nickname for his overweight diabetic wife but the word suggests that part of him is a prehistoric raging animal. The film's final scene offers hope for both Hannah and Joseph.Considine seems just to be establishing character and situation halfway through the film but when Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence inflicted on self or by others events become tense and suspenseful and desperate though the characters are we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Semicomical rants from Joseph's drinking scragglyhaired drinking partner Tommy Ned Dennehy add flourishes and the death of Joseph's friend and his funeral which family and Hannah now very battered and taking refuge with Joseph provides a temporary pause before final revelations. Considine is as strong in the plotting as in the character areas and his choice and directing of actors can't be faulted.There is intensity and bitter truth in Considine who steers clear of the edge of wild fantasy one finds in the Irishman Martin McDonagh. His harshness verges on the crude. But considering how well all the elements are managed here Considine has produced a very impressive debut. He knows how to grab you and hold you all the way through. If you're looking at your watch it just because you're terrified. Brutal and ugly this world may be but Considine seems to know it and love it enough to show its truth and humanity. The accomplishment here is to give us lives that seem broken and hopeless and then hold our sympathy and offer a chance of a new beginning that's far from soft and easy. Erik Alexander Wilson's images which for a welcome change are not distractingly jerky and handheld have a kind of limpid clarity and there are some songs at the funeral that are almost too rich and pretty.

	schema:headline " Hard to digest but brilliantly acted...";
	schema:reviewBody "Recently Hollywood and the various film industries across the globe have seen an upsurge in the amount of onscreen performers who are taking a break from acting in front of the camera to instead take control from behind it. Paddy Considine the star of 'This is England' and 'Dead Man's Shoes' is now a member of this increasingly growing club with his first featurefilm debut 'Tyrannosaur'. Written and Directed by Considine this is an uncompromising debut film from the former photographer which examines the destructive effects of violence and aggressive behaviour on the lives of two different individuals who are drawn together through their developing friendship.Joseph Peter Mullan is a lonely cynical and belligerent working class man. He spends his days drinking alone in the Pub and gambling in the local bookmakers where his only friends reside. Violent and abusive outbursts govern his existence thereby creating a solitary creature who acts on instinct rather than reasoning. However Joseph's life changes when he meets and befriends Hannah Olivia Colman a local Christian woman who is constantly being verbally and physically abused by her sadistic husband James Eddie Marsan. Both tortured souls they find solace in each other's lives and develop a friendship which transcends their misgivings.'Tyrannosaur' is an uncompromising and at times difficult film to watch as the characters' lives are laid bare for the whole audience to observe. Joseph responds to problematic situations through the use of his fists while Hannah simply acts out of fear and denial. Both Peter Mullan and Olivia Colman give fantastic performances Mullan is initially a brutish vagrant looking male who can't naturally become entwined in society but as the film develops empathy begins to grow for a man who accepts his shortcomings and the fact that he may never be able to overcome them. With humanity arising slowly from his dishevelled face through his relationship with the young neighbourhood boy Sam Samuel Bottomley.While Colman's striking performance which is farcry away from her role on the hit British comedy series 'Peep Show' shows a woman who is conflicted in all manner of her beliefs. Her religious beliefs give her the naivety to believe that her husband can change while her heart knows that he will only stop hurting her when her beatings become fatal. This is most notable in the scene where James breaks down in tears at her feet after striking out at Hannah as she cradles his head he constantly professes his love for her repeating the phrase it won't happen again you know it won't happen again. Hannah constantly reaffirms his worries saying that she does love him but as she lowers his head the camera observes her changing emotions as the audience is shown that Hannah is clearly not a woman in love with James but instead she is simply afraid of him.Considine's first directorial effort is certainly a competent effort he never attempts to direct the audience's attention too far from the script or the two central performances at hand but this itself is the film's primary flaw. While it is captivating and emotionally unsettling it is also a narrative which is not uncommon in modern British cinema or known to some as 'miserable British cinema' and it portrays the same judgements and ideals as many of its predecessors did before without providing anything new to the subgenre at hand especially in the culmination of the subplot involving the young boy Sam and his neglectful mother and boyfriend.Despite its unoriginality in the narrative's conclusive mediation the film still manages to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer through its combination of horrifying visuals and fragile performances from the two lead British actors as Paddy Considine begins his feature film journey with a solid and respectable character portrait of two broken individuals.".

	schema:reviewBody "For much of the past century class consciousness has been at the centre of Britain's film output. Developing the style dubbed by commentators and critics as 'British Realism' our filmmakers seem continually preoccupied with class division and its inherent anxieties. But more than ever realism seems to have very little to do with it as what began with such kitchensink masterpieces as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning has now been reduced to onedimensional and clichd depictions of life on 'the other side of the tracks'.In the world of all things edgy and British Paddy Considine is almost too good to be true. He is a longtime friend and collaborator of Shane Meadows has starred in an Arctic Monkeys video and of course has a regional accent. After a decade of acting in such highprofile films as Dead Man's Shoes and Submarine Considine made the transition into writing and directing with his short film Dog Altogether. His new film Tyrannosaur expands upon the BAFTA awardwinning short and much like Considine himself is a veritable checklist of Britflick clich.The film tells the story of Joseph Peter Mullan and Hannah Olivia Colman. Joseph is a gruff alcoholic whose violent rage obscures a heart of gold Hannah is a middleclass charityshop volunteer whose cheery exterior hides a torturous home life. The two meet and would you believe it they realise that  despite their different backgrounds  they are kindred spirits.Not only is the plot a little onthenose but Tyrannosaur is so painfully conventional that at times it borders on parody. Even the setting is all too familiar a gloomy estate shrouded in perpetual dusk where sirens are forever sounding in the background and children kick ragged footballs against graffitiadorned walls.Furthermore the way in which Considine attempts to unpick the binary between the middle and workingclass experiences is blatant to the point of being distasteful. In order to show us that Joseph and Hannah share the same pain Considine juxtaposes images of Joseph spending his evenings in an old armchair wearing a vest and holding a baseball bat to his head with scenes of Hannah in the comfort of her newbuild home sobbing into a glass of Blossom Hill. Whilst Considine deals with some pretty dark subject matter  namely abuse rage and alcoholism  such relentless stereotyping robs the film of any actual pathos.As the two tortured souls begin to find solace in one another the rest of the film unfolds in an equally embarrassing fashion. At one point Hannah joins Joseph at his local pub for his friend's wake. What follows is a horrendous scene in which she drinks lager smiles incessantly and dances around with Joseph and his ragtag group of friends. The fact that this exact sequence was perhaps done with about the same level of sophistication in James Cameron's Titanic where Rose joins Jack in steerage to dance a jig and drink Guinness is rather telling of the level of insight into class division Tyrannosaur provides.In spite of the dire material they are given the cast do rather well and are of notably high esteem. Peter Mullan for instance has starred in some of gritty British cinema's most beloved films including Ken Loach's Riff Raff and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting. Yet this impressive pedigree only adds to the overriding sense of selfparody as Tyrannosaur is little more than a caricature of the sort of film that someone like Mullan would find himself in.Tyrannosaur has already won numerous awards at both the Sundance and Munich film festivals and it's easy to see why. Like the old Hollywood joke that all you need to do to win an Oscar is make a film about the Holocaust it seems that all you need to do as a British filmmaker to find critical success is to cobble something together involving a grotty pub a rough estate and a pitbull chained to some railings. Tyrannosaur is all this with bells on a paintbynumbers British drama that is as offensive as it is redundant.".

	schema:headline " Tyrannosaur Feat. Q  A with Paddy Considine";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since his debut appearance in Shane Meadow's cult classic A Room for Romeo Brass back in 1999 Paddy Considine has provided us with a diverse range of characters in low budget wonders as well as appearing in a number of Hollywood productions. His acting ability seems to know no limits and it was with great anticipation that I awaited the opening credits of his feature length directorial debut Tyrannosaur blissfully unaware of the gritty realism and brutality that was about to unfold before my eyes.It was interesting to see that Brian Cox was also in the audience it is clear that this actor turned director is respected not just by his audience but also by his peers. When the lights went down in the packed cinema a stark silence fell on the audience the anticipation was enormous and I was hoping that Tyrannosaur would live up to its name.After the success of his BAFTA award winning short film Dog Altogether Paddy decided to revisit the characters he first introduced to us back in 2007 to take an in depth look at their lives. For those unfortunate enough to have missed this short it follows the path of an unhinged man Joseph and his encounter with a religious charity shop worker Hannah who will seemingly stop at nothing to help him. This scenario is revisited in Tyrannosaur and it is great to see that Considine stuck with the same actors with both Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman putting in exceptional performances which are only enhanced by the inclusion of Eddie Marsan as Hannah's violent husband.Comparisons to Shane Meadows work are inevitable but Tyrannosaur is an altogether different beast with lashes of dark humour and depraved acts that would not be out of place in a Peckinpah film. It is incredible how Paddy manages to create a feeling of empathy towards Joseph he is a violent brute with little or no concern for those around him but somehow also strangely likable. His relationship with Hannah is the key to this as we see rare glimpses of affection which indicate a human side to him even though we are well aware that deep inside there is a monster lurking.Joseph is not the only one prone to violent outbursts with Hannah's husband even more twisted and abhorrent. From the offset it is clear that there will be an inevitable confrontation between these two characters and the build up to this climax is outstanding. The supporting cast do a fantastic job of grounding the story with a gripping subplot involving a young child and his suffering at the hands of his mother's cruel boyfriend. I fear that I have already given away too much but I have barely scraped the surface of this captivating drama that will be playing on my mind for a long time to come.For a debut film this leaves one hell of an impression whilst asserting Considine's position as a Director to watch out for. In my eyes it is the third great British debut of the year following on from Richard Ayoade's Submarine and Joe Cornish's Attack The Block and it gives me faith that our nation can compete with Hollywood when it comes to one of the most important aspect of a filmmaking the art of storytelling.Paddy was gracious enough to appear at the preview screening I attended for a Q  A session following his film and the rapturous applause spoke for itself. I have encountered him twice before at gigs where he played with his brilliant band Riding the Low and he always comes across as a charismatic down to earth guy with a genuine passion for his art whether it be acting singing or directing.It wasn't long before he mentioned his pal Shane Meadows and not long after this Paddy's phone went off It's Shane telling me I better watch what I say about him he retorted reading his text message. It's off the cuff comments like this that make it so easy to warm to the man and it was not long before we were all putty in his hands listening to his fascinating anecdotes and eager to press him for as much information as we could in the time allotted.My highlight of the session was Paddy's retort about filming on location You can't film Inception down the f high street and he went on to mention how the way a man came past walking his dog provided the idea for one of the key scenes in the film. In another scene shot in a pub I was astounded to learn that the guitarist was given the part in order to stop him from pestering the crew. The song he created fitted perfectly with the mood of the film indicating that Paddy is unafraid to take risks with his filmmaking in order to provide us with the aspect of realism that echoes throughout Tyrannosaur.One of the highlights of British cinema this year Tyrannosaur is an outstanding debut with powerful performances that should not be missed. Fans of Considine will certainly be impressed by his decision to move behind the camera and those new to his work will be dumbstruck by the sheer brilliance of what could well be the next great British director.".

In my eyes it is the third great British debut of the year following on from Richard Ayoade's Submarine and Joe Cornish's Attack The Block and it gives me faith that our nation can compete with Hollywood when it comes to one of the most important aspect of a filmmaking the art of storytelling.Paddy was gracious enough to appear at the preview screening I attended for a Q  A session following his film and the rapturous applause spoke for itself. I have encountered him twice before at gigs where he played with his brilliant band Riding the Low and he always comes across as a charismatic down to earth guy with a genuine passion for his art whether it be acting singing or directing.It wasn't long before he mentioned his pal Shane Meadows and not long after this Paddy's phone went off It's Shane telling me I better watch what I say about him he retorted reading his text message. It's off the cuff comments like this that make it so easy to warm to the man and it was not long before we were all putty in his hands listening to his fascinating anecdotes and eager to press him for as much information as we could in the time allotted.My highlight of the session was Paddy's retort about filming on location You can't film Inception down the f high street and he went on to mention how the way a man came past walking his dog provided the idea for one of the key scenes in the film. In another scene shot in a pub I was astounded to learn that the guitarist was given the part in order to stop him from pestering the crew. The song he created fitted perfectly with the mood of the film indicating that Paddy is unafraid to take risks with his filmmaking in order to provide us with the aspect of realism that echoes throughout Tyrannosaur.One of the highlights of British cinema this year Tyrannosaur is an outstanding debut with powerful performances that should not be missed. Fans of Considine will certainly be impressed by his decision to move behind the camera and those new to his work will be dumbstruck by the sheer brilliance of what could well be the next great British director.";

For the first time the male protagonist sees what he was what he has failed to do and what he must do to make things right. It is such a cathartic moment of clarity for him and his female friend both clarity and horror and a complete shock for the audience.Peter Mullan stars in one of the year's best films. He plays a man Joseph who suffers from alcohol loneliness and worst of all rage. His temper hurts those around him and gets him into more trouble than he can chew. His only friend is dying the daughter of which hates both him and her dying father. He drinks all day staggers home at night and fights anyone who does him wrong or at least what he calls wrong.One day he winds up hiding inside a woman's garment shop. She finds him irritable vulnerable and extremely volatile. The woman Hannah Olivia Colman does what most of us wouldn't do. She let's him be offers tea and prays for him. This confuses Joseph. It's quite evident but underneath all the testosterone and aggression you can almost see him trying to figure out why she helps.We soon find out that she is the victim of someone similar to Joseph only more cruel and abusive than just angry. Her husband James Eddie Marsan drinks as well but his temper and need for sex and authority drive him to do awful things to Hannah. Joseph and Hannah strike an unlikely friendship attempting to find solace in the utter chaos that is life.Mullan and Colman play off of each other so well. They both need help and want help but don't know how to ask others let alone help themselves. Mullan's character lost his wife to diabetes though his aggression doesn't stem from that single incident. We don't know everything about him or Hannah but we know their characters have seen a lot and have had to deal with more than your average Joe. Their faces and their voices speak volumes of their back story.Director Constantine makes his feature debut he also wrote the script. He shows a gritty and morbid Irish Landscape where the beer flows the skies are rarely bright and sunny and the nights are filled with barking dogs violent husbands and tortured souls crying out. He has developed some really deep disturbed characters that have significant baggage. The writing is authentic I'd be curious to find out how much was improvised by Mullan and others especially during tirades. There is a great deal of heart poured into this film.There is a good amount of disturbing material here that some people might find offensive. As tough as these scenes and images are to take in I find that they are necessary to tell this type of story. Violence is not pretty but when done with a certain grace and dedication it can really turn into something special such is the case with Tyrannosaur.".

However I felt that this film was such a work of art I could not help myself but come on here and add my voice to the chorus of compliments this film has been receiving.I like nothing better in a movie than something that is thought provoking and gripping. I get so bored with some of the formulaic nonsense churned out by filmmakers these days particularly from Hollywood. If I sit down to watch a film and I find myself utterly absorbed then that's usually a sign that the piece is something special. This was one such film and it was over before it had even started such did it hold my attention that I had no concept of the passage of time.The script written by director Paddy Considine isn't anything out of this world. It's fairly basic and in plenty of instances predictable. It is actually the direction and masterclass acting performances that serve to make this movie what it is. It is abundantly clear what the script sets out to do. Had the cast been average or simply not the correct casting choices this movie would've been instantly forgettable. However all three of the principle cast are absolutely amazing. Peter Mullan's good hearted tortured soul of a man is played to perfection as he lives a daily battle with the rage and anger that has become his demon and undoing in life. Eddie Marsan's ability to communicate the sheer evilness of the abusive husband is gripping especially considering the contrast he represents to other characters in the picture in that his character was more evil and nasty than fighting inner demons or pressure.However the major shout out of this film is Olivia Coleman's performance. It is truly astounding. I have been following her work ever since she appeared in a guest role in The Office. She just gets better and better. She expertly channels pressure of trying to keep one's self together despite having to live an intolerable and hidden existence. Despite her inevitable descent into the more during the course of the picture Coleman manages to continue having the audience feel nothing but sympathy and compassion for her character. An unfortunate victim of a world in which cruelty and evil is all too real and all to effecting should we come face to face with it in our lives.I am not sure whether or not this picture has been released too late but I was astounded to see Coleman not getting a best actressbest supporting actress nomination at the Academy Awards. I'm amazed how a performance like this gets overlooked yet an actress from Bridsmaids gets the nod. It beggar's belief.For those wanted a thought provoking film this is not to be missed. It is arguably the best British film of the year. For aspiring actors and actresses I would say this is a must watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had absolutely no knowledge or expectations for this film before  watching it and I think this probably augmented the shock that came  with its viewing.  To sum it up in one word I'd say this film is unsuspecting. The  characters plot and action are all totally plausible and the realist  style lulls you into a sense of suspended disbelief which makes the  impending violence all the more shocking. When I say violence I don't  just mean a Hollywoodstyle orgy of blood and guts everywhere. This  isn't sensationalist torture porn like the Saw films. Tyrannosaur's  violence is real and conceivable like it could actually happen. But it  happens when you least expect it and by those whom you least expect it  from. The resultant effect is a shock that stays with you well after  the film is finished.  The cast are incredible. Peter Mullan gives authenticity to a character  so filled with rage it would seem impossible for people like him to  really exist. Eddie Marsan is one of the most provocative villains I've  ever seen on screen and Olivia Colman's performance immediately tricks  you into forgetting what Peep Show is much less remembering that she  was in it.  I left this film thinking Paddy Considine HAS to make more films. The  direction if faultless  it has the same oppressive grey landscapes as  you would expect from any social realist film and focuses more on  faces expressions and economic storytelling than superficial flare.  His writing is top notch too. He has a way of clearly highlighting the  issues and themes domestic abuse anger lust and love and presenting  them in a fresh engaging inspiring and shocking form.  Tyrannosaur is a damn good film but it's not enjoyable in the  conventional sense of the word. It's affecting more than anything.  You're moved frightened and shaken by the things you see. You  physically and emotionally react and this I think is what makes a  good film.".

	schema:headline " In grim 'Tyrannosaur' 'Save the Cat' becomes 'Kill the Dog'";
	schema:reviewBody "The late screen writing guru Blake Snyder came out with a book a few years ago entitled 'Save the Cat'. He argued that a successful screenplay should contain a 'Save the Cat' moment at the beginning of a script where the hero ingratiates his audience through a humanitarian gesture it could involve helping a person or even an animal hence the term 'save the cat'. Newcomer writerdirector Paddy Considine turns Snyder's advice on its head by offering up the opposite a 'Kill the Dog' moment. Rather than feeling sympathy for the protagonist Considine seeks to alienate the audience from his protagonist and is quite successfulI can't recall a film in recent memory where not only one but two dogs are actually killed by the film's protagonist.My pet peeve with 'independent' films these days is that many protagonists don't like themselves. I call them 'sad sacks'. They're the type of characters that don't make for good drama since their egos are weak are always down on themselves and have little or no charm. Considine's 'Tyrannosaur' goes a step further by offering up Joseph the unemployed North England widower who has a perpetual anger management problem. When he meets domestic violence victim Hannah who runs a charity shop his harsh words toward her are a very hard draught to take.Nonetheless there is an even more despicable character than Joseph and that's Hannah's husband James the ultimate abusive husband. James' character is designed to shock as he's seen returning home one night intoxicated and ends up urinating over Hannah while she sleeps. He later rapes her and she reveals that he's placed shards of glass in her vagina in the past causing her to become infertile. While the domestic violence scenes are admittedly powerful they are also wholly manipulative since James is merely a onedimensional monster. It would have been much more difficult for Considine to humanize his villain. This also holds true for his secondary characters the skinheads who live across from Joseph who are also perpetually angry and are not above goading a dog to attack a child.Considine attempts to humanize Joseph a bit as he ultimately softens up in his relation to Hannah. But in a cruel twist of fateSPOILERS AHEADHannah is jailed for murdering her abusive husband. While Joseph pays his respects at a funeral for a friend and visits Hannah in prison at film's end this seems to indicate that he's 'cleaned up his act' somewhat but is it enough to forgive him for past transgressions? Some would say given his background 'yes'. But to my mind the horrible killing of the two dogs is enough to reject Joseph out of hand. There are many people who had horrendous childhoods or difficult lives who don't end up killing defenseless animals and subjecting others to continuous psychotic outbursts. Considine seems to argue that characters like Joseph should be given a 'free pass' or perhaps people should be 'understanding' given the environment these characters come from.There are occasional strong moments in 'Tyrannosaur' especially the aforementioned domestic violence scenes. But there were some characters who were too onedimensional such as James and others like Joseph who I was inclined to have little sympathy for. Only Olivia Colman's performance as the brutalized Hannah proved to be compelling and saved the film from a total unpleasant aftertaste. With so many films on the market investing oneself in Joseph's journey is not one I would care to take again.".

Peter Mullan was also excellent as Joseph a great piece of casting as I felt he was ideal for the role. Eddie Marsan plays the abusive and somewhat creepy husband just right and I have to also give a mention to the young actor Samuel Bottomley who plays a local boy who Joseph looks out for. I'm sure this young man will have a great future. This is a film that is all about the performances there are no special effects or fancy camera trickery it lives or dies on the performances and I have to say for me at least it worked to a tee! One of the criteria I use when deciding whether I like a film or not is the emotional response it generates. And I can honestly say with this one it was all positive.

	schema:headline " Paddy Considine has made a monster!";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't remember ever having sat through a film with my hand over my mouth for the entire duration but that is exactly what has just happened from opening scene to close.Knowing that this was a film by Paddy Considine a man known all too well for his roles as tormented souls abusive sociopaths and vicious psychos I had the feeling that this wasn't to be taken as lightly as the picture on the front cover suggested.Tyrannosaur is in fact a seething monster in the calm before the inevitable rampage and I believe that Considine has just gone and proved himself the most intensely expressive actor turned director since Gary Oldman brought us Nil By Mouth.The story without spoilers goes that Joe is a violently angry and disturbed man whose rage and aggression has already seemingly cost him dearly yet we see first hand the extent of the damage he brings on himself.His revulsion towards his own actions bring him to cross paths with Hannah a Christian charity shop worker who delivers him somewhat from the consequences of an outburst of rage. But when he judges her for someone that doesn't understand him or know the life he's lived little does he realise the damage and rage boiling beneath her own calm exterior.Tyrannosaur has the ability to be so many different kinds of story all at once and thanks to the clear direction of Considine the superb script and the outstanding performances of Peter Mullan Olivia Colman and the surprisingly solid Eddie Marsan you know all too well that the characters are capable of taking it in any one direction with all the purpose that their rage amounts to.But Tyrannosaur's true grit and determination keeps it on one set path. And never have I seen a film that so often portrays the very real fear sadness anger and confusion of any one character yet does not get lost. This film is bleak dirty perverted angering tragic  downright gutting in fact  and yet it becomes uplifting and redemptive.I would never want to tell Shane Meadows that he's out of a job but by the looks of Paddy Considine's first venture behind the camera he surely has competition.If this film doesn't rock the film industry they're all dead inside!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Kitchen Sink and Social Realistic genres are ever present in the UK as British filmmakers explore that the darker elements of life and society. Tyrannosaur is a film that shows that the genre is still alive.In a nameless working class town Joseph Peter Mullen is an unemployed man with a violence temper and flies into fits of rage with ease. After killing his dog and threatening a teenager in a pub Joseph hides in a charity shop. They he meets a Christian woman Hannah Olivia Colman offers the hand of friendship to Joseph. But Hannah is also a victim of violence suffering at the hand of her abusive husband Eddie Marsden.Tyrannosaur is the directing debut for actor Paddy Considine. He has a very hardhitting unflinching style as he is not afraid the most the darkest aspects of life. Considine explores the themes of violence in society how it affects people from the perpetrators to the victims and that it affects people from all walks from life. Violence at both the forefront and in the background as it effects characters in the background. The destructive effects of alcohol plays on people playing with their emotions and acting as a coping mechanism. The pacing is just right the score was soft and subtle and the cinematography had a dark simplicity to it highlighting the bleakness of the town and the situation of violence.The acting was fantastic throughout. Both Mullen and Colman had difficult roles and they did everything they needed to. It would have been easy to make out Joseph to be a vile human being that we want to see come to serious harm but Mullen does bring out a lot of character and complexity to his role I admit that his accent and grumble makes him a little hard to understand at times it was still a very compelling performance and it would be easy to far a man like him despite being in his late fortiesearly fifties. Playing a victim of domestic abuse is always a tough role to get right and Colman known mostly for comic roles gives a natural performance and deserved many of the Best British Awards she earned.Tyrannosaur is a very tough watch with some very graphic scenes that shock for its brutal depiction as a man searches for redemption. Tyrannosaur is a film you should see once.".

The film opens with the main character killing his dog how can you feel any empathy for this character?. Well watch this film and tell me you didn't feel something for him. Life is not black and white and this film affirms this brilliantly. The relationship between the thuggish Joseph and the gentle and kind Hannah is at times uncomfortable but is dealt with in a realistic and brutally honest way. The acting performances of the three main leads Peter Mullan Olivia Colman and Eddie Marsan are nothing short of phenomenal. The film is bleak but has it's moments of tenderness and every scene seems to work. My only negative about this film is that it's too short I could have gladly watched another 12 hour. The only reason this film hasn't got a 10 from me is that I never give any film a 10 on first viewing. This came pretty close to breaking that rule. If you are looking for a non sensationalist piece of gritty drama then you will never do better than watching this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I warmed to the idea of watching this film purely after seeing Mr Considines' performance in Dead Mans Shoes. I found his acting to be absolutely brilliant so was curious as to whether his film making would match his asking skills. And boy did they match up. In regards to the opening animal death scene. I NEVER watch animal documentaries purely for the reason that I hate seeing animals being killed even if it is for food. Any advert appealing for help from animal charities is upsetting for me so I agree the opening scene was tremendously upsetting. The second time I watched Tyrannosaur I skipped the opening scene to avoid it. BUT on the flipside people DO things like that to animals everyday and it is nitty and gritty and heart wrenching so the use of such a harrowing and upsetting scene fitted the film.I loved Peter Mullan in this. Yes he starts off as a right bstard but you can't help liking him and warming to him. All I kept thinking was 'I hope he gets the girl' because I sensed such chemistry between him and Olivia's character. They worked so well together. The two contrasts of characters the drunken down and out versus the charity shop working religious caring person but both living very similar lives both alcohol ridden and laced with trauma. Perfect!I'd read before watching this that it was a depressing film and long winded and hard to watch. Nonsense. It's very good indeed. Well done Paddy. Thank you for this film and hope there is going to be loads more to come from you.".

At a relatively short 92minutes Tyrannosaur packs both a literal and figurative punch. Although it is short in length it is NOT slight in subject matter  as it is grim austere dark and disturbing at times but ultimately uplifting and therefore a rewarding watch.The film begins after a particularly rough night for Joseph he is brutally beaten over some verbal sparrings and provoking antics when he stumbles upon Hannah as she is opening her store one morning. The pious and kind Hannah opens her doors arms and heart to the broken man although he isn't sure if he wants to take any of her kindness or charity and he makes this fully known he has his reasons.The film takes some twists and a few unexpected turns but these two stay true to their conflicted characters as it becomes a tale of morality faith and devotion and not how one might expect. Soon after the pair meet the tables are turned and Hannah seeks out Joseph for some muchneeded helpsupport on her side. These characters are highly flawed but well written  don't misread that  as this is what makes Tyrannosaur stand out for good reason in search of someone else who might value them as something. There is a searching a longing a desire a grasp a yearning or a hunger present in THESE characters that is not commonly found in film today. These two simply have an URGE to be valued flawsandall by a fellow human being! I will safely ? bet that the majority of us are not as flawed as either Joseph or Hannah but their NEED should resonate with us all! These two destructive personalities find solace in one another but they initially do not know what to make of the other and the film plays out their developing relationship. This is a particularly good watch although it is a tough one  and I am glad to recommend it as I also see it as an important one.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something about watching this very dark brutal intense deeply sad and yet profoundly compelling movie that seeps into the psyche making future night walks rather fearsome. Paddy Considine who can bring us such warmly lovable characters on the screen as an actor here write and directs a story that pleads for us to look at just how low people can go  and still survive. It is shocking to watch but once the film begins the power of the story and the brilliance of the actors who bring it to life it is impossible to pause for breath.Joseph Peter Mullan is a grizzled isolated drunk widower whose anger at the world is so close to the surface that he lashes out at the slightest provocation  even to the point of brutally killing his own beloved dog at the opening of the film  a fact that makes the audience loathe him form the start. He lives alone occasionally visits his only friend who is dying from cancer and ha a connection with a kid across form his flat a young boy Sam Sammuel Bottomley who is forced to sit out on the sidewalk while his mother Sian Breckin cavorts with her current boyfriend Paul Popplewell who keeps his pitbull dog close by. In a matter of a few days Joseph has not only beaten his dog to death but he has also crushed the windows of the Paskistani bank where he abuses the owners and in a pub pool hall he severely beats three mouthy boys who taunt him.Having no place to hide Joseph walks into a charity second hand store run by Hannah Olivia Colmana seemingly evangelical church woman who takes pity on Joseph and prays for him despite the fact that Joseph is atheistic. As the story unfolds we discover that Hannah is also a profoundly sad woman her smarmy husband James Edie Marsan is abusive Hannah is afraid of him and turns to drinking to escape her loathing of James. James spies Hannah with Joseph threatens her and rapes her urinates on her and destroys her organs with broken glass so that she is sterile. Hannah attempts to leave James gets drunk is beaten more and finally ends up with Joseph as her only friend and Gilead. When Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence inflicted on self or by others events become tense and suspenseful and desperate though the characters are we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Once the playing field is even between Joseph and Hannah things change and we realize how desperately at the bottom of the pit they are. What happens form that point most be seen afresh to appreciate the ending.There is some comic relief provided Joseph's drinking scragglyhaired drinking partner Tommy Ned Dennehy and some songs and dancing at the funeral when Joseph's friend dies but the overall film is bleak and in the hands of lesser actors than Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman it may not have worked. But Considine's writing and direction along with the brilliant performances of these tow actors produces a film that is one of the finest of the year. This is cinema at its darkest and we should see films like this to realign our own perspectives about how life can be severely difficult. Grady Harp April 12".

	schema:reviewBody "The title and cover of this DVD suggest a film that is more fluff than substance. But don't be fooled by these clues. BLIND DATING is a wellwritten Christopher Theo welldirected James Keach  brother of Stacy Keach and husband of Jane Seymour story about the coping of the visually impaired the quirks of Italian and Indian families brotherhood and the gamut of finding the right partner in a world of essential blind dating! One of the reasons the movie works so well is the ability of actor Chris Pine to make us believe he is blind and convey the positive manner in which people with impairments 'view' those around them.Danny Chris Pine was born prematurely and as a result is blind and as he grows toward age 21 he feels he is unattractive to women. His family is warm loving and Italian and supportive  especially his brother Larry Eddie Kaye Thomas who runs a Limo service and is constantly trying to find Danny his first physical encounter be that with hookers girls from the office or neighborhood or just referrals  each of whom is a disaster when it comes to dealing with a date who is blind! Danny discovers an operation that implants a cameralike contraption in his brain that will allow him the possibility to see again even if the images are simply black and white and indistinct. In the office of ophthalmologist Dr. Perkins Stephen Tobolowsky is a young girl Leeza Anjali Ray who is Indian and whose parents have arranged a wedding with a man she does not love. And yes in time Danny and Leeza are attracted to each other in what appears to be a doomed relationship  for family reasons. Danny has his operation and is able to see some images but the implant fails and Danny once again is without sight  but far from being without hope as both his and Leeza's families undergo changes of heart.There is a sense of love that emanates from the screen due in part to the script the direction and to the acting. Chris Pine is exceptionally fine in a challenging role finding the balance between courage comedy and tenderness that make his character believable and lovable and never once making a move that breaks his image as a sightless person. The entire cast is fine including a hilarious Jane Seymour as Dr. Evans Chris' therapist with a penchant for disrobing in front of her sightless patient! But the aspect of the film that sets it apart from many is the presentation of everyday type prejudices that can be every bit as hampering as a physical impairments! This is a warmhearted very human comedy with many messages. Grady Harp".

Chris Pine's portrait of a blind guy seems very real to me and I really felt for him throughout the whole movie. The story is somewhat obvious and not that inventive but it has a point and even though it's sometimes a little clich it's still very decent and enjoyable. After all IT IS a comedydrama there just has to bee some parts we all know.Everybody are just human after all. It doesn't matter if you are visually impaired what skin color you have or what your heritage is. Watch this flick if you want to feel a little better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Film Festival. You can tell from the movie poster that the movie is intended to be taken light heartedly and be fun. Which I thought it was.The main character Danny is blind and a virgin. He is not looking only for sex but for a relationship and something that has meaning. His brother does not understand this and sets Danny up on a slew of bad dates ranging from the overly emotional to the very promiscuous. Danny finally meets someone on his own Leeza who works at his eye doctor's office. Leeza is Indian and engaged but still goes out with Danny. She falls for him but chooses her fiance over him for cultural reasons. Danny and Leeza are separated and go through some ups and downs but ultimately they end up together.I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and I thought Chris Pine Danny did a very good job. But I think this movie could have been more than it was. The two main characters obviously have stresses in their lives which I feel could have been explored more. But instead the movie focuses on the pranks that get pulled on Danny and the various nutjobs his brother sets him up with. Personally I would have liked to see Danny and Leeza's relationship become deep and really feel their connection over the sometimes crude humor. I would have liked to see more of Leeza struggling with the cultural differences rather than a few teary eyes when she is at dinner with her family. Being of Indian descent I felt some of her insecurity but I think had she been more developed more everyone could have really felt it. Chris Pine is lovable kind and clever as he gets back at his brother and takes his life into his own hands.Overall its a fun watch. Don't go in expecting anything profound but expect a few crude jokes and take the movie for what it is. A comedy about a cute blind guy going on dates.".

He said it's being released in May and if you like it tell your friends. Well since I absolutely hated it I figured I'd do the same. And then I expanded friends to include everyone I could possibly think of.At the beginning of the movie we find out that Danny is 22 he's been blind all his life and he's looking for love. That's about where the fun stops because from this point on he becomes a vehicle for cheap jokes and stereotypes. See Danny run down a hill and smack into a tree! See Danny get tricked into picking up dog poop because his brother tells him it's candy! See Danny walk right smack into a door! See Danny slip and fall on a toy! See Danny's therapist taking off her clothes because she finds him attractive and he can't see her! See his brother faking benchpressing reps at the gym because he can't see the weights!His slimy brother Larry played by Eddie Kaye Thomas who apparently watched a lot of Mickey Rourke movies to prepare for the role just wants him to get laid and sets him up with a string of predictably awful dates. See Danny's first date turn into a complete basket case the minute she finds out he's blind! See Danny's maneating second date chase him into a bathroom stall! See Danny's third date paw at him under the table and tell a potential John that she costs 500 per visit!By the way Larry runs a limo service and he rents it out to prostitutes and their johns when he isn't busy. And this leads to an appalling stereotype. See the Asian man taking lots of pictures and asking Larry to take one of him with his hooker!Wait there's more. Leeza a receptionist at a doctor's office for blind patients takes a liking to Danny. Because apparently you have to be someone who works with blind people to ever fall in love with one. But she's Indian and therefore her family has an arranged marriage set up for her. See Leeza fighting her mother for the right to marry whoever she wants! See the predictable lowlife she's been matched up with!This is the first movie I've seen in forever that made me think of Roger Ebert's famous review of North as a comparison. You know the one  I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. It was stupid insulting and actually offensive at times. I guess it was trying to be like The 40YearOld Virgin which I really enjoyed but there's a huge difference between that movie and this one. Virgin treated its main character with respect and its characters had human flaws of their own that explained some of their antics. But this movie treats Danny like a joke surrounded by phonedin caricatures. There's probably a good movie out there about the social awkwardness that can result from being blind but this is absolutely not it. To think James Keane said he was really proud of this movie.".

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay romanticcomedy which is entertaining to a certain degree and definitely had some potential. Unfortunately this film didn't quite have enough comedy or romance to sustain my interest or elevate it any higher than a rating of average.";

It has similar themes of other amazing films like Late Spring and Early Summer both of which had the truly amazing actress Setsuko Hara who is not in this film. However this film is just about as great as them since it has one of the best acting performances of terrific Ozu regular Chishu Ryu. He plays the father a widower with three children two sons and a daughter. It is no surprise to me that the daughter Michiko played by Shima Iwashita and Akiko the daughter in law played by Mariko Okada have had such long varied careers in cinema. They are great in their roles. There is a certain sass to both of them which really comes across in their characters. They are also both beautiful. The story also has a great sideline in which Mr. Ryu's old friends help out an teacher nicknamed The Gourd. From there you meet the teacher's daughter Tanako a familiar face to all Ozu fans. I was deeply affected by Tomako even though her role is small. I feel her sadness and loneliness. Another great scene is when the father meets up with an old armed services buddy and they go to a local bar and play a war march. They are a bit drunk and they salute. Playing the barmaid is the great actress Kyoko Kishida star of the great Manji and Woman In The Dunes. I was deeply interested in the lives of these people and find the film to be just wonderful displaying the emotions that a great Ozu film possesses. This film is profoundly moving. I would not start with this film as an introduction to Ozu only because Tokyo Story Late Spring and I Was Born But are such masterpieces but this ranks with them. A deeply profound excellent epitaph from Yasojiro Ozu one of the greatest directors ever from anywhere at any time. See it you will not be disappointed. Rest in peace Yasojiro Ozu.".

	schema:reviewBody "An Autumn Afternoon the final film by the great Yasujiro Ozu is a portrayal of family interaction and conflict that provides a moving summation of a career that produced 53 films in 60 years. Similar in theme to his 1949 film Late Spring a widowed father Shuhei Hirayama portrayed by the wonderful Chishu Ryu wants his 24year old daughter Michiko Shima Iwashima to marry but fears loneliness. After the death of her mother as is traditional in Japanese families Michiko has assumed her role taking care of household chores and making sure that her father's needs are met. She feels no urge to marry and prefers to remain at home.Much of An Autumn Afternoon consists of small vignettes of family life. One of these involves Hirayama's son Koichi Keiji Sada and his wife Akiko Mariko Okada. Both seem to mirror the encroaching consumer values of the new Tokyo lit up with neon lights CocaCola signs and rooftop golf. They bicker about finances borrow money from their parents and talk about buying expensive golf clubs and leather handbags on installment. The film has moments of delightful humor. Hirayama spends a great amount of time at a bar run by a woman who looks like his former wife reminiscing about the good old days and listening to a military march from World War II. In one of the funniest scenes he talks to a former shipmate who tells him that if Japan had won the war American women would be playing Japanese musical instruments and wearing geisha style wigs and they both agree that it was better that Japan lost. When one of Hirayama's employees tells him she is leaving to get married he begins to wonder whether or not it is also the time for Michiko. When Hirayama's friend Kawai Nobuo Nakamura proposes a match for Michiko however he does not tell his daughter about it thinking there is plenty of time. The situation is crystallized when he has a reunion with an old school teacher Sakuma Eijiro Tono known as The Gourd and notices how guilty his friend feels for not insisting that his daughter Tomoko marry when she had the opportunity. The result is an acceptance of the inevitable and the sadness that goes along with it. As An Autumn Afternoon ends the camera pans around an empty room. We see an old man sitting on a chair his head in his hands weeping quietly. In his final moment of grace Ozu has given us another experience that will last a lifetime.".

I have recently seen An Autumn Afternoon again and was not disappointed. Each scene has an almost indescribable longing an ephemeral quality that speaks to the beauty and sadness of everyday life. I love this film it is a true work of art.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ozu's final film is his most visually beautiful and among his most somber. Aside from Tokyo Story Late Spring and A Story of Floating Weeds this is my favorite Ozu film. There are several stories at work in this movie but the primary involves a middleaged father whose adult daughter is reluctant to marry. Long detached from her the father realizes only too late that with her departure goes the happiest chapter of his life. Ozu's style is extremely refined at this point and An Autumn Afternoon shows the director at the height of his artistic prowess. As such this movie is a terrific introduction to Ozu and it is a rewarding farewell for fans. Visually speaking this one is a stunner and every frame of the movie is a standalone composition. Many of the Ozu stock company make appearances including Chishu Ryu and Keiji Sada as well as some new faces such as Kyoko Kishida from Woman in the Dunes. The story is a classic Ozu meditation on family marriage and nostalgia and the ending is among his most remorseful. If you appreciate Ozu or are just curious about this quiet master An Autumn Afternoon is a great choice. This film is a serene graceful masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " An updated version of BANSHUN";
	schema:reviewBody "My favorite Yasujiro Ozu film is BANSHUN. And so as I sat watching SANMA NO AJI I quickly realized that this film is essentially a retooling of BANSHUN. Both films are about a devoted daughter living quite happily with her widower father. The father however realizes that the daughter is giving up a lot so it's his goal to get her out and married for her own good. There are some differences though in the films. In SANMA NO AJI it's not just the father but also the young lady's employer who sees a need for her to marry. In addition to taking care of her father there also is a younger brother in the home. Still it is essentially the same story with a few twistsand in color.It's also highly reminiscent of many of the mid to late Ozu films in a variety of ways. Like his usual style the camera is stationary and often is at floor levelwith cuts instead of closeups. You may not notice this at first but it's clearly the director's trademark. In addition the film has the typical slow and gentle pace and is about the conflicts between modern Japanese life and tradition. In this sense there's not a lot that's too new about the film other than a light and modern for 1962 soundtrackvery bouncy yet gentle.As for the film the father Shuhei has a pretty nice life. He has a nice job often goes out with friends to drink and Michiko the daughter takes care of his needs at home. However as the film progresses he notices in other people's relationships that something is missing. In particular meeting with an old school teacher from 40 years ago is a wakeup as this old man also lives with his unmarried daughterand his life is a bit pathetic. Shuhei is afraid that in later years his and his daughter will have a similar relationship. So he and his married son go about trying to arrange a marriage for Michikowho does want to marry though judging by her outward appearance and insistence that she wants to stay home and take care of her father you's never know it.Overall it's an incredibly slow but satisfying film and a nice end to Ozu's career as it is his last film. Well worth seeing and full of lovely and realistic vignettes. For those who are looking for action and excitement you may not like this film. For those who can appreciate a slower and more deliberately paced film this is hard to beat. A lovely portrait of life in Japan circa 1962.By the way is it me or did those people in the film really drink a lot?! Wow!".

	schema:headline " Ozu's Valedictory Film Seems a Most Fitting Summation of His Legendary Career";
	schema:reviewBody "The last work from revered filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu is a surprising delight at once a summation of the family dramas that dominated his postwar career and a celebration of his quiet artistry. It's a movie that doesn't call attention to itself and even goes as far as lifting entire sequences from his previous films. At the same time this 1962 drama is not so much a retelling of the same stories cowritten with longtime collaborator Kgo Noda as it is a reevaluation of the same dramatic themes that inform the director's work since Late Spring his 1949 classic to which this film bears the strongest resemblance. Ozu aficionados will find all his familiar idiosyncratic touches here  the elliptical narrative the observational view of the characters from the outside the thoughtfully composed shots and the stationary slightly aboveground camera angles to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. Moreover Ozu liked using the same actors over and over again so it comes a no surprise that frequent Ozu actor Chishu Ryu stars in the director's valedictory film.The characterrich plot centers on middleaged businessman Shuhei Hirayama who lives with his 24yearold daughter Michiko and younger son Kazuo. In the absence of a mother Michiko takes care of the wifely responsibilities for her father and brother and hasn't considered marriage in the near term even though Japanese tradition would label her an old maid soon enough. Hirayama's old friend Kawai has an eligible bachelor in mind to connect with Michiko but her heart belongs to someone else who is unaware of her interest. Hirayama thinks there is no hurry to marry his daughter off until he sees his old middle schoolteacher comically nicknamed The Gourd by his old classmates. Hirayama and Kawai take the wizened man home in a drunken state after a night of sake and beer. They see that he now owns a rundown noodle shop and lives with his daughter an aging spinster who reveals hints of her sad fate. As Hirayama forges ahead with his daughter's prospect his older son Koichi struggles to live within his modest means with a wife who nags him about his spendthrift ways. He needs to borrow money from his father to buy a new refrigerator but wants to buy a set of used MacGregor golf clubs against his wife's objections. The plot threads eventually come together when Michiko does marry leaving Hirayama to share household responsibilities with Kazuo.What first catches your eye is Ozu's vivid use of color especially a bold use of red in both defining and transitional shots. The other aspect is tonal as the director has moved from the barely concealed emotionalism of his early works to a certain ruefulness in his last film. The last few minutes cover the exact same dramatic finale of Late Spring but this time it doesn't seem nearly as tragic evoking a slightly melancholic resignation. The stoic Ryu plays the role of the widowed father in both films this time given an intriguing backstory as an officer in the Imperial Navy during World War II. This leads to my favorite scene at a bar where Hirayama runs into a former sailor under his command played with boisterous relish by Kurosawa favorite Daisuke Kato and speculate what Japan would be like had they won the war. Played by Kyko Kishida the bar hostess will be familiar to arthouse connoisseurs for the title role in Hiroshi Teshigahara's classic Woman in the Dunes. Another familiar face is Haruko Sugimura the selfish older daughter in Tokyo Story whose cameo as the schoolteacher's spinster daughter is heartbreaking. Eijiro Ton Tora! Tora! Tora! cuts an effectively pitiable figure as her father.Shima Iwashita plays Michiko with snippy plaintiveness effective enough but a far cry from the luminous Setsuko Hara in the earlier film her reassuring presence is missed here. Keiji Sada who sadly died in a car crash soon after this film was made and Mariko Okada etch a revealing postwar portrait of a young Japanese couple struggling to make ends meet in their small apartment. Compared to previous Ozu classics released by the Criterion Collection the extras on this 2008 release are sparse and limited to one disc. First there is a highly informative commentary track by author David Bordwell Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema. The second is a fifteenminute excerpt from a 1978 French TV special Yasujiro Ozu and The Taste of Saki just as France was discovering his work. Critics Michel Ciment and Georges Perec lend their rather pretentious perspectives. Two theatrical trailers round out the disc extras. There is also a 28page booklet about the film's production included in the slipcase.".

Ozu aficionados will find all his familiar idiosyncratic touches here  the elliptical narrative the observational view of the characters from the outside the thoughtfully composed shots and the stationary slightly aboveground camera angles to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. Moreover Ozu liked using the same actors over and over again so it comes a no surprise that frequent Ozu actor Chishu Ryu stars in the director's valedictory film.The characterrich plot centers on middleaged businessman Shuhei Hirayama who lives with his 24yearold daughter Michiko and younger son Kazuo. In the absence of a mother Michiko takes care of the wifely responsibilities for her father and brother and hasn't considered marriage in the near term even though Japanese tradition would label her an old maid soon enough. Hirayama's old friend Kawai has an eligible bachelor in mind to connect with Michiko but her heart belongs to someone else who is unaware of her interest. Hirayama thinks there is no hurry to marry his daughter off until he sees his old middle schoolteacher comically nicknamed The Gourd by his old classmates. Hirayama and Kawai take the wizened man home in a drunken state after a night of sake and beer. They see that he now owns a rundown noodle shop and lives with his daughter an aging spinster who reveals hints of her sad fate. As Hirayama forges ahead with his daughter's prospect his older son Koichi struggles to live within his modest means with a wife who nags him about his spendthrift ways. He needs to borrow money from his father to buy a new refrigerator but wants to buy a set of used MacGregor golf clubs against his wife's objections. The plot threads eventually come together when Michiko does marry leaving Hirayama to share household responsibilities with Kazuo.What first catches your eye is Ozu's vivid use of color especially a bold use of red in both defining and transitional shots. The other aspect is tonal as the director has moved from the barely concealed emotionalism of his early works to a certain ruefulness in his last film. The last few minutes cover the exact same dramatic finale of Late Spring but this time it doesn't seem nearly as tragic evoking a slightly melancholic resignation. The stoic Ryu plays the role of the widowed father in both films this time given an intriguing backstory as an officer in the Imperial Navy during World War II. This leads to my favorite scene at a bar where Hirayama runs into a former sailor under his command played with boisterous relish by Kurosawa favorite Daisuke Kato and speculate what Japan would be like had they won the war. Played by Kyko Kishida the bar hostess will be familiar to arthouse connoisseurs for the title role in Hiroshi Teshigahara's classic Woman in the Dunes. Another familiar face is Haruko Sugimura the selfish older daughter in Tokyo Story whose cameo as the schoolteacher's spinster daughter is heartbreaking. Eijiro Ton Tora! Tora! Tora! cuts an effectively pitiable figure as her father.Shima Iwashita plays Michiko with snippy plaintiveness effective enough but a far cry from the luminous Setsuko Hara in the earlier film her reassuring presence is missed here. Keiji Sada who sadly died in a car crash soon after this film was made and Mariko Okada etch a revealing postwar portrait of a young Japanese couple struggling to make ends meet in their small apartment. Compared to previous Ozu classics released by the Criterion Collection the extras on this 2008 release are sparse and limited to one disc. First there is a highly informative commentary track by author David Bordwell Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema. The second is a fifteenminute excerpt from a 1978 French TV special Yasujiro Ozu and The Taste of Saki just as France was discovering his work. Critics Michel Ciment and Georges Perec lend their rather pretentious perspectives. Two theatrical trailers round out the disc extras. There is also a 28page booklet about the film's production included in the slipcase.";

	schema:reviewBody "An Autumn Afternoon is Ozu's last picture and probably his most bitter. In his other movies sorrow was generally compensated by some caring characters or an affectionate relationship. Here nothing really positive emerges. The plot is similar to the one of Late Spring 1949 where the same actor also played a widower persuading his daughter to marry however An Autumn Afternoon is darker with more social insight.The original title The Taste of Mackerel Pike is lowkey mysterious and meaningful somewhat like Ozu's films. It refers to a fish that is widely eaten in Japan especially in autumn when it is abundant its taste is bitter if eaten whole as Japanese frequently do for this species and autumn evokes a world that is changing possibly decaying.It is a postwar movie even though it was shot 17 years after WWII in the sense that an emerging society tries to find its path within a modern world. There are many references to the war Hirayama went to the Naval Academy Hirayama and Sakamoto were on a warship they discuss about war as well as other customers later on a jukebox plays a patriotic song twice the Navy Hymn and Hirayama sings it at the very end Hirayama Sakamoto and the waitress imitate the military salute we understand Hirayama's wife died during WWII. The country faces mourning humiliation of defeat development challenges. Yet the society that emerges is void it displays solitude acrimony and materialism.Solitude is a dominant feature. Characters talk about professors and spouses who disappeared. Hirayama and Sakuma are widowers a barmaid reminds Hirayama of his late wife. Hirayama Kawai and Horie make jokes about death and refusal see below. Hirayama is left alone at the end drunk and depressed his last words ending the movie are Lonely in life. Michiko is turned down by the man she loves. The plot then tends towards her marriage with another man which should be good news however we never see the ceremony and not even the bridegroom at any point we just see Michiko in her wedding dress silent and sad. Symbolically she is still alone. After he comes back from the wedding the barmaid asks Hirayama Were you at a funeral? to which he tragically answers Sort of. It could be his own funeral since he is now lonely or his daughter's buried in a marriage that could turn out as the other couple's see below.Even when characters are not alone relationships are cruel. Koichi and his wife Akiko always argue there is not one single sweet moment between them despite the fact it is the only couple we see Horie's wife only appears briefly. Hirayama is frequently scolded by his children even though he is a decent man. Koichi lies to him about the money he needs to buy a fridge. Tomoko despises her father Sakuma. Sakamoto says about Sakuma's noodle bar right in front of him It's ugly here let's go elsewhere. People frequently leave gatherings earlier than expected spoiling the atmosphere notably Horie unexpectedly leaves the dinner with Hirayama and Kawai despite the fact Kawai cancelled a baseball game to attend. These socalled friends play nasty jokes to each other Hirayama and Kawai make the waitress believe Horie is dead while he is only late afterwards Kawai and Horie make Hirayama believe his daughter will not be able to marry the man they recommended which saddens Hirayama but it is a lie.And when relationships are not tense they are shallow conversations are mostly pointless people drink a lot when they are together. Worse left to their own fates individuals have nothing valuable to hang on to. Knowledge is not praised any more the former respected professor Sakuma is now obliged to run a cheap noodle restaurant to make a living. Lifestyle is disrupted many activities relate to Western culture not Japanese Sakamoto complains American culture has invaded Japan while drinking a whisky in a bar with a Western name! Characters also watch baseball or play golf with American branded clubs. The main exception is the aforementioned patriotic song but that scene is highly ironic since Japan lost the war. The only tangible element that dominates is materialism. Koichi and Akiko mostly think about buying a fridge golf clubs a handbag Akiko covets a vacuum cleaner at a friend's home. Notice how overall the movie is smooth there are no loud noises nobody shouts we barely hear the city despite the fact we are in the middle of Tokyo. Precisely the only exceptions are loud noises coming from material elements symbolising consumption golf balls against the practice metal net a jukebox a syrupy offscreen music ironically playing when people go out to drink. Likewise the most striking images are void of persons the movie opens with shots on a huge factory with fuming chimneys throughout the movie there are repeated empty shots notably of bright neon signs outside the bars we do not only hear the golf balls striking the metal net we see them distinctly the movie ends on other empty shots.As a result of all above persons are frequently sad Hirayama Michiko Sakuma Tomoko. The only relief is getting drunk. Amid this vacuity only does the main character Hirayama understand his country has taken a wrong path. In a stunning remark that must have thoroughly shocked Japanese 1960s audiences he admits to Sakamoto It is maybe better we lost the war instead of invading the USA with their culture if Japan had won instead. Nobody else seems to mind. For instance two customers in the bar shockingly laugh when they mention Japan was defeated who cares as long as we can drink they seem to think.With An Autumn Afternoon Ozu asks where have we gone? We could have built a brand new society with values solidarity hope yet exactly the opposite happened. A bitter testimony that could still be valid nowadays.".

It's a different angle focusing on the father's perspective but although I like the actors the plot felt so meandering that it didn't engage me though nor did it bore me. It feels a little too derivative. Ostensibly Ozu's films suit a black and white environment as the colour pastilles don't have the same richness his traditional cinematography provides. However if anything by its end it captures a striking image of loneliness. It accentuates the irony of sending offspring to marry just to result in this as though it's a cycle of life.

	schema:reviewBody "AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON is a drama which examines family relationships and life decisions in a warm way.The main protagonist is an ageing widower with a 32yearold married son and two unmarried children 24yearold daughter and 21yearold son. His wife has died just before the end of the war. His older son lives modestly with his wife in a small apartment. The widower and five of his classmates from middleschool hold regular reunions at a restaurant. They remember their old times and having fun with good food and drink. One of his friends has found a good opportunity for his daughter. She takes care of the housework drunken father and younger brother. After a few events the old man recognizes his own selfishness in keeping his daughter at home to look after him and decides to arrange a marriage for her...Mr. Ozu has made another family drama that touches the soul. He examines topics related to a family loneliness alcoholism marriage through relationships between parents and children.

In this outing the discussions of the war are more overt than usual though they extend no further than the drunken reminiscences of old men in a restaurant. These few understated scenes are crucial the war was the great break after which virtually nothing in Japan would be the same and the rift it creates between the collective memories of the young and the old is in many ways the proximate cause of the movie's more visible and contemporary rifts the rifts of lifestyle in Japan's postwar economic environment. The film is best appreciated with some knowledge of its historical background but casual fans of Japanese cinema should find much to enjoy as well.

Ozu's story telling style which is rather simplistic and dipicts rather the avarage life of people than any kind of more important event is not bad per se but when you combine it with very dull written characters the movie gets somewhat unwatchable especially when the message in the case of Tokyo Story is also nothing really complex to wrap your head around. An Autumn Afternoon on the other hand shows that his simplistic story telling style with life lessions attached to it can be done in an entertaining and interesting way when you add characters with actual personality. In this movie you have a number of those and a lot of character interactions that keep you interested throughout the film. This movie also deals with getting older and not letting go of your memories and the people close to you not wanting to be alone and forgotten. I think this idea is implemented perfectly in this movie.Soundtrack and Cinematogrophy where also made in a rather simplistic way. The Cinematogrophy didnt always suffer because of it sometimes there were some nice shots between characters but the soundtrack was rather boring and at the end of the movie I got pretty tired of the same old tune.But overall it was quite a nice watch way more recommendable than his other works besides maybe Floating weeds which was also an enjoyable watch".

	schema:reviewBody "What make Ozu's final film a special thing to hold on to is that the expectations one has are part of what the director has in mind. He's at the point in his career when he makes this film that he's been around the block when it comes to stories of older men with daughters or just family in general but specifically that dynamic like in Late Spring probably his best film in my estimation and that he knows the audience coming to this will have likely seen one of his movies and specifically one of these stories. I thought this was all the film would be but it's much more than that. This is about the passage of time and cultural norms and about how people deal with changes and societal expectations.Indeed while the central plot of what delicate not small amount there is sees Ozu mainstay Chish Ry contemplating after much questioning and gentletonotgentle prodding by his coworkers and friends that he should marry off her daughter and naturally he does Ozu's concern as a filmmaker isn't just that. In other words that's not precisely why he made the film and the story of a father marrying off his daughter is more of a byproduct of what philosophically he is after here. An Autumn Afternoon is really about those men in the room with The Gourd Sakuma and damn is Eijir Tno a having fun and communicating a real sadness to this character. They've all had certain norms and ways of looking at the world  in one conversation just hearing how these oldermiddleagedtoseniorcitizen ages men talk about women and relationships and how stuck they are in that says it all  and this also extends to even world war two itself.I'm not sure how much I've seen Ozu reference the war in his other films but in this it's certainly an element when Shuhei is at the bar with the one gentleman who he didn't recognize from before as one of his former privates he was a Captain there's some reminiscing about the war and about the what ifs that could have been. For example the fairly drunk ex private there are a LOT of drunk men in this by the way drinking for fun and to wash any pain anyway which they maymay not have put on themselves talks on how he wishes the Japanese had won  Shuhei politely disagrees that it was good the Japanese lost another interesting point I'm sure I could pick apart more  and how the Japanese are now reflecting American culture as opposed to the reverse would've happened if Japan had won. This is one of those moments that a filmmaker normally might not have in a film if they were solely concerned with plot or narrative but Ozu wants to emphasize the weight of the emotional world of his characters by having these moments that it's about the bigger picture both philosophically and internally.This is a masterful film because of how Ozu treats human beings and how he shows them sometimes subtly navigating having to come to blows with one another. Take the husband and wife where the former wants to buy some golf clubs he uses the buying of a refrigerator as sort of a cover at first and it doesn't hold up the wife objects in part because of the expense but also that she sometimes wants things too and he won't let her. This is about as heavy Ozu gets in a film like this to having a major dramatic blowout but the emotional undercurrent is still strong between these two and eventually somehow some way the woman actually does get her way  she wants a leather bag though she responds to the husbands concerned look with it's my money  and in Ozu's own subtle way there's a nice comment about the passage of time too. What happens when gasp women aren't completely subservient to their men and have their own you know agency and can do things for themselves  this is apart from the other question of being married or not or deciding who to marry or being married off.So in short this film was a pleasant surprise as far as being deeper than I expected and has a particularly bittersweet ending that moved me. While I'm not sure I love it quite as much as Late Spring as it lacks that extra touch of Setsuko Hara  the daughter here Iwashita is fine but only that as an actress I didn't feel as much depth from her as the other actresses  it's a great film and one that any director would be proud to go out on though I'm sure Ozu didn't intend it that way he died relatively young at 62.".

This time around in An Autumn Afternoon I really loved the atmosphere  it's absorbing. Ozu frames the cityscapes in a completely unique and spellbinding way really wow. Even characters walking along a hallway gave me goosebumps. Maybe it's the most spot on movie about postmodernity. All scenes capture that feeling so brilliantly. All the small moments the son playing golf the daughter and her brothers friend waiting at the train station the father and his friends talking together or even just the father and his children sitting in the house add up to an incredible picture. Almost every shot is well framed that the composition always indicates some sort of distance. There's also that brilliant scene at the bar with the father and the guy who was part of the military as well. It's when you realize that the illusions broke but that there isn't much left now. There's that wishing you could return what if Japan had won the war but it's not possible. It's indicative for much of the film the characters know what they want but it's incredibly hard to get. However the film yet has some happiness about it and Ozu's use of music is magnificent. It hums its way right into your heart.".

The story line yet again deals with the conflicts arising from twentysomething unmarried and attractive daughters living with and focused on caring for aging widowed fathers who need to get on with their lives. To say that Director Yasujiro Ozu was obsessed with variation on this theme would be a vast understatement. He kept making essentially the same film over and over trying to get things right or just stuck in a noncreative funk? with translated titles often including the name of a season. Sort of like a TV series with one episode per season pun intended. But the version presented in this film is the best of the bunch. The same old story line is significantly punched up with a robust imaginative script offering a wide variety of plotrelated and tangential events including the game of Go which is rarelyif everseen in the classical Japanese cinema and often amusing scenes populated by engaging character actors in cameo appearances. And the pacing is brisk at least by this Director's standards. The film also reflects fascinating aspects of contemporary Japanese life and culture circa early 1960's. Many of the same actors and actresses appear in this film as they have in others of the series but mostly play different roles as is usually the case. The male lead actor Chishu Ryu turns in another stunning performance. Same interiors scenes and sequence of scenes and even shots and sequence of shots as employed in prior films. Music is heard during most of the movie and resembles film scores from the European cinema and especially the Italian cinema of the era. Kimonos look exquisite even the everyday ones. Cinematography color and sound are fine. Visual effects are primitive. Subtitles are indispensable for helping with the Western dialect used throughout the film. A keeper. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

We have a young woman who really is not all that interested in getting married. How can it be that finding a suitable husband is not the first thing on hr mind? The framing and colors are excellent and very much evoke the best of the 1960s. How Japan was different from other places at the time I do not know but in some ways the worlds do not seem far apart. This could take place at an American office in the 50s or 60s. Well without the bowing anyway.".

We have a young woman who really is not all that interested in getting married. How can it be that finding a suitable husband is not the first thing on hr mind? The framing and colors are excellent and very much evoke the best of the 1960s. How Japan was different from other places at the time I do not know but in some ways the worlds do not seem far apart. This could take place at an American office in the 50s or 60s. Well without the bowing anyway.";

	schema:reviewBody "The success of this blend of the high and the low owes almost all to the marvelous screenplays Ozu scripted with his cowriter Kogo Noda. The cinematography by Yuharu Atsuta is unobtrusive as ever in the ozu style. And equally backgrounded are the musical interludes of Kojun Saito. The DVD is soon to be released by The Criterion Collection and while it is comparatively light on extra features visvis other Criterion releases as well as others of Ozu by Criterion there is a good deal of quality in the extras. There is the requisite theatrical trailer and booklet essays by film critic Geoff Andrew and ubiquitous Japanese film scholar Donald Ritchie. I would have expected Ritchie to provide the audio film commentary track but instead that task is assigned to another Japanese film scholar David Bordwell. Bordwell has always been hit and miss as a film critic and his few audio commentaries reflect that fact. But this time he's pretty good albeit not as natural as Ritchie a veteran DVD commenter is. Bordwell is solid not too didactic specific to scenes but a little stiff. He never conveys that he's stuck to his script but he never really loosens up and gives the percipient the sense that he really is into the total film experience either. As stated good but not great. Perhaps the best point he makes and it is one I echo is that Ozu is not a director concerned with character motivations. He is in essence the Method Actor's nightmare. Instead Ozu is a maven of Behaviorist Cinema. What his characters do is more important than what they think or voice. This is why we often get deliberate shots of his characters In this and other films from behind. Ozu wants the viewer to imagine what they are feeling from the situation presented not from how many tears they shed nor how wide their smile. Finally there are selections from Yasujiro Ozu And The Taste of Sake a 1978 French television show looking examining Ozu's career and featuring French film critics Michel Ciment and Georges Perec. On the negative side is the fact that Criterions bland white subtitles are often lost on screen in brighter scenes a problem that is not as bad as in black and white films but when will Criterion get a clue colored subtitles and ones with borders are a must especially sans an English language dubbed track. The film is shown in a 1.331 aspect ratio.An Autumn Afternoon is a great film but it is not a great film that is garish in its depth and breadth. It does not tackle grand themes nor does it blow the viewer away with magnificent vistas. Instead it is a small perfect gem of a film that distills the human essence into less than two hours of experience that moves one to laugh and inhale deeply. And if one does not think that such a feat as that is something and something great then one simply does not understand art.".

Having a good time.I don't need to have everything in a scary movie make sense or be explained to me. I am not in school I am having a laugh and a good time freaking out with the poor saps trapped in the haunted mental institution.The story was tight enough to be good loose enough to allow for the insanity that ensued. The characters were not clich and the ending was not totally cookie cutter.Bottom line this movie was fun. There were moments when we laughed at it but there were also moments that made us freak out and want to turn on the lights. Just stop overanalyzing relax and go with it and have fun.

And because I know there are a lot of people out there who still have to see it I will not spoil anything which makes it a bit harder to review the movie at this time but I'll give it my best.I loved the beginning of the movie especially as a 'ghosthunters' and 'ghost adventures' fan. It is very clear that the makers of this movie have at least watched 'ghost adventures'. The cast is legit this could've seriously been a new paranormal show or at least it could've convinced me.I loved it even more that the makers of 'Grave Encounters' I mean the show in the movie actually prove it is almost impossible to capture evidence each episode. This while that's what's required to keep a ghost hunting show interesting all the time and how they are planning to deal with that in case 'once again' nothing happens this was the only time I had to laugh during this movie. After that the lockdown that word sounded very familiar to me  began and the laughing stopped...In contrary to what other reviews said I DID find it very very scary at times even the parts that were already in the trailer. There were moments that I literally jumped off my seat. If you're going to watch a movie about ghost hunters of course you can expect slamming doors and stuff like that I don't think one of my previous reviewers are very honest about that and I actually wonder what YOU were expecting. Of course there are screaming people all the time giving the events of the movie or even only half of them I would've liked to see you in a situation like that!I do however admit that the movie made some turns towards the end that I didn't expect and would rather have seen differently. Once again without spoiling anything because I would hate to do that I would rather have seen the makers keeping it ehm a little less explosive and a little less revealing. Once you see the movie you'll understand what I mean.I would have been more satisfied if the only thing that I had seen the entire movie are slamming doors and flying things for instance. But I guess that's also a matter of what you are willing to believe CAN happen.So my only reserves are that the only reason that this will not be a new blair witch project is because there is too much visually revealed. Metaforically speaking keeping ghosts invisible is usually scarier.Overall I was greatly entertained this was the first movie to seriously scare me while watching in over a decade which says something coming from a diehard horror fan check my history. It has been worth my wait and I hope I see more from this crew in the future.".

The premise is very similar to something like House On Haunted Hill people go into a house or in this case a mental asylum to investigate paranormal happenings and things get nasty.Grave Encounters isn't original in any way while watching it I was thinking oh I've seen that happen in this movie or that movie  it seems to have taken a lot of factors from a lot of other paranormal horror movies and rolled them all into one which I thought was excellent the fact that it's not overly original isn't a bad thing at all Hollywood isn't well known for it's originality it uses formulas that have worked well before in a non direct wAy. The pacing of the scares is great it's slowly built up so that its more intense when there finally is a genuine scare I hate when horror movies just have cheap scares just to try and keep people interested this movie builds tension so well I was in the edge of my seat most of the time. The asylum where the film is set is terrifying the whole place just has an overwhelming sense of dread it's the last place I would ever want to spend the night.The acting is rather decent except for a few times when the lead male had me cringing the dude who plays the psychic is awesome he brought a little bit of a comic edge which was nice.So yeah not the most original horror film but it still delivers genuine thrills if you're a horror fan I doubt you'll see a better paranormal horror this year. To me it was like Blair Witch with a dab of Yellow Brick Road and a sprinkle of House On Haunted Hill.Highly recommended just don't expect lots of originality.".

They act very poorly and unconvincingly as show hosts but once the scary stuff starts their acting becomes really believable i mean REALLY.The movie starts out slow the first 13th or 14th is just plain talking and normal stuff so it can be a little boring but after that the movie takes an entire new turn. Please do yourself a favor and watch through the first 13 which is the boring tough part you will reap the rewards later.Its a very good movie well worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grave Encounters brought to us by the young Vicious Brothers is not the pinnacle of Haunted House Horror. Neither is it pushing any new boundaries in that particular subgenre but does it need to? Here's a film made expressly for those that are prepared to invest completely in the viewing experience to do as my lady partner and I did turn off all the main lights light a couple of candles for ambiance switch the phone off and turn the volume up on the TV. Scene set helps too that my lady is like a cat on a hot tin roof with a film like this puts me on edge love it in fact we both love this subgenre it's our favourite. Gore and torture bores me I want things that go bump in the night and things that suddenly jump out and make me jump. Grave Encounters does this exceptionally well but I invested fully I'm not over analysing it or sitting there comparing it to films released previously and I'm certainly not one of those who deliberately sits there determined not to be scared. And yes! There are many out there who do that a test of toughness maybe?Grave Encounters has problems without a doubt. As with many other films of the type dumb decisions are made by characters one particular character is actually too over the top during the preliminary setup and a couple of scenes involving hands and a rat are badly placed within. However it's a pant soiler because it's great at the scare tactics is deftly paced by the Vicious boys and unfurled in the atmospherically perfect setting of a Mental Asylum. As characters wander off into darkened corridors or peer off into the gloom if you are invested fully you will feel the dread your body slowly sinking in your set your nails ripe for chewing. Or are you someone sitting there with arms folded fully expecting a jolt? Or maybe humming a tune in your head so as to make sure the mood isn't right? If you are expecting something new in this field of horror you are always going to be disappointed. Session 9 a brilliant and intelligent movie from 2001 went the other way set in an Asylum it chose psychological scares and atmospherics instead of boo jumps yet looking at reviews and message boards for that one you see many moaning about boredom. Recently Insidious and The Woman In Black the former tried to bring a new astral aspect to the formula and got slated for it the latter kept it traditional and got accused of bringing nothing new to the table! Maybe just maybe these films are better left to Haunted House fans who are willing to invest their being into the experience? Only then can Grave Encounters be a rewarding time. The rest of the horror faithfuls can keep searching in vain for something new in the formula for the next twenty years or so.Thank you Vicious boys the missus and I had a right old scary time with your movie. Now about my laundry bill..... 810".

Well in the beginning this fancy fella was telling me that the footage i'm going to see is genuine and 100 real which WE ALL KNOW IT ISN'T and after that i entered the gloomy asylum with the rest of the 'crew'. To be honest the asylum was gloomy eerie and was great for the setting of the premise BUT... they had to ruin it with rarely poor acting. And the acting was indeed very poor especially that of Sean Rogerson. Further on the tremendous dark atmosphere of the asylum was as i already said healthy ground for developing a huge horror movie but all we have a chance to see are cheap jump scares and not a big number of those either. The movie just wasn't enough suspense hell it wasn't even suspense at all. Most of the scenes are fairly predictable and there was a moment in which i wanted to turn off the movie and bin it but i held on just to see if something would happen that could change my opinion of the movie. It didn't. The visuals are very good but the sound effects are just too much. Poor acting lack of good scares and extremely annoying Sean Rogerson have a 310 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well it definitely has more in common with The House On Haunted Hill than REC. or Paranormal Activity when it comes to impact or freshness and believability but it sure knows how to frighten you frozen in your seat as them. It starts off as a somewhat mockumentary similar to The Last Exorcism that was pretty clever and entertaining as a phony ghost hunting reality show crew willingly lock themselves inside an abandon mental hospital only soon do the realize that it has a mind of its own. The way the movie escalates the terror suspense and intensity was unrelenting and I have never had to cover my eyes as much or be sleepless after watching a horror movie since I saw the first Paranormal Activity and though Paranormal Activity was more effective with its scares this one was a heart pounding frightfest with ghoulish ghosts and activity around every corner as though you feel like you're right there with them in a never ending haunted house ride. The films direction plot and theme is nothing new or ground breaking and the acting not as raw as some of the better found footage movies but once this subgenre dies out this one will not be lost and forgotten and might be named as one of the best found footage film of all time it is sure on the top of my list. Overall this definitely deserves a wide release as it's one of the scariest entertaining horror movie of 2011 and sure it doesn't have originality on its side and ends on a predictable but still chilling note but I got to tell you Grave Encounters will get under your skin and it gives me another reason why I love the found footage horror movies so much because they're involving and terrifyingly raw which makes most of them unforgettable. Keep them coming because I for one can't get enough of them. Highly recommended! 7.7 out of 10".

But like a real trooper I decided to soldier on. My mistake.Bad acting to the point of laughable. But do not get me wrong it is not so bad it's good type of laughable. Typical low budget scares some very similar to Blair and P.A. that really do not scare any more because you have already seen their likes. Typical shaky camera running around through the dark. And a more than predictable ending.This movie lacks everything that a low budget horror needs to have in order to be good  originality and believable acting. The setting of the movie mental hospital opens up a lot of possibilities that could have made for a much better  scarier movie than this turned out to be even on a shoe string budget.Do not waste your time if you are looking for something original or scary unless you have never seen Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity then you might find this to be at best half decent but because of the acting I doubt it.".

I have never seen so many scenes of people sleeping in a so called horror movie before. I don't care how exhausted you are when your life is on the line you do not sleep period. When the movie first started I thought it had to be a parody but I was wrong it would have been better if it was honestly.

Clearly a rip off of the TV show ghost adventures combined with paranormal state. If you do watch make sure its free but even then you are wasting 2 hours of your life. I have never seen so many scenes of people sleeping in a so called horror movie before. I don't care how exhausted you are when your life is on the line you do not sleep period. When the movie first started I thought it had to be a parody but I was wrong it would have been better if it was honestly. For all those ghost hunteradventures watchers this is a waste of you time.";

I love scary films but this was not scary. it did have a few jumpy bits but that was it! I thought it would have been better if there was a bit more explanation at the end I didn't really understand what happened in the end of the film. It ended with no desire to watch a sequel if ever was one released. If you cannot handle scary films then this is suitable for you but if want like the scare factor this is not for you!

These films are so overplayed and have been turned into something more of comedy rather than fear. A window opens here and a door slams there it has been done before. There ate never ending scenes of sleeping screaming crying and loud noises and shaky camera work. SPOILER this is probably the worst bit  all of a sudden the door of which they entered the asylum is now a meaningless entry door to yet ANOTHER endless abandoned hallway so now the whole asylum is a labyrinth soon after this everyone begins to go insane slowly but surely.

With every passing minute the clichs become endless scares can be predicted as the duration tailors off into it's climax.Also the CGI used in certain scenes to try and emphasise the fear factor is so shockingly bad it is laughable.The Vicious Brothers are supposed to originate goosebumps on our shivering arms with the idea that Lance Preston and his film crew are supposedly going to endure the longest night of their lives in an ancient abandoned mental institution. Sadly it's the audience who will have to endure the longest night of their lives as they will be regularly glancing at their wrist watch with every passing second appearing to last a minute.";

	schema:reviewBody "Marley is a 2012 Documentary film that tells the story of legendary Jamaican reggae artist Bob Marley. The film charts his life from his humble beginnings in a small country village without electricity through his rise to fame in Jamaica to his exile in London subsequent return to his Island of birth and eventual death at the age of just 36.Before going in to the cinema I wouldn't have classed myself as a Bob Marley fan and although I have a couple of his albums and love his best known songs I knew very little about him. The film gives an honest account of his life and of Marley as a man. The story is told using achieve interviews with Marley himself but mostly through interviews with his friends family and ex colleagues who are still living. Some of the interviewees are great characters and speak with wisdom. Others are hilarious and most have a fantastic Jamaican Patois which is delightful to listen to. The film also gives some background to Rastafarianism something else that I knew little about.The whole film is backed with over sixty Marley and Bob Marley and the Wailers songs which start with the song he first recorded aged sixteen and ends with One Love. This film has one of the greatest soundtracks of any film I've seen. The highlight for me was Marley's triumphant return to Jamaica for the One Love Peace Concert in 1978. After years living in London following an attempt on his life Marley returned to Jamaica and performed in front of 32000 people and bought the leaders of Jamaica's warring Political Parties up on stage where he managed to get them to hold hands above their heads in a sign of peace. It was an amazing thing to witness even in the cinema and its impact was obvious.The final quarter of the film takes on a deceivingly sadder tone as we reach the final years of Marley's life. After a battle with cancer he died in 1981 in Miami USA. There were many people crying in the theatre including my girlfriend after a very sad few moments on screen. The film ends on a positive note though by showing how Marley's music and message is still being used to educate and unite people today.The film shows Marley to be both a great musician and great man but isn't afraid to look at his less impressive traits. His womanising is mentioned on several occasions as is his poor parenting. His willingness to do anything to make it is also a constant theme. He was willing to change his style as well as drop his friends in order to become better known or appreciated and the film doesn't shy away from letting this be known. A thread I'd like to have seen explored further was his lack of success with black audiences outside of Jamaica. It was hinted at several times but is an interesting area which could have been looked at further.Marley is a fantastic biopic documentary which sheds light on one of the world's best loved musicians. It isn't afraid to show both his good and bad sides and does a good job of illustrating his life from start to finish. It is accompanied by a soundtrack that head my head bobbing and feet tapping throughout and made me want to go out and further explore his back catalogue as well as his message of One Love.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

While it is more than two hours in length you will soon realize it takes every bit of this and then some to detail the life of someone who unfortunately only lived to the age of 36. There are recoding sessions interviews with Marley himself and footage of his many tours and concerts. This documentary will convert anyone yet understanding how important Robert Nesta Marley was to world music and world politics. I highly recommend it.".

Here he takes on the fascinating life of musician and humanitarian Bob Marley.This extraordinary film features some wonderful never before seen video and still photography as well as some very insightful interviews from friends family bandmates and others who were present during that time. We see the poverty stricken area of Jamaica where Marley was born to his mother a local teenager and his father a 60something white man who evidently worked for the forest department.It's truly fascinating to watch Marley's development as a musician and human being. With little education he relied on stunning life instincts and rose to be the most important Jamaican figure in a time of intense discourse. His personality was one that brought people together and his music complimented his beliefs and encouraged a unified country and world. While he survived an assassination attempt he was unable to beat cancer. His death at the young age of 36 leaves us asking ... what could have been? Watching his Wailers begin by playing for free in small clubs and building to worldwide tours in huge stadiums shows just how much influence he had with his words music and actions. He was admired globally and revered in Jamaica. So often biographies and documentaries treat their subject as either a saint or villain. Here we get the descriptions from Marley's own voice as well as the voices of his wife Rita his children including Ziggy his girlfriends including Cindy Breakspeare who was Miss World. We learn he had 11 kids with multiple women. We learn he wasn't the warmest father to his kids. We learn he was courageous and insightful and always willing to listen to both sides of an argument.For most being an influential musician would be enough. For Bob Marley it was just the key to the door ... his vision was for a peaceful world where we could all get together and feel alright. You will notice I have yet to mention marijuana. Marley's face has become a symbol for Jamaica's key export and that's a shame ... more need to know what this man was all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm old enough to have dug Bob Marley when he was actually alive and performing. AND I was fortunate enough to produce some jingles in Tuff Gong Studio for Air Jamaica. So I was around the scene postMarley and I played his music endlessly for a decade or two.Then I discovered salsa and Latin Jazz and the AfroCuban sound and let my Marley go.Well now I have my Marley back. This film took me into parts of Trenchtown Kingston Jamaica that I have never seen and never want to see. Even after reading Timothy White's marvelous biography of Marley Catch A Fire I couldn't imagine how horrible Trenchtown was until this movie.It gave me a deep appreciation for how far this young man traveled in his tragically brief time on this particular planet. He wasn't nice he wasn't easy but he was brilliantly talented and surrounded himself with other talented fascinating people. Yes folks are moaning about the movie not having enough music but ... it has lots of heart and conversation and laughs and empathetic understanding of the Marley story  and the story of Jamaica one of the most beautiful and agonizing places I have ever been. I can't recommend this film highly enough. Gosh I hope there are no spoilers here. Can you write a spoiler for a documentary of a widely known figure?".

MacDonald won an Oscar for the documentary One Day in September. He has directed a number of fine films but none any finer than this gem. This is an excellent biography of a musical genius who died very young. While he lived he was a force of nature. What is particularly delicious about this film is the sound. There is a lot of music throughout much of it in the background but in the foreground are the people who knew and played with Bob Marley. The Jamaican language makes the film very compelling. There are subtitles which translate English into English. The language adds so much to understanding why Reggae is what it is.This is a fine film an artistic achievement and a fitting tribute to a great musician. See it if you have even a passing interest in reggae or Bob Marley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marley 2012  12 out of 4 Director Kevin Macdonald epic look at music legend Bob Marley follows him from his early days to his rise in music and eventually his death at the age of 36. Through concert interview and audio footage we get to hear from Marley throughout his life and of course there's a lot of attention given to the music but there's also a lot aimed at Marley's lifestyle and his hopes for the future. We also get interviews with his son daughter mother wife as well as countless band members and others who knew him personally. At 142minutes this thing certainly packs in a lot of information and I think diehard Marley fans are going to really love this thing. There's no question that nearly every aspect of his life is covered from his early childhood to his womanizing and of course the final few months of his life. The film really does an exceptional job at giving you a complete look at the man and it doesn't shy away or try to hide his darker side or moments that aren't as good and fun. The documentary really shows him as a complete human which is something a lot of these films miss. Those who are just mild fans or are just wanting quick look at how Marley was might find this to be a bit too long but I do feel this was made for diehard fans who want to know everything. I really enjoyed all of the concert footage that they added because one gets a great idea of what Marley was like on stage. Of course countless songs are on full display here which is another major plus. Certain aspects of Marley's life gets additional attention here including the Smile Jamaica Concert and him getting shot before hand. Also the final months of Marley's life also gets additional scenes and it's still shocking to see him dying so young.".

It must be remembered that The Wailers first proper studio album Soul Rebels 1970 produced by Perry became a serious bone of contention between the band and Perry.That said the interviews are enlightening and often amusing. The interview with Cedella Marley Bob's Daughter is rather sad as she obviously retains a level of bitterness towards her Father.Highly recommended.".

A prophet to some and a lyrical icon who left the earth leaving a significant mark in musical history.Marley is a beautifully crafted piece of work based on the late Jamaican star. The film is aimed at his biggest fans as well as those with little knowledge of his life example being myself. Born in 1963Raised in the slum's of Kingston Jamaica Bob Marley lived life an only child with his mother fending for food and water. Bob's life shows an affect for disaster with little knowledge of his father and any appearance being nothingshort of a myth. Just like Bob friends and numerous characters from the Kingston area are introduced in the film expressing their upbringing in poverty stricken Jamaica.We learn of the belief in Rasta Fari. A god worshipped by certain Jamaicans. Bob Marley describes him as the equivalent to Jesus. White people have Jesus we have Rhasta Fari. A belief which entitles them to smoke a ridiculous amount of weed each day.The concept of the documentary tells a tale of comedy happiness and depression as ones life is told through those who grew up with and loved him most.His struggle for success is told through friends and numerous members of The Wailers. How reggae was founded through a single chord? how Bob Marley eventually left Jamaica for America to expand his ideas in music. A story of ambition and tragedy relating to the shooting of Bob Marley and certain members of The Wailers. How Bob Marley was begged to revive Jamaica's government torn gang war bringing a country together through his music.Vital members of the Marley family are heard for the first time in this cinematic masterpiece. Son of Bob Ziggy Marley tells of his remembrance as we see a shocking resemblance to the late singer. Rita Marley his first and last love tells the story of how she stayed with Bob despite his sexual antics.A revealing documentary of the Jamaican superstar seen through the eyes of members of the music industry as well as a brilliant cast of Kingston locals who simply never left the scene since Bob Marley's growing up.Marley reveals a variety of live performances showing Bob Marley at his best and a typically beautiful soundtrack which mingles with every scene. Fans and people today know of the ending that awaited Bob Marley. This documentary is a terrific celebration towards a musical genius who just like many icons changed parts of the world politically and musically.Overall Marley is terrifically original telling a story of a man with a history guaranteed to make you laugh and cry. A film for fans of all ages to enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good film about an astonishing man. I rarely throw the word 'genius' around loosely but I truly believe that's what Bob Marley was. There are a few musicians who died far too early and you wonder what they might have gone on to achieve had they lived longer... Buddy Holly Mozart Lennon and Bob Marley. Still he packed quite a lot into his 36 years before his tragically early death from cancer in 1981 and has left the world a wonderful catalog of music along with 11 or was it 12? children. Bob Marley is truly an international superstar possibly even more famous in death than he was in life. The music transcends cultural boundaries in a way that little else does.This movie directed by Kevin Macdonald traces Bob Marley's life from his very humble beginnings in St Anne's Parish Jamaica through a move to Kingston a brief early stint in Delaware USA and extended periods in London interviewing those who knew him best fellow musicians in his band his wife and several girl friends some of his children an early teacher his Mum record producers even politicians. Marley didn't invent Reggae but he took it to the world and the many many songs he wrote carried his personal message of peace and love and it also became the medium of his desire to see his fellow men and women world wide getting along better together. He was a modest man and generous to a fault giving away swathes of money to help others in Jamaica. He was a perfectionist making his band rehearse for long hours to perfect what looked effortless and laid back on stage. What he wanted more than anything was to get his music and his message of love out to the world.And it has to be said when women threw themselves at him he rarely turned them away. But no one seemed jealous least of all Rita his wife although I suspect that her generous acceptance of his wandering ways probably hurt more than she let on then or now. His daughter comes across as somewhat bitter lamenting that even at his death his family didn't really get quality time alone with him Bob wanted to share himself with the world.The seventies the height of Marley's creativity coincided with a time of dreadful political violence and rivalry in Jamaica and Marley although he never aligned himself with any party or leader survived an attempt on his life. He fled with his band to the UK for some peace and quiet producing some of his best music at this time and embarking on tours that took his fame worldwide. And it was in London that he first encountered the melanoma that was eventually to spread to his lungs and brain. Had he accepted the advice of doctors and had his toe amputated he might be alive today but he loved football ie soccer to my US readers so much that he was afraid a missing toe might affect his ability to play and to dance on stage. Invited back to Jamaica the only person capable of bringing any peace to the warring political factions he staged one of his most memorable concerts free in Kingston and managed to get both leaders on stage shaking hands.After doctors gave up on his cancer he went to Germany for a last ditch effort at turning back the tide at a controversial holistic clinic. But the cancer was too advanced spread all over his frail body. He died in Miami in May 1981 a mere 36 years old.Yet today Bob Marley is an iconic figure around the world the first great planetwide music star to come from a developing country. Get up stand up stand up for your rights is a rallying cry in slums everywhere. My own personal favorite has to be One Love his anthem to the union of the world's people. The only thing I find problematic is his adoration of Haili Selassi late emperor of Ethiopia a small and inconsequential man as far as I can see. But maybe it's my loss and Marley saw something I have missed. And I haven't even touched on the huge ganja intake that can hardly have aided his lungs.In fact I have barely touched on so many elements of this film and of Bob Marley himself. Just go see. Great movie great man.".

Strictly biographical it does attempt to pull on emotional threads to get the audience properly attuned but rarely is this honest. Another point of contention is steering away from the more political aspects of his music the song Buffalo Soldiers isn't even mentioned and skindeep portrayal of rastafarianizm and Marley's role in it. An additional issue is the presentation of reggae as something 'discovered' by Bob Marley.That said the movie is entirely watchable and enjoyable for the long runtime of 140 min. mainly due to the music which goes without saying is brilliant. The best scenes however are during the end credits when the true meaning of the Marley icon is presented. Nonetheless even then is does not even get anywhere near the accomplishment of the mentioned Land of Look Behind".

He got little attention in the Southeast I suppose because he is the wrong color for a lot of people around here...sigh The documentary starts kind of slow but it picks up speed quickly and fills you in on a lot of fascinating info on Jamaincan culture and the young Marley climbing out of abject poverty and achieving an exceptional level of greatness. At the end I found myself and still do days later dealing with a sense of loss not only because of his death at 36 over 30 years ago but because I never knew the guy and I find that I really like what he was doing and what the doc and his music have told me about him.I'm very happy I watched this documentary and do recommend it to everyone.".

I therefore had no idea for example that Bob Marley died of cancer at age 36 I thought he was shot dead. I had absolutely no clue that he was mixedrace and went by the moniker 'German boy' on account of his White father. There was not much I did know about Jamaica's most famous figure. No matter Kevin Macdonald the Scotsman who directed the excellent 'The Last King of Scotland' does a superb job of educating people in my position and I have a feeling his superlative documentary will sate even Marley's most ardent fans. This is one of the most joyous interesting and educational documentaries I have ever seen. I was utterly engrossed in fact spellbound.The concert footage is mesmerising. Not many could generate as much energy without recourse to gimmicks. In rare and previously unseen interview footage we get a glimpse into the psyche of the man. He was quite the philosopher. Everyone preaches peace and love especially singers but Bob practised it. That's why people in the most unlikely places on Earth as shown at the end sing their hearts out to his simple but powerful songs. I learned about Rastafarianism the politics and history of Jamaica the origins and influence of reggae music and of course about the documentary's primary subject Robert Nesta Marley. His ascent was ridiculously unlikely given his impoverished background lack of direction and mixed heritage. If you were a religious person as he was you might say divinity had a part to play. I can't say whether he was a genius but I don't hesitate to call him a superior human being. He genuinely wanted to see the two rival parties in Jamaica the People's National Party and the Jamaican Labour Party unite under his synonymous phrase 'One love'. Yet he had no political agenda only a humanist agenda. The man even took a bullet for his belief and didn't let the material prospect of assassination deter him. It is so hard not to be infected by the brio of the interviewees particularly Rita Marley his uniquely tolerant widow and fellow Wailer who put up with Bob's notorious philandering when most wouldn't. 'Who didn't want him?' is her rhetorical rationale. Even Jamaican Miss World Cindy Breakspeare couldn't say no. He loved football his country music culture women. He loved life. He loved people. That's why when you hear his songs it's impossible not to smile and as he sings 'don't worry about a thing cuz everything gonna be alright'. www.moseleyb13.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen the poster for this documentary film a number of times it was obvious what the subject of it was as a big fan of the artist focused myself I was definitely looking forward to watching directed by Kevin Macdonald Touching the Void The Last King of Scotland Life in a Day. Robert Nesta Bob Marley was born 6 February 1945 this film depicts the life of the Jamaican singer songwriter musician and guitarist charting his stratospheric rise to fame. The film is made up of archive footage from Marley's various radio and television appearances including his rare footage and interviews and of course there are interviews by those who knew him best friends family and colleagues. Marley was passionate about music from a young age but he started with disappointing sales as a solo artist but then he decided to collaborate with a band called The Wailers to become Bob Marley and the Wailers and they achieved international fame. Marley brought to the world attention to Jamaican culture Reggae music and the Rastafari movement and the film focuses on his influential music and his struggle with racial identity and acceptance and there is mention of his use of cannabis and marijuana. As a member of the Rastafari movement Marley was dedicated to his religion believing that God and his family are more important than the success or money he made in total he had eleven children with seven women his most famous relationship being with Jamaican Miss World 1976 winner Cindy Breakspeare. Marley's death is also depicted a cancerous sore had formed on his right toe it was operated in the past but the disease had spread to his lungs and brain and was inoperable he lost his treasured dreadlocks during chemotherapy and his pain increased over time until his tragic death on 11 May 1981 he was aged 36. His greatest and most recognised hits featured or mentioned include Exodus Rough Rider High Tide or Low Tide Soul Rebel One Love  People Get Ready It's Alright Stir It Up No Woman No Cry Get Up Stand Up Concrete Jungle Jamming I Shot the Sheriff Three Little Birds Is This Love and Could You Be Loved. Others that could or should have been mentioned are Buffalo Soldier and Sun Is Shining vs. Funkstar De Luxe. With contributions from Rita Marley Bob's widow Neville Bunny Wailer Livingston David Ziggy Marley Bob's son Cedella Marley Bob's mother singer Jimmy Cliff Cindy Breakspeare Lee Scratch Perry music producer Constance Marley Bob's half sister Chris Blackwell Judy Mowatt backing vocalist Neville Garrick Marcia Griffiths Aston Family Man Barrett Peter Marley Bob's second cousinJunior Marvin Diane Jobson Allan Skill Cole Bob Andy Donald Kinsey Alvin Seeco Patterson Dr. Carlton PeeWee Fraser Evelyn Dotty Higgin Pascaline Bongo Ondimba Ibis Pitts Dr. Conroy Cooper former President of Jamaica Edward Seaga Lloyd Bread McDonald Hugh Creek Sledgo Peart Carlton Santa Davis Imogene Aunt Amy Wallace Dudley Sibley Desmond Desi Smith and many more. Marley was a reggae superstar and his music continues to inspire and influence artists it is interesting to watch and obviously hearing the popular songs keeps it going you could argue it is perhaps a little too long at just over 2 hours 20 minutes and it is a bit up and and down at times but overall it's not a bad biographical music documentary. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Documentary Film. Worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "Marley is an amazing film that tells the whole story of the Reggae legend bob Marley. Bob Marley was a remarkable musician whose music echoed throughout the globe singing about peace love and Rastafarianism. He died young at the age of thirty six due to cancer. Today his music is more popular than it ever was. He is still emblazoned on posters T shirts etc. This film features Bob's life before he became famous and it talks about the Rastafarian religion. Marley Tells an amazing story of Bob Marley's life before he became famous. Robert Nesta Marley was born in Nine mile St. Ann in Jamaica. He grew up poor with his mom and rarely saw his father. His father was white and his mother was black. Bob's mother tells us a story about how she met Bob's sixty year old father Norval Marley when she was only sixteen. Bob's grandmother referred to him as the German boy. It made him have to deal with acceptance and racial identity. When bob was twelve he and his mother moved to Trenchtown in search of a better life. Bob had a hard life growing up in the slums of Kingston. A friend of bob's called Desi Smith recalls both of them going to bed hungry very often. Bob focused on music so he could try to escape the life he had in Trenchtown Kingston. One day Bob came home and told his mother he wasn't going to school anymore and gave his school books to a friend. Bob worked with a guy named Desmond Decker in a welding factory. Desmond decker got auditioned by Jimmy Cliff a Jamaican recording artist. When Bob found out that Desmond Decker had recorded a song Bob was motivated to do the same. He eventually came out with his first song called Judge Not in 1962 when he was only sixteen. Jimmy Cliff was very impressed with bob's lyrics and he said that Bob was a really good poet. But Bob's solo records did not sell and he thought it would be appropriate that he created a group. Bob and one of his friends named Neville 'Bunny' Livingston put a group together and they eventually added Peter Tosh. This Legendary group ended up being called The Wailers. They released their first single Simmer Down in 1964. They started working with a guy named Clement Coxsone Dodd who owned his own recording studio. When Bob's mom moved to the United States Bob stayed in Jamaica and slept in the back of Coxsone's recording studio. He married a girl named Rita Marley. She became Bob's Guardian Angel. Eventually they had two kids but Bob would end up being the father of eleven children from seven different women in the future. The Wailers did a promotional tour of the Catch a Fire in England. Bunny and Peter were furious that they didn't get money out of it. The Wailers were well known in Jamaica but not in England. Bob was being real and was being patient. Peter and Bunny ended up leaving the group. In 1974 Bob made a new Wailers line up including background vocalists The I Three who had Bob's wife Rita Marley in it. In 1975 in London Bob Marley and The Wailers became famous at a concert called The Lyceum. Chris Blackwell said it was the tipping point and after that concert everyone knew The Wailers. Marley gives out great information about the Rastafarian religion. Rastafarianism was and still is a growing religion in Jamaica. Bob was being rejected in society before he became a Rasta. Monteer Planno took Bob in and taught him about the Afrocentric religion. Monteer Planno was a Rasta preacher and a spiritual leader. Rastafarianism preaches self reliance self confidence peace love and unity. They take care of their bodies by watching what they eat and living a healthy active lifestyle. Rastafarianism is quite similar to Christianity but they interpret the bible in a different way. Most places in the bible are in Africa. Haile Selassie I aka Ras Tafari is the reincarnation of Jesus. He was the Emperor of Ethiopia. Bob says in the film that Jesus Christ was to return in 2000 years and when he returned he would be the king of kings. Rastafarians are known for growing Dreadlocks. Dreadlocks mean you are a Rasta and you have taken a vow not to cut or comb your hair for a certain amount of time. Rasta's smoke marijuana not just to get high but it puts you in a holy peaceful happy and inspirational mood. Marley gives an immense story about the life before Bob Marley became famous and it gave a lot of information about the Rastafarian religion. This is important because it shows what kind of person Robert Marley is. He had a rough childhood that even his own family would make fun of him just because he was mixed. The only thing Bob could do to get out of the slums of Kingston was his guitar. We can also tell Bob was a peaceful person because of his religion. The film does a great job by showing his story and his religion and how that made him right so many songs about his life and religion.".

Peter and Bunny ended up leaving the group. In 1974 Bob made a new Wailers line up including background vocalists The I Three who had Bob's wife Rita Marley in it. In 1975 in London Bob Marley and The Wailers became famous at a concert called The Lyceum. Chris Blackwell said it was the tipping point and after that concert everyone knew The Wailers. Marley gives out great information about the Rastafarian religion. Rastafarianism was and still is a growing religion in Jamaica. Bob was being rejected in society before he became a Rasta. Monteer Planno took Bob in and taught him about the Afrocentric religion. Monteer Planno was a Rasta preacher and a spiritual leader. Rastafarianism preaches self reliance self confidence peace love and unity. They take care of their bodies by watching what they eat and living a healthy active lifestyle. Rastafarianism is quite similar to Christianity but they interpret the bible in a different way. Most places in the bible are in Africa. Haile Selassie I aka Ras Tafari is the reincarnation of Jesus. He was the Emperor of Ethiopia. Bob says in the film that Jesus Christ was to return in 2000 years and when he returned he would be the king of kings. Rastafarians are known for growing Dreadlocks. Dreadlocks mean you are a Rasta and you have taken a vow not to cut or comb your hair for a certain amount of time. Rasta's smoke marijuana not just to get high but it puts you in a holy peaceful happy and inspirational mood. Marley gives an immense story about the life before Bob Marley became famous and it gave a lot of information about the Rastafarian religion. This is important because it shows what kind of person Robert Marley is. He had a rough childhood that even his own family would make fun of him just because he was mixed. The only thing Bob could do to get out of the slums of Kingston was his guitar. We can also tell Bob was a peaceful person because of his religion. The film does a great job by showing his story and his religion and how that made him right so many songs about his life and religion.";

The Other Guys was pretty good Step Brothers was funny in parts but this one totally takes the cake for being a great drama and schools anyone who thinks Will Ferrell can't do anything but comedy. Though I doubt fans of Old School will think highly of this.The plot isn't too much but it sustains a film. Will Ferrell is Nick Halsey an alcoholic who has had one too many alcoholrelated episodes and has finally lost his job. He returns home to find out his wife has changed all the locks on the house and has moved all of his belongings to the front yard. Frustrated and hopeless he decides to life on his front lawn and make the best out of a horrible situation.He spends his day sucking down Blue Ribbons beers until he is met by a chubby adolescent named Kenny Christopher Jordan Wallace the son of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G.. Kenny's mom takes care of an elderly woman leaving him free to roam the streets on his bike. Kenny and Nick strike up an odd but warm relationship with each other and when Nick is informed by his AA sponsor Pena that he must move all his stuff off his lawn in three days he works with Kenny to help them hold a big yard sale.A subplot involves Nick getting acquainted with the woman across the street who has just moved to the neighborhood and is awaiting her husband's arrival. The relationship isn't as strong or as wellcrafted as the relationship between Nick and Kenny but it is still a solid one.It's also noteworthy that we never see Nick's wife or the woman's husband anywhere in the film. We don't need to though. The plot works fine without them and I believe that if we saw Nick's wife in the film we'd get too many arguments between the two which may result in a believability being low and b a possibility for Ferrell's comedy side to sneak in. We don't need comedy here. We get it but in tiny miniscule doses. There is almost nothing funny about this situation.Once again this proves that Will Ferrell is a great character actor and doesn't have to get drunk shout his lines or get in goofy fights to be successful. Unfortunately Everything Must Go's overall performance wasn't impressive and it may be a long time before Ferrell does something like this ever again.Not everything here is perfect. The worst flaw is the ending because there is no emotional payoff and nothing to make our experience anymore than just enjoyable. I wanted more than enjoyable. I haven't read the short story Why Don't You Dance? by Raymond Carver so I'm not sure of any similarities both this and the story share. Everything Must Go is a good film in general but a great film in terms of Ferrell who is essentially putting on a onemanshow for more than half the film.Starring Will Ferrell Christopher Jordan Wallace Laura Dern and Michael Pena.

	schema:headline " Everything Must Go is a wellmade movie but heavier than I was seeking";
	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed Stranger than Fiction and since I had heard Will Ferrell's performance in that movie compared favorably to the one in Everything Must Go was excited to see EMG. I walked away after seeing EMG a little unsure of whether I truly enjoyed the movie or just merely appreciated the quality of the director's vision and execution. Everything Must Go is the story of Nick Halsey Ferrell a struggling alcoholic who in the first 10 minutes of the movie has been laid of from his job and kicked out of his house by his wife all within the same day. The rest of the movie looks at Halsey's attempt to manage the tension between wanting what he once had and trying to pursue a life that he desires even though he isn't entirely sure of what that looks like. I will start by saying I thought the acting of everyone involved especially Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace was superb and a highlight of the movie. I thought the music and visuals added significantly to the feel of the movie especially how so much of the movie occurred in the front yard with the records of his father occasionally playing in the background. Now I knew to expect a story that was not a happygolucky comedy is there one about an alcoholic struggling with sobriety but was hoping for some more lightheartedness. I did particularly enjoy watching the relationship between Nick Halsey and Wallace's Kenny Loftus and thought that the filmmakers did a good job pairing the two actors up. A couple of things with which I walked away first I found it interesting how the director decided to show Halsey's eventual growth in the way that he let go of certain things and to whom he left them. Afterwards a friend of mine and I discussed how difficult these acts would have been but thought it appropriate for someone trying to move beyond such a serious issue as alcoholism. I also found it interesting that such a pivotal character like Halsey's wife has no screen time at all save for her voice in one scene. It is as if the filmmakers want us to see how much damage one person has managed to do by simply stepping out of another's life. Overall I do believe that the movie was well made with an interesting story and fantastic acting but the mood of the film was a little heavier than what I was looking for.".

I walked away after seeing EMG a little unsure of whether I truly enjoyed the movie or just merely appreciated the quality of the director's vision and execution. Everything Must Go is the story of Nick Halsey Ferrell a struggling alcoholic who in the first 10 minutes of the movie has been laid of from his job and kicked out of his house by his wife all within the same day. The rest of the movie looks at Halsey's attempt to manage the tension between wanting what he once had and trying to pursue a life that he desires even though he isn't entirely sure of what that looks like. I will start by saying I thought the acting of everyone involved especially Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace was superb and a highlight of the movie. I thought the music and visuals added significantly to the feel of the movie especially how so much of the movie occurred in the front yard with the records of his father occasionally playing in the background. Now I knew to expect a story that was not a happygolucky comedy is there one about an alcoholic struggling with sobriety but was hoping for some more lightheartedness. I did particularly enjoy watching the relationship between Nick Halsey and Wallace's Kenny Loftus and thought that the filmmakers did a good job pairing the two actors up. A couple of things with which I walked away first I found it interesting how the director decided to show Halsey's eventual growth in the way that he let go of certain things and to whom he left them. Afterwards a friend of mine and I discussed how difficult these acts would have been but thought it appropriate for someone trying to move beyond such a serious issue as alcoholism. I also found it interesting that such a pivotal character like Halsey's wife has no screen time at all save for her voice in one scene. It is as if the filmmakers want us to see how much damage one person has managed to do by simply stepping out of another's life. Overall I do believe that the movie was well made with an interesting story and fantastic acting but the mood of the film was a little heavier than what I was looking for.";

After Nick Ferrell gets fired from his job of 16 years he comes home to find his wife has changed the locks on his doors and all of his stuff is on the lawn. Thinking the best way to fix things is to stay at home Nick begins his new life living outside. This is a very very good movie and a very different role for Will Ferrell. While not quite as good as Adam Sandler in Reign Over Me Ferrell still shows he has what it takes to be a good dramatic actor. There are a few funny parts in this but this is not a comedy. It's a drama with a lot of heart and while the movie is depressing at times it is a joy to watch. Ferrell does have some funny scenes with his own style of humor that adds to the character and watching him with the actor that plays Kenny is a treat. This is not a typical Will Ferrell movie but being a huge fan I loved it and look forward to more roles like this from him. I highly recommend this. Overall if you like Ferrell you will like this if you don't give this a shot still. You may like the change. I give it an A.Would I watch again?  I think I would.Also try  Barney's Version".

The theme is quite refreshing but even though the movie is tagged a comedy the humour here is very dry it does draw a few chuckles and it felt more like an intense human drama than a comedy. Halsey's situation is depressing and it really makes the viewer want to hate Catherine even though the writer tries to make the point that she was justified in treating him that way. But anyway this is Halsey's story and perhaps to balance the intensity Rush could have added more quirks. The pacing is quite slow at times but there was never a boring moment. I liked how the director and Ferrell depict Halsey's struggle with alcoholism. However I felt that the story and characters especially the supporting ones could have been further developed. Will Ferrell is excellently restrained which makes Halsey all the more human and easier to relate to. Rebecca Hall is brilliant. Laura Dern has about one scene and she shows the viewer how one scene alone can make an actor stand out. Overall I wouldn't recommend 'Everything Must Go' to those looking for a comedy. It is an intense humour drama about a man who once had everything and is now forced out of his house and how he struggles and attempts to deal with his problems one step at a time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you know what the rate of success is for marriage when one person sobers up but the other one doesn't?Will Ferrell stars in this fantastic comedy slash drama but this isn't the typical Ferrell comedy where we see him screaming all over the screen. This time he plays a quiet and sad alcoholic and it's perhaps one of his best performances to date. Everything Must Go was a really pleasant surprise for me it reminded me a lot of 2008's film The Visitor starring Richard Jenkins. Will Ferrell gives a very similar and quiet performance. Nothing really happens in the movie but it's the relationship between the characters that carries the film to a higher ground. This is Dan Rush's first film as a director and he really hits a home run with his debut film. He also adapted the screenplay from Raymond Carver's short story Why Don't You Dance. The dialogue in this movie is just great and it really feels authentic. The actors also do a great job with the pauses everything about this movie makes it fresh. The film is rather slow paced and focuses more on the drama and interactions between characters who end up bonding in unexpected ways. It also has very funny moments although not the laugh out loud kind of humor but more of a put a grind on your face kind of comedy. I didn't know Ferrell had it in him to give a performance of this caliber without relying on his usual loud mouth role. This is the sort of guy we can identify with and whose life seems to be unraveling right in front of us. So much potential gone down the drain due to a small mistake. Will Ferrell plays a Sales Executive named Nick Halsey who at the beginning of the film is being fired from his job due to his problems with alcohol. He was a great worker and seemed to be recovering from his drinking problem but recently had a relapse when he traveled to Denver and decided to have a few drinks to celebrate an important sale. Word got out to the office in Arizona and they decided it was time to let Nick go. Without a job now Nick arrives home only to discover that all his things are laying in the front yard of his house and his wife has changed the locks of the doors. Apparently in Denver he also slept with another woman and now his wife has kicked him out of the house. Nick decides to stay in his front yard sitting on his reclining chair and has no intention of moving out. Someone makes a complain and the police come to arrest him for disturbing the peace in the neighborhood but his friend Detective Frank Garcia Michael Pea gets him a permit to stay in his front lawn for five days with the excuse that he is having a garage sale. During these days he befriends a young boy named Kenny Christopher Jordan Wallace who practically spends all day on his own. Nick hires him to help out with the sale and during that time they become friends. Nick teaches Kenny a thing or two about baseball. A new neighbor also has recently moved in the house in front of Nick's she introduces herself as Samantha Rebecca Hall and says she's expecting a baby girl in a couple of months. Nick opens up to her about his problems and they being an interesting friendship. Everything Must Go is a really interesting small film that will surely put a smile on your face as we see these authentic interactions between characters that probably under normal circumstances never would've befriended each other. The thing I enjoyed the most about this film was the realistic way in which each of these characters was portrayed and the way the actors played them. Will Ferrell Christopher Wallace and Rebecca Hall who I first came to love in Ben Affleck's flick The Town all give great performances and the success of the film relies entirely on them. The movie isn't deep it doesn't try to be preachy either it just focuses on these small relationships and lets us now that it's never too late to start again. Will Ferrell should continue to accept interesting projects like this so he can prove that he is more than a one dimensional actor. I love his comedies like Talladega Nights and Ron Burgundy but it is great to see him in different roles as well proving he can be a serious actor as well. Director Dan Rush took a huge risk by giving him the lead role but the gamble paid off because he fit the role perfectly. This is a different kind of film but I absolutely recommend it. I loved it.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Everything must progress including Ferrell's acting range.";
	schema:reviewBody "'EVERYTHING MUST GO' Three and a Half Stars Out of FiveWill Ferrell tries his hand at more serious comedydrama again after the likes of 2006's 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' with this tale of a relapsed alcoholic who loses his job and wife on the same day and resorts to living on his front lawn. It's based on the short story 'Why Don't You Dance' by Raymond Carver and is written and directed by first time filmmaker Dan Rush. It costars Rebecca Hall Michael Pena Stephen Root Laura Dern and Christopher Jordan Wallace the son of Faith Evans and the late rapper 'The Notorious B.I.G.' in his second film. The movie is funny as well as depressing and emotional. It's a nice step in Ferrell's career for exploring broader range.Ferrell plays Nick Halsey an alcoholic who's recently fell off the wagon. As the film opens he's fired from his job for apparently having an affair with a new employee and then left by his wife for the same reason. He's also locked out of his home after his wife changes the locks with all of his belongings left on the front lawn. His credit cards have all been canceled as well and his company car is repossessed by his former employers. With no money and no place to go he decides to camp out on his front lawn with all his stuff. His neighbors complain of him being a public nuisance though and he's reported to the police. Thanks to city law his cop buddy Frank Pena is able to give him five days to hold a yard sale before he has to kick him off the property. While trying to sell his stuff Nick befriends a new neighbor across the street Hall and a local neighborhood kid Wallace.Like I said the movie is surprisingly dramatic for a Will Ferrell movie and he pulls off his performance impressively. The material isn't too much of a stretch for him given that it's still pretty comedic but it's definitely honest and set in reality unlike the majority of his films which are mostly slapstick and there's some pretty hard hitting drama at times as well especially towards the end. The movie still has a sizable amount of laughs though so traditional Ferrell fans shouldn't be disappointed. That's why the movie is the perfect step for Ferrell to test out his range. A gigantic leap in to serious drama would be to sudden and the film works perfectly as is. A smart move for Ferrell and a decent film results because of it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vWEqXaxUaU".

	onyx:emotionText "'EVERYTHING MUST GO' Three and a Half Stars Out of FiveWill Ferrell tries his hand at more serious comedydrama again after the likes of 2006's 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' with this tale of a relapsed alcoholic who loses his job and wife on the same day and resorts to living on his front lawn. It's based on the short story 'Why Don't You Dance' by Raymond Carver and is written and directed by first time filmmaker Dan Rush. It costars Rebecca Hall Michael Pena Stephen Root Laura Dern and Christopher Jordan Wallace the son of Faith Evans and the late rapper 'The Notorious B.I.G.' in his second film. The movie is funny as well as depressing and emotional. It's a nice step in Ferrell's career for exploring broader range.Ferrell plays Nick Halsey an alcoholic who's recently fell off the wagon. As the film opens he's fired from his job for apparently having an affair with a new employee and then left by his wife for the same reason. He's also locked out of his home after his wife changes the locks with all of his belongings left on the front lawn. His credit cards have all been canceled as well and his company car is repossessed by his former employers. With no money and no place to go he decides to camp out on his front lawn with all his stuff. His neighbors complain of him being a public nuisance though and he's reported to the police. Thanks to city law his cop buddy Frank Pena is able to give him five days to hold a yard sale before he has to kick him off the property. While trying to sell his stuff Nick befriends a new neighbor across the street Hall and a local neighborhood kid Wallace.Like I said the movie is surprisingly dramatic for a Will Ferrell movie and he pulls off his performance impressively. The material isn't too much of a stretch for him given that it's still pretty comedic but it's definitely honest and set in reality unlike the majority of his films which are mostly slapstick and there's some pretty hard hitting drama at times as well especially towards the end. The movie still has a sizable amount of laughs though so traditional Ferrell fans shouldn't be disappointed. That's why the movie is the perfect step for Ferrell to test out his range. A gigantic leap in to serious drama would be to sudden and the film works perfectly as is. A smart move for Ferrell and a decent film results because of it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vWEqXaxUaU";

	schema:headline " A Wonderful Example of Ferrell's Acting Ability";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything Must Go is a wonderful film. Taken from a short story by Raymond Carver it is a simple idea but richly textured so the viewer must look under the layers of simplicity for the story to open up. The short story is only a few pages long and it is very simple on the surface. The writing is sparse but it still makes you think and this idea goes into the film as well.Will Ferrell plays Nick Halsey the exVice President of a Regional Sales Office. We catch him on his last day of work downing a flask and reminiscing on the meeting where he was recently terminated after falling off the wagon one too many times. After getting beer Nick arrives home to see all of his stuff in his front yard and the locks changed. His credit cards and bank account are frozen and he's left with the money on his wallet and the stuff on his lawn.Ferrell gives a very wonderfully subtle performance. Carver would be proud. It seems to me that the main complaint that people have voiced with this film was that there was no big payoff. I disagree. I think there was a big payoff just not in the sense that there was this huge change in the character. The change is subtle but it is there. Ferrell goes back to his dramatic abilities to show us the story of a man in crisis struggling to get out and he does it well. My fear is that this movie will be misunderstood by fans of Ferrell's comedy.It is a depressing movie but it is a simple story of finding hope as well with comedy sprinkled throughout. My advice would be to give it a chance and be rewarded by seeing Ferrell's abilities.".

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't disagree more with the idea that this is a contrived movie with a pointless main character. Will Ferrel plays a man that is flawed cynical and coping with alcoholism in my opinion somebody incredibly human. To the previous reviewer who says things like There are a few chuckles but how is this guy not smart enough to be sleeping in his front yard and forget that he has sprinklers in the front yard. .... not once but twice. ... The man is drunk for somewhere near 100 of the time he is on his lawn. If you pass out drunk you're not making plans to deal with sprinklers in the morning.Anyway Will Ferrel is excellent. The humor in the this movie is all Ferrel's timing and countenance as he copes with everything that has happened so suddenly in his life. He shines during the characters most vulnerable moments like when he wakes in a cold sweat in complete panic because he is out of alcohol and his desperation in trying to get beer on credit from the liquor store. His reaction to and ability to cope with constant traumatic discovers makes this movie an interestingengaging experience.".

	schema:headline " Was looking for an easy comedy to help me sleep...what I discovered was invaluable";
	schema:reviewBody "OK so no this movie did not help me sleep. It kept me staring at the ceiling for an hour after the credits started rolling then compelled me to wake up and write this my second ever review on IMDb. To those of you who have or have ever had trouble sleeping...you know when your brain just won't shut the hell up  everything is running through your mind a mile a second? Well I figured I needed something light and funny to soothe me to sleep...instantly I thought of Will Ferrel. I wanted to watch a film of his I hadn't seen before and then came Everything Must Go.Remember Adam Sandler in Reign Over Me? Get ready to be wowed by another comedy actor turning to a more serious role. Ferrel plays Nick Halsey a middleaged professional working in a senior position for a top corporation who also struggles with alcohol. What happens to set the stage for the film is every mans worst nightmare. All in one day he loses his job his wife  his home and has all his possessions tossed onto his front yard with no access back into his house. With no car no money and no where to go he takes up residence on his front lawn. With the help of a neighbourhood kid a new neighbour  an old high school acquaintance Nick embarks on a journey to discover how his choices got him exactly where he is today. Because although the writers fool you into having sympathy for our main protagonist at the beginning of the film the dots slowly connect and you discover that maybe Nick himself is largely to blame for his current circumstances.What spoke to me is Nicks addiction. The first thing he does on his front lawn when everything has gone to hell is crack open a beer. Which sad to say is what I would've done although alcohol is not my poison. At first his drinking just seems like a reaction to his bad situation but it turns out it has been a major influence on his life for a long time. Each character plays a specific role in his selfdiscoveries. The neighbourhood kid gives him a purpose someone to teach about sales and helps him reflect on his relationship with his parents. The new neighbour is a representation of how Nick and his wife started out and the compromises that had to be made and I say this in the least creepy way possible she was the most beautiful pregnant woman I've ever seen even though she obviously isn't really pregnant. While the old high school acquaintance again I heavily related to this was someone from another time in Nicks life who saw him as this larger than life character with a big heart who was sure to be destined for great things. And Nick is desperate to be reassured that he is still that guy. The thing I noticed is...Nicks encounters with these 3 characters is always one on one except at the end when there is a walking scene but no dialogue and I tell you each encounter with each character will have you hooked to your screen. I can't explain it it was nearly like the adrenaline rush you get with an action movie but a lot more subtle. You never knew if the exchange was going to be positive or negative.The theme of the movie can be summed up like this how did my choices in life lead me to now?. I relate to Nick in almost every way...except for the choices he made. Because it was my lack of making choices that led me to a similar place that he finds himself in. It was freaky how in almost every scene I would have reacted the same as he did and I kid you not right before he says to the cop There's a law that says I can't drink a fing beer on my lawn? I thought in my head there's a law in the US that says you can't drink a fing beer on your own front lawn? I can't really recommend this film enough based on entertainment value alone but if you're looking for a movie that is sure to trigger some selfreflection also then you have really stumbled onto a winner with Everything Must Go. The humour is scarce but you get 2 to 3 laugh out loud moments the rest will either make you smile or chuckle depending on how sensitive your funny bone is.I don't get all the hater reviews on here. A lot of them are complaining that they were duped because they went to see a funny Will Ferrel comedy but got this instead...Awwwww poor baby need me to kiss the boo boo better? Grow up! If you were dumb enough to not look into the movie you were going to see regardless of the lead actor then you brought it on yourself. Even I read the short bio on this website before I watched it after I read the part about him struggling with alcohol I knew it wasn't going to be all moon beams and my little ponies. And you didn't like that the movie was 'depressing' did you? You one of those warm fuzzy types that always has to have their head up with the fairies? Life can be depressing life can be hard...this isn't news. And for a movie to bring these truths to light in such an artistic engaging and REAL fashion...inspired. And you didn't like it? I'm sure if I ever met you I'd punch you in your 1 dimensional head.To all lovers of movies with substance that stimulate your brain stop reading this review already and watch this movie. A movie that leaves you with a feeling of new starts are hard and they may not work out but the only other option is to sink.".

So he takes the unusual step of camping out in his front yard luckily he doesn't live in the UK with all of his lifelong belongings.It's a coming of age movie in some ways albeit at 40 years of age. Will Ferrell nails the helplessness of his situation he drinks and along the way through relationships with a young kid his pregnant neighbour and an old school flame he realises that he's a good man that he has something to offer the world that perhaps he doesn't need the booze after all. The direction is solid however its slow paced allowing the viewer snapshots as to why Nick turned out this way. I also liked the fact that you never meet the wife or the husband across the street you don't need to. Its very uncomplicated perfectly paced.I loved this movie and the whole cast performance if anything its uplifting and ultimately a positive message via an unfortunate back story.

	schema:headline " Absolutely absurd from the word go.";
	schema:reviewBody "I think that Will Ferrell is one of those actors that can do a pretty solid job of mixing comedy with drama and I like when he plays human characters. Unfortunately here he is stuck in a movie that pretends to be this grounded character drama about a broken man who's lost everything while it's actually just an absurd story that doesn't fit into any real context and meanders along until it thankfully comes to it's disastrous end. The film has a setup that I just couldn't get into at all. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver Ferrell's Nick Halsey gets fired in the opening scene and then goes home to find out that his wife put all of his things on the lawn and changed the locks on the door. Halsey constantly makes a point of mentioning that he owns the house so why doesn't he just call the police and have them let him in? Seems pretty simple. Even more simple given that his wife just isn't there anymore why would she bother changing the locks and throwing his things on the lawn if she was just leaving? So right off the bat I wasn't on good terms with this one.However I can get past a rocky setup. Earlier this year Hesher had a pitch that I didn't buy whatsoever but it still managed to impress me with a strong character study and excellent performances. Everything Must Go on the other hand offers no redeeming qualities. After the ridiculous setup we're loaded with scene after scene of painfully contrived moments that would just never happen. Rebecca Hall plays the clichd stranger that randomly decides to become friends with the man who is living on his lawn drinking all day. Yeah every pregnant woman does that. Christopher Jordan Wallace comes along as the young kid who needs a mentor and finds it in the creepy adult with no friends one of the most idiotic clichs in film. There's a whole ten minute scene with Laura Dern's character that is of no consequence to the rest of the film adds nothing to the character and is clearly there as filler to get the movie to a decent running time. It's just scene after scene of absurd moves that no one with half a brain could watch with any sense of genuine believability all led by a performance from Ferrell that couldn't have been more lazy and lifeless if he tried. A dreadful picture with absolutely nothing going for it.".

Unfortunately here he is stuck in a movie that pretends to be this grounded character drama about a broken man who's lost everything while it's actually just an absurd story that doesn't fit into any real context and meanders along until it thankfully comes to it's disastrous end. The film has a setup that I just couldn't get into at all. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver Ferrell's Nick Halsey gets fired in the opening scene and then goes home to find out that his wife put all of his things on the lawn and changed the locks on the door. Halsey constantly makes a point of mentioning that he owns the house so why doesn't he just call the police and have them let him in? Seems pretty simple. Even more simple given that his wife just isn't there anymore why would she bother changing the locks and throwing his things on the lawn if she was just leaving? So right off the bat I wasn't on good terms with this one.However I can get past a rocky setup. Earlier this year Hesher had a pitch that I didn't buy whatsoever but it still managed to impress me with a strong character study and excellent performances. Everything Must Go on the other hand offers no redeeming qualities. After the ridiculous setup we're loaded with scene after scene of painfully contrived moments that would just never happen. Rebecca Hall plays the clichd stranger that randomly decides to become friends with the man who is living on his lawn drinking all day. Yeah every pregnant woman does that. Christopher Jordan Wallace comes along as the young kid who needs a mentor and finds it in the creepy adult with no friends one of the most idiotic clichs in film. There's a whole ten minute scene with Laura Dern's character that is of no consequence to the rest of the film adds nothing to the character and is clearly there as filler to get the movie to a decent running time. It's just scene after scene of absurd moves that no one with half a brain could watch with any sense of genuine believability all led by a performance from Ferrell that couldn't have been more lazy and lifeless if he tried. A dreadful picture with absolutely nothing going for it.";

Following up manic depression with severe alcoholism and mild depression is just a bit too much weight in such a short time. But I guess that's the point of this one. Will Ferrell stars as Nick who loses his job punctures his boss' tire and finds out his wife not only left him but also locked him out of the house with all his belongings in the front yard. That's in the first 8 minutes of the film.Ferrell proceeds to get drunk ... while sitting in his Lazy Boy in the front yard. He clearly has hit bottom and shows no signs of recovering. At least not until he partners with a lonely young bike riding boy named Kenny Christopher Jordan Wallace son of Notorious B.I.G.. This partnership consists of Kenny doing most of the work for the yard sale while Ferrell sleeps and drinks.Rebecca Hall plays a pregnant woman who is moving in across the street. What kind of man makes his wife move across country alone?. That's the question Ferrell asks Hall ... and along with the viewer these two characters understand the answer would be a man just like Ferrell.What I like about the film is that there are numerous signs of real human emotion throughout yet none of the main characters overplays their part. If you are unaccustomed to seeing Mr. Ferrell in anything but slapstick comedies I encourage you to see Stranger Than Fiction. He really does have dramatic acting skills on top of his amazing comedic talent.The film comes from first time director Dan Rush and short story writerextraordinaire Raymond Carver. The script does capture much of the emotion that goes with feeling rejected and searching for numbness in a bottle ... or in this case a Pabst beer can. Supporting work from Stephen Root Laura Dern and Michael Pena are solid but the best scenes are between Ferrell Wallace and Hall. Don't show up expecting to laugh much. This is a seriodrama that makes you think ... there but for the grace of God ...".

His relationship to Kenny his AfricanAmerican neighbor teen was very well done. His awkward searching out and finding his highschool crush played by Laura Dern was moving.Now the bad things The pacing was slow and languid. The comedy that was implied in the trailer was minimal giving the film a mostly depressing feel that made its 137 minutes seem longer. The plot lines never seemed to go very far or deep probably to reflect his own depression. Finally the ending while hopeful might have benefited with going just a bit further or perhaps in a different direction with Laura Dern's character.Conclusion Unlike some reviewers who raved I think the box office tells you whether it was really a masterpiece or worth a 10 rating. But while others called it a disaster I doubt most viewers would feel that negative as its problem was that interesting plot lines while plenty were just not explored or developed enough making the overall feeling slow and somewhat depressing rather than enjoyable as even the most serious movie should aim to be. Hence Not good but not bad. Soso thus a 5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Until I started reading these reviews of my work praising me I never felt the people I was writing about were so bad off...the waitress the bus driver the mechanic. God the country is filled with these people. They're good people.  Raymond Carver The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation.  Henry Thoreau In Raymond Carver's short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love a group of adults sit around a table and talk about love. Eventually it becomes apparent that each character has a different definition of love and that none of the characters can really express what love is. Ultimately they agree to disagree. This tale encapsulates the overriding thrust of Carver's work. Though he is renowned for revitalising the short story format one point of your typical Carver shortstory is that each particular tale is but part of a larger compilation the world made up of a seemingly infinite number of clashing and differing subjective perspectives. Director Robert Altman recognised this with Short Cuts. Rather than adapt a single Carver story he adapted at least nine including some of Carver's poems and then loosely tied them all together. Carver's collections function in the same way dipping in and out of wildly differing windows households families and lives.Everything Must Go directed by Dan Rush is an adaptation of a single Carver story Why Don't You Dance?. While it lacks the statewide scope of Short Cuts  it focuses on just one man one little suburban square  it nevertheless captures Carver's voice style and interest in simple seemingly slight domestic drama. There's a touch of Hemingway here too. While some of Carver's early work parodied Hemingway he eventually grew into one of the writer's successors though Carter's prose dispenses with the romantic egoism of Hemingway with his blunt minimalism distinct cadence a result of wordstingy editor Gordon Lish idyllic wildernesses themes of depression and alienation and his knack for first sentence hooks. In the case of Everything Must Go the hook is that alcoholic Nick Halsey played here by comedian Will Ferrell has suddenly been fired from his job. To make matters worse Nick returns home to learn that his wife has left him locked him out of their house moved to a different state and scattered all his belongings out on their home's front lawn. Flabbergasted Nick camps outside his home surrounded by his furniture and various other objects clothes possessions and trinkets.The film captures well Carver's particular brand of symbolism. Nick's failed marriage is mirrored to a newlywed couple across the street and Nick's front lawn becomes a wasteland of discarded memories a wreckage strewn past. Nick is also literally caught in a kind of stasis stuck between a failed job and homelife and we see how alcohol art musiccameras etc and consumer trinkets serve only to assuage or cover up deep regrets disappointment and unhappiness. You need to put up some curtains Nick tells neighbour Samantha. Why? So I don't have some drunk staring at me all day? she asks. No he replies so you don't have to look at your future. The banality of post 1960s red white and blue collar America was a Carver obsession but here these things are treated very literally. You're all as screwed up as me Nick yells from his front lawn but you get to hide in your houses while I'm out here! Nick functions as a symbol for every man caught in latecapitalism's ceaseless double helix.Carver's characters typically seem tired and world weary spending all their time on the sofa watching TV or hauling their bodies to and from offices. Nick's found himself temporarily dislocated from this treadmill. He tries to turn his back on yesterday's baggage bonding with a woman across the street and hooking up with an old college class mate Laura Dern in a cute little role but is ultimately left without solutions. The film then ends with a cover of Dylan's I Shall Be Released a song which perhaps belies Nick's true future.The film is unconventionally relaxed lazy and unhurried  like sitting on a rocking chair in the middle of a cool breeze  and is quite different from Carver's six page short which was nevertheless also about being liberated perhaps to the point of insanity from objects duty even marital responsibilities. Rush's film is better but he's still too small an artists to recognise the radical connotations of this tale's title. Everything Must Go but there are no wrecking balls here. Nick recruits a young black kid as a salesman makes a buck selling his stuff and thanks the heavens that his alcoholism was moviealcoholism. You know the kind that leads to redemption wisdom and Zencalm. The film's ending while not necessarily happy is wrong to force closure upon an ongoing historical process.Ironically Joseph Urgo once identified the short story itself as a capitalist artform of a particular sort in that it is managerial must be completed within certain spatial confines and mirrors an imperative of its cultural context. The short story is like a wellmanaged operation Urgo said one that functions like clockwork without a hitch the genre's demands for efficiency of form cohesiveness and economy of scale parallelling the demands of managerial capitalism. If a tightly written short enacts the very same sense of what is good and what is valuable as does the efficiently run textile mill or factory how much do the confines of movie formula prevent Nick's climax from going more interesting places?8.510  Great mood let down by occasional Hollywood schmaltz and several cartoonish stereotypes. Worth two viewings.".

The director's in all these movies are very good and is in my opinion half of the success of any movie. One of my favorite director's these days is Sofia Coppola who I think does a great job at instilling a deep sense of reallife into her movies.

What I received instead was a very realistic portrayal of a functional alcoholics life. Divorce and termination from employment are two of the most devastating losses a person could ever experience. The movie begins in reflection of the downward spiral that ultimately causes Nick the main character to lose both his wife and his job simultaneously. What I love about this movie is how neighbors for whom Nick has never met befriend him and come to his rescue. It also helps that an old friend reminds him of his good nature and good heart. All this helps Nick regain his confidence and self respect. The movie does a great job of demonstrating how important it is that a person who suffers from addiction continues to communicate and open up with people rather than shut everyone out and hide. This is an addiction flick that starts on a negative gives you a few real good laughs throughout and ends very upbeat.".

That's smart to remind us that some people are living these kind of situation daily. Sophie Marceau is playing in an horrible way.

Juliette Arnaud is doing well too Anny Duperey is ... well I love her so I'm going to describe her in this movie as it must be an error or she needed some money...whatever that's awful. The end is probably the worse part. Sophie Marceau violently use a stolen police car against cops who try to stop her while yelling how much she loves him in the megaphone. And finally conclude after the cops gently help her to go out from the car go to the court and when she goes out say that she he will certainly have a big fine! Really? Does anyone read the scripts in France before the state finance all these folks? Because what she does with her car would drive anyone in prison for 10 years or more in most countries including France I think or worse they may just shot at you to stop it. But in this movie they almost thanks her she is in love and blablabla... that's so funny. At the end you feel some pity for Sophie Marceau to have to act in such a lame scene crying her love in a megaphone while squashing cops with a stolen police car...such a shame for a good idea with good actors.

	schema:reviewBody "North Korea has developed a nuclear long range missile that can reach America. It's almost ready for launch and the American president has few other options but ordering a military strike to remove the threat.A navy seal team is put together and sent to the missile site to go undercover and destroy the facility making it seem like an accident thus preventing provoking North Korea into retileration which could quickly blow up into a full scale war causing millions of lives lost.A very real world scenario and it's a good background for a thrilling movie. However with all this realism you would want more realism from the plot. There are so many holes in the plot if the movie was a bucket it would have water pour straight through the bottom.For example why would a surgical strike with stealth bombers be more provokative than sending a team of trigger happy seals behind enemy lines blasting everything sky high for everyone to see? Yet the whole tension is about the navy seals finishing their mission in time before the surgical strike is the only option left naturally with no communication abilities with HQ to report about progress and the usual war hungry American military adviser pushing for the most dangerous options.The movie is also way too political correct. There are no badguys South Koreans work together with the Americans and even the North Koreans are good guys who are secretly on the Americans side. Only one person is left as the bad guy Kim jong Il North Koreas dictator.I was also surprised to see how poor the special effects were. Reminded me of something from the early 80's. Blood splatter from gunfire was clearly just painted on top of the movie during post processing and having a poorly done 3D model of the nuclear missile rotate around on a screen in the presidents conference room just made it look comical.All in all messy inaccurate and most of all predictable and pretty boring stuff. The first behind enemy lines was just a million times better in all aspects.".

Yet the whole tension is about the navy seals finishing their mission in time before the surgical strike is the only option left naturally with no communication abilities with HQ to report about progress and the usual war hungry American military adviser pushing for the most dangerous options.The movie is also way too political correct. There are no badguys South Koreans work together with the Americans and even the North Koreans are good guys who are secretly on the Americans side. Only one person is left as the bad guy Kim jong Il North Koreas dictator.I was also surprised to see how poor the special effects were. Reminded me of something from the early 80's. Blood splatter from gunfire was clearly just painted on top of the movie during post processing and having a poorly done 3D model of the nuclear missile rotate around on a screen in the presidents conference room just made it look comical.All in all messy inaccurate and most of all predictable and pretty boring stuff. The first behind enemy lines was just a million times better in all aspects.";

The director CONSTANTLY jiggles the camera during the action sequences enough so that these sequences are very hard to follow. He also photographs the majority of movie in ways that give the basic look of the movie a bland feeling with nothing to capture the eye. But the screenplay has plenty of problems too. Would the U.S. military really enact a mission to North Korea without consulting the South Korean militarygovernment first? And without taking any Korean soldiers with them for translation and other local problems that might come up? I'm no expert on the Korean situation or military procedures but all the same this movie really insulted my intelligence.".

The first 50 minutes jumps around like Access Hollywood in fastmotion none of it amounting to anything. The story doesn't come into focus until the final 40 minutes then being only meaningless drivel. Making matters worse is Dodson's senseless trick of filming sequences thru color filters the first being an orange filter for the South Korea scenes. Hey guess what? South Korea is no more orange than South Dakota you dope! Other scenes are through red filters blue et cetera. Dodson must think these tricks cover over the simple fact that he has no clue as to how to make a movie.In the introductory voice over the movie absolutely trashes the thousands of American soldiers who served and lost their lives in the Korean War 50 years ago. I think this was not so much Media Spin as that the filmmakers attended public schools and might have been taught doctoredhistory. They seem unaware that America was fighting not so much North Korea but Red China and Russia or that General MacArthur had pushed deep into North Korea before the war ended.I confess to owning 200 shares of stock in 20th CenturyFox hence my sky high and bloated vote of 2.

In some cases i had to pause the movie to stop myself from being ill! The colors in most of the scenes was off so lacking in some scenes of action that it looked like i was watching a black and white student film.So if you loved BEL 1 and you expect BEL 2 to be anything like it?

The gas and dust from the misses was a nice touch though somewhat overdone considering these guys are supposed to be a professional fighting group and they hit nothing but air trees and rocks.Furthermore any fun in the action that was to be had was immediately quashed by the absurdly wild camera angles. In some cases i had to pause the movie to stop myself from being ill! The colors in most of the scenes was off so lacking in some scenes of action that it looked like i was watching a black and white student film.So if you loved BEL 1 and you expect BEL 2 to be anything like it? Don't even bother giving it a second look. It's a steaming waste of time.";

	schema:headline " An operation by a one or another special forces group gone sour is an old concept attempted to be renewed by the filmmakers not very successfully";
	schema:reviewBody "There's not too much to say about this movie as there isn't much going on about it. Navy SEALs are prepared for a mission inside the North Korea to resolve a nuclear crisis that's appearing on the horizon. During the drop the mission gets aborted and several SEALs get stuck in the enemy territory. Things turn sour quickly but before you know it the forlorn have to save the world. The idea itself is nowhere near original and only a good execution can save a plot like this as it can go both ways. Let's see if it does.As we go deeper into the plot of the movie it quickly becomes apparent that the movie was meant to attract as many viewers as possible with lots of gunfire and shocking moments. That in mind it's not surprising to see many small ridiculous moments where anyone who gives it some thought would be shocked but not in a good way. For instance there's a moment when a SEAL gives a gun to a clueless and tired Korean slavelaborer so he can also take part in a highly important operation where stealth was of high importance. The laborer shoots himself so at least the movie doesn't go as far as turning a laborer into a Rambo. Thanks for that. Moreover common are firefights where both sides are meters away from each other and neither side seems to be able to eliminate the other even with the hundreds of rounds they seem to have in each 30round clip.The acting is average and the best players got the side roles in particular the Koreans. The main hero could've been a better choice than Nicholas Gonzalez. Interesting thing to notice is that no real bad guy is present in this movie.The camera work is one thing that's noticeably professional. The camera seems to move around in every way physically possible with a wide zooming range using tricks like multiple layers when you see zoomedin content on a zoomedout background.The sound has been given some thought and the music ranges from exciting symphonic trips to soulscratching folk singing. It fits relatively well so there's not much to say about it.The movie survives thanks mainly to camera work some actors and perhaps a large budget. It's an average action flick that can entertain if you have nothing better to do but I wouldn't make it a central movie at a big event.".

Having seen this movie I can say that the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is neither the story a pretty standard action movie nor the acting no Oscar material in this movie... but the relevancy it has today.... I think that the US government being confronted now with the fact that North Korea has tested it's first nuclear device she would be kicking herself if that explosion in 2004 really was a nuclear explosion and that they have 'missed' this warning that might have led them to act against North Korea ...because it maybe all too late now. And I think that they looking back would settle now for the outcome that was portrayed in this movie.Goofs If you ask yourself what kind of Jeep you should buy for Christmas buy a North Korean Jeep.

	schema:headline " Excellent cinematography acting and realism";
	schema:reviewBody "As a movie buff I compared this movie against the first Behind Enemy LinesBEL as well as a few others. As a former Special Operations member I also compared this movie to my personal experiences in the military. I have to say that compared to the first BEL the second was much more believable. The first BEL had a couple sweet matrix type moments like the trip wire mines going off but I would expect this with an operating budget of 40 million dollars. With BEL2 having only 3 million dollars in operating expenses it did a pretty dang good job comparatively. Almost all of the computer generated scenes in BEL2 are almost unnoticeable except for a few exaggerated blood splatters. The transition from computer to reallife is very professional. Basically I sometimes couldn't decide if it was real or computer generated during some of the action sequences. Ultimately I don't think Fox should have tagged this movie with BEL it should have been a movie itself. The only reason they did was because I'm sure viewers wouldn't give it a glance at Blockbuster otherwise due to the lack of big named stars.Now take into consideration that two episodes of Alias or approximately 96 minutes of runtime without commercials costs an average of 4.6 million dollars 2.3 million each episode. Compare this to BEL2 and Alias looks like the Brated movie while BEL2 saved 1.6 million dollars over Alias in the process. As for acting I felt like everyone in that movie deserved an A. I get the sense that some reviewers are biased against movies that don't have big named stars. Well the acting in this movie out performs a lot of blockbuster hits. If this movie received a larger budget than 3 million and had big named stars it would have been as good if not better than Bruce Willis's Tears of the Sun. Just for comparison Tears of the Sun cost 70 million dollars what a waste of money compared to BEL2. They should have gone with BEL2's director and computer animation group.As a former SpecOps member I appreciate the realism of the tactics and fight scenes. I'm not implying that it is all real but it is much more believable. Some scene's like the SEAL training scenes are buttered up a bit to give the audience a generality of their background but are not actual training procedures. It's a relief to go from Owen Wilson dodging a million bullets unscathed to BEL2's real life consequences of a well placed shot by the enemy. The political tactics in this movie are extremely realistic. A good portion of the movie revolves around the politics as well as the field action. In my opinion it best represents actual procedures that would occur in a real world situation. After all war and the prevention of is a significant amount of politics and not just Rambo shooting all the bad guys. Don't worry though the political encounters in my opinion help you feel more involved in the entire process of an actual real world situation. BEL2 also shows all sides of the parties involved i.e. N. Korea S. Korea and the US. What I liked most about the movie was how they showed all sides as intelligent human beings. Unlike the first BEL in which the enemy was all evil and no good person existed on the opposite side of the US. BEL2 shows the N. Korea's military leaders as intelligent and some of them compassionate people that care for their countrymen and also for the welfare of the earth's population and they are aware of their leader's habits and exaggerated perceptions about himself.I now have a great admiration for the director of this movie Jame's Dodson. He took 3 million dollars and turned it into a movie that deserved the big screen. In my Opinion he turned 3 million into 40 million when compared to the first BEL. Taking this into account he should be making blockbuster hits with this kind of potential profit for investors. In the filming of BEL2 Jame's Dodson took the Paul Greengrass approach as in the Bourne Supremamcy. If you didn't see the Bourne Supremacy it involves closeups and a bit more movement of the camera during action scenes to build realism and suspense. In the Bourne Supremacy if you thought to yourself I remember the Bourne Supremacy and I felt like I was going to puke from the extreme camera movement do not worry. James Dodson's approach is much more milder and more comfortable than Paul Greengrass's aggressive technique while still keeping the intense effect.I think the majority of people will enjoy this movie for its accuracy action and intelligence embedded in the plot. Its a movie worthy of the big screen and you can rent it for less than a movie ticket at the theaters. I know we all worry about renting straighttoDVD release's and being overcome by cheesiness but fear not peoples who love quality movies. Here is your chance to rent a movie and actually see an entertaining movie you haven't already seen on the big screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "As a movie buff I compared this movie against the first Behind Enemy LinesBEL as well as a few others. As a former Special Operations member I also compared this movie to my personal experiences in the military. I have to say that compared to the first BEL the second was much more believable. The first BEL had a couple sweet matrix type moments like the trip wire mines going off but I would expect this with an operating budget of 40 million dollars. With BEL2 having only 3 million dollars in operating expenses it did a pretty dang good job comparatively. Almost all of the computer generated scenes in BEL2 are almost unnoticeable except for a few exaggerated blood splatters. The transition from computer to reallife is very professional. Basically I sometimes couldn't decide if it was real or computer generated during some of the action sequences. Ultimately I don't think Fox should have tagged this movie with BEL it should have been a movie itself. The only reason they did was because I'm sure viewers wouldn't give it a glance at Blockbuster otherwise due to the lack of big named stars.Now take into consideration that two episodes of Alias or approximately 96 minutes of runtime without commercials costs an average of 4.6 million dollars 2.3 million each episode. Compare this to BEL2 and Alias looks like the Brated movie while BEL2 saved 1.6 million dollars over Alias in the process. As for acting I felt like everyone in that movie deserved an A. I get the sense that some reviewers are biased against movies that don't have big named stars. Well the acting in this movie out performs a lot of blockbuster hits. If this movie received a larger budget than 3 million and had big named stars it would have been as good if not better than Bruce Willis's Tears of the Sun. Just for comparison Tears of the Sun cost 70 million dollars what a waste of money compared to BEL2. They should have gone with BEL2's director and computer animation group.As a former SpecOps member I appreciate the realism of the tactics and fight scenes. I'm not implying that it is all real but it is much more believable. Some scene's like the SEAL training scenes are buttered up a bit to give the audience a generality of their background but are not actual training procedures. It's a relief to go from Owen Wilson dodging a million bullets unscathed to BEL2's real life consequences of a well placed shot by the enemy.

First Navy Seals insert into North Korea to take out missiles  an absolutely unbelievable concept considering that a bomb would do the trick. I was willing to suspend my belief on this. Then what foils the Seals? A freakin' kid of course. I guess the Seals flunked training where they learned to blend in with the environment. If a 5 year old fascinated by a rat could see them then I'd draft a militia before sending those guys into battle. So the Seals defy logic again and chase a kid  bam! You guessed it right into an enemy village with their muzzles to the floor while running. After that they ensure blowing their cover again by grabbing one of the North Korean soldier's wives and then LET HER GO to run away and alert the soldiers. I could not make this up. Therefore after a 100 pound woman fights off the supposedly heavily trained unit. The Navy Seals run out again exposing themselves and again without weapons drawn to enter a stareoff with the wive's husband the soldier. He waits literally 20 seconds whips his pistol out and shoots the Navy Seal in a place that would obviously defeat the round. The Seals shoot back but who cares anyways. They only hit one guy and fire like maniacs. Then they go to ambush the North Koreans by running at them and get mowed down WWI style. The last Navy Seal who survives sees the Grim Reaper and a TIGER what!?. That was when I turned this piece of crap off and vowed to never watch it again. Behind Enemy Lines II insults the first movie which wasn't that great to begin with. This movie however made it look like the Godfather.

	schema:reviewBody "Only months after I read the 1847 Emily Bront novel and saw the 1993 film adaptation along comes yet another version of this enigmatic work. Director Andrea Arnold has taken a bold approach to her interpretation that like all movie representations of books has its strengths and weaknesses.The boldest feature of the film is its casting of Heathcliff as black Solomon Glave as the youngster and James Howson as the selfmade man. Bront describes Heathcliff as notably dark and Arnold  who cowrote the script  has taken the character a significant step further in a manner which underlines Heathcliff's difference from the country folk. The accents are well done with young Cathy Shannon Beer perhaps better than older Catherine Kaya Scodelario. The photography is wonderful with stunning views of the Yorkshire Dales such a contrast to the more frequent very tight shots and the sound is brilliant with a real sense of the wild natural setting.Set against these undoubted virtues it has to be said that the dialogue is so sparse and sometimes muted that unless one has read the novel it's often unclear what's going on and even if you've read the novel you sometimes yearn for the film to get a move on and while some of the exchanges are taken straight from the novel others are so crude that one cannot imagine Bront ever penning such vulgarities. The leisurely pace means that like all except the 1992 version this one can only deal with the first half of Bront's uncomfortable indeed bleak tale so that one does not see the full sustained vindictiveness of the antihero.".

Director Andrea Arnold has taken a bold approach to her interpretation that like all movie representations of books has its strengths and weaknesses.The boldest feature of the film is its casting of Heathcliff as black Solomon Glave as the youngster and James Howson as the selfmade man. Bront describes Heathcliff as notably dark and Arnold  who cowrote the script  has taken the character a significant step further in a manner which underlines Heathcliff's difference from the country folk. The accents are well done with young Cathy Shannon Beer perhaps better than older Catherine Kaya Scodelario. The photography is wonderful with stunning views of the Yorkshire Dales such a contrast to the more frequent very tight shots and the sound is brilliant with a real sense of the wild natural setting.Set against these undoubted virtues it has to be said that the dialogue is so sparse and sometimes muted that unless one has read the novel it's often unclear what's going on and even if you've read the novel you sometimes yearn for the film to get a move on and while some of the exchanges are taken straight from the novel others are so crude that one cannot imagine Bront ever penning such vulgarities. The leisurely pace means that like all except the 1992 version this one can only deal with the first half of Bront's uncomfortable indeed bleak tale so that one does not see the full sustained vindictiveness of the antihero.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like other reviewers I have read Emily Bronte's novel but I am not sure we were reading the same book. My strongest impression from first reading was wonder that the book could be so engaging without a single character with whom to identify.The characters in Wuthering Heights are unlikeable Heathcliff and Hindley are downright nasty. Hatred contempt and jealousy are the overriding emotions of the story. Certainly there is love  strong passionate love too  but it lives in dark corners and is ultimately destructive.This film captures much of the emotion of the book. The first half with Heathcliff Catherine and Hindley as children is played very well indeed.Heathcliff's character is determined in these early years at Wuthering Heights and so it is in the film. When Heathcliff returns as an adult inexplicably played by another actor his heart has hardened and revenge hatred and violence dominate his character. But James Howson who plays the adult Heathcliff is not up to the task and nor it appears is the direction. Heathcliff is certainly violent but this is mostly directed against animals seemingly as means of relieving his frustrations rather than the depiction of a genuinely violent man. His appalling treatment of Isabelle is largely glossed over and the film ends before he starts abusing Hareton. Hatred contempt and jealousy are expressed mainly by closeups of facial expressions and here Howson in the finery of his wealth only seems able to portray smugness.The film lacks a point of view. The camerawork suggests the film is intended to show things from Heathcliff's perspective but much seems to be deliberately obfuscated where Heathcliff would have known exactly what was going on. The audience is continually kept in the dark emphasised by the rain mist and long nights on the moors and just in case we haven't got the idea by repeated scenes shot out of focus. This is all very well adding to atmosphere but the book manages to bring the reader into the story this film seeks to distance the audience as voyeurs only. The people we see are the same people we read about and with much the same character. The children it is true were interesting to watch but when Heathcliff went away returning without comment played by a different actor and Catherine too for that matter but Kaya Scodelario played her role better she had less to do I found I no longer cared about any of them.Heathcliff played as a black man works well. He is clearly of foreign extraction in the book  Who knows but your father was Emperor of China and your mother an Indian queen  although equally clearly not 'a regular black' also a quote. A black Heathcliff is far more convincing than an obviously white English one.The language is also rather more 'colourful' than in the book. But this too seems to be justified. It sounds true enough to me and I did not detect any neologisms. It must be pretty impenetrable to nonnative English speakers but there is precious little of it. I know Heathcliff is taciturn but the silences are unbearable. Even the book has Nelly Dean to carry the dialogue.Finally there is the ending. The book more or less describes the story backwards starting long after the film has ended and showing Heathcliff in his ultimate form. The film quite rightly in my opinion is in chronological order barring some unnecessary and distracting flashbacks and covers only Heathcliff's relationships with Catherine and Hindley. The ending is well chosen in terms of plot but totally undermines whatever integrity the film had for the entire film is shot without a background soundtrack. What we hear are the sounds of nature songs being sung out of tune and out of time but utterly in character. A poor band playing a mournful Christmas hymn the Coventry Carol is it? branches tapping on a window even though this last does not sound quite right all add to the film's bleakness. But then with only about a minute to go till the end there intrudes a modern song played on modern instruments in a studio. I quite like Mumford and Sons but what on earth is that song doing there? At least it could have started after the credits began to roll the mood destroyed this is one film I did not stay to read them.".

It had quite a few walk outs near the beginning probably the strong Yorkshire accents with lots of background noise made it unintelligible for non native English speakers and they were the lucky ones as it certainly did not improve over the following 2 hours.The director's main aim seemed to be to try and shock audiences who thought they were coming to an Emma Thompson type costume drama by making the film as morose as possible and throwing in lots of swearing violence and a bit of necrophilia. Unfortunately the only shocking thing was that they had managed to make such a bad film out of a classic novel.There were numerous petty things which annoyed me about this film e.g. the use of pathetic fallacy with the weather is way over the top the Earnshaws live under a constant biblical downpour whereas there rich neighbours in the next door valley have a climate from a fruit juice advert the cameraman either had Parkinson's or had been previously employed in one of those American police series where reality is represented by a constantly jerky camera the actors playing the adult Cathy and Heathcliff look nothing like their younger selves  Heathcliff even appears to have changed race! would a 19th century strict Christian father be happy with someone sleeping with his teenage daughter in the house? would a 19th century Heathcliff be able to swan around Edgar house willy nilly? I could go on.Most importantly I think the director fails completely in making us feel any sympathy for her characters. Heathcliff has a hard time of it in his youth but has no redeeming features. It's not helped by the fact that the actor playing the adult Heathcliff is atrociously bad at his job.I have no problem with making Wuthering Heights dark and brooding but make it a bit less daft.".

They are leaden.In Andrea Arnold's latest edgy production the only characters that have any depth have anything going on behind the eyes and therefore engage the audience are the characters played by professionals  namely Paul Hilton Steve Evets  Kaya Scodelario. And yet she proudly declares that she likes to use real people instead of professional actors because real people are authentic. But it is these real people who let her down by not being able to act and by being unreliable being late not showing up for ADR etc. Andrea Arnold appears to be blissfully unaware of how insulting she is being to an ancient profession actors are real people too and she ignores the fact so many better films than any she has made are populated by pros.In this as in her inability to explain why the film was shot 43 she reveals that she has little interest in movies and movie making. So why should an audience be interested in her movies?Thankfully Andrea Arnold does use professionals behind the camera. The cinematography by Robbie Ryan a professional and quite probably a real person was superb. Although the over vigorous use of the hand held style meant that for a lot of the time the screen is filled with a meaningless mass of blurs which only serves to emphasise to the audience the presence of a camera. Thus the fourth wall is broken and any magic is lost.Since winning an Oscar for her short film Andrea Arnold has now made three movies. She may well carry on making movies so long as there are producers brave enough to take on a disorganised artist who might be better off working in a studio on her own.".

	schema:reviewBody "My experience was so drastically opposed to what I'd heard about this film in the newspapers that I was going to write a shocked review here but I see that it has already all been said. Wilfully obscure narrative I went with someone who had never read the book and had to explain to him afterwards who was who and what had happened and why selfindulgent overuse of wildlife shots and arty camera angles once is good twice is good ALL THE TIME is tedious important plot developments whisked over in the joints between one scene and the next poor performances from the adult actors jerky camerawork insufficient lighting and a variety of deliberately repulsive scenes of slaughter necrophilia bloodsucking and copulation in the mud and I'm not talking about that bizarre bog scene between Cathy and Heathcliff clearly intended to be very significant since it was repeated at the end...A lot of the time I felt I was being battered over the head with the director's insistence that This Is a Very Important Metaphor but simply didn't understand what the shot of a beetle or a horse's flank or a patch of stone or yet another rainstorm was supposed to be saying. The one thing I didn't notice interestingly was that the film is in Academy ratio rather than widescreen  probably because the vast majority of the pictures I watch are not in widescreen and in fact I generally dislike it so I certainly wasn't conscious of that as a drawback. To be fair my other companion who adores the novel thought the film was the closest she'd ever seen to capturing the spirit of the book although she too was somewhat disappointed in the 'adult' section.I suppose you could say that it was a disquieting film of a disquieting book in which none of the characters were sympathetic because none of the characters in the original are sympathetic for my part I found myself roused to a furious dislike and resentment so was at least not indifferent to it.

	onyx:emotionText "My experience was so drastically opposed to what I'd heard about this film in the newspapers that I was going to write a shocked review here but I see that it has already all been said. Wilfully obscure narrative I went with someone who had never read the book and had to explain to him afterwards who was who and what had happened and why selfindulgent overuse of wildlife shots and arty camera angles once is good twice is good ALL THE TIME is tedious important plot developments whisked over in the joints between one scene and the next poor performances from the adult actors jerky camerawork insufficient lighting and a variety of deliberately repulsive scenes of slaughter necrophilia bloodsucking and copulation in the mud and I'm not talking about that bizarre bog scene between Cathy and Heathcliff clearly intended to be very significant since it was repeated at the end...A lot of the time I felt I was being battered over the head with the director's insistence that This Is a Very Important Metaphor but simply didn't understand what the shot of a beetle or a horse's flank or a patch of stone or yet another rainstorm was supposed to be saying. The one thing I didn't notice interestingly was that the film is in Academy ratio rather than widescreen  probably because the vast majority of the pictures I watch are not in widescreen and in fact I generally dislike it so I certainly wasn't conscious of that as a drawback. To be fair my other companion who adores the novel thought the film was the closest she'd ever seen to capturing the spirit of the book although she too was somewhat disappointed in the 'adult' section.I suppose you could say that it was a disquieting film of a disquieting book in which none of the characters were sympathetic because none of the characters in the original are sympathetic for my part I found myself roused to a furious dislike and resentment so was at least not indifferent to it.

	schema:reviewBody "If you are intending on watching a film adaptation of Wuthering Heights then I would recommend you watching one of the earlier adaptations. This 'film' does not tell the story in any shape or form. Obviously this is not to say that people shouldn't be able to create their own take on a piece of literature however anyone who is expecting a retelling of the classic novel should be aware of this before watching.My main faults with this film were in its complete lack of characterisation. I did not feel like I knew or understood any of the characters and while as previous reviews have pointed out Bronte hardly presents the most likable characters they did at least have several dimensions. I felt no sympathy towards any of the characters in this film for a start there was barely enough dialogue to even form an opinion on them. I feel that Nelly and Joseph were completely overlooked and Nelly in particular was not able to give the film so much of the charm that the book has. Another fault would be the complete lack of passion in the novel the reader really gets a sense of the anguish and torture that both Heathcliff and Catherine feel. When the line 'May you wake in torment' was changed to 'May you wake in agony' I was disgusted with the fact such a powerful line had been changed for something with a different meaning for no good reason. Where is the passion we get in the novel 'I cannot live without my life I cannot live without my soul'? Heathcliff and Catherine barely seemed to care in the film!Other flaws would include the fact you could barely hear anything over the exaggerated wind and the directors blatant desire to make the film unique and quirky. Obviously some viewers may be upset by the unnecessary violence to animals that was depicted graphically as well as the language. I did not personally enjoy either of these aspects. And of course as a lover of the novel the complete change of storyline  that said it is an adaptation so I can live with that despite thinking it ruined a classic. All in all the main disappointment really has to be the characterisation or lack of particularly the failure for any of these characters to develop throughout the whole two hours.You might enjoy this film if you like a lot of silence a lot of wind and rain inappropriate music choice for a film set in the 18th19th century and a total disregard for the reasons that make this novel so loved to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hareton disturbed me the most in this film based on Wuthering Heights. Dour before his time he appears now and then in the early scenes a dirty blondehaired urchin to gawp at visitors or to witness violent abuse from the sidelines. In the final scene he is seen hanging up dogs by their collars. The depiction of Hareton is related to the 'cruelty breeds cruelty' message in Andrea Arnold's film  and in Emily Bront's novel if that can be seen glibly as a straight deliverer of messages. Considerable respect has been shown to the original a fair amount of thought and research seems to have gone into finding out what was in Emily Bront's mind and how she saw her characters and into the late eighteenth century in Yorkshire. All the artefacts  stoneware jars spades for digging out peat and so on  look as if they have been borrowed from a folk museum the costumes appear to be authentic and Heathcliff is black. All perfectly credible.The unknown James Howson from Leeds was cast as the adult Heathcliff with the equally unknown Solomon Glave as his young version. We do not find out which language he speaks when he first arrives because there is very little speaking in the whole film. It is not dialogue free employing a few sentences and phrases from the novel rather like the quotes a candidate might fish out for an Alevel essay with more of them in the film's second half after Heathcliff's return than in the first. At other times the words which the characters use seem to have grown from improvisation sessions giving the action a kind of Ken Loach feel at times. To leave out most of Emily Bront's beautiful prose  and the second half of her story as usual  are bold moves which a few literary folk might find outrageous. I can fully understand the opinions of those who might describe the film as 'coarse and disagreeable' but then the structure of the novel does not match the needs of the cinema. Unlike Cary Fukunaga who retained as many of Charlotte's words as possible in his Jane Eyre Andrea Arnold has gone in an opposite direction because she has decided not to bother with conventional costume dramas.This Wuthering Heights relies on cinematography the impact of fresh and young actors eat your heart out Stanislavski an authentic period feel and a powerful often startling harshness. Arnold has said that she had to pick out the things that had resonance to me and that she wanted to give the children plenty of time at the beginning. This was a good move because the children are by far the most interesting. Solomon Glave and Shannon Beer have not acted before but manage to be fascinating holding everything together for an hour. Full marks to Arnold there. The story is told through sounds and sights we see the boy's amazement and disorientation when he arrives Cathy's warm smile  the only warmth  a feather brushing a cheek his hand on the horse's rump when he rides behind her his smelling of her hair the weals on his back after a beating by Joseph her mouth as she licks the blood from them their crude and muddy sexual fumbling out on the moors. Sensual imagery with a vengeance! Raw teenage emotion in our faces! And I loved Shannon Beer's charming rendition of Barbara Allen. She's a proper wild wicked slip of a girl.Irish cinematographer Robbie Ryan won the Golden Osella Award at the last Venice Film Festival for Best Cinematography deservedly. His low shots through clumps of sedge and his panoramas of the moors filming took place on the bleaker areas around Hawes in the Yorkshire Dales are stunning but what is especially memorable is his selection of closeups of the insects flowers and small creatures to be found in the heather and under the bilberries. I was looking out for harebells but did not notice any. Perhaps they were the wrong kind of flower here. The wind sounded right  I recognise that wind  as it battered the microphone relentlessly.The creatures of the wild moors a couple of centuries ago have a strong presenttimes feel because casting in this way has put racial prejudice in the forefront. Heathcliff is full of revengeful passions because he has been racially abused. The violent skinhead Hindley Lee Shaw is notably foulmouthed when he does speak like an adherent of some farright organisation and the enforced baptism scene shows that the church was pretty short on tender loving care when it came to new darkskinned members of the congregation. The West Yorkshire accents are just right. In the second half the adult Heathcliff James Howson does not spend long on relishing his revenge on Hindley but that is not the only disappointment. Both James Howson and Kaya Scodelario who plays the adult Cathy bear only token resemblances to their child counterparts and have less presence. Cathy is not differentiated from Isabella enough and seems to be unrelated to her younger self which can not be explained away by her presence in the sophistication of Thrushcross Grange where manners and the mild weather are always better. Heathcliff seems somehow clumsier and less sympathetic a fact which is not helped by James Howson's lack of acting experience more forgivable in Solomon Glave and the shots of flowers and insects which sustained the first half become less effective because they are repeated too much. James Northcote's acting as Edgar is faultless but seems out of place here as if he has stepped out of another film.And that other film could be the 1939 version which is at the other end of the spectrum.".

Having Cathy and Heathcliff meet as older children was a mistake in my opinion as it denied the story their innocent youngcub type bond. There was rather an embarrassing scene where young Cathy and Heathcliff writhed together in the mud. Awkward pretentious and such an obvious crass device equalled only by Heathcliff later writhing on Cathy's corpse.Wuthering Heights the house itself was way too squalid.I wondered in the end if the directorscreenwriter actually liked or respected the original story at all. Everything that makes it wonderful and enduring was stripped from it  with the exception of the countryside  and all we were left with were two fantastically ordinary individuals who within the parameters of the setting offered by the film would certainly not have bothered to have kept their hands off each other long enough to cause themselves or their nearest and dearest any of the trouble detailed in the novel.On a practical note the epic length of the credits really struck me. How did it take that many people to make THAT??".

Everything that makes it wonderful and enduring was stripped from it  with the exception of the countryside  and all we were left with were two fantastically ordinary individuals who within the parameters of the setting offered by the film would certainly not have bothered to have kept their hands off each other long enough to cause themselves or their nearest and dearest any of the trouble detailed in the novel.On a practical note the epic length of the credits really struck me. How did it take that many people to make THAT??";

I also liked it that a large part of the film concentrated on the early parts of the book apparently in contrast to other film versions especially as the younger actors performed quite well. It was as a shame that the acting deteriorated so much with the adult cast to the extent that I could detect no passion or chemistry between Heathcliffe and Cathy.I thought the film was overall a dreary waste of time.

	schema:reviewBody "OK I'll start off with what I definitely found disturbing about this film and did not like. As others have mentioned there is some worrying animal cruelty in this film  no I don't mean the trapped hare or the killing of rabbits  I can easily stomach this. What did worry me is the hanging of the small dogs from fence posts by their collars which clearly left the dogs in a distressed state  I can't believe this was generated by special effects so can only assume that some dogs were left dangling in this way for the purpose of producing this film  not acceptable in my book.That aside I actually enjoyed this film and would have given it 8 out 10 had it not been for the unnecessary cruelty. I have yet to see 'Red Road' so this was my first experience of an Andrea Arnold film. What struck me is how little dialogue there was  instead we are treated to the Yorkshire moors in all their bleakness. I think this has been done to great effect  the wind noise as the camera is bouncing along the moorland is surprisingly effective at immersing the viewer in the wild Yorkshire landscape. The first half of the film  where Heathcliff and Cathy are still children has some very powerful moments. Unfortunately I found the grown up versions less convincing although it is my opinion that Arnold deliberately chose actors that did look somewhat different to their younger versions there are many flashbacks in the second half of the film and these are made more prominent by featuring the different actors.Other reviewers have pointed out how dark this film is and that there are no likable characters. Well surprise surprise it's an incredibly bleak book and it's a relief that this has been retained here. What is unfortunate is that the whole of the second part of the book featuring Cathy's daughter Catherine has been completely omitted but at the slow pace of this film it would have required at least another 2 hours to cover this. Also I might suggest that Isabella was actually quite likable!Would I recommend anyone to see this? Not to an animal lover for sure  it's unfortunate that these scenes are included and I'm slightly surprised that this is permitted in filming. But for the wonderful experience of being immersed in the wildness of the moors definitely.".

In its attempts to show how awful in its strict meaning the Yorkshire Moors must be and how terrible were the lives of its inhabitants the film just missed pretty much every other valid point of the book. And the title should have been Young Heathcliff because every other character was washed out. The whole adult section wasn't even worth bothering about not even adult Heathcliff. And adult Cathy a day after watching has completely gone from my memory so little impact did she make. Young Cathy was the only positive thing I can rescue. The idea of a black Heathcliff doesn't ring true. While I do feel that one of the book's main themes is racism it is clear that a Latin or East European actor should have portrayed Heathcliff but then the film seems to be more a reflection of today's society rather than the 18th century. In the book Heathcliff arrives as a small child small enough so that his relationship with Cathy is fraternal however the film has Heathcliff arriving as a horny 13 year old and so the two of them almost start off with sexual tension which was never apparent in the book. In fact the book is so chaste that sex rarely rears its head babies appear almost magically! The confused fraternalsexual love that the two have for each other in the book is totally subsumed in the film. Hindley's jealousy is another aspect of the book which is converted into his portrayal in the film as just a foulmouthed violent skinhead. Hindley becomes this despicable wretch because he was so unfairly treated by his adored father who lavished his love on the racially inferior Hindley's point of view ragamuffin over him for what reason we do not really know so we do not know who Hindley really was. But jealousy can turn a normal man into a monster.And finally since I am comparing the film to the book rather than the other film versions another reviewer commented on how unintelligible this film would be if you hadn't read the book. I totally agree as dour as the book is it has a very clear and very clever and well thought out plot and one never is allowed to wander far from the core story. The film however is plot less and the story can only be understood with reference to the audience having read the book which rather defeats the whole exercise of producing a film of a major literary work. And anyway while Emily Bront does try to recreate the atmosphere of a dark wuthering place to frame her characters the film does the opposite it uses the characters to add a little colour to its deathly main theme the colourless violent rugged yet fearfully beautiful Yorkshire Moors. It would maybe have been better adapted for a Discovery Channel history documentary rather than a well known novel.".

I've read a lot of reviews for this movie and people seem fairly unanimous that the older actor who played Heathcliff was dreadful. To me I thought he was one of the only good attributes to the film. He conveyed Heathcliff's abrasiveness perfectly and it's essential to remember that in the novel Heathcliff wasn't meant to be intelligent or comprehensible. After you've read the book you're meant to be confused as to whether Heathcliff was an 'imp of Satan' or one with a brutal exterior that disguised intense emotion. It was Brontes criticism of the archetypal Byronic hero challenging the poetic stock character of an abrasive unpleasant and perhaps even violent individual who is in fact very passionate. In this case the domestic violence and animal cruelty showed by Heathcliff makes it almost impossible to sympathise with the character which was one of Brontes key themes. Heathcliff is played brilliantly and fits my exact idea of everything he should embody Literature's most infamous antihero.I also loved the authentic feel of the film the director went right back to the roots of Wuthering Heights and the setting is perfect.That's seriously it. It was undoubtedly the worst Wuthering Heights adaptation I've ever seen. Excessive pathetic fallacy and animal metaphors the two birds flying was unimaginative and annoying! and a pretentious absence of dialogue. Almost all of the characters were completely underdeveloped and it seems Arnold had more fun showing the moors than engaging the audience in a clear plot. Cathy was underplayed in the book she's much more exaggerated and distinctive and Nelly Dean was just...was she even there? I can't blame the acting though it was the fault of whoever did the screenplay or more fittingly didn't do the screenplay. You're constantly waiting for the story to get going and then you realise you're over half way through and the majority of it should have happened already. And when Mumford and Sons kicked in...I nearly fell off my chair. That really did put the cherry on the shitty cake. It sadly reminded me of Luhrmanns' Gatsby. Pitiful.I don't understand how anyone can take one of history's most passionate intense novels of destruction love and revenge and turn it into something so dull drab and morose.".

I knew enough about Arnold not to expect a costume flick nothing that would remind the audience of Jane Austen and I didn't expect anything light either. Bronte's novel isn't exactly light and I was actually looking forward to a darker interpretation.What's the story? A young boy named Heathcliff in this interpretation he's black is taken in by a rich family in England where he gets abused by his foster brother and where he develops an intense obsession with his foster sister Cathy.I wasn't that bothered by the weather. Even though it was raining cats and dogs near the house of the Earnshaw's. I'm not exaggerating it was literally pouring down there was an enormous amount of fog and the sun seemed to be a myth. The rich neighbours a few hours away however had a lovely climate.I wasn't that bothered by how minimalistic the movie is. On the contrary I enjoy movies with no soundtrack. There's almost no dialog. Something I usually enjoy as well. And there's an overuse of wildlife metaphors mostly bugs and feathers.I wasn't that bothered by the shaky camera either. Even though it looked like they were imitating one of those reality cop shows.I wasn't even bothered by the fact that the older Heathcliff and Cathy looked nothing like their younger selves. And by nothing I mean nothing.What did bother me?First of all the animal abuse. I understand that after hunting a rabbit you need to break its neck. I understand to put lamb chops onto a plate you need to first kill the lamb. I also understand that when there were too many dogs around one estate some would get killed. But I honestly don't havewant to see this. I really don't need a director showing me close shots of how these animals die.Then there's not one likable character in this story. Not one redeeming quality. I am aware that it's similar in the book. But one does not care about the love story or the protagonist. The protagonist is a poor soul but he also behaves like a jerk the love story is an obsession and destroys two human beings. Plus it ends with some necrophilia which btw isn't an exaggeration either.All this made me want to climb through the screen and go and punch a few characters. I don't like it when a film makes me feel nothing but aggression. Since I remember vaguely that the book is just as dark and depressing maybe this just isn't my story.".

Well there wasn't much luring...most  of the samurais were just unlucky enough to wander into the old woman  and nubile young daughter's home territory...but the movie was still a  superb little find...in a suburban Blockbuster Video of all places!  This movie which I found to be faster paced than most Japanese period  pieces is just DRIPPING with weird psychological overtones. The story  involves an old woman and her daughterinlaw living off the spoils of  wars. Various samurai from countless wars are always stumbling into  these bandits' territory and to be summarily jacked for their armor and  weapons. It's one big happy family until an old comrade of the  daughter's husband returns home and reports that the daughter's husband  is dead. We're never really sure if this man killed the husband or  not...but that issue is soon is overshadowed by the sexual tension of  two women who haven't been with a fella for some time. Eventually the  nubile young daughter helps herself to this new lover much to the  jealous rage of her motherinlaw. So the old woman hatches a scheme to  separate these two lovers...but keeping them apart is as difficult as  keeping apart two dogs in...well you get the idea.  The cinematography of this film is excellent. Each shot is meticulously  and lovingly shot building the tension and supplying the canine  symbolism. The music is unusual too...it starts off with some hepcat  bebop and then regresses into what I can only guess is theme music for  an oni Japanese ogre.  I would highly recommend Onibaba for those evenings where everyone  feels a need to be disturbed and entertained at the same time. It also  doesn't hurt that Jotsuki Yoshimuru who plays the daughterinlaw  happens to be drop dead gorgeous...in a punk rock sort of way. You'll  see what I mean when you check out this flick.  I doubt you'll find this flick at Blockbuster Video...unless you find  one in the middle of a wheat field.....".

	schema:reviewBody "Onibaba is a supernatural horror film based on a Buddhist fable. It's about a couple of women in feudal Japan surviving the hardships of war by murdering and robbing stray samurais who wander unwittingly into their path. Their domain is a huge field of tall reeds with an ominous deep hole at its centre where they dispose of the unfortunate men they kill. Things are complicated when a male neighbour returns from the war and unleashes sexual tensions within the women which ends in horror. And that is to say nothing of the demon mask...Onibaba is an artistically strong piece of cinema. From the outset the film is aurally intense with repetitive beating drums announcing the beginning of the tale. The widescreen frame is consistently used brilliantly with beautifully lit black and white photography. From the constantly swaying reeds to the closeups of the protagonist's faces the visuals capture the mysterious yet ominous beauty of the natural world while emphasising the intense emotions of the protagonists. The setting ensures that the atmosphere is one of claustrophobia. In fact one of the themes of Onibaba is the way that the natural landscape can shape the way we are. The field of reeds allows the women to get close enough to kill warriors it is one of the things that shapes them into killers as it allows them to murder at will undetected. Similarly the film is an allegory on capitalism. The war has forced these starving women to find their own way to survive the hardships all around them. They take extreme measures to feed the capitalist machine as they murder and sell on that which they steal to a local lowlife. Capitalism has dehumanised them and the black hole in the centre swallows up the victims. But aside from this it is an intense human drama intertwined with eerie supernatural horror. The scenes near the end of the film with the demon in the reeds are beautifully creepy. While the horrific curse of the mask results in some scary and disorientating final scenes. In addition there is a powerful depiction of female sexuality. These women are no shrinking violets. They are aggressive amoral and deadly.Onibaba is a film that is sumptuous both visually and aurally yet its characters and story are devoid of beauty. It's one of the best examples of a horror art film.".

	schema:reviewBody "To describe this film in one word that word would have to 'wow' or something to that effect. In short Onibaba is an absolutely spectacular cinematic spectacle and one that has few equals in it's field. In fact it's the perfect fusion between arthouse cinema and atmospheric horror! Loosely based on a Buddhist fable Onibaba tells a story of lust envy wrath and betrayal which is wrapped up by way of a hideous demon mask. Onibaba is a human drama before it's a horror movie  all the character actions are driven by their various needs and wants and the all the comeuppance emancipates from there. The characters and their actions are constantly fascinating and it's that which predominantly keeps the film alive. We follow a mother and her daughterinlaw a couple that are forced to eke out an existence in war torn Japan by killing passing samurai's and selling their belongings for food. Their existence is upset one day however when the son's friend Hachi returns from the war to the place where the two women live.The title of the film roughly translates into English as 'demon woman' and that is an apt title for this story. Although the film doesn't contain any actual demons or other mythical creatures the real horror comes from the character actions and the film succeeds as a horror film in that way. The atmospheric location which consists of a huge area covered in reeds adds weight to film's claim to the horror genre also and the location provides a truly stunning set for this story to take place. The film also features a dark pit which the women use to dump the bodies of the Samurai they kill which adds to the fantasy and inventive element of the story. The film is cinematic poetry on many levels from the bleak yet beautiful cinematography to the elements of the location mentioned  all the way down to it's central piece of imagery  the mask itself. The mask is the film's centrepiece and the part's where it features are the most memorable of the movie.Prolific Japanese director Kaneto Shind takes us on a tourdeforce of atmospheric direction. He spends a fair amount of time focusing on the reeds blowing in the wind and many of his angles focus on the sky which will no doubt irritate the less adept viewers amongst us  but the rest of us know that this is a way for Shind to aptly portray his setting and every instance when he did that was a delight for yours truly. There are many great shots in this movie and if you're a fan of technical prowess Onibaba is your film and even if you're not this film is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Onibaba is a very well done film purposefully using black and white cinema to its' advantage in this stunning portrayal of murder jealousy and uncontrollable human instinct in a dark period of Japan's history.A film that aims at portraying the baser side of human nature and investigating human psychology it is chalkfull of symbolic scenes and sequences. From start to finish it draws you in with the odd imagery and scenery of Japan's rural areas and even though in this film though there are very few characters and elements that are to it both visually and literally through its' minimalism it effectively tells its' story.This film is both very artistic  symbolic as well as literal and upfront juxtaposing very graphic real images of the face of humanity that demand the viewer to infer much throughout the whole of the film. When going into this film I would say that it is very important for the viewer to think of the film as being very symbolic for the instincts and base nature of mankind and perhaps even a 'state of nature' portrayal of humanity. If you watch this film with that in mind it will help with the inferences that one must make to get the most out of this film.As it stands by itself aside from the deeper meaning it is an intriguing story that is a veritable 'slice of life' film in the darker sense viewing the way that people had to live during a period of war and hard times in feudal Japan. It deals with the hardships that these people face and their method of survival in addition to a very human story of jealousy and portrayal with a very interesting culminating point that I did not expect at all. The climax of the film is very much worth the buildup though at times it seemed to be rather slow. Overall a very important piece of film when it comes to the symbolism and techniques employed. Through its' minimalism and blackandwhite cinematography we are really treated to a great film that is of its' own right an influential and great movie. The cinematography is exceptionally good especially the use of the reeds and the light at night.I would recommend this film to anybody with a serious interest in film as well as anybody who likes a good film that investigates the darker side of human nature.".

	schema:headline " ONIBABA 1964 12";
	schema:reviewBody "ONIBABA had been for as long as I can remember one of a select group of arthouse horror movies  namely Carl Theodor Dreyer's VAMPYR 1932 Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE 1959 and Harry Kumel's DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS 1971 among others  which I seemed destined never to catch up with in my lifetime. Thankfully however albeit all fairly recently I've succeeded in watching each and every one of them the latest case being Kaneto Shindo's film just a couple of days ago by way of Criterion's remarkable presentation on DVD. Seeing one particularly tantalizing still and reading about it in filmreference books since childhood had certainly raised my expectations skyhigh. Well having seen it now I can safely say that it's an excellent movie striking cinematography both evocative and rich in imagery is counterpointed by an unusual yet highly effective music score direction and acting are equally superb and the film easily ranks among the finest Japanese films one of my favorite exponents in World Cinema I have ever seen. The film's overpoweringly torrid even carnal atmosphere reminded me of Hiroshi Teshigahara's WOMAN IN THE DUNES 1964 whereas its supernatural connotations recall Masaki Kobayashi's epic horror compendium KWAIDAN 1964  but also look forward to Shindo's own KURONEKO 1968 an equally stylish and perhaps even more fanciful ghost story.Still ONIBABA's reputation as a 'horror' film is somewhat misleading these elements only come into play during the film's last third in fact the very few characters and equally minimal dialogue and plot gives rise to a rather slow  but never tedious  pace culminating in a truly horrifying final sequenceyet they are so classily presented that THIS is what most viewers remember about the film! Even so I think that the film's frank depiction of both uninhibited sexuality  via the frequent daughterinlawneighbor sexual encounters and the striking image of the nude 'mistress' within the sleazy trader's lair  and repressed desire  the memorable scene of the externalization of the mother's frustration at her daughterinlaw's continuing sexual activity and with it the realization of her own fading looks and subsequent rejection by the neighbor upon a tree trunk  is an equally remarkable achievement.In fact I was somewhat surprised by the copious if always tasteful and inoffensive amount of nudity in the film though this was certainly required not only by the themes discussed above but also by the film's setting in the sweltering heat of Japanese marshes. From the very first sequence  the elliptical and coldblooded murder of the ravaged warriors reminiscent of an early one in Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS 1958  the mother and daughterinlaw are seen returning to their huts gobbling up their miserable lunch and expire of fatigue practically naked on their bunkbeds as any legitimate breadwinner would do after a hard day at work indicating that this state of events has been their daily routine for some time now. For an equally impressive look at the reality of the hardships imposed upon those who stayed behind during the period in which the Japanese waged feudal war on each other one needs only to refer back to Kenji Mizoguchi's sublime UGETSU 1953  quite simply one of the most beautiful blackandwhite films ever made which coincidentally just like ONIBABA may also be regarded as an exquisite ghost story. If I had to name one slight gripe I had with the film it would be the exact same one eminent British film critic Leslie Halliwell had had with my favorite Luis Bunuel film THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 'makes all its points beautifully and then goes on twenty minutes too long.' I don't concur with his judgment on the Bunuel film but in ONIBABA's case the clandestine nighttime journeys of the daughterinlaw towards the neighbor's hut do tend to get repetitious although I must say that the recurring swishing sounds and entrancing images of the reeds being parted by the girl's breathless running is highly effective and in the director's own view full of erotic implications. One thing I particularly liked about ONIBABA is the film's ambiguous and slightly inconclusive ending did the neighbor get killed when he visited the trader's lair? did the mother fall to her death in the very same pit she used to 'store' her victims? how would the daughterinlaw be able to survive now that both her accomplices have met their doom?The DVD extras especially Shindo's delightful interview were both illuminating and entertaining. I do hope Criterion proposes such classic Japanese fare more frequently only Kurosawa seems to be amply represented so far as one really cannot get enough of them".

	schema:headline " A warning for what human beings are capable of";
	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on a Buddhist fable warning against the evils of bitterness that is Onibaba. The Director Kaneto Shindo has created a psychosexual tale of dubious morality and unrequited lust which is a fantastic cautionary fable with a dark and unique atmosphere all of its own which in my mind puts it up with the greats of the horror genre.The plot revolves around two women who live in feudal Japan who live in mysterious marshlands who keep themselves alive off the death of wandering soldiers by selling there armour and clothes. This allows them to survive while the younger woman Nobuko Otowa's husband and the older woman Jitsuko Yoshimura's son is away fighting in the wars. However all of a sudden they find the very nature of their daily existence thrown into turmoil by anger fear and jealousy brought on by a man named Hachi Kei Sato their neighbour. He returns from the wars with the news that the younger woman's husband is dead and although initially distrustful the wife strikes up a passionate affair with him... much to the disgust of the older woman whose anger is not so much derived from a sense of immorality but that the older woman is jealous of the younger woman as she to seeks a passionate night with a man also but later she realises that her younger accomplice might leave with Hachi and have her fend for herself which turns her jealously to fear. Then one night a chance encounter with a passing soldier who wears a terrifying demon mask gives a plan to the conniving old woman involving a demonic visage and the daughterinlaw's natural fear of hell. However not all goes to plan...Stunningly beautifully photography by Kiyomi Kuroda which at times gravely still and voyeuristic at others frightfully haunting the cinematography breathes as much life into this film as any of the characters it captures. Also set to Hikaru Hayashi's unique score which combines a 60s jazzy aesthetic with a more traditional drum based sound Onibaba is frightening not so much for genuine horror moments but for the fact that it serves as a warning for what human beings are capable of. Like the best parables it transcends its location and time period and still resonates to this day with its darker aspects of lust and hate.".

I had no idea what it was about before I saw it only that it was a stylish horror film that draws influence from the Kabuki. I assumed it would be sort of surreal and abstract kind of like a nightmarish dance. But it was very traditional in the way it stuck to the story. Which wasn't bad. In fact I really enjoyed it.I also thought it would be slow and to tell the truth boring but it surprised me in how it kept my interest throughout. It didn't indulge in needlessly long takes just for the sake of appearing artistic and there was always something happening always a development.One of the great things about this film is the way the director uses the surroundings to create a stuffy cramped yet isolated atmosphere. The tall grass is always present and we never get to see what's more than several feet away from the characters. Don't laugh but it reminded me of the fog in Silent Hill the video game not the movie.SPOILERS BELOWI may be wrong but I thought I detected some Hitchcockian influence in the film. The whole domineering motherfigure theme the way the audience is in on the secret while the other characters stay oblivious. Also the plot had that wicked streak that is present in episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Especially the bit of poetic justice at the end  she pretended to be a demon therefore she became a demon.I loved the tonal shift about two thirds of the way through from realistic drama to a sort of haunted folktale. And the ending was just perfect.".

This is a dramatic and very sober tale set during a devastating civil war in Japan and focusing on two leftbehind women living in a seemly endless field of reeds. In order to survive the women an elderly lady and her daughterinlaw kill random samurai that pass through the reeds and sell their armor to a weapon dealer. When a male neighbor returns claiming the women's son and husband got killed in battle the young woman develops feelings of lust for him. The old woman quickly gets jealous and afraid and thinks of ways to tear the young couple apart. The power of Onibaba almost entirely depends on the minimal amount of filming locations and the unsettling cinematography. Director Shind portrays the bodyhigh reeds as some sort of inescapable hell complete with surreal death traps the pit!! and lurking mystical forces the mask!!. The monotonous blackandwhite camerawork excellently illustrates the poverty and misery of the women. Long before turning into a petrifying horror story the film is a mesmerizing allegory on the human behavior when faced with war and solitude. The music is fantastic and the script contains some downright brilliant dialogues. Probably the best I've ever seen in Asian filmmaking! Onibaba's biggest trump unquestionably is the genuinely eerie demon mask used by the old women to tame her daughterinlaw's growing lust. This relic is breathtaking and effectively suits the atmosphere of this Japanese masterpiece which is weird...grim...and totally unique!".

She climbs down the hole to take his possessions and his mask and she finds he is a disfigured man. The she uses the demon mask to haunt her daughterinlaw to keep her away from Hachi. However when she decides to remove the mask she has a surprise. Onibaba is a raw film by Kaneto Shind disclosing how two women are capable to survive in the war in the Fourteenth Century in Japan in an environment of sexual tension and murders. This film is tagged horror genre but indeed is a brutal and erotic drama. The blackandwhite cinematography is magnificent and the camera work is exceptional. In accordance with information available in Internet the mask was inspired in a Shin Buddhism parable. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Onibaba A Mulher Demnio Onibaba The Demon Woman".

	schema:reviewBody "Japan's enjoying a Civil War in the 15 or 1600's and two peasant women a middleaged woman and her daughterinlaw are reduced to savagery they ambush weary samurai who are trying to hide out in their lair of tall suzuki grass. After spearing the soldiers in the backs the women strip them of pricey weapons and armor which they'll sell to a blackmarket profiteer for sacks of millet you know times are bad in Japan when rice is unavailable . . . but not before disposing of the samurai's carcasses down a very large almost bottomless hole in the earth.The breadwinner of this family the mother's son has already joined the wars along with a boorish neighbor who lives nearby. Well the boorish neighbor finally returns home alone and relates a doubtful story about the son getting ambushed and killed by vengeful farmers. It doesn't take very long for the fellow to take advantage of the bereft women's plight he assists the women on one of their murders cutting a better deal for himself with the blackmarket creep and commences making for the freshly widowed daughterinlaw. Who naturally jumps at the opportunity mourning is a luxury of civilization of which there's none in Kaneto Shindo's Onibaba.And so the situation intensifies the daughterinlaw starts sneaking out of their hut at night after the mother appears to be asleep in order to enjoy assignations with the lusty neighbor. It might as well be said here and now that for 1964 the sex scenes depicted in Onibaba were far ahead of their time even by the standards of foreign films. Breasts are bared the breathing is heavy and the flesh is sweaty. The mother meanwhile who has forbidden this relationship is very well aware of what's going on. She tries several ways to sabotage the nightly trysts telling the daughterinlaw that the neighbor is nothing more than a dog sniffing for a bitch in heat offering her OWN body to the neighbor she's immediately rebuffed threatening the daughterinlaw with stories of a Shin Buddhist version of Hell the mountain of needles the rivers of blood! reserved for those who give in to lust. All of this fails but then an unexpected opportunity arises when the mother unexpectedly meets a strange samurai wearing a demon mask that he refuses to remove from his face. . . .Such is the plot of Onibaba trans. Demon Woman though perhaps The Hole remains a better title for English speakers. Shindo shows us a vivid world in which civilization has deteriorated to barbarism. The huts in the grass hardly appear to be human dwellings seeming rather to be mere extensions of the wild grassy landscape. The women spend much of the day walking around with breasts bared  why bother about the niceties? Farming an advance in the evolution of human society has been rendered pointless due to the depredations of the warriors who are pointlessly fighting each other. Thus the women's slaughtering of stray samurai is an outgrowth of a general regression. Human life is cheap  worth about two bags of millet to be exact. The primary motivation of each character is unadorned survival. Food sleep and procreation are the drivers. Indeed this explains the mother's desperate attempts to keep the daughterinlaw at home with her survival would be that much harder for her if the daughterinlaw throws her over for a new life with the neighbor. But whileOnibaba is about survival it's also about how sex is the very touchstone of survival. The lustful trysts of the young couple are contrasted with the older woman's agonized diminishment of sexual capability the body withers but  cruelly  desire remains. Shindo gives us a stark symbol of this when the mother after a bit of voyeurism clutches a denuded barren tree trunk her only son is dead and no future fruit can be harvested.The most pervasive symbol of the movie's concerns is of course that big gaping hole amidst the hairy grass. It serves to connote both the endless hunger of a bottomless mouth and the mindless procreation of savages. Shindo is as adroit as Shakespeare cf. King Lear in depicting a certain nausea when it comes to the genitive organ of the female. It's no coincidence that the mother finds the tool of her tragedy within that hole nor is it a coincidence that she hysterically claims to be a human being in the film's final shot as she leaps over the pit. In this movie death would be a mercy. Survival meanwhile is nonnegotiable. Whew!  some fairytale eh? 9 stars out of 10.".

I ordered the Criterion Collection edition DVD and watched it last night. While nowhere near as scary as The Exorcist this film still managed to make me feel unnerved in that subtle sort of way that Japanese horror films seem to excel at.LIGHT SPOILERS AHEADThe movie follows a middle aged woman and her daughterinlaw living in feudal Japan. The son of the woman is out fighting in a war and they await his return living day to day. In order to survive the two women ambush samurai unlucky enough to venture through the tall grass surrounding their hut and trade the armor and weapons for food and any other necessities. The bodies are dumped into a hole in the earth afterwards. Hachi a man who had left to war with the woman's son returns with news that the son had been killed in an attack. Without a second thought he immediately begins to court the son's wife caring little of their loss. The daughterinlaw resists at first but the two begin to carry on a moonlight affair when she sneaks out of the hut to see him. The older woman gets jealous scheming to sleep with Hachi herself. But things take a strange turn when the older woman is visited by a war deserter wearing a mask he refuses to take off.I don't want to give away anymore of the movie but what I liked about it was its overall frankness. The emotions in this film are very raw and handles human sexuality in a way that I found pretty surprising given the year that this film was released. The pace of the film is slow and everything unravels at its own speed but I think that's what makes the last half of the movie so good. While the film isn't the scariest thing I've ever seen I felt this crawling in the pit of my guts while watching it that grew and grew as the movie progressed onwards especially at the arrival of the masked war deserter. It's a simple yet complex tale with a satisfying ending that I think I could safely recommend. The horror aspect of the film works more on a psychological level and doesn't rely on cheap shocks and scares to get you. I thought the music was very good and the black and white photography used in the film creates images that are sure to stay burned in your mind after you watch it. There are scarier horror films that have come out of Japan but I think this one fits in neatly alongside them. If you're looking for something dark moody and unsettling I strongly recommend this film.RATING  out of .".

The story is pretty simple a woman and her daughterinlaw eek out an existence during a warring medieval Japan by murdering lost or wounded samurai and selling their belongings. Then a male neighbor escapes from his conscription and returns home inciting lust jealously and suspicion. Ooh.I can't help but say that I was disappointed in the film. But it has a lot of merit to it. First of the all the black and white photography is absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing. The soundtrack is also really impressiveI liked it a lot although it might just be my avante garde background speaking for me. But on top of this I wasn't particularly impressed. I found myself yawning through the film even though I fully understood what the film was about and why it was going about doing what it was doing.I can't say it's because I prefer Hollywoodstyle film and stories. God knows that I've watched and loved my fair share of films from all over the world. This film however with its slow exploration of sexuality was rather uninteresting. Maybe because there was nothing surprising about it? Maybe because I saw nothing I didn't expect? Outside of the aforementioned photography and soundtrack. I think I'd also have to admit that the editing was pretty neat at times. I think the problem with the film for me is that it doesn't sufficiently build up its characters enough for me to care whether there's lust or not and whether there's anything really at stake when it's started or stopped. I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. And so there really was nothing but an exercise in filmmaking set before my eyes. Yes good craft but the matter of the film reminds me of one too many film school shorts that I've seen.Points for the artistry but boo on the storytelling. I can see why people might like it but it certainly didn't work for me. 610.".

The girl is clearly just sexmad after being cooped up with her  motherinlaw and would jump on any man she found  although strangely Hachi keeps his big white Japanese mannappies on throughout. The whole idea of the nearby pit the two women use to dispose of the bodies being a source of ancient evil is left completely unused and despite the demon mask being very scary it's not at all effective because we know exactly who is behind it.However just as I was beginning to get seriously bored of the whole 'horny lass running through corn sees demon and runs home screaming' affair two deliciously unpleasant fates befell two of the unsavoury lead characters.

A vast amount of the film's problems stem from the overdrawn and rather lengthy amount of time it takes for anything remotely resembling a horror film to take place. While setting the stage for the lifestyle the two live in and how they're going about it together the fact that very little actually happens for a good part of the film as it's nothing more than scenes of them working in the fields or pilfering items in order to resell them later on until the other guy gets involved in their lives. The introduction of that stranger and the burgeoning sexual intrigue that he sparks following that arrival makes for some nice dramatic moments where they spend time trying to deal with his appearance and what that means for the girls which gives this one quite a dark and dreary pacing yet doesn't really do much in terms of making the film creepy or chilling at all with the endless amount of time spent not doing anything that drives that forward. While it provides this with some nice nudity and sets up the idea that their sinful lives are finally catching up to them That all changes here in the final half where it drops a lot of these pretensions and goes fullforce into plenty of supernatural horrors which has a lot of redeeming qualities featured in their coming facetoface with the cursed masked man running around the countryside who comes into their lives and forces all their hidden feelings to come to the surface in screaming intensity. Full of suspenseful fare including the striking first appearance of the masked figure walking in the reeds and appearing in front of the couple through the trees and returning to their hut it becomes rather chilling with the demonic corruption turning them against each other and bringing on the full realization of its deadly curse against the girls with the demonmasked figure returning to attack them at the end which is quite fun with the way it gets to the chasing and tormenting that occurs in the swamplands around the hut that have this one ending on a highnote. The other bit that really works here is that titular mask worn that is incredibly chilling and looks appropriately scary when it's seen in action floating through the reeds lit in the dark which enhances the creepiness factor in this one that remains one of the most striking and impressive figures in the film. These here are what really help this one even though it's still quite flawed.Rated UnratedR Nudity Language and Violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the resurgence of the horrorthriller genre in recent years writers and directors have started to utilize a number of locations and situations that have proved unsettling in real life to be the center point for a film. P2 is one of those films. Who among us hasn't felt a little uncomfortable in a empty dark parking garage with no one in sight to call out to if there is a problem? P2 proves to be an effective if not exactly original thriller that does a good job of keeping the audience on the edge of its seat.Angela Rachel Nichols is a workaholic who is trying to get out of the office on Christmas Eve to reach her sister's home where the family is waiting on her. After having to complete a lastminute task she finds herself one of the last people to exit the building's parking garage. However her car won't start and she seeks help from the garage's nighttime security Thomas Wes Bently. Although he appears to initially be helpful it is quickly obvious that he is a little off. When Angela determines that the building is locked she returns to the parking garage for help where Thomas subdues her and then chains her to a chair in his office dresses her in a revealing outfit and plans to spend a pleasant Christmas eve dinner with her. Angela quickly realizes that Thomas is determined to prove that he is the perfect man for her but his methods are on the homicidal and creepy side he threatens her with his dog causes her to call her family and tell them she isn't going to make it and threatens her with physical violence. She eventually escapes his immediate grasp and a chase through the garage ensues that takes a number of different turns.P2 isn't an ambitious film to be sure. However it crafts this simple premise into a generally unsettling experience. P2 is largely driven by the performance of Wes Bently in the role of Thomas. Bently is at first glance an amiable guy. He seems awkward and a bit shy but he eventually reveals himself to be delusional and lacking much in the way of conscience. At the same time he actually manages to make Thomas a somewhat sympathetic individual tapping into feelings of loneliness and alienation. Thomas in the end is certainly a deranged individual but Bently manages to make him more than just that.Rachel Nichols is competent in the role of Angela providing us with the appropriate reaction of someone trapped in an ever evolving nightmare. Angela wavers between anger false sympathy for Thomas and fear. It isn't a demanding role but she delivers as necessary.P2 doesn't pull many punches in the violence department. There are several grisly scenes including one involving a fingernail that will put those with a weak constitution on the edge of their seat. Unlike a recent raft of PG13 horror films P2 doesn't pretend to not know what some percentage of its audience wants to see.If P2 falls a little bit it is in the fact that this film is something of a variation on a theme from other recent thrillers so once it has played most of its cards you can find yourself generally able to determine where it seems to be heading. There is still plenty of tension fulfilling its primary mission but not without traveling some paths that have already been well trodden.".

P2 on the other hand has many exciting moments and I was engaged the whole way through. The acting is solid. The actress who plays the lead does a great job at conveying real terror. I also like that she wasn't the typical bigbreasted female lead who seems ripped from the pages of Maxim magazine. She is attractive yes but not your traditional Hollywood beauty who's cast simply so she can have a scene where she's taking a shower and has to flee from the villain naked with her gargantuan boobs bouncing in closeup. I loved Wes Bentley in American Beauty and was quite disappointed to find out that he fell off the radar after delivering that great performance as Ricky Fits. He would only pop up occasionally in braindead slasher flicks like Soul Survivors. In P2 he was given a chance to redeem himself and that he did. He is a perfectly creepy villain especially with those dark piercing eyes. The movie is not without flaws. It has some of the expected fake scare moments and without giving anything away let's just say that I'm SURE it would take less than 20 minutes for the cops to show up after you make a 911 call. The filmmakers do a great job at setting up a creepy tone starting off the film by playing Santa Baby over the opening credit sequence. That's ten times creepier than say playing a standard horror movie score. If you're sick and tired of many of the braindead teen slasher flicks that have been hitting theaters lately this should come as a refreshing surprise. I think this film is sadly underrated.".

	schema:reviewBody "So P2... it looks like it would be a crap movie. But it's actually pretty good. I KNOW!!! Coming from an art background and as an avid fan of suspense and horror films I found this film was pretty smart and responsible. Rachel Nichols performance was really good and the scenario plays out believably while avoiding a plethora of gender stereotypes as well as confrontational stereotypes.The characters are interesting and dynamic is great. From their first interactions and the interplay between them it's clear how involved the process was in trying to capture those moments.As far as the story goes it's a pretty standard fair for a suspense thriller type of film. What makes this one work is the consideration given to selling the moments truthfully and keeping scenes honest. Right down to the end of the film. Wes Bently is a really gifted actor his performance was candid truthful and filled with a lot of well expressed anxiety and isolation. But never really expressed vocally but it's always present in his character. Rachel Nichols is straight aces with her exploration of her characters pensive and diplomatic displacement in the situation she finds herself in. These two carry the film. The only problem I had was that one character was never really at the center and I really wanted to know more than what I was being provided. I think some more time with either Bently's or Nichol's characters could have made a world a difference in really attaching us to them. I would say more so for Bently's security guard... he has an implied backstory but I wanted to see more... how he functions outside of his job a little.Something that really divides Seven from all it's other ripoffs and variations is the focus on the subtle specifics of Mills and Somerset's world how definite and impractical their ethics are in the environments they inhabit. And then how liberal and apathetic they are when faced with John Doe's absolute nature. This dynamic is that missing ingredient from P2. You're not really given an identifiable attachment to either of the core characters.But overall a movie I greatly underestimated... This film does deserve a good look but don't expect it to be something like The Eye or Skeleton Key. It's a much richer and culturally considerate tapestry than films of that ilk but isn't rich enough to be a classic like Seven. It's a good film that I am sure didn't fully get it's dues.".

	schema:reviewBody "P2 was recommended to me by a friend who really loved it. I looked it up and it seemed interesting enough and right away I was ready to watch the movie whenever I got the chance. Well when it started off I was immediately interested. The film starts off pretty strong as you see Angela Rachel Nichols getting ready to go home for the holidays. However the obsessed Thomas Wes Bentley has plans of his own as he invites Angela for a nice little dinner with him. All in all things go horribly wrong for Angela as she ends up trying to escape the maniac's clutches.This film for me had quite a lot of new material such as I loved the way Jim died for it was a fresh cunning death. Some other things I also enjoyed were the dog chase scene which I found really intense and I liked how even though Bentley's character became quite moronic at times he never actually stopped being intimidating. The film itself had nice suspense too. However the movie's clich level is what really drags it down a few points There were just some things I found so unnecessary and predictable to the point where it wasn't enjoyable at times. It does get a bit mediocre and of course it's no masterpiece.Overall though P2 was a very entertaining and exciting movie to watch. I thought both Nichols and Bentley gave pretty good performances and while the movie isn't the best of the best it's worth the watch.".

I knew what I was going into so I wasn't expecting very much. What I got out of it was even less.The setting for the film was the only thing intriguing. The acting wasn't very good the 'psycho' in this is beyond annoying...and a lot of what he says just doesn't make sense. Yes he's supposed to be crazy but come on! The heroine was decent in her performance attractive I must say. But the story was just downright silly the movie could've been done in a half hour. And if that's the case its obvious that the script needs to be tightened up. This is indeed the case as I couldn't help but think that the makers were just adding a lot of filler so the film would last at least 90 minutes. The heroine could've gotten out of her predicament a few times the first time almost immediately as she's FREED from a chain around her leg but she's too much of a wuss to really do anything about it. There's the obligatory gore here most of it out of taste. I wasn't disgusted but more disappointed that they stooped to that level of cartoonish violence. The fingernail scene was just ridiculous they had to think that would've been cool and just threw that in there.P2 is your typical runofthemill horrorthriller that's just not a very good film at all.

This movie is all about a woman who gets kidnapped by a security guard in the parking garage of the building she works in. Good story right? Wrong. There is nothing about this movie that is suspenseful or thrilling. Every move is predictable. There is not a hint of good acting. The movie tries to be funny when you don't want it to but then on the other hand some scenes where they are trying to be serious are laughable. There were many scenes where i found myself laughing at the obvious things that were overlooked. There was a scene where a character walked right over a cell phone and did not see it. This is just an example of how bad this movie is. There are so many scenes where i just went....wait they are serious. I want to go to the people who made this and tell them not to release this and get publicly embarrassed.

	schema:reviewBody "The ambiguously named P2 attempts to do for parking garages what Psycho did for showers and while Hitchcock certainly didn't direct this one Franck Khalfoun's debut feature manages to provide plenty of high tension in part thanks to the involvement of Alexandre Aja pun intended and gory scares. Wellpaced and chillingly violent there's nothing like a good Christmas thriller in November.Workaholic Angela Bridges Rachel Nichols gets stuck at the office late on Christmas Eve and her night goes from bad to worse to horrifying when she discovers the awkward parking lot security guard Thomas Wes Bentley has taken her hostage in the underground garage with a night of devious torture planned. With no help in sight Angela must survive his mind games and attempt to escape the labyrinthine prison of parking level P2 and P3 and P4.Setting itself apart from the countless thrillers sporting faceless and personalitylacking villains P2 introduces us to an inventively sadistic psychopath with Security Guard Thomas. Played with delusional finesse by Wes Bentley the maniacal antagonist provides an equal amount of terror and comedy with his offkilter comments and murderous tendencies. Recalling killers from Norman Bates to Stuntman Mike the deranged kidnapper never seems aware of just how unbalanced he is and offers heavy irony with his bloodshed. Thomas has a way with insanely honest words bringing out the contrariness that he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong and therefore unable to comprehend why his victims retaliate.Rachel Nichols also lends herself to a seldom seen damselindistress one who falls into several clich circumstances without getting out in overly predictable ways. She displays a healthy mix of panic and bravery commendably shying away from turning into the whining mess often witnessed in horror heroines. Intermittently helpless and aggressive Angela keeps the suspense sincere and also manages to fill her lowcut white dress more than adequately.While some of the events could be construed as predictable the opening title sequence perfectly illustrates the stupefying violence and apprehension that the rest of the movie is likely to reveal. With serene Christmas music being abruptly halted by the screeching of metal we are promised no deceptions as to what road the film will traverse. Some of the elements prove to be rather unfathomable for the average protagonist especially when Nichols is a bit too calm after her initial kidnapping when she must fight off an enraged dog and later when she takes the aggressor role with a fire ax  but P2 does handle suspense admirably.Considering the entire film takes place in one building after everyone has left the body count is considerably small but the violence to those few is remarkably gratuitous. To break up the senseless savagery is irony and a sadistic humor handsomely provided by the spontaneous Thomas. The contrast of his saying grace at dinner and attempting to convince Angela that he's trying to help adds to his comically twisted design.With a vastly creepy setting plenty of jump scares and nailbreaking suspense P2 is crafted to appeal to those who like their thrill rides covered with anxiety and blood. Even with the occasional unlikely event or predictable moment P2 stays entertaining all the way through making this a decent fright flick just as long as you don't think about it too much afterwards.The Massie Twins".

The film tells the story of Angela who is working late on Christmas Eve. She is leaving for a get together with family when her car will not start. If that wasn't bad enough she is also locked in her work building. Angela is helpless and someone wants to help her. Someone wants to be with her. On Christmas eve Angela is held captive in the parking garage and wants to get out. She'll do anything to get out. Before going to the movie today i had read soso reviews saying that the film is predictable boring and unoriginal. Sorry but what horrorthriller film is original these days? The plot is not original by any means but it does have one thing that makes the film great and that is realism. The film is very much realistic and it's just one of those situations you could see happening to you or one of your friends. What also makes me love this film is that instead of getting some villain killer in a mask chasing some helpless girl you get a regular guy who in times you feel sorry for and a woman who is just like an everyday person. She is the heroine but at the same time remains the victim. She is smart for a character and has some very kick ass moments but she is still scared crying and nervous. The acting was good. It was a bit eh at parts but for the most part remained fine. Rachel Nichols shined in this film and really plays the character well. All you want her to do is go home to her family in the end. And Wes Bentley is superb in this film. Everybody says that his acting was bad in this film but i don't see that at all. He is so psychotic in the film yet acts like a friend at the same time. Other than that other characters were just extras. The film paces itself pretty good but in parts drags on and you're just thinking to yourself come on. The character development is good. You get to know the main character and you feel for her which is the main object. Not only that but also at times feel for the villain.Overall the film is great. There are flaws but seriously what film doesn't have flaws. It can't be perfect. So Good Characters Good story and just an edge of your seat thriller. If you can see this in theaters you should. Recommended. If you like High Tension you will like this film.810".

There are several cheap scares that get the crowd pushed back in their seats. I feel as though this movie was probably rushed when made. The movie probably could have been shot all in one night if it really wanted to be. Overall though there are some scares. I just think that this movie could have been made to be a lot more creepier than it was.".

	schema:reviewBody "P2 is about a young businesswoman Angela Bridges Rachel Nichols who finds herself working late on Christmas Eve in her New York city office building. The last one to leave the building she finds her car won't start. Parked on level P2 in the building's underground parking garage she runs into a security guard Thomas Wes Bentley who tries to help fix the car. After the failed attempt Angela is scrambling to try and make it home where her family is waiting for her. But when she becomes locked in the parking garage she finds herself in a fight for survival when Thomas a psychologically unstable man kidnaps her and intends to spend Christmas Eve with her... if she can stay alive through the night.While it may have a rather obscure title P2 is a pretty solid thriller that came about just in time for the holiday season. I enjoy Christmasset horror movies there's something gleeful about yuletide scares for fans of horror films and I typically tend to enjoy them P2 being no exception. And while the fact that it takes place during Christmas has nothing to do with the story whatsoever it gives the movie a little boost of something different. The film starts out at a steady pace and not much happens for the first thirty or so minutes and then afterwards things begin to kick in and the thrills and spills start up welcomely of course.Written by Alexandre Aja a French filmmaker who brought us High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes remake the story is something halfway original. It takes the typical struggle between a psychopathic man and a strongwilled woman and places it in an unusual environment which provides for some pretty unique occurrences and plenty of great opportunity. Parking garages are creepy places anyway with their lowceilings cement walls and dark and damp atmosphere  so why not set a horror movie there? After our protagonist is kidnapped the antics between her and the psychopath ensue and I felt that this was fairly wellwritten. The pacing has a few problems things would become extremely intense and then the movie would slow to almost a stop then kick in again which became a little tiring but it wasn't enough to kill the film for me.Rachel Nichols performs well in her first leading role here playing the strongwilled Angela and Wes Bentley is plays the quirky offbeat character it somewhat reminded me of his character in American Beauty just in a psychopathicmurderer form well. Both actors have talent and do well throughout the majority of the film although some moments do come off as a little campy  I'm sure the writing had a little fault with this too but it isn't a major problem. It's not a terribly gory film either. There are a few pretty nasty moments but they are for the most part few and far between. The atmosphere is damp and dark as a parking garage and the Christmas setting brought through with some Christmas tunes to play along with a few scenes is effective and neat. There are a handful of excellent and memorable scenes the carride murder scene and elevator being most clever. Most of the movie is what could be classified as a 'psychological thriller' in which Thomas is playing a catandmouse game with Angela. The ending is quite the kicker and I thought it was a good way to close the story.Overall P2 is an aboveaverage horrorthriller. It delivers enough thrills to keep the audience entertained and is wellwritten for the most part. The premise may not be terribly original but the main thing that this film has got going for it is it's unusual but effective setting that is made welluse of. I enjoyed the majority of this film and while it is a bit campy in moments overall it's a fun movie that horror fans should be advised to check out in conjunction with the holiday season. This will likely fall under my little list of mustsee Christmasthemed horror movies because it's one of the better ones. 710.".

Narrow corridors of light surrounded by blackness flickering neon bulbs ever vigilant surveillance cameras claustrophobic elevators and uncomfortable crawlspaces every aspect of the car park setting is cleverly used to breathe new life into tired material.Spirited performances from the film's two leads also help to gloss over the film's numerous plot holes and clichs Bentley is required to overact as though his life depends on it and obliges with an impressive noholdsbarred display of nuttiness in one hilarious scene he even gets to pretend he's Elvis!. Nichols also handles her role well scoring maximum points for her screaming running and ability to look unfeasibly hot in a flimsy dress worn for no other reason than to permit viewers a chance to ogle her impressive cleavage.Occasionally the material does get a little TOO predictable for its own good a couple of moments that attempt to deliver the 'surprise factor' fail spectacularly and the result of the climactic showdown between Angela and Thomas is telegraphed way too early closeups of leaking petrol and a sparking Taser can mean only one thing.... However with one particularly violent set piece guaranteed to shock all but the most desensitized of gorehounds and the constant distraction of Rachel Nichols' magnificent heaving chest I find it fairly easy to be forgiving about the film's weaker moments hence my possiblytoogenerous rating of 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "A business woman has to work late on Christmas Eve when she finally finishes and heads down to the parking garage her car won't start. She asks the parking attendant to help her but what she doesn't realize is that he is a deranged psychopath who has been watching her and wanting to be with her for quite some time now.I had pretty low expectations for this film after all it is set in a parking garage. Yet P2 surprised me not only was it suspenseful it had great performances and a pretty surprising amount of violence. With a lot of horrorthrillers these days they seem to skim out on the bloody violence but P2 uses it very well here. It's not overly done only used sparingly. When it is used it's gruesome which adds to the ick factor. P2 gets a thumbs up from me because of that.Wes Bently plays the parking attendant and he plays crazy very well. His calm demeanour is even more sinister than what a loud lunatic would be. He wants to be Rachel Nichols' friend desperately he is madly in love with her. In his sick and twisted way they needhave to be together. He is there to help her realize this and is willing to kill those who either get in the way or mistreat her. This takes us into our first death and one of the most gruesome parts of the film. For those that are squeamish they should look away because one characters gets beaten repeatedly and then some. I find myself liking Bently more and more with every film I see him in with the exception of Ghost Rider...ew.Rachel Nichols is the female lead she is suppose to be the clichd blonde bimbo in distress. P2 switches the tables around no longer are we stuck with a stupid character who falls over when they are running away from the killer. We are given a smart and determined business woman who is constantly showing off her cleavage. Yes this movie for some reason has put our heroine in a white dress that was most likely done to please the male audience. P2 isn't for everyone I'm sure there are dozens of things wrong with it. Such as why doesn't she simply pull the fire alarm just for starters. But the film did what it was suppose to do. Put a female in danger have a strange and sadistic murderer follow her and the film becomes a cat and mouse game. In the endless list of films that do this P2 is surprisingly well done. It's definitely underrated as many people seemed to have overlooked it. I wouldn't suggest you rush out and rent this today but if you were ever interested even a little bit check it out. That is if you've ever heard of it.".

This movie was terrible the script had to be written by a 7 year old and the acting was horrible. There were parts of the movie when I didn't know if I should laugh or be scared if there was any suspense to this movie at all. The lead character the security guy was a terrible terrible actor and played his role out like a whiny girl at times in this movie. I found myself looking around not sure what people around me were doing in the empty movie. So I figured I'd give it a shot and a comment here gave it a 10 out of 10. By no means was this a 10 out of 10 because at some parts I felt like I was watching a horror movie spoof where they make fun of other horror movies. I am not a harsh critic and don't point my finger and say that sucks!!. Never in my life have I thought about getting up and leaving a movie for the fact that I felt like I was going no where and it was an utter waste of time and money. There are very good thrillers out there ones that keep you on the edge of your seat ones that keep you guessing and ones that just mystify youThis one kept me on the edge of my seat because I didn't know if I should walk out or not. I am someone who does get scared and I am not afraid to say I was scared but I jumped at one point in this movie and thats it. A thriller should be jumpy and have you guessing whats going on a thriller should have you not expect whats going to happen next and P2 seriously did none of those for me. The only things that weren't predictable was what that security guard was going to say or do next because I swear everything was horrible improv. I never leave comments and I rarely go out of my way to do this stuff but please do not watch this movie save it for BEE movie or something that you will actually laugh a couple times. I was sickened at how bad this movie was and sickened that other people like it I would love to see this movie in the 3's because thats what it deserves. IF for some reason you don't follow this guide which is totally understandable I hope you come back and read this again and say wow he was right. I gave this a 2 stars out of 10 not out of hate or harshness to anything but I gave it a 2 only because they had to put a lot of time into making the movie....THAT IS ALL!!!".

You have seen it before and this brings nothing new to the genre.As with movies of this sort any person met before the main character is abducted by the madman will be killed along the way. Cars don't start cell phones don't work when you need them to. This one went with the NO SERVICE theme as opposed to the battery dead theme.The woman desperately tries to escape as with all similar movies and when she realizes at the end that their is no escape she kills the madman and then is able to walk out of the building.The movie is played seriously and has no intentional humor. It is honestly is very hohum and if you have seen more than 3 similar movies then you will be bored.Skip this one.".

	schema:headline " Decent if unspectacular cat 'n mouse horror thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Before P2 I never would have thought an underground car park would be a remotely interesting location for a horror film or indeed any film. These sorts of preconceptions are made to be broken though and P2 does a great job of first making its location interesting then ratcheting up the suspense and excitement for an overall pretty pleasing hour and a half or so. Set on Christmas Eve a committed career woman works late and finds herself unable to start her car. Things really start to go wrong when she encounters a strange young security guard and declines his offer of Christmas dinner driving him over the edge in doing so. This is pretty basic stuff a cat 'n mouse horror thriller that supplies enough shocks and tension to work bustling along at a decent pace with a reasonably likable protagonist and interesting villain. Wes Bentley is the crazy security guard here and he plays the role as if it fits him like a glove. Its a slick easy turn pulsing with low key weirdness and a whiff of latent savagery he lacks the sinister chops to become truly menacing but does succeed a a gripping presence. Rachel Nichols also does a good job harried demeanour mounting to affecting desperation she wrings out as much tension as she can and maintains sympathy throughout. Now you may be thinking at this point so the acting is OK and its a decent formula plot but how the devil does this thing get around being set in a car park? Well its a matter of smart direction and cinematography. Regular Aja collaborator Maxime Sendre gives the setting a grey and impersonal look a cold and unappealing place. Then he highlights the color painted signs on the otherwise white walls with different colours for each level the signs catch the eye a distraction from the monotony. Franck Khalfroun directs with a feel for the monotony the unwelcoming inhuman locale and its contrast with the action the increasingly dangerous and violent hurlyburly of the film takes on greater effect because of the grim setting the two characters standing out all the more just being alive. When you stir in the at times rather intense action altogether it works fairly well. The film does slightly overstay its welcome though. Its pretty thin stuff like most cat 'n mouse thrillers of this sort and it lacks the dynamic design inspiration or out and out uncontrolled craziness that such a situation requires to stay interesting. Sure things are exciting and there's a terrific shock scene around halfway through but after a while things do start to get repetitive and Wes Bentley's dialogue begins to slip into bathos. Essentially the film could happily have been shorn of 15 minutes or so and been a better experience when the end comes it isn't exactly a massive sigh of relief but the film is definitely starting to get long in the tooth. I was never exactly bored or displeased but in the final third or so I was peering at the run time once or twice. Still little faults aside this is good fun stuff and I'd recommend it not a classic but certainly solid.".

He's a complete loner who's so detached from society and everyone in it that he thinks he can kidnap a woman and make her love him by killing people who have wronged her. Seeking humanization from some we objectify others. It's a point a good horrorthriller could have made well. This though isn't a good anything.

As you must know by now Oshima tackles in this film the forbidden subject of homosexuality among Samurais.The movie's premise and this is a bit of an understatement... unleashed controversies and protests in some Japanese traditional quarters  taboo indeed What about American cowboys too ? Officially all white heterosexuals ?  Yeeeah right... But I would argue that somehow the homosexual act itself  is not the film's core subject  its characters discuss it quite openly we are nowhere near the sniggering comedies of the West the politically correct heavy handed lessons of Hollywood or the louche coded homoerotic European art films. This ...is a Japanese movie  about beauty vs. discipline selfdenial and ideals internal conflict and tragic resolution. Homosexuality here does not equate limp wristed  camp  victimised diffidence and other suchlike cliches from the start we are shown that Kano is a ruthless killer and a master swordsman.What disturbs and gradually destroys the supremely rigid order of the Samurai militia is Kano's personal aura his apparent ! frailty this unnerves these iron hard warriors the story of which is cleverly presented in a twopronged attack by Nagisa Oshima. On one hand the master director plays it seriously insisting on very static set pieces where seated immobile Samurais discuss sex and murder without flinching on the other Oshima introduces elements of pure comedy....The name Shakespeare crops up more about that later. Firstly this is a very formal film  static slow constructed welldefined about structures to be respected upon penalty of death codes of honour such as sexual  official initiation by geishas or ethical  no betrayal of the group hierarchical Which school do you belong to ? they ask of each other etc.. In a weird way Takeshi's own facial halfparalysis serves the purpose of the film. Not to mention Kano's immaculate white attire as opposed to the black armours all around. But on the other hand there are elements of comedy. The old unassuming guy who Kano meets turns out to be an officer ...and also a clumsy swordsman joke fight scene the colossus assigned to take the youth to a brothel sends the wrong signal Er... don't ! he reminds himself and so on. After a while the story almost turns into a whoddunit except this time it's physical attraction we're talking about  which one of these hard men beneath the surface has not secretly fallen for Kano ? I mentioned Shakespeare earlier  I saw this film with some Japanese young ladies who confessed afterwards that  without the subtitles they wouldn't have understood the language  old Japanese. But I am also thinking of the juxtaposition of levels  comedy and drama love and ethics saucy overtones ...and the ineluctability of tragedy to unfold. It's pretty clear that the alleged lover Tashiro is not in fact and that he will serve the hand of fate  sublime last scenes. Finally for all lovers of Japanese cinema it's fun to spot Takeshi's mates who usually feature in his trademark ultraviolent  Zen nihilistic gangster movies  they're all here under various fabulous wigs. If you liked this film you'll love Claire Denis's Beau Travail that was the best film of 2000.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even after seeing this movie more than 20 times it still draws me in. Some of the best actors in Japan take part in this flim most noticeable is Beat Takeshi. The story line is simply jaw dropping. This is the type of film that Hollywood probably wouldn't even dare make.  To me the subject matter isn't shocking but I've spent time in Japan and studied their language and culture extensively but some people are offended by this.  Simply because they cannot get past the little detail that these strong powerful men can have gay tendencies.The movie follows Kano Sozaburo as he joins the Shinshigumi feudal era police. Also not here that most of the main characters except Kano and Tashiro are based off actual historicalfamous people. As Kano joins the rank his beauty and sword skill captivate the men around him from the other new recruit to the top ranking officers.  Suddenly people begin to die murdered in the night. Any more will give away the story.IF you get the chance to see this movie do.

	onyx:emotionText "Even after seeing this movie more than 20 times it still draws me in. Some of the best actors in Japan take part in this flim most noticeable is Beat Takeshi. The story line is simply jaw dropping. This is the type of film that Hollywood probably wouldn't even dare make.  To me the subject matter isn't shocking but I've spent time in Japan and studied their language and culture extensively but some people are offended by this.  Simply because they cannot get past the little detail that these strong powerful men can have gay tendencies.The movie follows Kano Sozaburo as he joins the Shinshigumi feudal era police. Also not here that most of the main characters except Kano and Tashiro are based off actual historicalfamous people. As Kano joins the rank his beauty and sword skill captivate the men around him from the other new recruit to the top ranking officers.  Suddenly people begin to die murdered in the night. Any more will give away the story.IF you get the chance to see this movie do.  For some it may be hard to get all the details and understand the little intricacies involved and the ending may confuse some especially if you are just going off what the subtitles say. But give it a chance it's a wonderful film but not for everyone and not for the whole family ";

	schema:headline " Go see Gohatto";
	schema:reviewBody "Oshima's first film in 14 years after illness was apparently directed from a wheel chair and it's tempting to locate some of its static formal qualities in the personal restrictions faced by the director. But this cool intense and very Japanese piece is stylistically rooted in the country's cinematic past while at the same time offering provocative work familiar characteristic of this director. In his most famous film Realm Of The Senses aka Ai No Corrida made 25 years ago dangerous sexual activity was explicit. In Gohatto trans Taboo things are far less in the open. The expression of sex has been replaced with its obsession although for Oshima the irrationality of arousal still remains antiauthoritarian as it creates impulses that are hard to resist. For those more used to the straight samurai of old Oshima's suggestions of cuddles beneath the kimono is a surprise more outrage was generated in Japan where it was felt more strongly that such suggestions ran against a proud tradition. One can never imagine stouthearted Toshiro Mifune the most famous cinematic samurai from the previous generation falling for another soldier and interrupting his role in Seven Samurai for a romp in the dojo. Cult actordirector 'Beat' Takeshi here playing Captain Toshizo Hijikata seems at first sight an odd choice for this sort of drama too until one remembers the gay gunman he played so convincingly in Takashi Ishii's Gonin 1995. With his impassive face he reduces introspection to the reoccurring flicker of his real life tic which most aptly here can suggest everything and nothing. Hijikata's internal narrative first quizzical about Sozabura's lovers then perturbed about his effect on the garrison suggests growing doubts resolved only in the final memorable scene. In Gohatto much of the interest of the film lays in the degree in which Sozaburo's beauty arouses the interest of the men around him. Some are openly attracted to him notably Tashiro who shortly attempts to climb into the bed with him. Others are on the edge like Inspector Yamazaki charged with taking him to the brothel in Shimabara to introduce the youth to women. Most are affected in one way or another most enigmatically are Hojikata and his superior and close colleague Commander Kondo Yoichi Sai. As Hojikata observes a samurai can be undone by a love of men. But then he wonders too Why are we both so indulgent with Sozabura? and Kondo's rectitude and conspicuous silence hides we suspect a greater interest in the youth than he might wish to admit. Oshima's visual scheme creates a film full of the bare dark wood interiors of the militia base and the mud brown of uniforms where just a few significant colours stand out. During the early beheading of the renegade samurai by Sozabuta it is the red splash of the executed man's blood. At other times Sozabuta wears a unique white robe the Japanese colour of death. His is a presence and beauty shortly associated with a form of annihilation. In a place full of military men that we see this feminine youth kill most often is no surprise. Compared to his contemporaries he is the most adept at the sword unless fazed by romantic entanglements. It's an obvious irony that the object of homosexual affection is also the most deadly of the men there's more in the fact that a group of ironhearted soldiers can be so easily divided by an 'enemy' within one neither fierce nor commanding. There's another mystery in Gohatto besides who exactly is sleeping with Sozabuta and who wants to. It's who is the murderer of Yuzawa Tomorowo Taguchi and doubts as to the truth of the case persist. This and the attempt to apprehend the intruders at the base they call these samurai? provide the main impetus of the plot. Like so many great Japanese films of the past Oshima's says a lot in restraint. Here the arrangement of seated figures within the frame can suggest unspoken tensions order is paramount and the use of the camera is elegant and discreet. Some see the resulting style dull when it is a slower more contemplative way of seeing the world one where not every question is answered. What exactly is 'taboo' in Gohatto is clearly the issue of homosexuality  although confusingly for Western audiences such matters are not explicitly forbidden. Reference is made to the military code which hangs on the barrack walls. Extracts appear on screen too but no mention is made of prohibiting gay relations between soldiers. A man may be beheaded for illicitly borrowing money but sleeping with his comrades at arms while gossip worthy is only really of concern when discipline is threatened. There no secrets on Heaven and Earth and everyone knows it says one of the intertitles and Hojikata himself refers to the tacit understanding which normally keeps things in check. A policy which roughly equates to the modern American army's own Don't ask don't tell. The film is helped immensely by Ryuichi Sakamoto's incessant metronomic score the steady beat of which considerably amplifies the obsessions and drawn out tensions of events. Like Oshima's interiors it is uncluttered music the muted colours dashed with an occasional significant tone. Now and again urgency and violence break into this world the initial beheading scene the murderer's attacks or the sword battle by the river. As a package the result readily deserves art house admirers  especially as the director saves the best scene for last expressing both Hojikata's final position and a main thread of Gohatto with hardly a cut more than necessary. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nagisa Oshima's work is always visually exquisite.  He has that finely honed generationsold Japanese eye for detail which has served his artistry well over the last 50 years.  It reveals itself to be the difference in the world of film that a Monet Michelangelo or Van Gogh is to sidewalk chalk drawings.Decades ago Oshima set out explore new territories to leave formula and standard approved plot progressions behind and delve into the deeper recesses of the human experience.  What comes out of that are works of storytelling which require more attention and involvement on the part of the viewer than your typical Michael Bay or Renny Harlin flick.  Not that pure escapist entertainment is a bad thing far from it.  But you don't generally come away from one of those features wanting to go sit at a table with your friends staying up to the wee hours discussing what you've just seen and all the ramifications of each scene.  In simpler terms they don't enrich your intellect!  I think even Bay?s and Harlin?s most ardent fans can agree with me on that part   .Gohatto is the Japanese word meaning Taboo in its simplest form so you know going in your about to see something out of the ordinary.  Oshima has long had a fascination with the dichotomies in Japanese culture and frankly most cultures between how behavior is proscribed and how the more primal instinctual urges mostly sex always find their way to the surface in spite of those mores.  Oshima has also found a fascination in seeing how both Western and Eastern cultures have at one time or another or more than one put strict moral taboos on homosexuality adultery and even on prostitution but these strictures have never eliminated or even slowed down their existence.Gohatto takes us into a world 150 years ago where such things don't exist on the surface but are fully integrated into what is real life just beneath. Whether such subject matter or exploring Eastern cultures particularly interests you or not if you're interested in being challenged by the art that you see Gohatto like Peter Greenaway's recent The Pillow Book is a mustsee film.".

The story explores the homoerotic tensions between the men as well as the conflict with another militia group of samurai.In a way not much happens in the film but at the same time it is fascinating from beginning to end. Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano gives an impressive performance as one of the older samurai and in fact all the actors are very good.While the overall atmosphere of the film is quite dark there are many funny moments which lift the mood. The humour is quite subtle  no slapstick here.The film is visually stunning with wonderful use of light and colour to emphasise the mood of each scene. The Japanese mountains lakes and buildings look gorgeous.There are some moments in the film which are quite graphic both sex and violence. However this is not done in a gratuitous or grotesque way and I didn't find it offensive.Overall as another reviewer has commented this film is somewhat cold. Despite the powerful events that happen in the film they don't really emotionally involve you as a viewer. The film almost feels like a parable rather than a 'realistic' story.In summary this is a gorgeouslooking film with an unusual subject matter which is well worth watching.".

And then I saw a more impressive actor... who turned out to be Kitano. Doh! The story of this was very interesting and I'm not sure how it'd go over in America. It explores homosexuality and it's relative openness in the samurai and is based around a handsome young man who a lot of men fall in love with. These men start turning up dead and a jealous member of the clan is suspected. The movie gets confusing at times but I think that is more because of a cultural difference than script downfalls. Kitano is brilliant in this one as the captain who seems to be struggling to hide his affections for the young man Ryuhei Matsuda as Sozaburo Kano. There are several branching storylines but they all lead back to the main one. Not a masterpiece of anything but more quality Asian cinema.".

And then I saw a more impressive actor... who turned out to be Kitano. Doh! The story of this was very interesting and I'm not sure how it'd go over in America. It explores homosexuality and it's relative openness in the samurai and is based around a handsome young man who a lot of men fall in love with. These men start turning up dead and a jealous member of the clan is suspected. The movie gets confusing at times but I think that is more because of a cultural difference than script downfalls. Kitano is brilliant in this one as the captain who seems to be struggling to hide his affections for the young man Ryuhei Matsuda as Sozaburo Kano. There are several branching storylines but they all lead back to the main one. Not a masterpiece of anything but more quality Asian cinema.";

	schema:headline " A riveting exquisite film about homosexuality in Edoperiod Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "Japan in the 1860's was in a tense political situation with the Shogunate and the Emperor in conflict over whether to trade with foreigners. Though the country was still mostly isolated the winds of change were in the air. Longstanding traditional institutions were withering away and soon the supremacy of the samurai would give way to that of the merchant.Nagisa Oshima's newest film TABOO GOHATTO examines this sociopolitical decline on a personal level. The film which was nominated for a Golden Palm at Cannes 2000 and won Best Film recognition at the St. Petersburg Festival of Festivals in St. Petersburg Russia is a truly riveting yet exquisite film about homosexuality among Edoperiod samurai. It is worth seeing for the simple streamlined beauty of its images and its potent drama.Kyoto Spring 1865. Hyozo Tashiro Tadanobu Asano a lowranking samurai from the Kurume clan and Sozaburo Kano Ryuhei Matsuda an effeminate 18yearold rich man's son join the Shinsengumi a conservative samurai military unit loyal to the Shogun. Deceptively demure at first the boy Kano quickly proves his acumen for killing when ordered to execute a wayward samurai. Tashiro struck by Kano's feminine beauty and odd power seduces him and they become butt buddies. Other men in the unit are also taken with Kano and soon their bodies start piling up murdered by a notaltogetherunknown assassin.The troop leader Isami Kondo Yoichi Sai and his secondincommand Toshizo Hijikata the famed actordirector Takeshi Kitano observe the situation and react to it differently. Kondo wants Sozaburo to pay with his life for his alleged transgressions while Hijikata who is as wise and merciful as can be within the samurai code of conduct adopts a waitandsee attitude.The most intriguing and surprising element in the film is how fairly tolerant of homosexuality the samurai leaders are up to a point. The two commanders even discuss the subject with bemusement. When it becomes clear that the passions are running just a little too hot and threaten the cohesiveness and then the very integrity of the unit then and only then is Hijikata galvanized into action. The last sequence of the film when he makes his decisive move is one of extreme grace and potent symbolism.Takeshi Kitano's performance is measured and calm. His character seems to have attained an inner peace that the others have not. Kitano puts a human face on a dutybound samurai. He previously acted in Oshima's 1983 JapaneseBritish coproduction MERRY Christmas MR. LAWRENCE playing a sarcastic sergeant in a Word War II P.O.W. camp who cracks jokes about homosexuality. Upon closer inspection TABOO shares some striking similarities with that film. Both films take place in a military setting and deal with homoerotic themes. The two films are also outstanding in their exploration of the endlessly conflicting aspects of Japanese culture prone to militarism and merciless brutality on one hand  aesthetically and spiritually attuned on the other. Oshima's images are colder more austere and subdued subdude? in TABOO than in MR. LAWRENCE but are also no less resplendent.".

	schema:headline " Morbid samurai film not about homosexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "Shogunera Japan. 1865. Young Kano Sozaburo is admitted to an elite samurai academy. As the twentieth century approaches Samurai traditions wane reformist forces busy knocking on doors.Taboo was directed by Nagisa Oshima a director renowned for the sexually explicit Realm of the Senses. Because of this some have claimed that Taboo is another film about sexuality specifically Sozaburo's homosexuality Sozaburo isn't gay but this isn't quite true. Sozaburo with his androgynous features navigates Oshima's film like a vacant object of desire. In Lacanian theory he'd be typically termed an objet petit a whose mere appearance prompts the need for some secret to be explained. But though he's a beautiful man and obviously quite skilled as a swordsman every student and superior at the academy finds themselves vying for Sozaburo's affections not because of what Sozaburo is or possesses but because of what they project onto him. Love then is revealed to be defined by the imagination more akin to a fetish. This is typical of Oshima. Oshima's aesthetic seductions then become Sozaburo's the film tricking you into partaking in an array of obsessions before it reveals how all these attractions to Sozaburo are exploitative at worst unconscious narcissistic impulses at best. These affections range from courtly love to longings from afar to mutual beneficial attractions to outright rape and a bevy of other complex relationships but in each case the point is the same. They are taboos because permission is never sought.The Taboo of the film's title is thus not homosexuality and Oshima practically says this blatantly in interviews. Indeed homosexuality was openly accepted in the Imperial militia. The taboo is violence with primacy given to psychic or metaphysical violence. This is what prompts Sozaburo to seek physical revenge. On one hand he's your archetypal mysterious vengeful stranger with a hidden past on another he's taking a vow to pay back the world for its taboo of aesthetics of its surfaces and pretense. For Sozaburo love and the appreciation of beauty in general is a veiled violent thing. Love is a primordial act of violence the privileging of one object at the expense of another. Indeed Sozaburo a deeply embittered and scarred man is able to bait men precisely because he now views love as a barren transaction of signs he becomes the male version of past Oshima heroes signs which he has now vengefully resolved to control in this regard observe how he refuses to cut his hair his fringe has strong cultural connotations in Japanese culture. Of course Sozaburo's contempt while not necessarily wrong isn't the whole story. Pretense or pretending is paradoxically central to compassion the putting oneself in another's place the let's pretend impulse of children and art.Oshima then broadens the film such that life in the academy serves as a microcosm for late nineteenth century Japan. The film takes place during a period of time in which the shogunate had taken control of the nation from the emperor. The Shinsengumi a samurai militia serving the shogunate then began recruiting new members from the peasant class. You thus had a situation where peasants were essentially tasked with keeping peasants under control. As social order is subject to human urges such order obviously proved difficult. Typical of Oshima we then reach a bizarre ironic situation in which any indecency is permitted be it homosexuality or murder in order to maintain public decency. Oshima then clashes the highly aestheticized culture of Japan with Japan's brutal martial code of the warrior. In this regard Sozaburo becomes an aesthetic object an almost porcelain work of art who's beauty triggers a bevy of suppressed and twisted emotions in the psyche of Japanese culture. He lays bare poeticized violence symbolised through the film by cherry blossoms and cut trees.Incidentally because he suffered a stroke his second stroke after Taboo's release Oshima is unlikely to ever release another film. While Taboo is a major work by Oshima its aesthetic  call it mannerist poeticism  has been rendered kitsch by countless postMizoguchi postKurosawa postOzu etc filmmakers and countless samurai films and animemanga. Of course you can argue that this is precisely the point. With his silky kimonos his cherry blossoms his opulent sets Oshima is hoping to serve up a kind of samurai romanticism that gradually reveals itself to be hackneyed. It works theoretically rather than visually depending how familiar you are with samurai movies.8.510  See Claire Denis' Beau Travail. Two viewings required.".

The insouciant but deadly thread that Oshima weaves throughout the beautiful shades of 19th cent. Japan is all the more poignant as he seemed to singlehandedly bring a Japanese film icon's son into a profession he now seemed destined for. I've read that Ryuheisan was more interested in soccer than following his parents into acting and in likely teenage boy squeamishness actually turned down the role of Kano because it was a gay character Matsuda is straight and now married. Thank goodness he changed his mind because Oshima had hand picked a boy who held his own among multiple film greats in a way that I have never seen in a teenage actor of his generation...or in anyone since.The only summary I can give is 'exquisite'  a mustsee film in my opinion. And really the explicitly 'gay' scenes are not explicit at all and even the most butch heterosexual wouldn't be offended perhaps I'm being optimistic. This is a perfect movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're going to make a samurai film I propose that you should have either 1. an engaging plot with interesting characters or 2. lots of wickedcool sword fights or ideally both.  Gohatto has neither.  What it does have is cool outfits and lots of men looking at each other longingly both of which would be fine if it also had either of the two criteria listed above.After seeing this movie and Collage of our Life' in one weekend I'm starting to rethink by formerly high opinion of Ryuhei Matsuda.  Though it could just be the lukewarm performance by everyone else make his trademark 'malaise' outright bland.  Even Beat Takeshi who I thought would be perfect as Hijikata looked like he couldn't care less about what was going on. Just about the only character that has any personality is Tashiro Tadanobu Asano who disappears for about 23 of the film.  Everyone else is either a flat caricature Okita smiles a lot Inoue is old and inept or just plain flat.  Most of the film could have been done with finger puppets to similar effect.The plot is just as onedimensional.   The whole story takes place during the Bakamatsu one of the most interesting episodes in Japanese history. Does Oshima use this fascinating period as a poignant backdrop for his drama or at the very least an excuse for overdone swordfights to disguise the lack of a plot?  No we get these guys sitting around making contrived references that sound like they're dictating footnotes for a history textbook.  Other than that the bloody struggle to determine the future of Japan is totally irrelevant to the plot.  It could have taken place at an open minded country club.There isn't so much plot development as 'stuff happens'.  There a guy and someone dies and there's this other guy then it snows and they have dinner  quote history texts and pine over the prettyboy.  These haphazard events are tied together by such brilliant transitions as a black screen with the words Meanwhile' One month later' patience is rewarded'. Wow riveting stuff.  Why is Kanothecute such an efficient killing machine? What does he have against women?  How does that life threatening head wound heal without even a scab?  Who knows? There was one moment near the end when I went 'Oh that's kind of interesting' and even that little twist wasn't a big surprise.I'd have no problem with a low key psychological take on the Bakamatsu or homoeroticism among the Samurai if there was even one character in the whole movie I could have cared less about.  And even the homosexuality is lukewarm 'Gee.  I like the prettyboy gosh darn it'.  On the other hand the swordplay is beautiful in a somewhat authentic way not a Ryuhei 'Versus' Kitamura bloodfest way as are the swords themselves if you're into that kind of thing but they're too few an far between to cover for the flimsy story.  So there's really no reason to see this film at all no matter what kind of movies you like.  Unless you have a major interest in costuming and set design or simply must see some samurai manlove.".

I've read so many reviews of this film that express dissatisfaction with its ethereal vagueness. But that's kinda the point. People in Japan in 1860 or today for that matter don't generally see being gay as an identity but as an action or series of actions. Expecting the characters to somehow come out of the closet is a peculiarly western demand. Ambiguity of morals responsibility blame action are all pretty typical of Japanese cinema. Like pistachio ice cream it's not the flavor for everyone. Other reviews complain that Matsuda Ryuhei's looks are more bizarre than beautiful. Once again he looks Japanese. Zhang Ziyi in Memoirs of a Geisha is not what real Japanese people let alone idealized 19th century ones look like. This film really explores perversity. Not because of a bit of semigraphic sodomy but because almost everyone in the film loses their moral compass over a pretty face. What makes it titillatingly icky is the fact that Matsuda Ryuhei was only 15 when this was filmed.".

The latter stages of the film which involves a hunt for the serial killer of homosexual samurai! provide a welcome touch of mystery and lead to an unexpected but wholly satisfying conclusion.".

The arrival of a young and beautiful trainee Samurai played by newcomer Ryuhei Matsuda sparks off a tale of jealousy and murder where everyone begins to suspect everyone else of the homosexual taboo.  Both sides of the subject are explored in depth Director Nagisa Oshima best known for the infamous Ai No Corrida deftly handles both the homophobic and homoerotic themes without resorting to any graphic or cliched images.The acting is superb throughout but once again it is the star Beat Takeshi who really shines.  For once he plays a very likeable and fatherly character second in command of their unit.  Instead of the frightening intensity that he brings to the cops and criminals that he is best known for here we see a different side of him his character is caring and kind and with a sense of humour.Whilst no Samurai film would be complete without some swordplay this is not an action film.  There are some scenes of training with Shinai bamboo swords and one brief battle scene against a rival clan.  But what there is is dynamic and fast and concentrates on realism.  Even Beat Takeshi gets to wield a sword and acquits himself admirably once again showing his versatility as an actor.

	schema:reviewBody "When I rented the movie I didn't have any idea about the plot other than it was about samurais and that Takeshi Kitano one of my favourites directors acted in it. Expecting to see an ordinary tale of japanese samurais I was very surprised to see what the movie was about and how the plot was developing. I had never expected anything like this. The homosexuality is played with naturality and with honesty. I read an article saying that Nagisa Oshima is the only who could make Taboo. Maybe is true. This is the sort of movie Hollywood won't make. In the end I am not really convinced about this movie. By the way the soundtrack even tough is good it just doesn't go with the movie to me it is out of place. So I would say that even though I didn't like it very much in general I was glad to have been surprised by the unusual subject of the movie and by the honesty and naturality in which is told. My vote is 6 out of 10.".

Expecting to see an ordinary tale of japanese samurais I was very surprised to see what the movie was about and how the plot was developing. I had never expected anything like this. The homosexuality is played with naturality and with honesty. I read an article saying that Nagisa Oshima is the only who could make Taboo. Maybe is true. This is the sort of movie Hollywood won't make. In the end I am not really convinced about this movie.

Within days poverty forces the class troublemaker Zhang Huike to leave for the city to work. Minzhi possessed of a stubborn streak determines to bring him back.

As a matter of fact and in a clear statement of sort the whole cast of this movie are real and ordinary people.Zhang Yimou has gone the extraordinary miles to let reality tell the stories stories of the decline and poverty in parts of rural China of heartwrenching conditions for schools and education under such poverty of heartwarming spirit of happy lively and adorable children in Shuiquan school blissfully ignorant of their condition and of the 13 year old peasant girl Wei Mizhi's single minded determination for Not One Less.This movie is Zhang's daring experiment to use normal reality to tell reality and he has achieved convincingly his goal. All characters in this movie are real as in reality real. They are real because they have no means of being unreal and that is the whole point of using real people.Wei Minzhi's selfdisplay since I can not use the word performance here is what she is a 13 year old poor goodnatured nononsense single minded and tenacious peasant girl. She quickly learns to use her toughness to discipline or even bully her students. She seldom smiles but is actually a pretty good leader because of her nononsense and toughness and single mindedness. She is extremely tenacious and is obsessed with Not One Less.The blissfully happy 10 year old troublemaker and prospect kid migrant worker Zhang Huike's display is just so good that it is almost unreal. The village mayor is a natural real. Sun Zhimei the girl who lost Zhang Huike in the city is also as real as you can get.The people I really like in this movie are the three girl students who sleep in school Zhang Mingshan Jiao Jie and Ming Xinhong. Zhang Mingshan is just so pretty and adorable. She is also smart and is a student cadre. Jiao Jie has a such vivacious smile and has already some good business sense as she comes up with the moving brick idea and the cheating on bus ticket idea. Ming Xinhong loves to run and her fleeting smile in the car leaving for athlete training school is simply priceless.Ironically notwithstanding the poor condition in Shuiquan school I feel very warm and touched by the good spirit of the children. Shuiquan school is actually working and working quite well thanks to good teacher like Gao good village mayor like Tian and also to the student cadre system all of which are legacy of Mao's era. Just look at how smart creative and participating the students are in trying to solve the bus fair problem for Wei Minzhi you know something is very right in that school. One of the right things in that school is the student cadres like the pretty smart and caring Zhang Mingshan who's title is study commissar xuexi weiyuan usually the most responsible student in class and a teacher's favorite. We also see a boy student cadre in charge of morning military drill and flag raise ceremony.Wei Minzhi is most of the time an uncaring teacher except the issue of Not One Less which involves her pay. The one who real cares and helps out the class is the beautiful study commissar Zhang Mingshan. She writes out a student name list for Wei to do roll calls. When Wei sits outside letting trouble maker Zhang Huike reign free she tells Wei that it is her Wei duty as a teacher to do something. When Huike knocks the precious chalks off the ground she picks up these chalks and telling the tugging and struggling Wei and Huike don't step on the chalks. She even criticizes in her diary read out by Huike in class over her protests but at the insistence of Wei that Wei is not taking good care of chalks like teacher Gao would...A little girl living in poverty and in that utterly dilapidated school but still writes a caring dairy of what is going on in class something is very right.Unlike many other Zhang Yimou's movies which are persistently followed with complaint by Chinese audience for being tailored and catering to foreign taste and curiosity Not One Less is very well received in China. In a surprise reversal of Zhang's fortune with Chinese authority this movie has even been promoted as a propaganda material of sort by the Chinese government in its campaign for better rural education.".

This is anyway a delightful story for all the family hugely enjoyable simply and lovingly told and with just the most marvellous little Chinese girl imaginable! She has to stand in for the local schoolmaster who very definitely must go and visit his mother who is ill and dying. He leaves her in the middle of about twenty kids only a couple of years younger than herself to get on with the job as best she can so as to earn 50 yuan in a school which is falling apart.Now you might think that such a building could not possibly be a schoolhouse in remote rural China or anywhere else. I assure you I have seen such schools  and not in such remote areas  in Indonesia India Afghanistan and in what was Portuguese Timor. Even here in Spain in rural villages high up in the sierras my wife has worked in schools in little villages where either the floorboards were rotting under her feet in front of the blackboard or the plumbing did not work or the lights did not switch on when you wanted them to or the woodburning stove in the middle of the room gave off billows of smoke so that you had to open the windows  with 10C below zero outside or the window panes had no putty in them and so on. And this only a few years ago in a modern civilised European country.Minzhi Wei playing the part of Wei Minzhi who is herself with her own name in Chinese the surname is put first is a thirteen year old who will never make it to Hollywood but is just the most beautiful school mistress you could imagine! I will not say anything about the story you can see it for yourself. This young girl had to do it all  she is barely ever off the screen. Yimou Zhang has given us a little gem a beautiful story with such wonderful participation by all those children as well as the fine photography and Bao San's occasional accompanying music.How nice to see a lovely story so naturally told! Can't we do things like this in Europe and the USA without it being all violence or overladen commercialism for the hungry masses? Can't we tell a real human story without all the technological special effects? Can't we make honest cinema.?".

	schema:reviewBody "6 March 2000Not One LessIt's the first great film of this year for me. Not One Less' is storytelling at its dead straightest  most like the work of the contemporary Iranians Makhmalbaf and Kiarostami but also directly connected to the great Neorealists DeSica Rosselini and Bunuel. All revel in telling culturally specific stories that reflect universal human experiences that are resonant across all time and place. But as I sat there freshest on my mind was David Lynch's The Straight Story.' Both Lynch and Zhang take us on a small journey that reflects a world's worth of living. Both show us that harrowing experience and heroism seemingly small scale in their films can be writ in large and commanding script across the lives of ordinary people.Shi Xiangsheng's script is a rural fable based on his own story set in remote China Hebei  the dry high plains an undoubtedly stiffening existence. It's shot as beautifully as any of Zhang's films  he's a deft colorist one of the great painterly directors in cinema see Ju Dou' and Raise the Red Lantern'. The children are crimsoncheeked with complexions warmed and toasted by the unfiltered sun  but they will surely eventually become worn and parched like their elders Teacher Gao and Mayor Tian. We see an honest poverty here in great detail. The film's camerawork lets every detail seep into us allowing us to feel the film's atmospherics and making us thirst in its arid heat and dust. When the 26 children share 2 cans of warm Coca Cola after a long and hard day we too want to get in line for our sip.Thirteenyearold Wei Minxhi is dragged along by Mayor Tian to the village' s ramshackle oneroom schoolhouse to meet Teacher Gao. She is to become the school's substitute teacher for one month while Gao leaves to tend to his ailing mother. He can't in good conscience leave this child to shepherd his children but he is without a choice  it's the kind of hard rationalism that is part of everyday life here. Before leaving he counsels her sternly and provisions her with only a ragged lesson book and one stick and only one stick of chalk for every day he will be gone. He shows her the narrow bed in the adjoining room that she will share with 3 boarding students.Teacher Gao is an old man who has suffered a lot of dedicated and dictated poverty in order to improve the lot of his village's children. We come to know his commitment to his work even at this stage of his life when he warns her that conditions are hard in this village and that the vicissitudes of life weigh very heavily on the children here. When he says he has already lost 10 students you know he has felt the loss of every single one. He commands her to keep the body of his school together and that when he returns he wants to see every one of his students present  and not one less.Not One Less' is about young Teacher Wei's struggle to meet his simple challenge. We see immediately that she has more reluctance than skill or gumption for this task. But in a culture that expects obedience she has no recourse. And nowhere else to go. She is more like a sullen older sister than a teacher. And because they are children the students begin to test her a little. They aren't bratty kids just rambunctious and resistant to the discipline of schoolwork. She hasn't a clue about how to make them work so she just writes the lesson on the board and posts herself against the door barring any escape. Her handwriting is neat and orderly but as the film progresses we come to see that Teacher Wei is only a little more schooled than her charges.The great thing about Not One Less' is its unstinting perspective on the innocence and naivet that only a child lives in. Teacher Wei and these children are completely guileless without a window on the wide world and have none of the knowledge or calculation for the simplest complexities of modern life. The film's crisis is that the class troublemaker elevenyearold bumpkin Zhang Huike leaves unannounced for the city so he can earn money for his destitute family. Wei feels the absolute fear of her failure to keep her pledge and is desperate to go and find young Zhang. Figuring out how to get to the city to find him  for her and these children it might as well be a search for the Holy Grail. It seems as fraught with myth and legend. Yet she in her naivet is undaunted. Many schemes are attempted and when each fails she just begins walking having no idea how far it is or how long it will take her or what lies ahead when she gets there. She just knows she must find him.Her journey is the quest of her young life just as Alvin Straight's is the culminating quest of his life. It is a defining act for both. There are no earthshattering twists of plot to keep from you. It is the unfolding of a redemptive story a boldly honest portrait of a world away from our experience and a young girl's attempt to navigate it with all her will and perseverance and naivet  and only that  to sustain her. In the end we feel we have been somewhere we've never been before and perhaps learned something that we had long forgotten. It is the singular power of cinema to transport us this way to jack us directly into a net of experience we can feel so deeply in our hearts.".

Both show us that harrowing experience and heroism seemingly small scale in their films can be writ in large and commanding script across the lives of ordinary people.Shi Xiangsheng's script is a rural fable based on his own story set in remote China Hebei  the dry high plains an undoubtedly stiffening existence. It's shot as beautifully as any of Zhang's films  he's a deft colorist one of the great painterly directors in cinema see Ju Dou' and Raise the Red Lantern'. The children are crimsoncheeked with complexions warmed and toasted by the unfiltered sun  but they will surely eventually become worn and parched like their elders Teacher Gao and Mayor Tian. We see an honest poverty here in great detail. The film's camerawork lets every detail seep into us allowing us to feel the film's atmospherics and making us thirst in its arid heat and dust. When the 26 children share 2 cans of warm Coca Cola after a long and hard day we too want to get in line for our sip.Thirteenyearold Wei Minxhi is dragged along by Mayor Tian to the village' s ramshackle oneroom schoolhouse to meet Teacher Gao. She is to become the school's substitute teacher for one month while Gao leaves to tend to his ailing mother. He can't in good conscience leave this child to shepherd his children but he is without a choice  it's the kind of hard rationalism that is part of everyday life here. Before leaving he counsels her sternly and provisions her with only a ragged lesson book and one stick and only one stick of chalk for every day he will be gone. He shows her the narrow bed in the adjoining room that she will share with 3 boarding students.Teacher Gao is an old man who has suffered a lot of dedicated and dictated poverty in order to improve the lot of his village's children. We come to know his commitment to his work even at this stage of his life when he warns her that conditions are hard in this village and that the vicissitudes of life weigh very heavily on the children here. When he says he has already lost 10 students you know he has felt the loss of every single one. He commands her to keep the body of his school together and that when he returns he wants to see every one of his students present  and not one less.Not One Less' is about young Teacher Wei's struggle to meet his simple challenge. We see immediately that she has more reluctance than skill or gumption for this task. But in a culture that expects obedience she has no recourse. And nowhere else to go. She is more like a sullen older sister than a teacher. And because they are children the students begin to test her a little. They aren't bratty kids just rambunctious and resistant to the discipline of schoolwork. She hasn't a clue about how to make them work so she just writes the lesson on the board and posts herself against the door barring any escape. Her handwriting is neat and orderly but as the film progresses we come to see that Teacher Wei is only a little more schooled than her charges.The great thing about Not One Less' is its unstinting perspective on the innocence and naivet that only a child lives in. Teacher Wei and these children are completely guileless without a window on the wide world and have none of the knowledge or calculation for the simplest complexities of modern life. The film's crisis is that the class troublemaker elevenyearold bumpkin Zhang Huike leaves unannounced for the city so he can earn money for his destitute family. Wei feels the absolute fear of her failure to keep her pledge and is desperate to go and find young Zhang. Figuring out how to get to the city to find him  for her and these children it might as well be a search for the Holy Grail. It seems as fraught with myth and legend. Yet she in her naivet is undaunted. Many schemes are attempted and when each fails she just begins walking having no idea how far it is or how long it will take her or what lies ahead when she gets there. She just knows she must find him.Her journey is the quest of her young life just as Alvin Straight's is the culminating quest of his life. It is a defining act for both. There are no earthshattering twists of plot to keep from you. It is the unfolding of a redemptive story a boldly honest portrait of a world away from our experience and a young girl's attempt to navigate it with all her will and perseverance and naivet  and only that  to sustain her. In the end we feel we have been somewhere we've never been before and perhaps learned something that we had long forgotten. It is the singular power of cinema to transport us this way to jack us directly into a net of experience we can feel so deeply in our hearts.";

	schema:headline " A quasirealistic fairy tale of modern China";
	schema:reviewBody "Wei Minzhi played by Wei Minzhi essentially playing herself is a 13yearold peasant girl pressed into being Teacher Wei at a small rural elementary school when the regular teacher must take a month off. She knows one song a Maoist propaganda song and that not very well. She hasn't a clue about how to manage a classroom. Her arithmetic is suspect and her people skills are those of a selfcentered beginner. It's not even clear that she wants to do the job. In fact she seems more concerned about the 50 yuan she's supposed to get than anything else.Thus acclaimed Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou sets the stage for a most compelling fairy tale which illustrates how the determined spirit of a little girl might triumph over poverty ignorance and the hardheaded reality of the postMaoist bureaucratic society.And is she determined! She is given 30 pieces of chalk and warned not to waste any of it. The lesson plans are to copy some lessons on the chalkboard and to get the students to copy the copy. That's it! Both the regular teacher and the town's mayor point to the other as the one who will pay her. When the regular teacher starts to leave without paying her she chases after him. She is told she will get paid when he returns and if all the students are still enrolled she will get a tenyuan bonus.Thus we have the movie's title and the source of Teacher Wei's determination. When one little girl is picked to go to a sports camp because she can run Wei hides her from the authorities. When Zhang Huike the class troublemaker played by Zhang Huike quits school and heads for the city to find work Wei schemes ways to get him and bring him back.At this point the magic begins. With this common goal both teacher and the kids figure out ways to raise money to send Wei by bus to the city and back.They figure the cost for Wei's round trip and for Zhang Huike's oneway trip back with the kids themselves taking the initiative at the chalkboard with the math. Wei makes them empty their pocketbooks and when there is not enough she takes them on a field trip to a brickmaking factory and together they move bricks to raise the cash. Again they calculate how many bricks they must move at so many cents per brick.I mention all this because what is demonstrated by the by is some real teaching and learning taking place. In fact the mayor comes by and peeks into the classroom and is delighted to see that the substitute teacher knows how to teach math!This sequence of events is very moving and is at the heart of the film. Any teacher anywhere in the world will recognize how brilliantly this is done. The kids become so eager to learn that they learn effortlessly which is the way it is supposed to be. Furthermore one of the phenomena of the profession is exemplified that of the real teacher learning more partly because she is older than the students from the lessons they encounter.Now it is true that director Zhang Yimou does not show us the real poverty that exists in China nor does he point to the horrid dangers encountered by children who go to the city to work. Neither the little boy nor Teacher Wei is preyed upon in the manner we might fear. Recapitulations of the baser instincts of human beings are not part of Zhang Yimou's purpose here. This is in fact a movie that can be viewed by children who will I suspect identify very strongly with the story. Zhang Yimou is talking to the child in all of us and he does it without preaching or through any didactic manipulation of adult verses child values. It is true he does manipulate our hearts to some degree but with all the ugliness that one sees in the world today perhaps he can be allowed this indulgence.Although I would not say that this film is as good as Zhang Yimou's internationally celebrated films such as Red Sorghum 1987 his first film or Raise the Red Lantern 1991 which I think is his best film or The Story of Qiu Ju 1991 which this film resembles to some extent it is nonetheless a fine work of art exemplifying Zhang Yimou's beautiful and graceful style and his deep love for his characters and their struggles. And as always his work rises above and exists in a place outside of political propaganda as does the work of all great artists.Perhaps more than anything else however one should see this movie to delight in the unselfconscious natural and utterly convincing amateur performance by Wei Minzhi as a most determined and brave little girl. She will win your heart.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not One Less 1999 directed by Zhang Yimou Ju Dou Raise the Red Lantern Shanghai Triad is a bittersweet drama set in a poor public school in the remote Chinese village of Shuiquan in Hebei province. Based on a book by screenwriter Shi Xiangsheng who worked as a schoolteacher in Xinjiang Not One Less illuminates the conditions of children in rural China who have little access to education and are without schoolbooks or teachers with drive or experience. As the film opens the regular teacher Gao Enman must leave the school to take care of his sick mother and a 13year old peasant girl Wei Minzhi with no previous teaching experience is hired by the Mayor to become the substitute teacher for one month. Teacher Gao already upset by the number of students who have left the school tells Wei that when he comes back the number of students must be not one less. Wei concerned about receiving her pay of 50 yuan promises that no student will leave while she is there. The young teacher must control and teach 28 students most just a few years younger than her. With little resources other than a few boxes of chalk Wei can do little else than have the children copy an assignment from the blackboard while she sits outside the door to prevent them from leaving.Teacher Wei runs into difficulty in keeping her promise to Gao when one student is recruited to go to a special sports school. Another student a bright but mischievous 11year old Zhang Huike is also taken out of school to find work in the city of Jiangjiaou to help his family's finances. The story takes a sharp turn when Wei determined not to lose any more students makes plans to raise money to go to the city to find Zhang and bring him back to school. The process of finding the money to allow her to take the bus to the city enables Wei to teach the eager students by constructing reallife problems in simple mathematics.When Zhang gets lost in the city and lives on the streets scavenging for food Wei must summon all her inner resources to try to find him. The scenes in the city use hidden cameras during Wei's interactions with crowds to create a semidocumentary style that reminded me of recent Iranian films that blend fact and fiction. In the process of looking for Zhang the naive girl from the countryside encounters bewildering obstacles and bureaucratic bungling that are reminiscent of an earlier Zhang Yimou film The Story of Qui Ju. At first Wei's motives in finding Zhang are to make sure she gets paid when Gao returns. However she soon develops a true affection for Zhang and the result is a desperate search that will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride. While Not One Less is specifically about economic conditions in rural China the appealing innocence of the nonprofessional actors who used their real names to add authenticity to their performance gives the film a direct emotional appeal that is universal. It may lack the scope and dramatics of earlier Yimou works but Not One Less is a gentle and involving film that truly touches the heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose 'heart warming' are the first words that come to mind but lest that put anyone off I have to say that it is the way Mr Zhang involves us from the very beginning that is the reason for the film's success. Beautifully shot with some wonderful natural light our first glimpse of the rural backwater is astonishing. Almost immediately though we are drawn into a drama involving a thirteen year old girl being put in charge of a school of youngsters. The usual teacher has to visit sick relatives for a month and he leaves the girl behind with specific instructions to keep the schoolchildren from leaving school. Hence the film's title. Of course one goes missing and she follows to the city to try and find him which becomes the story of the film. It is fascinating to see and believe the degree of poverty in the village and wonder as the children do at the difficulty of surviving in either place. The young girl may be acting less out of altruism than self interest but our eyes do not leave her and her concerns are ours. Seemingly non professional cast do a magnificent job which must in no small part be down to Zhang but then nobody seems to put a foot wrong. Excellent.".

Almost immediately though we are drawn into a drama involving a thirteen year old girl being put in charge of a school of youngsters. The usual teacher has to visit sick relatives for a month and he leaves the girl behind with specific instructions to keep the schoolchildren from leaving school. Hence the film's title. Of course one goes missing and she follows to the city to try and find him which becomes the story of the film. It is fascinating to see and believe the degree of poverty in the village and wonder as the children do at the difficulty of surviving in either place. The young girl may be acting less out of altruism than self interest but our eyes do not leave her and her concerns are ours. Seemingly non professional cast do a magnificent job which must in no small part be down to Zhang but then nobody seems to put a foot wrong. Excellent.";

It truly deserved the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival.A reluctant substitute teacher taking on a job that would fetch a doubtful 50 yuan from a village mayor with questionable priorities transforms into a national hero in less than a month as she strives hard to ensure the number of her students do not dwindle until the regular teacher returns. Her resolutions transforms the economic state of the school makes her students into socially responsible young adults and teaches a lesson to the wily mayor a gatekeeper in the city TV station who goes by rules rather than by her discretion.The brilliance of the film is that the film hooks the audience as a thriller would until the film ends. Yet there is no sex no violence no beautiful face no delightful music or engaging camera anglesonly reactions caught by candid camera at least most of the time.The most poignant comment was the young student's comment I loved the city but it made me beg for food For a contemporary Chinese film made under tight censorshipthe film's director Yimou Zhang seems to offer layers of comment beyond the obvious story line. Did Teacher Wei do what she did for the sake of money or as a responsible teacher? Are you likely to forget propagandist songs but recall simple songs on family values? Are individual greatness teacher Wei more appreciated than group actions school as a group nation's need for good athletes overriding permission of the parents of potential athletes? Is the richness of rural lifestyles discounted by rising urban materialism? Does it require an individual's actions to underline the demands of the rural poor? These are hidden questions for each viewer to answer.I have only seen one other film of director Yimou Zhang and that is Red Sorghum. Not one less towers over Red Sorghum in every department of filmmaking.I saw this Chinese film on an Indian TV channel. I only wish more such international films get shown widely on TV throughout the world. It would raise the bar of what constitutes good cinema to many who currently have little idea of good cinema except those made in their own countries. Recent mainland Chinese films like Peacock and Not one less have established their world class credentials.P.S. I was more than amused to find Ford and CocaCola financed the film in part which is probably why the school kids in a remote Chinese village know about Coke and relish rationed drops of the liquid.

It gets better if you like a story that features an uncompromising absolutely determined female child in the lead role. But its even better if you happen to have had a teacher in your life you endeared or are a teacher and have had a favorite pupil. It gets better if you're a father looking for a strong role model for your daughter. Its better still if you have Chinese ancestry in your family. It gets better if you have an interest in learning more about the daily conditions of modernday rural and urban China delivered via a master cinematographer. It gets better if you think education occurs best when children take an active role in lessons situated in a context meaningful to them see the math lessons in the movie. And finally if you are many of these there's a message at the top of the credit roll that will either break your heart or confirm your knowledge of the relentless unfairness of the human condition.On top of all this the movie is littered with priceless vignettes the children writing singlecharacter calligraphy on the chalk board the misbehaving students and the absent teacher the dedicated teacher who will stand for two days at the security gate asking every passerby if they are the general manager the famished child waif guiltily but aggressively eating someone's leftover dinner from the tabletop of a streetside caf the pervasive role of money on life's most basic pursuits.This movie has the emotion of To Sir with Love and the honesty of Himalaya.Yimou Zhang doesn't just use actresses and actors to portray the parts he uses the real thing culling the mayor students and teachers from rural villages the television station manager the restaurateur from the city etc. How he manages to capture these people in the natural presentations of their characters is impressive. The performances were so convincing I marveled at their exquisite authentic qualities. I kept asking myself how did these actresses and actors nail their parts so well?

	schema:reviewBody "This is also a wellreceived and wellapplauded film in the international scene. Not surprising for it is a film directed by the same man who gave us Raise the Red Lantern Hero and Zhang Ziyi via The Road Home which I have yet to see  Zhang Yimou. Based on There is a Sun in the Sky by Shi Xiang Sheng who also wrote the screenplay the story tells about a young girl who actually represents China's poor and practically illiterate sector. Oh but that's getting ahead of the story.In the movie Wei Min Zhi young and barely out of her teens is given the task to substitute for the very dedicated Teacher Gao at the Shiuxian Village's school in Beijing. Having big and understandable doubts Teacher Gao still hands over the reins to her for a while as he is left with no choice. It being a job Wei asks for payment. They argue until they both agree to a decision that he will make sure she gets paid provided that in his absence no student leaves schooling to work not one less. Wei intends to keep this promise a promise that eventually becomes threatened when one of the students runs away.It is obvious that Not One Less is a movie intended to serve as an eyeopener and does not pretend to be anything else. It touches on issues such as poverty child labor and illiteracy. It is realistic enough as who are we to say that a situation such as Wei?s does not exist? While you maybe amused by the story from time to time you can?t help but feel pity for the characters. Imagine a 13yearold kid forced by the need to earn and teach other kids almost her own age. I winced between chuckles as Wei struggled to find the right words for the only song she claimed she knew the right answers to simple mathematics and the right way to find the missing boy in the jungle called The City.The story is told in quite a simple manner. No music no flairs and save for one  Li Fan Fan  no real celebrities. Read the credits and you?ll soon realize that none of the cast whether main or not were real actors. In fact everyone used hisher own name! Wei Min Zhi was actually a student from Zhenlingbao Village Middle School. Troublemaker Zhang Huike was actually also another student from another school. Teacher Gao Gao Enman was a real primary school teacher. Though the story was not based on a particular and actual person's life the cast played their own roles from the young runnerathlete to the village mayor to the TV anchor.There is no great acting. I must say the better. Raw acting can sometimes make everything more believable. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. Heck it's like seeing a familiar situation in my country's own backyard! A plus for Zhang Huike?s infectious smile. But even that I missed the first time I saw him cry and in this particular scene Li Fan Fan Do you like the city? Zhang Huike Yes. Li Fan Fan What is good about it? Zhang Huike The city is beautiful and progressive. Much better than the countryside. Li Fan Fan What?s the most lasting impression? Zhang Huike pauses and the smile fades That I had to beg for food. I will always remember that. So if you feel you can break away from all the hitech gory and adrenalinerushing flicks opt for a simple and realistic story. Here it is and don't expect any buttkicking Wei Min Zhi anytime soon. Just isn't going to happen.".

I have since had the pleasure of watching The Road Home Happy Times and The Story of Qiu Ju. Similar to Hou Jianqi's Postmen in the Mountain and a number of the films mentioned above Not One Less depicts the natural beauty of rural China next to the abject poverty in which quite a number of farmer families live. The film begins simply enough with the mayor tugging along the pretty slim Wei Minzhi who has been hired by the village to teach in the place of an older teacher who must leave town in order to look after his sick mother. Minzhi does not bring much to the table however because she is only able to sing one song in praise of Mao and her teaching ability seems to be limited to copying information on the board and then ordering her students to copy what she has written. Also did I mention the fact that Minzhi is thirteen years old? Minzhi was hired because she was the only one willing to work in the little bumpkin village. Of course because of her age she is not only taken advantage of by her students but the mayor as well who tries to swindle his way out of paying the young woman fifty yuan around maybe twenty dollars for a month's work. However when Minzhi is offered an extra ten yuan by the old teacher if she is able to keep all of her students during the month Minzhi becomes determined to keep all of her students in place. However one soon joins a school specializing in sports and another leaves for the city to support his sick mother.Like Yang Zhang's film Quitting all of the actors all nonprofessional play themselves. Filming is still highly censored in China so Zhang Yimou had to veneer the true messages of the film. So under that happy ending and bubbly children this is a serious social critique which needs to be seen to be appreciated.".

Zhang Yimou had earlier taken us with equal impact into the lives and struggles of Chinese villagers in 'Story of Qiu Ju.'. but 'Not One Less' takes place long after Premier Deng had 'broken the iron rice bowl' and left poor rural people in China to find their own way. The village school where 13 year old Wei is hired as a teacher cannot even afford to buy chalk. It certainly cannot hire an adult to teach the large group of children in one classroom.At first her efforts seem hopeless. Yet she won't give up. At the end she succeeds in holding the class together. Anyone who has ever tried to teach children will find deep satisfaction at the end when her students finally start to learn.

That said this is a beautiful and heart warming story about an aspect of Chinese culture one generally does not hear much about in the West the situation at rural schools. As Zhang Yimou lets us know at the end more than one million students drop out of schools in rural China because of poverty. From what I understand this is a pretty accurate picture of the situation in many places in the Chinese countryside. Forget about having a computer in the classroom this place has to worry about having enough chalk. To add to the authenticity Zhang Yimou used real people from the Chinese countryside to play the roles although to clear up one misperception this is not a true story. It is certainly a different China than the economic superpower we hear about in the news.

Her skills as a teacher are barely adequate and her students are just a few years younger than she is yet she makes up her obvious shortcomings as a teacher with an utmost zeal in accomplishing her mission. Her superior has told her that not one of her students must drop out of school so when one of the more trouble making boys heads to the big city in order to support his starving family she has to go there to get him back. The movie is refreshingly sincere in stating that she does not search the boy out of a sense of social concern but because of money since she won't receive any bonus if any of her students are missing. The best part of the movie shows the naive teacher trying to find her lost student in the urban jungle of the city. Shot with a wonderful amateur cast this look at rural China is beguiling.".

Never could I have predicted the deep meticulously crafted scenes led so strongly by Abbie Cornish playing Fanny. The heartwrenching emotion in this movie was unlike any other there has never been a more real portrayal of the most simplistic yet most common emotions that rule the heart. Campion went far beyond the usual I am deeply in love Now I am sad and truly captured human idiosyncrasy as she delved into the illogical irrational minds of two young and suddenly in love individuals. At times it was almost too much to bear due to how intensely palpable the sadness was. To some certain scenes or moments may have seemed a little longer than usual but completely necessary is the silence just as much as the dialogue. This film perfectly embodied how a simple real profound story should be told.If the above were not enough to drive this movie on the aesthetics were nothing short of spectacular. Each stitch in Fanny's sewing was as beautiful as each scene in a field of lavender or room flooded with butterflies. The magnificent settings costumes and natural sunshine pouring into a perfectly decorated room felt not contrived but simply like a very real dream. As the curtains in Fanny's room got caught in the breeze it was as if you felt it cooling you down ever so slightly as her content emotion overtook your mind.Ben Whishaw too was superb perfectly embodying the fragile wondrous poet that was John Keats so full of tender emotion. Fanny's younger sister was another beautiful element of this film and really stole the show in her own right with her hilarious and endearing perception of life in general. Each character and each line spoken brought something so special to the story. As much witty humor as there was aching sorrow this movie is not one to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film tonight and in my eyes it is a perfect film. Beautifully acted by all involved several times during the film I found myself thinking 'Abby Cornish is amazing! despite not being a huge fan before and stunningly shot it contains some of the most beautifully cinematic scenes i have ever seen committed to film. Campion does a wonderful job of communicating Fanny' emotional state through the composition particularly in one scene where the wind is blowing the curtain in her bedroom. The light and colour are fresh and gorgeous and the costumes and design add to the overall piece without being distracting which is just what you want from a period piece.But in the end it is above all a wonderful story well told. A deeply romantic tale the story of Fanny and Keats could easily have become a mawkish overly sentimental piece. But through her wonderfully naturalistic dialogue her use of humour and light touch and her restrained story telling she never lets a scene go on one line too long Jane Campion has created a heart wrenching film which I cannot fault. The characters are real and fully rounded you feel the joys and the pain with them and where I think she really succeeds is by making their love affair extraordinary and yet at the same time deeply ordinary.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film tonight and in my eyes it is a perfect film. Beautifully acted by all involved several times during the film I found myself thinking 'Abby Cornish is amazing! despite not being a huge fan before and stunningly shot it contains some of the most beautifully cinematic scenes i have ever seen committed to film. Campion does a wonderful job of communicating Fanny' emotional state through the composition particularly in one scene where the wind is blowing the curtain in her bedroom. The light and colour are fresh and gorgeous and the costumes and design add to the overall piece without being distracting which is just what you want from a period piece.But in the end it is above all a wonderful story well told. A deeply romantic tale the story of Fanny and Keats could easily have become a mawkish overly sentimental piece. But through her wonderfully naturalistic dialogue her use of humour and light touch and her restrained story telling she never lets a scene go on one line too long Jane Campion has created a heart wrenching film which I cannot fault.

	schema:reviewBody "I just had the pleasure of seeing Bright Star tonight. I was hoping it would be as good as the trailer and it was. The trailer is not misleading in this sense but a pretty good representation of the movie.Most of the negative reviews I've read for this have something to do with how the film is little or slow. Rarely they comment that it's melodramatic. Which it's NOT by any means. It is not mawkishly sentimental at all. It's not epic it is small in a way and there's never any seizing moment of action. That doesn't make it boring it's engaging throughout. This is different from any period film I've ever seen or really imagined. It's not like typical period pieces in trying to wow you with its aesthetic recreation of the time it's not so much about the visual splendor though it looks very lovely and is thoroughly convincing as a representation of that period. It's visually quite different from other period pieces it has a more realistic and kind of earthy look rather than pastelcolored and with a glow around everything. There are slums and lessthanpalatial places. This isn't Pride and Prejudice. Neither does it have sort of a broad sweeping narrative. At heart it's a deep love story about famed poet John Keats and his love and muse Franny Brawne whose relationship was cut short by a tragic death. It delves deeply into the small details of their courtship and is pretty involved psychologically.These people are portrayed realistically. Even the more minor characters they all seem to be real people with actual personalities rather than caricatures or types of stuffy Regency people who are preoccupied with propriety and good marriage matches. Fanny's mother is nice the main issue with her marrying Keats is that he literally can't support her and the people they know aren't mindlessly concerned about it. They actually have FUN and do more interesting things than stand at ballroom dances and sit at dinner. Who would have thought people in a Regency period movie could actually climb trees walk in the mud or do quirky whimsical things? Their ease and naturalness and relative candor in moving around interacting with and talking to each other was refreshing and definitely different from the idea you generally get. And this is the first period piece I've ever ever seen where anyone has actually picked up and held their pet cat and treated it like you would your pet. You can actually hear it purring it's a real part of their surroundings. I liked that cat it was cute.The dialogue was superb. It wasn't this sloppy general or comicalabsurd stuff. It was precise clear charged with personality and often beautiful. When you hear the conversations between Fanny and John it's brilliant real and a pleasure. I have never seen such intelligence subtlety or elegance in a movie in this way. To hear Fanny respond to something John said even just a word as if she were actually thinking about it as would happen in real life as if she were an intelligent feeling witty person was so nice. And so DIFFERENT. It's a little hard to explain if you haven't seen it. Suffice it to say the dialogue is delicate and nuanced. They are articulate but not pretentious they are sensitive individual people  not unreal types who don't pick up on details. And it being about Keats the characters have a lot of literary intelligence. You will enjoy the poetry in the movie.The acting was great. Keats  I would probably fall in love with him too. He seems like such a sensitive romantic and intelligent guy. Ben Whishaw was perfect for him. And Abbie Cornish as Fanny is wonderful  while not extravagantly gorgeous exactly her face has such clear features that she has an extraordinary appeal. She is a very striking character and deeply feeling about Keats. You get a real sense of love real responses to grief instead of just a pretty swoon. It was a real romance  their tender kiss was beautiful the things they said to each other and the things they felt.This movie is one of those rare films that are almost perfect to me. That doesn't make it my favorite movie but it means I didn't find much wrong with it. The emotion isn't overwhelming it's not exactly visceral but it's moving and penetrating it has its own style. It's NOT sappy or conventional. The extreme intelligence realism and emotional depth of this movie truly set it apart from all others. I heard a review say something like about how it's just about old British speech and mannerisms which couldn't be farther from the truth. It is NOT driven by quaintness or generic period speech like other period films. The dialogue is not stiff pretentious or artificial though it's accurate. Sweet moving and intelligent Bright Star has rare depth. It's definitely like no other movie. You should go see it if you think you'd be into it at all by any stretch. You might not like it  it is rather slow but very interesting at least for me  but it would be a thick or insensitive person indeed who couldn't appreciate it in some way. It's like how Keats described Fanny  the brightest most delicate thing.My favorite quotes areA thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness.I almost wish we were butterflies and lived but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain. There are many others much of Keats' letters to Fanny is so beautiful but I can't remember them off the top of my head. These are two that appear in the trailer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Through brilliant stunning visuals and intelligent witty dialogue Jane Campion's Bright Star celebrates the rapture of passionate love. Using many of the Romantic John Keats' own wordscaptured for posterity in his poems and love letters to Fanny Brawne his 'sweet Girl'Campion has weaved together one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Rich 19thcentury fabrics and breathtaking English scenery make Bright Star a sensuous pleasure to experience. But these visuals merely reflect the beauty within the soul of this film the love affair of Miss Brawne and Mister Keats. Brawne is passionate about and proud of her fashionable and daring needlework as is Keats his aspiring albeit more finespun poetry and both share an ardent love of life and a longing for someone with whom to experience it completely. Theirs is the inspiring true story of the rare uniting of equalsof two strong independent and intelligent individuals with unique talents and dreams yet deeply matching values and desires. The emotional intellectual and subtly sensual affair between Brawne and Keats is captured wonderfully in Bright Star owing in part to the portrayal and backdrop of those closest to the lovers in their own lives such as Keats' coarse but caring friend Charles Brown and Brawne's warm mother and endearing siblings. The obtrusively vulgar Brown serves in stark contrast to the gentlemanly Keats whose integrity and will Brown deeply admires but cannot quite live up to in his own life while Brawne's loving familywoven seamlessly into the storyline through their presence in scenes of playfully benevolent games strolls and dinnerparties serves as foil to the equally loving yet singularly feisty Brawne. Through the meaningful and oftentender dialogue and interactions between these vivid characters Bright Star is able to match beauty of setting with that of soul a rare feat in a film...as it is in life. Now Bright Star has been attacked as sentimental by the modern cynical skeptic and if it were the hackneyed story of a princess and a pauper mindlessly frolicking to their fairytale ending his criticism might merit a modicum of respect. But Bright Star is not a fairytale in that empty sense for the fact is Keats died at the age of 25 and he and Brawne were anything but mindless. So unhappily for the cynic his venom is ineffectual against this film for in Bright Star his normally insidious strain of attack finds its antidote reality. Bright Star is a true story depicting the love affair of two exceptional souls who lived a life however brief for Keats of happiness in this world. In today's angstridden often gloomy atmosphere of humility and despairwhere so many either consciously diffuse or unwittingly and tragically breathe in the modern liberal claim of man's depravity itself merely a mutation of the ancient Christian notion of Original Sinthe littleknown Bright Star shines through in rebellion with pride and exaltation demanding its viewers resurrect the selfesteem and aspiration they once had as children and should never have let die as adults. Although Bright Star is deeply uplifting and truly benevolent one must be prepared to leave its resplendent world tinged with a real sadness. But this sadness does notit cannot abide if one recalls Keats' own poetic words to Brawne from an early love letter which encapsulate the film's essence passionate love for this wondrous world and one's 'Bright Star' in it... ...I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer daysthree such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Keats's romance with Fanny Brawne and final days are brought to lovely life in Jane Campion's new film Bright Star. He had TB though it's never named. When he had become very ill they sent him to Rome. How foolish! Its climate isn't healthy though it might have seemed so compared to Hampstead. The house where Keats lived in Hampstead for two years and was in love with Fanny Brawne and wrote some of his has just been restored.Campion's film may not be a deep investigation of poetical genius but it's delicate and alive and infinitely touching. There's a delightful litte rosycheeked girl and good use is made of cats. The handsome Regency house was then divided into two one side occupied by Keats and his landlord and possessive companion Charles Brown the other by a family called Brawne. He fell in love with Fanny Brawne and she with him. She is creative in her own way a brilliant seamstress and designer of clothing who was inventive with fabrics. She didn't know much about poetry but to go by the film she crammed the classics to be able to talk to Keats and read all his poems and memorized many passages. They recite them back and forth to each other which may be artificial but you don't mind because the poetry is their love it bloomed through their love and expresses it. Until he began coughing blood and ceased to write because he was suddenly too ill Keats wrote some of his best work in Hampstead in love with Fanny Brwwne.They express their love in long sweet kisses and walking hand in hand. This too is artificial but a fitting symbolic expression of the ecstasy and swoons of romantic poetry.Sometimes the final credits define the experience of a film and of its audience. You have to love a film over whose final credits the wispy winsome Whishaw is heard softly reading the whole of the Ode to a Nightingale right to the end and you have to respect an audience in an American cineplex when many of its members sit still to hear Keats's masterpiece down to the final words Was it a vision or a waking dream? Fled is that music  Do I wake or sleep? Can you imagine having known a person with such extravagant gifts? Campion doesn't get too much in the way of our own imagining. She just lets it happen lets the cats wander in and out and thus captures the sine curve of romantic experience its extremes of joy and despair that are so poignantly focused in the life of this penniless English boy who died at twentyfive thinking himself a failure and left behind some of the finest poetry in the language.Abbie Cornish plays Fanny Ben Wishaw John Keats Paul Schneider plays Charles Brown. The little rosycheeked sister Margaret Toots Brawne is played by Edie Martin. Brown is the villain of the piece because he jealously guards Keants from Fanny whom he thinks is a silly girl who only sews and flirts. He's getting in the way of romantic love! And Schneider can't help but seem obtrusive here. Brown redeems himself later when having gotten the sweet Irish servant girl Abigail Antonia CampbellHughes with child he does the right thing and marries her.Fanny's mother says she can't marry Keats because he has no money but he proposes and she accepts and when the liebestod begins there's no way of denying his happiness or Fanny's or the sadness and devotion that made her wear the gold engagement band for the rest of her life. Campion's film offers no profound insights into the poetic process. But how can it? Though Fanny asks Keats to give her lessons in poetry its appreciation like its creation must be instinctive and cannot be explained particularly not the ethereal romantic kind. Wishaw's delicate and enigmatic quality is a satisfying image to hang our fantasies on.".

I can't imagine anyone doing a better job.Jane Campion the Director brought the period to life. And the character development was outstanding. The viewer really felt a connection to the characters in the film even minor characters like Fanny's mother  siblings were highly engaging. Fanny's younger sister was the most adorable little girl in film since Gretl in The Sound of Music.The music and mood of the movie fit the period and subject perfectly. I was mesmerized from the beginning to the end of this great film. I think I'll go back and see it again. It was that good.The movie ended while the credits rolled with Whishaw reciting Ode to a Nightingale set to classical music. The audience stayed up until the last credit rolled. It was a nice touch to finish the movie with.This movie will likely be the definitive film about Romantic poets. Maybe Campion will direct a movie about Byron in Greece or Shelley in Italy. One thing is for sure she set the bar pretty high with Bright Star.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that many viewers have coasted through this believing it to be a simple love story told simply. It seemed to me anything but that. This is a movie about the rhythms of poetic image from romantic love translated to cinematic image. The poet is Keats who likely was as imagined melancholy reaching for a romantic purity. Many such existed it seems but few that achieved this in words that matter.The story is a simple one ordinary in many ways. Instead of romanticizing the woman and their love Campion does us a real service. She shows that this great love was largely a matter of accident two primed lonely souls finding each other. The woman in this case really was not very special except in finding deep love. The contrast between the souls of the poems and similar pure romantic love of movies and what we have here is striking.The shift is not from the poetry to the people. The people stay real. It is from the poetry to the cinematic presentation. Campion is able without being obvious of slipping real romantic images to buoy this. Usually we have conventional duft presenting some unrealistic ideal. Here we have true love in sight surrounding ordinariness.Our bright star is a seamstress obsessed with fashion  fashion that makes her truly seem shallow. Many of the clothes she wears are strikingly ugly in the overall assembly. But in the small  which we often see  they are composed of elements that could be items of extended meditation. That they are her extended skin consciously designed and carefully crafted makes her an extraordinarily appealing lover.The first seconds of this film set the world one that is extraordinary. We see a closeup of a tiny needle being perfectly threaded. We see an enormous closeup of that needle piercing virginal white fabric. We slowly work to the situation of the woman involved. She is the narrator the maker. This is a movie that goes in my database of cloth films because the use of cloth is basic.There is short preliminary a short courting. It is not from Austin where strong soulmates bond just two ordinary souls. But when they kiss we have one of the two sublime scenes. She lays on her bed the location of which carries great significance. A white curtain blows seductively over her. Her similar white dress has the wind lifting it and awakening underneath. This is absolutely breathtaking.A second sequence may seem too heavy for most. Her love goes away and she is forlorn. He writes an amazing letter thus beginning his great period. Butterflies are mentioned. So she fills her room with butterflies. These somehow actually perform as part of the fabriced space participating as if directed. Oh no! She gets a letter cutting off futures and the butterflies die to be swept into bins. If ever there was a romantic cinematic environment this is it the butterfeathered bedroom where words feed image.The little sister perhaps ten and named Toots is patterned after Tootie in Meet Me in St Louis redhead precocious and romanticized beyond all else. She is a sort of emissary into innocence anchoring the ideals this elicits but does not exploit. Ms Campion thank you. A movie about love that makes love. Thank you.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Many of the scenes evoked the sixteenth century Dutch masters whom Jane Campion may have used to set an authentic tone for her masterpiece. John Keats the most intensely romantic of the Romantic poets although Shelley and Lord Byron did their best could not have received a fairer treatment plus he was superbly acted by Ben Whislaw I fell in love with the entire cast. This film lives up to its potential and if you know anything about the life of Keats you realize that it is a Titanic sort of plot because the ship must go down. Yet my sadness was only that I have to live in the current world so dominated by name brands and nonsense rather than the fine stitchery and wit of Fanny Brawne. Drag your husband significant other and everyone you know to see this film!! I've seen it twice!!".

The cast has the unenviable task of fighting a very poorly constructed script and they do an enviable job. The performances however are one of the few things going for this film.The script feels like a first draft and comes off like a checklist of Keat's life. There is no dramatic arc. A good script will have elements established early on that pay off later in the script but this has none of that. Anything that is introduced is dealt with immediately and then you move on to the next item so there is no sense of structure dramatic tension or story arc. It literally feels like a checklist. The dialogue alternates between clumsy and awful and the reading of the poetry always seems artificial and overwrought. I also wonder if a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor as there are huge leaps in logic and there is little emotional continuity. There is no sense of the character's relationships to each other and I did not believe that there was any spark of true love between the two main protagonists! The film kept trying to tell you they were in love but it just wasn't actually there despite strong performances.The costumes and sets are wonderful but the camera work and lighting is dodgy. The film has numerous soft shots and strange use of handheld where the camera seems to accidentally move and bump with no sense of intent. The framing is often downright awkward and strange and aside from a number of scattered beauty shots the cinematography is pretty poor.This was quite a disappointing film despite the hype. I feel like I am the little girl in Hans Christian Andersen's The Emporers New Clothes who says But he's not wearing anything!".

	schema:headline " Bright Star is Jane Campion's least graphic film but it's also one of her most passionate";
	schema:reviewBody "Bright Star is not only one of the best films of the year but also Jane Campion's return to top form. Possibly the most acclaimed female director of her time thanks to early strong and praised works such as Sweetie 1989 An Angel At My Table 1990 and particularly The Piano 1993 the truth is that Campion hasn't had a real critical or commercial success since... The Piano. The Portrait of a Lady 1996 her adaptation of the Henry James novel had a stellar cast but was almost universally ignored Holy Smoke! 1999 with Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel had its moments but failed to impress anybody and In the Cut 2003 was easily her worst film but far from a disaster. The fact that Campion managed to remain such a respected name all these years even though not being the most prolific or successful filmmaker proves how influential and fascinating she is. She became some sort of figure for all the major female filmmakers from the past two decades and developed a very personal style marked by strong female sexuality often repressed told with visual lyricism. She may be considered a feminist but not the obviously preachy type because her work flows like good cinema and not as a heavyhanded gender discussion.Bright Star is a tragic love story beautifully directed acted photographed and written. Is it a revolutionary or innovative film? No. But the power of its lyricism and unabridged romanticism is infinitely touching. Anyone familiar with 19th century poet John Keats knows that he died of tuberculosis at 25 and this is no major spoiler since it's mentioned in every synopsis of the film so we know the love birds are not going to live happily ever after. Campion centers on the threeyear romance between Keats a discreet and charming Ben Whishaw and Fanny Brawne Abbie Cornish magnificent their passion and the issues that prevented them from being together. Whishaw fits Keats' shoes perfectly even if he might seem a little too low key at times. Paul Schneider All the Real Girls who's becoming one of the great American character actors plays the villain as Charles Armitage Brown Keats' friend who will do whatever he can to keep him away from Fanny. Kerry Fox Shallow Grave Intimacy unforgettable as Janet Frame in Campion's An Angel At My Table plays Mrs. Brawne and Edie Martin is simply adorable as Fanny's little sister Toots. But this is Abbie Cornish's show all the way. This 27 yearold Australian first impressed me opposite Heath Ledger in 2006's Candy and here she shows her full potential. Her Fanny is simply incandescent  a terrific performance that could culminate in Oscar glory. For all romantics and admirers of good cinema Bright Star is what Keats himself would call 'a thing of beauty... a joy forever'  intoxicatingly beautiful. 1010.".

I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting in colors in placement of the actors in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen they are fresh faces and yet beautiful Abbie Cornish and expressive Ben Whishaw' John Keats and the film also brings the most adorable redhaired kid actor I have ever seen the name is Edie Martin. Characters develop and people speak and fall in love and love falls apart and life falls apart and there is a lot of poetry in all this loudly read poetry but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed some suspense is deserved  and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well they were quite long for me by the end of the film.Jane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'. Inbetween she made a couple of films in other genres 'Holy Smoke' 'In the Cut' which I liked more than the average critic and IMDb viewers opinion. I looked that the situation is reversed with 'Bright Star'.".

Characters develop and people speak and fall in love and love falls apart and life falls apart and there is a lot of poetry in all this loudly read poetry but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed some suspense is deserved  and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well they were quite long for me by the end of the film.Jane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'. Inbetween she made a couple of films in other genres 'Holy Smoke' 'In the Cut' which I liked more than the average critic and IMDb viewers opinion. I looked that the situation is reversed with 'Bright Star'.";

Bright Star tells the story of poor poet John Keats and the passionate love he shared with his muse Fanny Brawne. But you'll have to take the film's word that this passion existed because mighty little of it ever makes an appearance on screen. Ben Whishaw who plays Keats and Abbie Cornish in a rather lifeless performance as Brawne are good at moping around but not much else. The film's biggest dramatic conflict is that Keats and Brawne want to get married but can't because both are too poor. So they instead wander around English cottages and countryside reciting poetry to one another. Paul Schneider as Keats' jealous friend tries hard to imbue some energy into the film but his character is too bothersome to make those rare bouts of energy enjoyable.A flat dud.Grade C".

	schema:reviewBody "It took Jane Campion to sap all the energy out of John Keats a man whose ideas spilled out so fast he omitted letters and entire words who achieved poetic immortality before age 25 and whose love affair with Fanny Brawne is by turns passionate and tempestuous and tragic. And so much of the original material is extant in Keats's famous letters and the letters of his family and friends not to mention the poems. Campion seems determined to disprove the adage that you can't go wrong with good material. What went awry? The story is really focused on Brawne not Keats who comes off as a languid cipher of sortsbut at least Campion didn't make him the stereotypical wimp. I'm very open to a cinematic focus broader than the ol' great dead white man. But this doesn't work especially well here because save for her connection to Keats Fanny Brawne probably isn't worth a movie. Even many in Keats's circle felt that their immortality was tied to hisfor example his friend Brown's tombstone reads The Friend of Keats.And despite what some commenters think Keats and the Romantics aren't ensconced in the canon and in the popular imagination the way the poets of other eras arethe Romantics were some of the last dead white men into the canon and have been some of the first to be tossed out or at least skimmed over.So there needed to be a better fusion of the story of their love affair with a vigorous exploration of Keats's annus mirabilis. Without that tight connection anyone not up on their British Romantic poetry has to wonder Who cares? Why am I in this theater? It is hard but not impossible to depict the life of the mind in cinema. Keats is one of the most exceptional examples of the life of a mind in perpetual motion one in which the passion spills out in all directions in friendships and family bonds and poems and letters and love affairs. It's a shame that viewers don't get a feel for his extraordinariness. Keats's classic image in poetry is of power and energy in repose but Campion only got the repose part right. Sigh. Lacking that it's just another sad love story between some folks long ago. Like the eagle in the Elgin Marbles poem Bright Star wants to soar but can't get airborne.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Jane Campion has always been one of those names who's work I just never had the pleasure of viewing. Finally a few years back I had the opportunity to see The Piano almost fifteen years after its release. The chance to watch her new tale of John Keats and love Fanny Brawne at the Toronto International Film Festival couldn't be passed up. Campion herself was there to introduce the Special Presentation screening and spoke about how this story was pure to her. Spanning two years of first love between a beloved poet and his muse the tale is at the same time both heartwarmingly genuine in its passion and crushingly tragic in its aftermath. She gets the period style just right and brings out two amazing turns from her leads there are very little if any faults with Bright Star.The story that takes place in the 19th century a time where a man couldn't even conceive of the notion to marry unless he had a job and influx of money. When the man in question is a poet you can imagine how hard a feat that can behis work relying solely on critical acclaim and the success of his booksweak at best if one shop owner is to be believed that he bought twenty to sell and none had left his gaze. Living with a friend and fellow poet Keats and Charles Armitage Brown find themselves with a lot of time on their hands to craft and create their next best artwork. The two rent space from the Brawne family well Brown does since he is the one with money and spend most moments alone behind closed doors seemingly doing very little of anything. Eventually curiosity and being fedup with the sarcastic cruelty of Brown makes young Fanny decide to meet Keats and gauge his makeup. The man is a virtual recluse except when caring for his deathly ill brother using all his free time to think and compose. This meeting intrigues them both and is the first step to their budding relationship together one that sees her critiquing his words before eventually being the subject of them.Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw as Brawne and Keats respectively completely embody their characters and bring them to life on screen. They know their motivations and their place in the world she falling in love with him knowing he can't love her due to his place in society's hierarchy and he falling for her knowing he can't until he sells his words and earns the right to. Social restraints notwithstanding the two begin a not so secret union of love built on mutual respect and affection. Both very young this is their first relationship and one of the greatest details of the film is in portraying it just that way. When Cornish and Whishaw kiss they do so gently and slow closed mouth and no movement. They are unsure what to do and that nave innocence makes the courting so real and effective to watch. Their love is so strong that any adversity is made so much more relevant and all encompassing to their world. When Keats must leave to write abroad they both write letters feeling the emptiness of loss until a reply is received. Brawne is so smitten and taken by his words of true love how he would rather live a lifetime of three days with her as a butterfly than fifty common years weighed down by responsibilities of earth she begins capturing the flying creatures making her bedroom a sanctuary for them to fly about.Two years together and a bond unbreakable their love is beautiful in its simplicity. Always so pure is Campion ever correct on that statement and childlike in reverence they want nothing more than to be together. Her parents allow the relationship to continue even though they know he must become a success before letting her leave them and the only real blockade comes from Keats' friend Brown played wonderfully by Paul Schneider adding the comic relief and a bit of conflict. Wanting the space and time to do his work with Keats each time Brawne comes by to steal her love away Brown is always quick with a quip to put her down and complain about the intrusion. But it is a playful relationship they have as Brawne is never shy to shoot back with a biting word timed to perfection. Schneider infuses the role with so much heart as he usually does in his love for Keats and friendship with Fanny. When true tragedy strikes he becomes a beacon of strength for the most part and holds himself responsible in keeping his poet friend safe.Bright Star is a romance for sure and its bittersweet ending only bolsters that fact. Nothing can come between the love both Cornish and Whishaw portray in the film. The hardships that hit them make their bond ever stronger realizing how much they need each other. Risking the rumors and talking behind their backs of a love frowned upon and socially rejected nothing else matters as they are their own world living together through it all even with death knocking at the door. The metaphor of the butterflies resonates so fully when you look at the short time Keats and Brawne have with one another on this earth. They take that time and live without regret knowing that without the other they would have nothing. Any credibility in his poetry comes from his feelings for her and her purpose for going on lives within him. So subtle and immense in its details Jane Campion has crafted a romance to engross and affect all those who take the time to watch it. Highly recommended for sure its simplicity hides its immense emotional worth making for a film not to be taken lightly.".

	schema:reviewBody "The heroine tells us early on  I sew I design and make my own clothes and I can make money at it although we never see her make a penny!  another biopic of Coco Chanel? No it's a film apparently about John Keats the poet but it isn't it's a movie about a couple passionately but platonically in love. Only really it's a film about a young woman called Fanny Brawn set during the Regency in England who fell in love with John Keats and we know this because they wrote a lot of letters which have survived to each other and he wrote an ode to her. Only again it isn't it's another modern feminist film about a modern girl feisty determined manipulative to get her own way including lying a lot somehow repressed by the early nineteenth century society she is living in exactly the same misalliance as Coco Avant Chanel. Why don't socalled feminist directors and writers write about now if they want to put over portraits of modern women not load it all on to figures in the past? Abbie Cornish survives it all to give a sound performance but Ben Whishaw disappears in the soap dressed up as painfully slow arthouse cinema  why and where is it shown he is a great poet?

No it's a film apparently about John Keats the poet but it isn't it's a movie about a couple passionately but platonically in love. Only really it's a film about a young woman called Fanny Brawn set during the Regency in England who fell in love with John Keats and we know this because they wrote a lot of letters which have survived to each other and he wrote an ode to her. Only again it isn't it's another modern feminist film about a modern girl feisty determined manipulative to get her own way including lying a lot somehow repressed by the early nineteenth century society she is living in exactly the same misalliance as Coco Avant Chanel. Why don't socalled feminist directors and writers write about now if they want to put over portraits of modern women not load it all on to figures in the past? Abbie Cornish survives it all to give a sound performance but Ben Whishaw disappears in the soap dressed up as painfully slow arthouse cinema  why and where is it shown he is a great poet?

But it's not so easy to talk about poets.In fact it's kind of like watching paint dry. If you come around and don't see us doing anything we're working Brown Keats' roommate and fellow poet instructs Fanny Brawne. Right. Observing writers practicing their craft is really boring.In the screenplay Keats attempts to describe the process of creating a poem to Fanny who is hell bent on learning dissecting and making sense of poetry.It's a mystery Right.A very few have gotten inside the craft of writing and found words to describe the indescribable. Wistawa Szymborska a Nobel Prize winning author said in her acceptance speech It's not accidental that film biographies of great  artists are produced in droves. The more ambitious directors seek to reproduce the creative process. But poets are the worst. Their work is hopelessly unphotogenic.

It's just not easy to explain to someone else what you don't understand yourself. Bright Star was endowed with a massive prepublicity campaign. An 8 page insert in Vanity Fair got me jazzed to see a movie about a poet I had mooned over in college.

Of course I was moved by his passion and commitment and frustrations. Oh and the fact that his books didn't sell.

As a male poet you have little exposure to anyone who isn't a bookstore clerk but especially not women. You fall in love with your neighbor as you tutor her between books. Is everything about you? Honestly no it isn't. During your life very little is in your control. Not even your health.John Keats was never in control of anything in his life. He was swept about by financial duties family collapse and disease for his twentyfive years. This film of his later life Bright Star is a modern apologyofsorts to Keats. He is finally the star of his own film. His control of our reaction is only limited by history and directorial contrivances.And what contrivances they are! What little we see of Keats in Bright Star is limited to fawning over Brawne but not readily opening up to her and reciting lines of poems he's supposedly written. The decision to portray his love life over his intellectual life isn't inherently limiting. But Jane Campion's film fails to place us inside any part of his life. Other than the wikipedia articles I referenced composing this review I still know nothing of Keats. We never see him silently writing. It's like he is there to be Brawne's love interest. Since he is more famous than she is his character is the piston of the narrative. Brawne is under developed to a caricature. It's like Twilight for adults.If the actors were portraying regular people in a modern era I would recommend it. While watching this film I felt like I was watching people in costume acting in a Lifetime period piece. The portrayal doesn't work in a biopic. Milk is a much better biopic that could also be considered a romance film. Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant recreate Harvey Milk's life in its entirety. That's a good movie. These types of films are to be informative or at least compelling and this one isn't. Keats love life and tragic preemptive death is easy inspiration for a film. Why not remove the historical backdrop and adapt this storyline to modern day. Now no one can direct a proper Bright Star until a decade or so passes.".

	schema:reviewBody "J.S. Cardones' spooky and sinister low budget retread of Alien and The Thing does have some good ideas going for it as a result and is fairly well produced and directed on a low budget.A top secret government project they'll never run out of those in genre movies located deep underground is hard at work conducting sleep related experiments. One of their subjects has died violently and a NASA captain Hickock David Beecroft 'Falcon Crest' arrives to investigate. What the project team has discovered is that these experiments have opened a path to some other dimension and now a hideous creature is on the loose a creature that will make quick work of the characters while they try to figure out how to fight back.Even if rather routine in the end Shadowzone is a good example of its genre with Cardone creating a solid atmosphere and some decent suspense. Karen Grossmans' cinematography is quite stylish and moody and the production design by Don Day is likewise impressive. Richard Band supplies the spooky music score. Mark Shostrom creates some appropriately nasty monster effects and gore.A solid cast including several familiar faces is fun to watch especially old pros like James Hong Big Trouble in Little China as the scientist in charge and Louise Fletcher One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as his assistant. They're old fashioned mad scientists to be sure but this does add to the overall comfortable predictability of the material. Costarring are Shawn Weatherly Miss Universe Miss USA and Miss South Carolina of 1980 as a fellow scientist Lu Leonard Starman as the tough talking cook Miguel A. Nunez Jr. The Return of the Living Dead as reliable technician Wiley and Frederick Flynn Cardones' The Slayer as agitated panicky custodian Shivers. Some of you will be interested to note that there is some nudity provided courtesy of bit players Maureen Flaherty and Robbie Rives.The movie begins on an effectively ominous note and is consistent in tone and pace right up until a rather underwhelming finale. It's definitely recommended if you're a lover of B movies and Full Moon productions in particular.Seven out of 10.".

One of their subjects has died violently and a NASA captain Hickock David Beecroft 'Falcon Crest' arrives to investigate. What the project team has discovered is that these experiments have opened a path to some other dimension and now a hideous creature is on the loose a creature that will make quick work of the characters while they try to figure out how to fight back.Even if rather routine in the end Shadowzone is a good example of its genre with Cardone creating a solid atmosphere and some decent suspense. Karen Grossmans' cinematography is quite stylish and moody and the production design by Don Day is likewise impressive. Richard Band supplies the spooky music score. Mark Shostrom creates some appropriately nasty monster effects and gore.A solid cast including several familiar faces is fun to watch especially old pros like James Hong Big Trouble in Little China as the scientist in charge and Louise Fletcher One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as his assistant. They're old fashioned mad scientists to be sure but this does add to the overall comfortable predictability of the material. Costarring are Shawn Weatherly Miss Universe Miss USA and Miss South Carolina of 1980 as a fellow scientist Lu Leonard Starman as the tough talking cook Miguel A. Nunez Jr. The Return of the Living Dead as reliable technician Wiley and Frederick Flynn Cardones' The Slayer as agitated panicky custodian Shivers. Some of you will be interested to note that there is some nudity provided courtesy of bit players Maureen Flaherty and Robbie Rives.The movie begins on an effectively ominous note and is consistent in tone and pace right up until a rather underwhelming finale. It's definitely recommended if you're a lover of B movies and Full Moon productions in particular.Seven out of 10.";

Sure it wasn't the best Movie ever made from Full Moon Puppet Master will always be the Greatest movie made but probably up there in the Top Ten. I love this Movie and if you are a Full Moon Pictures or Horror Fan you will too.It wasn't just the Killings themselves that made the movie. It was the Sense of Reality I Felt. I felt like I was In The Movie being chased etc. As far as the Musical Score Goes Don't expect Much. Just put in this Move with a Good Attitude If you say or think you'll hate it You most likely will.My Final Rating 10 out of 10  out of People who liked this Movie Might like Puppet Master Blood Dolls Arcade Seed people Night of the Living Dead Hell Asylum Prison of the Dead Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on elm street as well as other Titles from Full Moon Pictures.".

A friend of mine gradually intends to introduce me to this cheesy Bmovie studio's greatest classics and I must admit he did a fairly good job starting off with Shadowzone. The kills are inventive and the makeup effects are enjoyably nasty there even is a delicious headexplosion. There's some welcome gratuitous nudity and wondrously hammy acting performances from washedup cult veterans. James Hong stars as the fanatic scientist and Louise Fletcher the unforgettable Nurse Ratched in One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is awesome as his assistant.

Then we have a monster who  remains relatively unseen  as it bumps them off one by one.The acting isn't great the special effects are stretched and what tension is pretty much directly lifted from Alien check out the 'motion tracker' type scene which is almost totally taken from the scene in Alien where Ripley observes Dallas while he treks through the vents plus the music which sounds almost identical.It's not the worst 'monstermunching' movie out there.

He can be really good when he gets it right. The plot. In a underground bunker experiments are taking place unfortunately there has been an accident and one of the test subjects has died. So an investigation has to take place. When it is instigated the sleeping person opens a doorway to another dimension. This plot is pure From Beyond without the style of the aforementioned movie. Something comes through the doorway and comes into this world. We then get treated to Alien meets Galaxy of terror. Where is the alien? People go searching and get blotted.

Through Hickock Beecroft is a nononsense takecharge kind of character who is realistic and practical when faced with a really difficult situation which he certainly inherits when searching for the truth regarding the death of a civilian. Frederick Flynn is the tobaccochewing easily rattled handyman Tommy Shivers who could use a shave bath and some manners.

The being itself is a series of monsters not particularly as scary now due to the advancement in special effects..or as effective as say Bottin's work in THE THING or Stan Winston's work in PUMPKINHEAD but effectively grotesque when they pop up on characters..the monkey creature is quite a ghastly creation. I have read about SHADOWZONE's comparison to ALIEN but the only similarity I noticed was the plot regarding characters roaming the halls and rooms of the facility as the being is somewhere in the vicinity..some attempting to put food together for the long haul with Hickock  Wiley attempting to repair the damaged transformer after the mishap regarding the being's entry into our universe. Shawn Weatherly is scientist Dr. Kidwell who is so attached to her pet monkey..a supposed lab animal no longer needed when Van Fleet began to test human subjectsshe'll risk her life to find it when it goes missing..the twist regarding her finding a monkey is a doozy.

Head scientist Dr. Van Fleet a brief but cool appearance by the always terrific James Hong accidentally brings into our world a powerful deadly being with the scary ability to fatally use our worst fears against us. Writerdirector J.S. Cardone who also gave us the terrifically trashy The Forsaken and the pleasingly eerie Wicked Little Things maintains a snappy pace throughout stages the genuinely startling shock scenes with considerable harrowing aplomb and does a deft job of effectively creating a clammy creepy and downright unsettling nightmarish claustrophobic atmosphere. The strong cast qualifies as another major asset Louise Fletcher as the mad Dr. Erhardt Shawn Weatherly as the fetching Dr. Kidwell Frederick Flynn as hearty computer technician Tommy Shivers Lu Leonard as gruff cook Ms. Cutter and Miguel A. Nunez Jr. as abjectly craven spineless sniveling janitor Wiley. Karen Grossman's dark fluid moody cinematography Richard Band's supremely shuddery'n'spooky score and Mark Shostrom's good'n'gruesome makeup fx are all likewise on the money excellent and impressive. The gory murder set pieces hit the splattery spot with a perfectly grisly bull's eye. As a nice extra bonus the lovely Maureen Flaherty as a sleeping psychic spends all of her screen time completely in the buff. A really nifty and unjustly neglected little lowbudget scifihorror winner.".

Head scientist Dr. Van Fleet a brief but cool appearance by the always terrific James Hong accidentally brings into our world a powerful deadly being with the scary ability to fatally use our worst fears against us. Writerdirector J.S. Cardone who also gave us the terrifically trashy The Forsaken and the pleasingly eerie Wicked Little Things maintains a snappy pace throughout stages the genuinely startling shock scenes with considerable harrowing aplomb and does a deft job of effectively creating a clammy creepy and downright unsettling nightmarish claustrophobic atmosphere. The strong cast qualifies as another major asset Louise Fletcher as the mad Dr. Erhardt Shawn Weatherly as the fetching Dr. Kidwell Frederick Flynn as hearty computer technician Tommy Shivers Lu Leonard as gruff cook Ms. Cutter and Miguel A. Nunez Jr. as abjectly craven spineless sniveling janitor Wiley. Karen Grossman's dark fluid moody cinematography Richard Band's supremely shuddery'n'spooky score and Mark Shostrom's good'n'gruesome makeup fx are all likewise on the money excellent and impressive. The gory murder set pieces hit the splattery spot with a perfectly grisly bull's eye. As a nice extra bonus the lovely Maureen Flaherty as a sleeping psychic spends all of her screen time completely in the buff. A really nifty and unjustly neglected little lowbudget scifihorror winner.";

Louise Fletcher James Hong and Miquel Nunez really bring the project above the usual fair. And the lead David Beecroft isn't bad either. The film is about something coming in from another dimension and preying on our worst fears. Think From Beyond with a touch of Dreamscape and a whole lot of Alien. Don't put too much logic in the scientifics of the plot. Thankfully they don't get too deep in the jargon because most of what they say doesn't make sense to me. But if you're watching this you're here to be entertained not educated. And Shadowzone is pretty entertaining. Enough so to warrant a rental.

Shadowzone is a fine horror film if one with a few irritating faults. The story does have many similarities to Alien yes but it's backed up by a smart script and some tense suspenseful scenes excellent performances and great gory special effects. Louise Fletcher who I generally find to be a pretty bad actress See the 1986 Invaders from Mars remake for proof...gave a very fun amusing performance as the chapstickobsessed scientist. James Hong was awesome here it's a real shame he was killedoff so quickly! David Beecroft Octopus also gave a good performance even if he keeps things a little too straightfaced. J.S.

The Ick factor is high in this one!Among the complaints I have here is the ending. Not only is it unsatisfying but it also feel cheap and rushed. The final incarnation of the creature was surprisingly laughable quite unexpected considering how nice the quality of the effects throughout the rest of the film. Shadowzone is a rear horror film but if you happen to find it rent it. It's an atmospheric welldone horrorscifi film with excellent performances a smart script very nice special effects and a good if farfetchedplot. Enjoy!710.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable but kinda boring...";
	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Shadowzone for the first time tonight and as a big fan of horrormonster movies and Bmovies in general I was looking forward to it. What I thought this was going to be was a big low budget monster movie where a science experiment goes awry and everyone needs to escape to hope to survive. And that's kinda what it is ... but there are A LOT of slow moving scenes of nothing but people talking.  It's not like I would be even mad at that except for the fact that it's not what we're promised on the cover of the DVD! On the cover we see a picture of some alienish looking monster wearing a tattered lab coat so we can assume that would what happens to James Hong's character Dr. Van Fleet. But it isn't ... no we never see such a character and Hong's character doesn't transform into anything. In fact for a movie that puts the monster front and center on the cover we hardly ever see it and when we do it's just little 5 second glimpses. And I thought maybe it's going the route of the big reveal in the climax and then we'll see it on screen for a decent amount of time? No! Not even then in the final act of the film we finally see it up close and can it's entire body but it's only on screen for about 2 minutes. It looks cool you can definitely tell it's low budget but that's ok but it barely gets any screen time. That was a major disappointment for me I was ready to see the monster I was promised on the cover but never saw it.  What saved this movie from being a total snoozefest we're the characters. James Hong is always fun to see we have his female assistant who for some reason is always putting chapstick on the other hot bombshell blonde scientist a black guy who's a computer whiz a fat smoking female cook who used to run a whorehouse and a hillbilly maintenance man named Shivers. Also our main protagonist the Nasa investigator played by David Beecroft who out of all the characters is unfortunately the most boring. He just has no personality whatsoever he never seems bothered when anyone dies and mostly all he does is stand around and ask questions. He doesn't really even figure anything out it's all the people around him that do all the work clearly he should not have been the main focus. All the other characters have quirks and funny attitudes that when they play off each other is entertaining to watch.  Other than that there's really not much to this movie the ending is a pretty big anticlimax. It doesn't really end it just sorta stops. It's as if the film makers said well that's all we really had so we're done the end. Again if this movie put it's focus on the monster instead of endless scenes about the science experiments if Hong is a bad guy or good guy what's going on in the facility a weird dream sequence that didn't really make a whole lot of sense animals ... because they were testing on animals before I think. Yeah it just got so boring and you so don't care I just wanted to see the monster come out and rip people to shreds. People do get ripped to shreds ... offscreen! Yeah we don't really see much it's mostly just blood splatters and then cut to the aftermath again with a few 2 second glimpses of the monster.  One more thing I really didn't get is why is a Nasa investigator there? This had nothing at all to do with space travel. The scientists were conducting experiments having to do with sleep. The experiment was honestly kinda hard to follow a person in a glass tube slept and somehow through some sceincetechno babble a portal to another dimension the Shadowzone was opened up and the monster came out through their body. It was a bit confusing to follow but a monster came from another dimension how doesn't really matter. Anyway this Nasa scientist doesn't even look like he works for Nasa he looks like a marine more than anything else. He has dog tags around his neck and never once even mentions Nasa all they say is he's from there. Which on a sidenote Nasa has investigators?  All in all if you like corny shlock scifi horror or the movies of Full Moon pictures you'll like this. For me I do like both of those but this one was just a bit to slow and not enough monster. I did really enjoy some parts of it though which is why I can't say it was a total let down. The cinematography is nice it builds a decent atmosphere around the characters builds up suspense well and has a very nice Bmovie horror theme song. Shadowzone is definitely a movie to make fun of while you're watching. Gather up a few friends and some beers and you'll have an enjoyable time with it.".

Actually it's been quite awhile since I've last watched SHADOWZONE maybe around 15 years. My memory was rather fuzzy but watching this little bfilm again after all these years. It remained a diverting downpat viewing. Mainly it reminded me of those plethora cheap Alien ripoffs and boy this film lifts some setups from ALIEN. I must admit it wasn't as exciting as I remembered nonetheless it was actually efficiently made by J.S Cardone for such a limited looking production.When it's not simply splashing blood against walls as the victims get attacked for most part offscreen there are a few effective moments of suitably grotesque makeup FX and a touch of splatter. You can't fail with a head explosion. Even the creature design and we do get a good look at it provides solid enough practical effects despite the stiff movements. The script's theory behind its origin structural metabolism and how it adapts to survive is rather creative yet it's hodgepodge as the science behind all of this commotion is nonsensical and poorly expanded on sometimes even stalling and taking away from the simpleminded fun.The mystery of what's going on in this underground facility slowly builds up to the danger that will unfold. Now that's when stupidity comes into play to keep the story moving and to cause some deaths. Don't you just love it when our heroine needs something to destroy the computers so he heads out the corridor to find an emergency axe in a glass case. Um just wait a minute  It's been there all this time untouched no one thought of using it when you got a hostile creature from a parallel dimension lurking about. Things don't start off that seriously though with the script providing moments of morbid humor but once the creature hits the scene that changes and the cheap tight surroundings gets claustrophobic trapping the occupants inside.The turning point is when James Hong who was appearing in nearly everything that was lowbudget horror related in the late 80s to early 90s decides to get himself knocked off. I was disappointed by that but Louise Fletcher Miguel A.

This is not an ordinary monstercreatureonthelooseinanundergroundfacility flick. Because the creature has the ability to alter its molecular structure and take the shape of your most deepest fears. The acting is pretty decent especially Louise Fletcher yes the headnurse from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Dave Beecroft who kinda looks like a younger version of Fred Ward. James Hong was also fun to see as Dr. Van Fleet losing control over his experiments. The special effects were rather good as is the case in any early Full Moon film with a highlight being a bloody headexplosion complete with popping veins and all. The climax near the end wasn't anything special but the ending nevertheless was sorta satisfying. I'd say If you haven't seen any Full Moon film yet then you might as well start with this one.".

This number is stunning for two reasons it's a dance of a breakup and it's the dance which may have been their most difficult to film. Because Astaire's mantra was uncut or nearly uncut dance numbers his duets with Rogers were usually all done in one unbroken camera shot. In Never Gonna Dance the action travels from one dance floor up two curved staircases to another cutting only one time to a final 2shot showing Rogers gloriously spinning in and out of Astaire's arms several times before making a dramatic exit.

All of their films together are excellent but Swing Time is set apart because it takes a much more realistic look at love and life. This film handles the love affair between Astaire and Rogers' characters in a way that none of the other films did. The romance is touching sweet charming  and believable! The songs are amazing including Pick Yourself Up The Waltz In Swing Time A Fine Romance Never Gonna Dance and The Way You Look Tonight which is the greatest love song ever written. The scene where Astaire sings this to Rogers is not to be missed. His reaction to her touch  in this scene as well as in the Fine Romance scene  is priceless. Watch for another nottobemissed moment also in the Fine Romance scene as Rogers uses every feminine trick in the book to try to get Astaire to respond. Although this goes without saying the dancing in Swing Time is superb. I hardly know words that are sufficient to describe the beauty that is the bittersweet dance number Never Gonna Dance. The emotion in this scene is phenomenal. It is absolutely exquisite. If Fred  Ginger had indeed never danced  before or after  to any other number this alone would have made them famous. It is the most beautiful dance ever recorded in motion picture history. Every time I rewatch this film I'm always caught off guard by the sheer beauty of this one scene. For this reason alone Swing Time is definitely a must see film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SWING TIME RKO Radio 1936 directed by George Stevens marks the sixth screen teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and if not their masterpiece their best collaboration together. Aside from the predictable storyline that succeeds in presenting itself as an original screenplay its their most lavish and stylish production with the most memorable songs ever scored for a motion picture compliments of Jerome Kern. Yet it's richness in sets and costumes makes one forget that this very expensive looking film was done at the height of the Great Depression.The story begins with John Lucky Garnett Fred Astaire a professional dancer finishing up with his stage performance and about to leave the theater and marry Margaret Watson Betty Furness his childhood sweetheart. Because his friend Pop Cardetti Victor Moore feels his marriage would be a mistake he succeeds into getting Lucky whose biggest weakness is gambling into a game of cards with his colleagues while others arrange to take time and have a tailor fix his pants by having cuffs put on them while in reality his pants don't need cuffs. By the time he arrives at his wedding the guests and preacher have long gone. Lucky persuades Margaret and her angry father Landers Stevens who disapproves of dancers that if he can make 25000 for his professional dancing he can return to Margaret and claim her as his bride. The old man readily agrees to this idea and all is forgiven. Lucky and Pop train ride to New York City where while walking down the streets a misunderstanding occurs between them and a young lady Ginger Rogers involving a lucky quarter belonging to Pop in which a policeman Edgar Dearing enters the scene and sends the lady on her way. Trying to square himself Lucky follows the girl Penelope Carroll to the dance studio where she works. He pretends to enroll in a class and has Penny as his teacher. Her employer Mr. Gordon Eric Blore fires Penny for insulting her pupil whom she finds annoying whom she finds annoying and incapable of learning how to dance but Lucky squares things by demonstrating how much Penny has taught him in one easy lesson. Amazed by the accomplishment Gordon arranges for Penny and Lucky to dance professionally at the Silver Scandal Night Club.

Unlike the traditional blackface clichs Astaire avoids the use of whiteness around the lips and presents himself in a complete tanned facial makeup dressed in derby and spotted jacket. The scene where he dances in front of three shadows of himself on the wall has to be seen to really be appreciated. There's no doubt this was the best eight musical minutes ever recorded on film. Thank goodness due to political correctness that this number was never known to have been deleted from television prints. After seeing Bojangles of Harlem one would wonder how Astaire could ever top this?

Great stuff.SWING TIME brings back Helen Broderick of TOP HAT 1935 fame for the second and final time supporting Astaire and Rogers once more delivering wisecracks in her deadpan manner and her first of several opposite Victor Moore. As with each passing movie Ginger Rogers has groomed into an attractive young lady. By this time her vocalization has matured no longer the highpitch girlish singer she once was in FLYING DOWN TO RIO 1933. Eric Blore a regular in five Astaire and Rogers musicals has less to do here than in his other collaboration with them. This time he sports a mustache isn't playing either a waiter or butler.SWING TIME available on video cassette and DVD and formerly presented on American Movie Classics is shown regularly on Turner Classic Movies. To watch SWING TIME for the 50th time is like watching it for the first. Highly recommended particularly during the late hours or during a cold snowy afternoon considering how snow does cover a lot of ground during the second half of the story. ".

	onyx:emotionText "SWING TIME RKO Radio 1936 directed by George Stevens marks the sixth screen teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and if not their masterpiece their best collaboration together. Aside from the predictable storyline that succeeds in presenting itself as an original screenplay its their most lavish and stylish production with the most memorable songs ever scored for a motion picture compliments of Jerome Kern. Yet it's richness in sets and costumes makes one forget that this very expensive looking film was done at the height of the Great Depression.The story begins with John Lucky Garnett Fred Astaire a professional dancer finishing up with his stage performance and about to leave the theater and marry Margaret Watson Betty Furness his childhood sweetheart. Because his friend Pop Cardetti Victor Moore feels his marriage would be a mistake he succeeds into getting Lucky whose biggest weakness is gambling into a game of cards with his colleagues while others arrange to take time and have a tailor fix his pants by having cuffs put on them while in reality his pants don't need cuffs. By the time he arrives at his wedding the guests and preacher have long gone. Lucky persuades Margaret and her angry father Landers Stevens who disapproves of dancers that if he can make 25000 for his professional dancing he can return to Margaret and claim her as his bride. The old man readily agrees to this idea and all is forgiven. Lucky and Pop train ride to New York City where while walking down the streets a misunderstanding occurs between them and a young lady Ginger Rogers involving a lucky quarter belonging to Pop in which a policeman Edgar Dearing enters the scene and sends the lady on her way. Trying to square himself Lucky follows the girl Penelope Carroll to the dance studio where she works. He pretends to enroll in a class and has Penny as his teacher. Her employer Mr. Gordon Eric Blore fires Penny for insulting her pupil whom she finds annoying whom she finds annoying and incapable of learning how to dance but Lucky squares things by demonstrating how much Penny has taught him in one easy lesson. Amazed by the accomplishment Gordon arranges for Penny and Lucky to dance professionally at the Silver Scandal Night Club. Along the way Lucky gambles his way to success by winning a game of cards to obtain an orchestra leader Ricardo Romero Georges Metaxa who loves Penny and jealous of her dancing partner. As for Pop he finds middleaged companionship with Mabel Anderson Helen Broderick Penny's coworker best friend and roommate.

It helps though that Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields worked in writing some of the most beautiful melodies heard in the movie.Swing Time is a pretext to present the stars doing what they did best dancing!

We know what comes after that. Penny and Lucky were made for one another and it will take the rest of the movie for they to realize this fact and for us to watch some amazing production numbers.The funniest sequence has to be when Lucky Penny Pop and Mabel decide to take a ride to the New Amsterdam resort during a snow storm in a convertible!

Ginger Rogers is also appealing as the object of Mr. Astaire's attentions. Victor Moore as Pop is not as funny as perhaps the film makers wanted him to be but Helen Broderick as Mabel was excellent. Eric Blore Betty Furness and Georges Metaxa and the rest of the cast do their best to support the principals.This film is a joy to watch thanks to Mr. Astaire and Ms. Rogers under Mr. Stevens' direction.".

One of their best dance numbers together is the spontaneous and fun Pick Yourself Up where Fred is in overly formal attire and Ginger wears a cute black business dress. Fred's big moment in the sun however is the legendary Bojangles of Harlem number. Many people today object to it because Fred dances in black face but I feel it's totally misunderstood. Instead of the awful grotesque black face Al Jolson wore pitch black face with white lips Fred wears tasteful theatrical makeup think Laurence Olivier as Othello. Also Fred isn't doing a jig in a cotton field and eating watermelon the backdrop is a city with glamorous backup dancers. It's not a racist parody it's one great dancer's tribute to another that's who Bojangles was after all. Forget what's on Fred's face just watch him display a talent no one sees anymore.

But when I learnt recently that these numbers all originated from the same production I was surprised.I had the pleasure of seeing this picture for the first time over the Christmas holidays 2004 and was entranced by the execution of these compositions in their original form. Of course much of the credit goes to Dorothy Field's lyrics  perfectly delivered by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. No wonder Irving Berlin and George Gershwin also wrote for them. We should remember that Astaire the vocalist is the equal of Astaire the dancer! Notwithstanding Kerns's melodies  which like Mozart's piano concertos are pure and simple but undoubtedly the work of a master  it is also the sexual chemistry of Astaire and Rogers that is expertly conveyed by Stevens and far ahead of its time! Forget Mike Nichol's Closer 2004 it is George Steven's Swing Time 1936 which suggests the leading players and their companions have an interesting private life and are far nicer people than Closer's protagonists too!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Swing Time 1936' is typically held as one of the finest Fred Astaire and Gingers Rogers musicals of which nine were made between 1933 and 1939 ' The Barkleys of Broadway 1949' would follow a decade later. Directed by George Stevens the film abandons the oftensilly mistaken identity subplots of previous films and presents a more credible love story supplemented by some of the most remarkable dance numbers I've yet had of enjoyment of seeing. Replete with the usual stock of enjoyable comedic actors 'Swing Time' is a professionallyproduced film and Astaire and Rogers as always bounce off one another exceedingly well. Though the storyline isn't quite as entertaining as in 'Top Hat 1935' or 'Shall We Dance 1937' the picture relies purely on its terrific dance routines to elevate it to such a high status. Jerome Kern provided the film's music and Dorothy Fields wrote the lyrics including the Oscarwinning song The Way You Look Tonight.John Lucky Garnett Astaire loves hometown sweetheart Margaret Betty Furness and wants to marry her or at least he thought he did. After the mastergambler moves to New York City to acquire a 25000 dowry for the wedding he comes upon beautiful dance instructor Penny Carroll Rogers immediately recognising that she is the woman for him. Wasting no time to consider the logic of his actions Lucky signs up for dancing lessons and his incredible progress leads the pair towards considerable success. A promising romance begins to bloom but Lucky cannot bear to tell Penny that he's already engaged to marry another woman at the same time he deliberately resists achieving success in his gambling activities lest he win enough money to return home to Margaret. Pop Cardetti Victor Moore and Mabel Anderson Helen Broderick knowing members of an older generation stand around to witness the pair's irregular romance and form a close friendship of their own though everything is thrown into turmoil when sleazy musician Ricky Romero Georges Metaxa attempts to coax Penny from Lucky's grasp.The absence of Edward Everett Horton unfortunately detracts from the effectiveness of the film's comedy though Victor Moore provides an amusing substitute his tone and mannerisms are so ridiculously adorable that he could accurately be described as a reallife Elmer Fudd. Jerome Kern's musical numbers vary from lighthearted tap dance numbers Pick Yourself Up to sarcastic quicksteps A Fine Romance to a virtuoso emotionfilled ballroom routine Never Gonna Dance perhaps the most stirring performance that Astaire and Rogers ever did. There's a certain indescribable desperation to the way in which the two dancers leap and twirl across the dance floor their movements escalating almost imperceptibly from an idle walk and Rogers' long dress twists and turns in the air behind her. In Astaire's continual search for creative perfection his routines were filmed wherever possible in a single take and this particular number was attempted no less than fortyseven times. Also notable is Astaire's frenetic tribute to Bill Bojangles Robinson performing in blackface against three tall synchronised shadows on the wall behind him.".

Directed by George Stevens the film abandons the oftensilly mistaken identity subplots of previous films and presents a more credible love story supplemented by some of the most remarkable dance numbers I've yet had of enjoyment of seeing. Replete with the usual stock of enjoyable comedic actors 'Swing Time' is a professionallyproduced film and Astaire and Rogers as always bounce off one another exceedingly well. Though the storyline isn't quite as entertaining as in 'Top Hat 1935' or 'Shall We Dance 1937' the picture relies purely on its terrific dance routines to elevate it to such a high status. Jerome Kern provided the film's music and Dorothy Fields wrote the lyrics including the Oscarwinning song The Way You Look Tonight.John Lucky Garnett Astaire loves hometown sweetheart Margaret Betty Furness and wants to marry her or at least he thought he did. After the mastergambler moves to New York City to acquire a 25000 dowry for the wedding he comes upon beautiful dance instructor Penny Carroll Rogers immediately recognising that she is the woman for him. Wasting no time to consider the logic of his actions Lucky signs up for dancing lessons and his incredible progress leads the pair towards considerable success. A promising romance begins to bloom but Lucky cannot bear to tell Penny that he's already engaged to marry another woman at the same time he deliberately resists achieving success in his gambling activities lest he win enough money to return home to Margaret. Pop Cardetti Victor Moore and Mabel Anderson Helen Broderick knowing members of an older generation stand around to witness the pair's irregular romance and form a close friendship of their own though everything is thrown into turmoil when sleazy musician Ricky Romero Georges Metaxa attempts to coax Penny from Lucky's grasp.The absence of Edward Everett Horton unfortunately detracts from the effectiveness of the film's comedy though Victor Moore provides an amusing substitute his tone and mannerisms are so ridiculously adorable that he could accurately be described as a reallife Elmer Fudd. Jerome Kern's musical numbers vary from lighthearted tap dance numbers Pick Yourself Up to sarcastic quicksteps A Fine Romance to a virtuoso emotionfilled ballroom routine Never Gonna Dance perhaps the most stirring performance that Astaire and Rogers ever did. There's a certain indescribable desperation to the way in which the two dancers leap and twirl across the dance floor their movements escalating almost imperceptibly from an idle walk and Rogers' long dress twists and turns in the air behind her. In Astaire's continual search for creative perfection his routines were filmed wherever possible in a single take and this particular number was attempted no less than fortyseven times. Also notable is Astaire's frenetic tribute to Bill Bojangles Robinson performing in blackface against three tall synchronised shadows on the wall behind him.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Astaire and Rogers partnership was in its third year and at its peak in quality and popularity when producer Pandro S. Berman decided to switch director Mark Sandrich who had the helmed classics The Gay Divorce Top Hat and Follow the Fleet with upandcoming George Stevens. Stevens' background was in B comedy and he had recently graduated to A drama with 1935's Alice Adams so had been judged ready to handle the franchise that was RKO's biggest moneymaker. The resulting film was the greatest of the AstaireRogers pictures and a highlight of the 30s musical.Although Stevens did not have the light rhythmic touch that characterises the Sandrich musicals he added an emotional depth that the series had never had before. Fred and Ginger were a pair of talented dancers with a flair for comedy and RKO had never used them for anything more than that. Stevens really allows them to act. The overall plot is in the same vein of romantic comedy as Top Hat yet here and there is a little hint of poignancy. For example when Astaire's old band mates hunker down and begin gambling with their earnings he gives a quick mournful look he as strolls past them as if he knows he's losing a part of his life. Later when Ginger realises that Fred's fianc is in the room she is held in a lengthy closeup and emotes brilliantly for the camera. The significance of these little moments is that they make us really care about the characters the way we cared about Katherine Hepburn in Alice Adams. We want their relationship to work rather than simply wait for the inevitable conclusion.Of course Stevens was also a brilliant comedy director and he is always willing to punctuate the most sentimental moments with a gag such as when The Way you Look Tonight ironically ends with Astaire turning round and realising Rogers actually looks a bit of a sight as she is halfway through washing her hair.As well as the different director Swing Time also sees something of a shakeup to the regular supporting cast. It makes a change to see Eric Blore playing something other than a butler for once and the marvellous comic actress Helen Broderick is thankfully back after almost stealing the show as far as comedy was concerned in Top Hat. Georges Metaxa seems to be a replacement for the pretentious foreign loverival normally played by Erik Rhodes and while not as comical as Rhodes does not do at all badly. On the other hand Victor Moore while very good is not a patch on Edward Everett Horton who is the perfect buddy for Astaire.A common misconception about musicals of the 1930s is that they were not integrated  that is the songs were musical breaks inserted into the narrative rather than being part of the story in themselves. Of course this is not the case as a glance at the Ernst Lubitsch Paramount musicals will prove but even those of Astaire and Rogers had their own form of integration. While it's true that the numbers tended to be fairly generic love songs functioning mainly to lead into a dance routine it was the dances themselves that often carried the plot along and revealed character. Every up and down of the romance revolved around a dance and the first time Fred and Ginger dance together that's the moment they fall in love.In the case of Swing Time the songs actually do bear some relevance to the storyline thanks mainly to some intelligent lyrics by Dorothy Fields. Jerome Kern also provides some fantastically soulful music that goes handinhand with the picture's deeper emotional feel. And let's not forget the amazing dance numbers dreamed up by Astaire and choreographer Hermes Pan. The routines in these pictures were becoming increasingly extravagant and inventive as Pan continuously tried to outdo his last effort and there is a sense of his clutching at straws for fresh ideas in the later pictures as the series' popularity declined. Here however the choreography is still on top form and the Bojangles of Harlem number has to rank among his best.Perhaps the biggest difference between the musicals of the 30s and those that came later is not how integrated they were but how seriously the genre could be taken. The plots of 30s musicals were always clichd throwaway romantic comedies whereas the musicals of the 40s 50s and 60s had grown up into fullyfledged dramas equally capable of tackling weighty issues or inducing tears as they were at delighting with song and dance. In that light the touching romance of Swing Time makes it something of a milestone. However while the musical genre would continue to move onwards and upwards the AstaireRogers franchise would never be this good again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Astaire's character Lucky may depend on the turn of a card or the spin of a roulette wheel to decide his fate but Fred Astaire did not. He and Ginger Rogers whom he pursues here as usual through several contretemps put in an enormous amount of work. Astaire insisted that there be few cuts during the dance numbers. Thus for instance when Astair and Rogers launch into Waltz in Swing Time which requires especially heroic effort from Rogers the whole intricate number isn't cut at all. This technique naturally involved multiple takes. In the case of Never Gonna Dance towards the end fortyseven takes were required. Imagine. You can put yourself through three or four minutes of strenuous thoroughly memorized dance steps after hundreds of hours of planning and rehearsal flub the last step and you have to start all over again. Whatever they were paying Astaire and Rogers it was hardly enough.The film gets off to a bit of a slow start. There is some fluff about whether Astaire's pants should have cuffs or not. The Grip Quotient remains the same through the rest of the film which is to say we're not dealing with Citizen Kane here.And the editing. Somewhere along the time line Astaire must have promised Rogers that he would quit gambling because when she finds him apparently betting on cards it leads to their third or is it fourth? breakup. The scene in which Astaire makes the promise however never made it into the final cut. No matter.It's the musical numbers that count and these are about as good as they come. The tunes are by Jerome Kern one of them won an Academy Award and the often amusing and sometimes touching lyrics are by Dorothy Fields. Some of the songs are likely to be familiar. Pick Yourself Up Dust Yourself Off and Start All Over Again. A Fine Romance With No Kisses. Just the Way You Look Tonight. Others may not have entered the national songbook but are spectacular in their own right. I cannot imagine anyone but Astaire doing that frenetic Bojangles number in one threeandahalf minute take without cuts. I don't mean just because it was flawless. I mean I can't imagine anyone doing it without inviting an acute infraction of the myoculinary flopping all over the place like a marionette being flung about by some puppeteer on crystal meth. Most people could make a thousand mistakes trying to do it and still drop dead of a heart attack.That number by the way is done in blackface a sorry tradition left over from minstrel shows. But this number was staged and designed as a tribute to a specific performer Bill Bojangles Robinson a popular dancer of the 1930s who appeared in several movies including one or two with Shirley Temple and Astaire's makeup avoids the crudity of the usual blackface which even Bert Williams an AfricanAmerican himself needed to wear during his numbers.The songs are by Jerome Kern the lyrics by Dorothy Fields. They include A Fine Romance Pick Yourself Up and The Way You Look Tonight which won an Oscar. The last Oscarwinning song I'm aware of is Take My Breath Away from Top Gun. What happened to vernacular music? Was there a train wreck or something? Thoroughly enjoyable  or almost. You get a pass if you nod out during some of the comic interludes featuring Victor Moore.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the day of his wedding to Margaret Watson John Lucky Garnett is tricked by the other members of his dance troupe into missing the ceremony. He goes to apologise and make amends but Mr Watson refuses to let them marry unless Lucky can apologise to the tune of 25000. Keen to get married Lucky resolves to go to New York with his natural dancing talent and make the money that way. Once there he meets dancer Penny Carroll and the two strike up a relationship despite the obstacles of Lucky being committed to someone else and a band master who refuses to play for them to dance.At the start the film stutters into life and sets us up with an uncomfortable backdrop of Lucky's engagement to another girl. This played on my mind for a little while because I felt it unfair for the film to basically turn us against Margaret in order that we would support Lucky and Penny but it is to the film's credit that this was swept aside quite quickly by a series of breezy and enjoyable songs and dance numbers. They all sound and look great even if the blacked up number runs the risk of having the PC brigade grumbling and mumbling to themselves. The only problem comes near the end where the issue over Margaret needs to be resolved and it is all done too easily and just felt like a bit of a whitewash or cop out. In fairness to do it more convincingly would have risked ruining the light and fun mood of the film.Needless to say both Astaire and Rogers are great and have a lovely chemistry between them and it also goes without saying that they move together as if they were images in a mirror. Support is also good from Moore and Broderick although I did feel a little bad for Furness being stuck in a secondary and thankless role. Overall though they all work well together and produce a film that is wonderfully light and entertaining and despite being in black and white seems to colourful and bright throughout. Some minor details may slightly bother viewers but generally it is a great film and refreshingly fun.".

Gone are the production numbers which comprised of a cast of a thousand dancers and the other couple usually Randolph Scott paired with a singer. Instead Swing Time pares down the excesses and highlights its musical gifts and what musical gifts they are! Jerome Kern's score is his best and so affectingly sung by Astaire. The Bojangles number is the stuff of legend and the poignant Never Gonna Dance communicates the highs and lows of love as eloquently as a Shakespeare sonnet. I recommend this movie highly.".

There's nothing to complain about in the dancing either the standout is easily Never Gonna Dance just perfection in every meaning of the word and Fred and Ginger probably haven't done a dance more beautiful or emotionally moving. It in particular shows off Astaire's effortless grace and style perfectly. The choreography has a lot of spirit and pizazz done with an appropriately light touch as well as touches of the dramatic. The script is goodnatured and amusing with some sweet parts too. Special mention should also go to the dialogue scene preceding Never Gonna Dance which is very poignant maybe the most poignant dialogue scene of any of their films. Fred and Ginger are delightful together and play their characters with great charm. Victor Moore acts with energy and enthusiasm but one does wish there was much more of Eric Blore.

When his marriage plans to Margaret Watson Betty Furness are temporarily foiled he hops a train to New York with his sidekick Pop Everett Victor Moore hoping to earn enough money to satisfy his future fatherinlaw. What he finds there however is inevitably true love with Penny Carroll Ginger Rogers a sweetheart of a dance instructress who falls quickly for Lucky's charm and fast feet. Although Lucky feels guilty about his fiancee back home he finds it difficult to deny his growing attraction to Penny.It isn't really difficult to figure out how the story endsit wouldn't be a AstaireRogers romanticcomedyslashmusical if Lucky and Penny didn't end up together. But what makes this stand apart from TOP HAT and in fact stand proud while doing so is how that inevitable love story is told simply and effectively and most importantly in a credible fashion. While watching TOP HAT I was too busy holding my breath at the sheer technical finesse involved in the dance sequences to really care that neither the characters nor their relationship with each other was very welldeveloped. Plot? What plot? It just really did not seem to matter with that film what mattered was that we were treated to a gorgeouslychoreographed songdance sequence practically every other minute. Which still does not make it a bad film just a slightly uneven one that relies on the charm of its leads to succeed.SWING TIME certainly has its own faults most notably repeating the reaction Ginger Rogers's character has to a perceived wrinkle in her relationship with the Astaire characterthat is impulsively marrying or nearly marrying the nearest person who happens to be male and who has a crush on her. The ending especially Ricky Romero's response to Penny's decision between himself and Lucky really makes one wonder whether the screenwriter for the film decided to clock out early when writing the last few minutes. But this is no less a problem in TOP HAT for some reason Rogers's character in both films always winds up nearlymarried to someone other than Astaire and the film must then take the time to regain the ground that has been lost through this 'plot twist'. For me this is almost salvaged in SWING TIME when Lucky and Penny finally serenade each other with a delightful blend of two of the best songs featured in the film 'A Fine Romance' and 'The Way You Look Tonight'. This minor flaw aside SWING TIME itself is delightfulit's much more a romantic comedy than it is a musical whereas I think this is reversed with TOP HAT. You can't help but warm to the relationship between Penny and Lucky particularly when she complains about the state of their 'Fine Romance'decidely one of my favourite songs in the film tough competition considering the fabulous Jerome Kern score! and a lovely touch that it is actually Rogers's character doing the pursuing for once. This number sung amidst whirling snow recalls my favourite song in TOP HAT in which Jerry is asking Dale 'Isn't This A Lovely Day?' while they're caught in a storm. The musical numbers are not compromised howeverthe dance Astaire and Rogers perform to 'Pick Yourself Up' is fantastic as is what appears to be their last dance together when Lucky tells Penny that he's 'Never Gonna Dance' without her again. As with Astaire's blackface solo in 'Bojangles...' the dance sequences are truly amazing to watch but happily not the focus of the entire film. In fact they are somewhat more lowkey and understated than those in TOP HATfar less sweeping and dramatic dances and more believable ones that fit perfectly with the story and the characters.SWING TIME is without a doubt one of the best movie musicals I've ever seen and to date my favourite FredGinger film. It's one of those films that's almost a masterpiece without trying and that's probably the best recommendation I could give it. Mandatory for FredGinger fans and for fans of the musical genre in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the height of its television popularity a New York TV station ran Swing Time twice a night for a whole week. Even before digital program recording people were timing it so they could tune in to every showing catching the magical moment when Fred Astaire performs his legendary dance sequence in Bojangles of Harlem.Later they would wait for the wonderful pairing with Ginger Rogers where chemistry would sparkle from beneath her long lashes to the tips of her toes. And although I've also enjoyed it on the small screen several times nothing can compare with the wonder of experiencing it in a movie theatre. The dance becomes alive. We feel not only the rush of movement but being caught up in the moment and seeing the fine details of expression so hard to appreciate when reduced in size. Swing Time is rightly regarded by many fans and critics as Fred and Ginger's greatest movie together. A movie to laugh and cry with. It was even referenced in Barack Obama's inauguration speech. The story is imaginative the goodnatured gags bring a smile to your face when remembered and the songs and dance routines live on forever. Fred and Ginger exude a joy of performance and a skill of execution that can make you gasp This is what dancing is all about!The dances are almost always performed in a single take showing the whole dancer's body. No mistakes. No special effects. But dancing that sets the standard for generations to come. They look carefree and relaxed  as dancers should  but each move each throwaway gesture and expression had been minutely rehearsed until it was beyond perfect. It was perfect and then had added charisma warmth and acting infused into it. The charm of Fred Astaire's onscreen character reputedly very close to his real life persona and the unaffected femininity of Ginger Rogers make them the partners that every dancer longs to trip the light fantastic with. Astaire is the epitome of style elegance and good taste. The embodiment of the 'gentleman' but without stuffiness. He woos the girl gets out of problematic situations and is a good friend. Witty repartee alights from his lips to disarm every attack and entice very woman into his arms at once making her feel like the most special woman that ever lived.Occasionally one wonders why Rogers achieved more fame in his arms than any of his other dance partners many of whom exceeded her in professional training and maybe even looks. Perhaps the answer is that she is not just a perfect dancer but a perfect partner. Who wants to dance with someone who just loves themself? Rogers both in her performance of dance steps and in the attitude she emanates dances as part of a partnership  seemingly made in heaven. As if both people are dancing from the same inner source. Watch her in their first dance together in Swing Time. After the initial gags he takes her back into the dance studio to save her job in front of the boss. For the first section of the dance she is the backdrop discretely watching and following Astaire the man taking the lead. It's a basic polka with added syncopation and tap steps.

	onyx:emotionText "At the height of its television popularity a New York TV station ran Swing Time twice a night for a whole week. Even before digital program recording people were timing it so they could tune in to every showing catching the magical moment when Fred Astaire performs his legendary dance sequence in Bojangles of Harlem.Later they would wait for the wonderful pairing with Ginger Rogers where chemistry would sparkle from beneath her long lashes to the tips of her toes. And although I've also enjoyed it on the small screen several times nothing can compare with the wonder of experiencing it in a movie theatre. The dance becomes alive. We feel not only the rush of movement but being caught up in the moment and seeing the fine details of expression so hard to appreciate when reduced in size. Swing Time is rightly regarded by many fans and critics as Fred and Ginger's greatest movie together. A movie to laugh and cry with. It was even referenced in Barack Obama's inauguration speech. The story is imaginative the goodnatured gags bring a smile to your face when remembered and the songs and dance routines live on forever. Fred and Ginger exude a joy of performance and a skill of execution that can make you gasp This is what dancing is all about!The dances are almost always performed in a single take showing the whole dancer's body. No mistakes. No special effects. But dancing that sets the standard for generations to come. They look carefree and relaxed  as dancers should  but each move each throwaway gesture and expression had been minutely rehearsed until it was beyond perfect. It was perfect and then had added charisma warmth and acting infused into it. The charm of Fred Astaire's onscreen character reputedly very close to his real life persona and the unaffected femininity of Ginger Rogers make them the partners that every dancer longs to trip the light fantastic with. Astaire is the epitome of style elegance and good taste. The embodiment of the 'gentleman' but without stuffiness. He woos the girl gets out of problematic situations and is a good friend. Witty repartee alights from his lips to disarm every attack and entice very woman into his arms at once making her feel like the most special woman that ever lived.Occasionally one wonders why Rogers achieved more fame in his arms than any of his other dance partners many of whom exceeded her in professional training and maybe even looks. Perhaps the answer is that she is not just a perfect dancer but a perfect partner. Who wants to dance with someone who just loves themself? Rogers both in her performance of dance steps and in the attitude she emanates dances as part of a partnership  seemingly made in heaven. As if both people are dancing from the same inner source. Watch her in their first dance together in Swing Time. After the initial gags he takes her back into the dance studio to save her job in front of the boss. For the first section of the dance she is the backdrop discretely watching and following Astaire the man taking the lead. It's a basic polka with added syncopation and tap steps. She is the tapestry upon which he shines. The good woman behind every good man. Then as they relax into the routine her steps become more decorative sparkling jewels adorning their performance together. For those fond of the oftquoted line Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did except backwards and in high heels this is a great example tap dancing in black high heels!

The latter reprises the entire musical score including the beautiful The Way you Look Tonight and A Fine Romance performed earlier in gently falling snow. Ginger looks lovely and the art deco nightclub sets are spectacular. The acting is more finely nuanced than in many of the other AstaireRogers vehicles. The story line is thin but you really care about Lucky and Penny. Even the blackface number which originally turned me off was done with grace and homage to a great dancer Bill Robinson. Although the number from Top Hat Top Hat White Tie and Tails is quintessential Fred Astaire his Bojangles is a much more complicated and creative undertaking. It's amazing.Enjoy Fred singing the title song in Flying Down to Rio or the electric Carioca number which started this unique partnership. Drink in the dance of seduction from The Gay Divorce Night and Day chuckle at the convoluted plot with corespondents passwords a husband who is a bigamist and the overthetop dance The Continental. Marvel at Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and the fun I'd Be Hard to Handle song and tap dance from Roberta. Suspend belief at the dance and ending of Let's Face the Music and Dance from Follow the Fleet not to mention the competition dancing in that movie. Evesdrop on the romantic twosome from Top Hat as they glide through Cheek to Cheek. Listen to Fred singing They Can't Take That Away From Me and Ginger both singing and dancing to They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus from the romp Shall We Dance. Laugh at the comedy of Ginger Roger's Amanda Cooper in Carefree as you marvel at the slow motion dream sequenceand get energized by The Yam. Wax nostalgic as you view both The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle the famous turn of the century dance team and The Barkley's of Broadway the Fred and Ginger reunion vehicle ten years down the road from their last musical of the 1930s. All of those movies unique and wonderful in their dancing displays but Swing Time which I think should have been calledNever Gonna Dance grabs you not only with great innovative dancingand Ginger really matches Fred step for step in this one but with sensitive direction by George Stevens wonderful tunes and sympathetic characters lovingly and thoughtfully portrayed by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.".

My vote might have gone to the cat. If you've ever owned a cat you can appreciate how unbelievablytrained this feline was in the film. Tonto was amazing! Almost everyone in this film is a good person who tries to befriend Harry and Tonto so you get a good feel throughout this almosttwohour movie.

	schema:reviewBody "A wonderful movie experience that speaks volumes with its quiet methodical pace. Harry and Tonto concerns a retired school teacher in his 70s shocking Oscarwinner Art Carney who is forced to leave the only home he has ever known when his apartment in New York is demolished to make way for a parking garage. Possibly this will be no big deal as he and Tonto his faithful cat decide to go live with his son Philip Burns. Quickly it is apparent though that the arrangement will not work and Carney decides that maybe it is time to see the nation he has never gotten a chance to see before by heading west with a little luggage and his cat of course. Along the way he meets back up with his daughter Ellen Burstyn has his grandson Josh Mostel follow him from New York encounters a strange hitchhiker Melanie Mayron and even has a short jail stay with Chief Dan George. As the trip continues a fine line is developed between Carney's old ties and his new ones. Carney is one of those people who instantly appears to be everyone's lifelong friend. The trip is an opportunity to meet new friends and sometimes very sadly say goodbye to old ones. In the end Carney's journey does not only take him crosscountry it also takes him to new and sometimes forgotten emotional experiences that he desperately needed to have. Harry and Tonto is a simple film that did not rely on a big budget or trivial situations to tell its story. This is a human tale that speaks to anyone who is willing and able to listen. Director and cowriter Paul Mazursky Oscarnominated for the latter created a movie that touches its audience with heart emotion and smarts. Carney is a revelation. He is basically only known for his silly turn on television's The Honeymooners but he proved he could play a part that is very difficult to pull off. Carney only 56 at the time plays much older than he was and received much support come Oscar season some looking suspiciously like sympathy votes. In the end Carney did win Oscar gold over such other names as Al Pacino The Godfather Part II Jack Nicholson Chinatown Dustin Hoffman Lenny and Albert Finney Murder on the Orient Express. In retrospect it is still hard to decide which of those five delivered the finest performance of that year. One thing is for sure though Harry and Tonto is one of those rare movies that always seems to stand the test of time. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

On the way to Chicago he has an adventure meeting different people people that are symbols of the changing society and he learns to cope with them and tries to adapt yet can't find his place in society. Harry must find a place in the world and he intends to find one. This is a heartbreaking poignant and engrossing view into a man's life in old age. Art Carney gives an excellent performance of a man conflicted with changing society and a man who must force himself to adapt whether he likes it or not. Will he ever find his place in the world? You have to watch to see. out of  stars.".

HarryArt Carney is a 72 yearold man displaced from his apartment building in New York that is scheduled for demolition. This is when his journey begins taking him from his son's home and comes across various people along the way including Ginger a 16 yearold hitchhiker a former lover with a shaky memory Geraldine Fitzgerald his bookstore owner daughter ShirleyEllen Burnstyn in Chicago a vitamin salesman a Las Vegas hooker and an Indian Chief. Harry is an intelligent man in his twilight years prone to fussing over his aging cat. The film is good natured and at the same time sad. It plays as a slice of life movie but one thinks of the old saying It is not the destination but the journey that matters. Art Carney gives a very real complex performance while being understated and I am not surprised that he won an Oscar for this film. I am glad that I finally came across this film and certainly appreciate it more as an adult than I did as a kid.".

	schema:reviewBody "from his three children in this film. Art CarneyHarry Coombes talks about the tribulations of Lear but Harry is the only one of his immediate family who has any life force in him. Son Burt Phil Bruns sputters and rants while his wife runs his life and his two sons take off on opposite courses. Number Two son Eddie Larry Hagmandrives a big car lives in Hollywood but hasn't a dime in his pocket while daughter Shirley has been on the marry and divorce merrygoround though she seems to enjoy the bookstore she runs. Harry must see the futility of dividing his world between these three losers. His desire is to find a new home and go on living a meaningful life.The story is not plotdriven which probably accounts for the scarcity of reviews here. The film places its main character in a field of action. Greenfield and Mazursky's script owes a small debt to 'The Idiot' as they take Harry's eviction from his apartment to set him loose in the world at large. Like Myshkin he meets various people all with their own agenda but unlike the Russian hero he does bring about change in some of them.Carney is wonderful though too young for the part. He looks like a man in his fifties who has dyed his hair gray and needs a haircut but once he speaks his words are those of the aged. Listen to his speech and that of those he encounters. Watch how Mazursky and Greenfield do not take the easy way out. Harry's first encounter is with Jesus the clerk who tells him how bananas give him sexual prowess. Harry remarks on this to his friend Jacob but never again does the writers use bananas as a punch line.Instead Mazursky lets Jacob take over the film for a precious few minutes and then uses his death to show us that Harry has more to give the world. I want to bury my friend he tells the bureaucrat at the morgue in an almost angry tone. Mazursky does this again and again letting each character give their motivations and fears an airing. Each gets their five minutes to strut and fret their time and some are allowed more. Melanie Mayron is excellent as the teen girl who picks up with Harry east of Chicago but from the little we see of cabdriver Muriel Beerman as a taxi driver we'd like to see her tell us more of her life. Then there is the still beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald playing an old flame of Harry's. Her mind is beyond the pale now but we are not embarrassed to see her nor is Harry.The only characters I have quibbles about are Josh Mostel not because of his acting but because his charactertype has been seen in other films and we can see what is coming a mile away. Chief Dan George is the same Native American standup comedian he is in Josey Wales and Little Big Man and adds little to the story. By the way how does Harry get out of jail in Vegas?Tonto is a silent Greek chorus a sounding board for Harry and a plot device for the scriptwriters so Harry does not have to fly. Once he has seen Harry to his new world it is time for him to go. Good job Tonto Art Messrs Mazursky and Greenfield and everyone else involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Art Carney's Oscarwinning role as a elderly man who is forced to move out of his NYC apartment and takes a crosscountry trip to California to start a new life with his elderly cat in tow was filled with light comic touches and very moving dramatic moments. Compared to his iconic character Ed Norton Carney's performance as Harry Coombes was relatively lowkey.Some critics played the age veteran or sympathy card when in the spring of 1975 Carney beat out Jack Nicholson Chinatown Al Pacino The Godfather Part II Dustin Hoffman Lenny and Albert Finney Murder on the Orient Express for Best Actor. In retrospect I don't think that was a fair assessment to Carney. In my opinion Carney's later performances in The Late Show and Going in Style were just as good maybe even better than his awardwinning role as Harry Coombes. Carney's win was unexpected but his performance in Harry and Tonto was not a fluke.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Coombes Art Carney was talking about his neighborhood when he made the comment in my summary line above but he could just as easily have been talking about the relationship with his family old friend Jacob or even himself. The story is about running down growing old and reevaluating one's life for missed opportunities and what might have been.I was surprised by another reviewer's mention that Carney took the role after it was written for but turned down by James Cagney. Interestingly Carney and Cagney appeared together a full decade later in the TV movie Terrible Joe Moran in which Cagney portrays the main character not unlike Harry in a lot of ways. In that film Carney is Cagney's neighbor and friend sharing pearls of wisdom with Cagney's estranged granddaughter and the viewer.The story of Harry and Tonto is played in a series of vignettes once Harry is forcibly removed from his New York City apartment making way for an urban parking lot. That in itself is a disquieting commentary on modern life when a commercial parking structure carries more value than human life. Though Harry has every reason to be cynical over the way the lives of his sons and daughter turned out that doesn't seem to be his way as Harry takes it all in stride and appears to rise above the fray. He also has an acceptance of ultimate finality as one is conditioned by the death of Jacob setting us up for the eventual demise of traveling companion Tonto. Still it's hard to keep a dry eye over Harry's loss.My favorite scene was the one with Harry arrested and in jail with cellmate Chief Dan George. As Sam TwoFeathers the Chief is dead pan hilarious discussing how he put the death spell on Edgar Red Bear and how he was once jailed for his horse dumping in a hotel lobby. Quoting his character Old Lodge Skins from the movie Little Big Man  Sometimes the magic works sometimes it doesn't'. Fans of Art Carney will probably agree that in this film most of the time the magic works.".

I happen to identify a lot with this film so I'm rating it a 10 but even if your from another country and another ethnicity you will still be entertained. You know something I really like about this film? The sets that are used don't look fake they look like places that real people would live in not something that a set designer made with the BO stereo I know its the 70's but BO was big than also the perfect furniture the new cars the great clothes etc etc etc. This is a real movie in all respects and as such you are drawn into the characters. Someone here said that they have no interest in watching Carney in the Honeymooners why is that? Carney was awesome in the Honeymooners he mostly did TV so to miss him in the Honeymooners you will be missing a lot he was the equal to Gleason they were a great comic team. I'll give you another of my favorite Carney works The Twighlight Zone where he is the drunk store Santa titled The Night of the Meek my eyes are welling up just thinking of it. I'm sure he's done other things but those stand out I also liked Going In Style but in Harry and Tonto he is the main star. You know what's sad? There is nothing written on IMDb about Art's bio for an actor who brought so much joy to me I would have thought some fan would have written one about him. Harry and Tonto reminds me of my father and I so much I'm the only child but I'm at times of my life all 3 of Harry's kids as he is just like Harry in his elder years cat and all. I wish I had watched this with him he would have really related to it. Use that 9.00 wisely and skip the Scary Movie 4 and get this DVD its great.".

The characters he meets on the road are often just as fun to watch. I particularly liked Chief Dan George fresh off of Little Big Man as the Indian healer Carney meets in a Vegas jail. Arthur Huunicutt playing a vitamin salesman who gives Carney a lift in Arizona steals the show. But it's Carney's show and he deserves his academy award.Because it's not flashy there are no gangsters exorcists or disgruntled police dicks Harry and Tonto is often overlooked in the 70's DVD bin. It's a great ride and it has aged well. Check it out.".

Harry is absolutely and unmistakably Harry an old relic with some superannuated friends and a cat. From here on I may cite some spoilers but I find that essentially all have already been remarked on I just want to comment on what people seem not to have noticed. First notice his amazing resilience. He's past 70 and he has lost nearly every anchor of his life his wife his profession his good friend his lifelong home everything but his cat. I happen to be very near Harry's age and you young folks of 40 or so may not notice what a devastating combination this could have been. he might have moved in with his son's dysfunctional family but he won't give in to that prospect. he might fly to chicago but the nice folks from the TSA won't take his cat and he damnwell won't give him up. He might try taking the bus but Tonto's basic catness shuts out that possibility. I would have understood if Harry had given up at that point got fallingdown drunk and died at the side of the road. But he pushes on. He acquires an old used car that could have been the centerpiece of slapstick scene but wasn't and gains a 15 or 16 or 18 year old girl as a traveling companion admitting to her as they settle into a motel for the night actually I am a little uncomfortable with this. From the viewpoint of my age that is an absolutely delicious line! Harry begins to shed years as he goes on notice him insisting to his daughter that his young friend is not a ''loose woman. When he gives away his car look closely and read his feelings for the girl. Again and again we see his resilience and adaptability in this profoundly human questgenre story. I found the ending at that broad Pacific beach very satisfying though it left open the simplistic question so what happened next? Harry is a marvelous character and the story told just as much about him as was needed no less no more. I came late to this movie but I agree. Art Carney earned his award for thus gentle portrayal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two stars for Geoffrey Rush as Harry Plumber and a star for Eva Martino as Ginger. Otherwise what pointless waste of time this movie was.Let's start with Goldie Hahn as Suzette. For a woman who has been living hard for over 20 years she looks unbelievably good. No woman who has been chain smoking heavily drinking and partying into her late forties is going to retain the obvious sex appeal that Goldie Hahn has.Yet somehow not only has Suzette's lifestyle not put a line on her face it has also imbued her with all manner of wisdom and authenticity. So no  Suzette is not a sad excuse for an adult with barely the resources to keep mind and body together  she's enlightened. I'm sure this will be a huge comfort to all the broke middleaged chainsmoking alcoholic women out there.Susan Sarandon's character Vinni is the stereotypical repressed uptight suburban housewife. Her family doesn't know the real her until throws a chicken breast at her husband during a family dinner very briefly shares some common knowledge about Jim Morrison with her daughters borrows some of Suzette's garish clothes gives herself a bad haircut goes to a club with Suzette to dance and is caught by her husband and older daughter looking at Polaroids of penises from her glory days.Now that we've plumbed the shallow depths of Vinni we can sit through a painfully corny graduation speech given by her overachieving older daughter. She actually says live true about three times as if hearing it once wasn't enough for the audience's popcorn to come back up.One glimmer of entertainment came from Geoffrey Rush's character Harry Plummer as a miserable uptight sexually repressed OCD man who returns to Phoenix AZ as a failed writer. He deserved more film time.The other glimmer was from Eva Martino as Ginger  Vinni's spoiled underachieving screwup of a daughter.BOTTOM LINE If you're into 'chick flicks' that have virtually nothing to do with how actual women relate to each other OR if you're into how much better it is to be a free spirit aka broke with no prospects OR if you're option is a kick in the head or watching this movie ... then go ahead and watch it.".

No woman who has been chain smoking heavily drinking and partying into her late forties is going to retain the obvious sex appeal that Goldie Hahn has.Yet somehow not only has Suzette's lifestyle not put a line on her face it has also imbued her with all manner of wisdom and authenticity. So no  Suzette is not a sad excuse for an adult with barely the resources to keep mind and body together  she's enlightened. I'm sure this will be a huge comfort to all the broke middleaged chainsmoking alcoholic women out there.Susan Sarandon's character Vinni is the stereotypical repressed uptight suburban housewife. Her family doesn't know the real her until throws a chicken breast at her husband during a family dinner very briefly shares some common knowledge about Jim Morrison with her daughters borrows some of Suzette's garish clothes gives herself a bad haircut goes to a club with Suzette to dance and is caught by her husband and older daughter looking at Polaroids of penises from her glory days.Now that we've plumbed the shallow depths of Vinni we can sit through a painfully corny graduation speech given by her overachieving older daughter. She actually says live true about three times as if hearing it once wasn't enough for the audience's popcorn to come back up.One glimmer of entertainment came from Geoffrey Rush's character Harry Plummer as a miserable uptight sexually repressed OCD man who returns to Phoenix AZ as a failed writer. He deserved more film time.The other glimmer was from Eva Martino as Ginger  Vinni's spoiled underachieving screwup of a daughter.BOTTOM LINE If you're into 'chick flicks' that have virtually nothing to do with how actual women relate to each other OR if you're into how much better it is to be a free spirit aka broke with no prospects OR if you're option is a kick in the head or watching this movie ... then go ahead and watch it.";

As a fan of old movies I could never fault a script for being formulaic. Let's face it if you've seen a thousand movies you've seen it all. As long as the writer gets it right a movie can at the very least be admired. In this case it can be appreciated. This movie is fun it doesn't take itself too seriously and there are some important messages remember the importance of being supremely sure of yourself of having a best friend and of hearing Led Zeppelin in concert. It shouldn't be relegated to the category chick flick. It is about a person who seems to drift aimlessly through life and winds up portraying someone who makes a positive impact on many peoples' lives. Watching Goldie'sSuzette's face as she and SusanVinnie start to dance for the first time in 20 years also made me remember something important when women friends dance together it's different than men and women dancing. They enter into a partnership that says for the next few minutes we will do something cool together and sometimes that's an important thing to do.".

Most of her films and performances are really good  and she has been one of the few very few Blond Bombshells with lasting movie power. Personally I think she knows how to choose most of her properties and that helps. THE BANGER SISTERS is a sensible variant on THELMA AND LOUIS which Hawn's costar Susan Sarandon made with Geena Davis years earlier. Unlike that classic which ended in a suicidal drive off a cliff by the heroines this one confronts the issues of individuality reemerging with less destruction as a result. Suzette Hawn has just been fired from her job and is driving in the southwest without any really clear plan for future action. She stops in the desert and picks up Harry Plummer Geoffrey Rush  with a nicely done American accent in this film. Plummer is a writer at beam's end  suffering numerous emotional quirks and a current writer's block all of which he blames on his father. It seems nothing Harry ever did pleased his father. He is going to Phoenix Arizona to confront the old man. Suzette drives him to Phoenix and after they separate she goes to look up her oldest friend Vinnie short for Lavinia  Sarandon. She finds her friend in an upscale section of Phoenix and watches her friend kiss her daughter older daughter Hannah  Ericka Christensen good night as the daughter goes off to her high school graduation prom. Sarandon is certainly dressed like a social matron type now  understandably as we later learn her husband Raymond Kingsley  Robin Thomas is a highly successful lawyer with political aspirations. But this is unsettling to Suzette  when she knew Vinnie they were palling around Los Angeles twenty years later and having a raucous old time.Suzette returns to the hotel that Harry is at and despite his protests camps down there in a spare room. Harry is too neurotic to take advantage of Suzette's freespirit offer of sex but he does allow her to stay. It's lucky she does  Hannah and her fellow students are at their prom in the hotel and Hannah had taken some bad acid and gotten sick. Suzette steps in to help Hannah with this problem and then drives her back to her home. And in doing so she confronts Vinnie.Vinnie recognizes Suzette  and totally misunderstands her being there. She thinks that Suzette is there to get money. Quite hurt at this and an offer to give her 5000.00 Suzette explains she was just driving Hannah home and leaves. Vinnie learns from Hannah that she took drugs and Suzette helped her. Later that morning the still stiffnecked Vinnie visits Suzette in Harry's hotel room and apologizes stiffly and offers to take her to lunch the next day. Suzette accepts.Two plots slowly evolve here. Harry's neuroses towards women crumble as he gets to know what Suzette is like  he even keeps a hot bath for her while she is out driving Hannah back home. Suzette and Vinnie get to know each other and the divide between them as Suzette watches how Vinnie is a control freak over Hannah's relationship with a boyfriend and on trying to buildup the selfesteem of younger daughter Ginger Eva Amurri despite the latter's bratty crying and selfishness. Vinnie notes how all her clothes are beige while Suzette looks like a walking flower because of her free and easy lifestyle.While Suzette slowly gets Harry to emerge from his neurotic cocoon and even start typing up a literary storm while she is out she also reawakens long dormant freedoms that Vinnie clamped down on in her rise as Raymond's wife. She ditches her own smart uppity wardrobe and wears a set of Suzette's clothes in fact it helps matters here that Sarandon like Hawn has a really nice figure  they both have very tight pants on and look quite hot together. Vinnie reveals a treasure trove in her basement  a small box of special photos she and Suzette took back when of their favorite musicians. She even starts smoking with Suzette a marijuana cigarette They even go out to a bar to dance it takes awhile for Vinnie to get into the swing here. The photos are very special  and of special equipment.But how far can this release go? It upsets Raymond Hannah and Ginger to see Mom acting so odd. And the constant sight of Vinnie with her family reminds free spirit Suzette of her sacrifice  similar to that of Anne Bancroft visavis Shirley MacLaine in THE TURNING POINT  of doing what she wanted and failing to get a family in the process.Also how far will things succeed for Harry? He too is being freed but he keeps sliding when he meets with some nasty setback. And there is still the problem of settling the issue with his Dad.THE BANGER SISTERS was not a box office dud but it never got the notice from critics that were given in 2002 to other films. It is a fun and thoughtful film of how our wild and conservative sides have to make time for each other for us to be totally happy individuals.".

And I assumed that Hawn teamed with Susan Sarandon who I do consider a serious actress would result in a very good movie. Instead I found it to be thoroughly unpleasant filled with unlikeable characters and at best a few chuckles to help the viewer struggle through.The basic story is that Suzette and Vinnie Hawn and Sarandon were close friends back in their younger days groupies in fact who had bedded a series of well known rock stars thus the name banger sisters. Suzette has never changed much while Vinnie now Lavinia has married rich and become quite conservative with a couple of unfortunately snotty brats as kids. For no real reason that I could discern Geoffrey Rush is included as Harry who becomes a sortof relationship for Suzette.What turned me off the most I guess was the moral perspective of the story. Geoffrey was very conservative. Unmarried the man hadn't had sex in ten years! Suzette of course has to fix that. No sex outside marriage? Horrible! And of course being conservative he's also insane. Lavinia of course having given up her wild ways for a more conservative life also has to be fixed by Suzette. How dare she be upset when she discovers her teenage daughter having sex in the pool at home with her boyfriend. Suzette was the fixer the normal one. The point was typical liberal Hollywood and I don't usually rail against this but it was just too obvious and blatant here if you're not having sex with everything that moves there's something wrong with you and if you for some reason choose to lead a more straightlaced conservative lifestyle you'll be skewered with a dysfunctional family and all other sorts of nastiness and you just won't be yourself.

	schema:reviewBody "Directing your own screenplay is akin to editing your own manuscript  you're loathe to remove or rewrite anything because you tend to believe all of it is wonderful. Obviously working under this false assumption firsttime director Bob Dolman has created a mishmash of a film in The Banger Sisters. The premise is interesting but better suited for a comic treatment rather than the dramatic one he chose. Suzette Goldie Hawn and Lavinia Susan Sarandon were once an infamous duo of groupies wildly partying in a world of sex drugs and rock 'n' roll best friends but dubbed sisters by Frank Zappa one of the many rock stars who were serviced by the pair. Lavinia eventually left the life to walk the straight and narrow settling with an attorney husband with political aspirations in Phoenix where she leads an existence of beige suits and cultured pearls in a house out of the pages of Home  Garden magazine. She's either unaware or chooses to ignore the fact that both her teen daughters are troubled this is just one of the many problems in a script that rambles along without being clear about a lot of its circumstances. Suzette has remained in LA tending bar and  one suspects  maintaining her promiscuous lifestyle. Financial problems force her to seek out her old pal and not surprisingly the unplanned reunion is not a happy one.From the very first scene The Banger Sisters is propelled by a series of unexplained andor senseless plot points. Although Suzette apparently is an icon of sorts among the crowd of customers where she works she is unceremoniously fired by the owner who offers no plausible reason for his decision. The only purpose of this scene it seems is to force the unemployed bimbo into her car and onto the road to find salvation with her former funlovin' buddy. Enroute she finds herself out of gas at a station that doesn't accept credit cards and when she attempts to hustle change from the passengers of a bus making a pit stop she's rescued by neverwas screenwriter Harry Geoffrey Rush who's returning home to kill the father he believes put a curse on him. Why is this character plagued by mental and emotional disorders that should have inhibited him from becoming involved with Suzette in any way whatsoever even in this movie other than to give her a haven when things with Lavinia don't go as planned? As for the former groupieturnedmodelhomemaker why did she opt for a life in suburbia in the first place? And how is she so quickly persuaded to chop away at her perfect coif don an outfit from Suzette's wardrobe and leave her family behind to return to her roots for a hot night on the town then return home and smoke a joint in the basement while perusing pictures of the endowments of the many men from her past? Would this woman comfortably settled in her suburban nest have kept these photos in the first place? Very little in this film makes any sense. The biggest mystery of all is how Sarandon Hawn and Rush  Academy Award winners all  could have seen any merit in this script. To their credit they give it their all but their performances aren't enough to salvage this mess.Does everything end happily ever after? I couldn't tell you  this film is so boringly bad that fifteen minutes before it was over I turned off the television and went to bed having no interest in the outcome and unwilling to waste another moment waiting to find out. Perhaps every unanswered question and unexplained motivation was made clear in those final moments. I'm more inclined to believe that The Banger Sisters concluded as senselessly as it began. Hopefully it taught Dolman a valuable lesson  stick to either writing or directly but never let the twain meet.".

	schema:reviewBody "You could say this is a chick flick but it's one that starts off so appealingly and then descends into stupidity. Goldie Hawn plays Susette an outofwork exgroupie who's never quite grown up who decides to embark on a trip to see her long lost friend. Along the way she picks up Harry Plumber Geoffrey Rush an insecure nervous screenwriter whose lifestyle has become obsessively regimented and who also wants to kill his father who he blames for his failures. Susette's long lost friend is Lavinia Kingsley Susan Sarandon who has dramatically changed since her groupie days. She's married and has two daughters and she has become the prim and proper wife and mother who stabilises her family! Susette retreats back to Harry when she feels that Lavinia has changed too much. However Lavinia or Evie wants to get to know Susette again and they each analyse the other one's life.The problem with 'The Banger Sisters' is mainly in the script and direction by scriptwriterfirsttime director in Bob Dolman. It starts off interestingly enough but becomes less convincing as the story proceeds. Susan Sarandon's uptight character in Lavinia changes too drastically within a short time I think a day of rekindling her friendship with Susette. While it's fair to say that Lavinia had forgotten her youth her character who becomes completely reassessed and transformed. Susette remains the same and really isn't interested in Lavinia's family in fact all she does is obnoxiously criticise Lavinia and her two spoiled daughters Erika Christensen and Eva Amurri! Though Eva Amurri's Ginger is hilariously spoiled and has tempertantrums while Erika Christensen's Hannah has had Lavinia mold her into the perfect daughter. And then there is the sidestory with Harry Plumber who becomes quite fond of Susette which never really feels legitimate.There is also one really awful scene when Lavinia and Susette rediscover the treasured pictures of famous stars they banged except these pictures aren't of the star's famous faces but rather their famous netherregions and that's what made the scene so awful. It got worse as they proceeded to get stoned and see if they could recognise them. Wow! I'm sure Lavinia would be mighty annoyed if her hubby kept a huge collection of previous lovers' genitalia yet here it's ends up being the hubby's fault for not paying attention to her. Another scene involved a sign Got Milk! which has you more amazed at how they got up there whilst wearing high heels than amused!The performances are okay particularly by Goldie Hawn and the overthetop Eva Amurri Susan Sarandon's reallife daughter. Geoffrey Rush does okay as Plumber but his accent wavers too much! Susan Sarandon is more convincing as Lavinia rather than her transition to Evie and I feel she's the weakest link in the film. Regardless the problem lies in the script and direction as The Banger Sisters' becomes predictable and somewhat pointless. Susette's character never really changes significantly and in the end all I thought about was the stupidity of the story. This is a rather silly and pointless film. out of !".

The one who changed so much Lavina or Vinnie Susan Sarandon takes one look at Suzette Goldie Hawn for the first time in twenty years and doesn't want anything to do with her.  With the help from Suzette Lavina discovers her old' self and makes some changes for the better.The director Bob Dolman's most obvious intention is to pull off a movie that deals with a variety of real life issues ranging from relationships with friends and family to making changes and rediscovering the past.  The director does an incredible job of making this movie realistic.  First of all he chose Susan Sarandon to play the part of the mother and house wife. Sarandon is a well known well liked actress who really helps bring this role to life.  Also not to forget Goldie Hawn now who can really say they don't like Goldie?  The director chose her to be the wild' one.  Goldie's petite body and sense of humor portrays this image perfectly.  Also her 1960s wardrobe and tattoo on her arm prove she is no settled house wife. To help along with the whole making changes' intention the director throws in the perfect' daughter known as Hannah Erika Christensen.  Susan Sarandon's daughter is Miss Valedictorian.'  The director of the film allows Sarandon to come home to find that her daughter is no princess. Hannah's major performance in this film definitely brought about change in her mother.'The Banger Sisters' is an excellent film.  It brings in realistic situations and deals with them in its own way.  This movie is recommended to anyone who likes comedies.".

You either know someone like or were yourself like either Suzette or Lavinia. Suzette living in her past and never growing up and Lavinia growing up and trying to forget her past. I LOVE Goldie Hawn!!! She's one of those actresses that I really believe is as adorable in real life as she is in movies. Goldies free spirited character and Susan Sarandon's up tight character played off each other so well. Jeffrey Rush was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Who knew he was so funny!!!!!!! I'd love to see him in more comedic rolls in the future. Run don't walk to your nearest video store and rent this one tonight!!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:headline " The inclusion of Geoffrey Rush reinforces The Banger Sisters";
	schema:reviewBody "I rather enjoy this film. Geoffrey Rush as Harry made it worthwhile beyond just watching Goldie Hawn as Suzette and Susan Sarandon as Lavinia aka Vinnie. It's a comedic turn for Rush here and no less colorful being opposite the talented ever so humorously in control Hawn. It was rather an ingenious pairing. The storyline may not be deep per se  come to think of it there's quite a bit of psychological situations involved in spite of its dramatic comedy format. The movie touches on parenting and teenage daughters portrayed by Erika Christensen of Traffic and Sarandon's daughter Eva Amurri  of the selfeffacing predicaments of a welltodo suburban wife  mom of the endearing lasting friendship of two women and their crossroads to life beyond 40  one in selfdeceiving fashion the other in selfdepriving mode. Somehow through cascading events in the course of a few days yes things change. People change. You might say Rush's character Harry who is selfconscious and direly needs to build selfconfidence in a way bridges and complements the reunion of the two women and adds meaning to Suzette's life vice versa. It's a decent Hollywood movie with drama and comedy and there's a few lines here and there that can be life lessons should you see it so. It meets the entertaining quotient for a first feature film written and directed by Bob Dolman.Really appreciate Rush's performance in Tailor of Panama The 2001 as Harry Pendel the tailor opposite 'James Bond' Pierce Brosnan in a handsome sleaze No. 1 role and Jaime Lee Curtis.  He's good in every role be it playing the manic uninhibited genius of The Marquis de Sade in Quills 2000 opposite Kate Winslet or the bereaved father and taciturn husband in Lantana 2001 opposite Barbara Hershey. Sarandon has three recent film releases besides Banger Sisters The she's part of a wickedly cool ensemble cast in yet another debut film Igby Goes Down a dark comedy by writerdirector Burr Steers with Kieran Culkin turning in a strong leading performance as Igby. She coexecutiveproduced and again in a sensitive Mom's role in Moonlight Mile written and directed by Brad Silberling with Jake Gyllenhaal Donnie Darko 2001 as lead character Joe opposite Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman. She looked so radiantly approachable when appeared on NBC's Last Call hosted by Carson Daly on her birthday Oct. 4. Hawn was also looking fabulous for her age when she appeared on PBS's Charlie Rose Show. She has down to earth viewpoints on living. Besides the very successful First Wives Club The 1996 with Diane Keaton and Bette Midler some of her many enjoyable movies are Housesitter 1992 with Steve Martin Overboard 1987 with Kurt Russell Foul Play 1987 with the incomparable Chevy Chase Butterflies Are Free 1972 with Edward Albert and Eileen Heckart and Private Benjamin 1980 with Armand Assante and Eileen Brennan.".

Friends say what is that lovely music? and you say the love theme from Hurricane you know with Mia Farrow. They do not understand and you just keep sashaying about as you serve a tray of crackers with pineapple chunks. Sadly though HURRICANE was a monumental disaster of its own when released in 1979. Here in Sydney Australia it played the 900 seat ASCOT Theatre built for My Fair Lady alas that never screened there but found huge success with 70mm spectaculars like SWEET CHARITY and RYANS DAUGHTER two films that struggled overseas but ran for over 12 months each in Sydney. Perhaps that was the reason HURRICANE went in after all the Ascot also had a 60ft cinemascope screen and HURRICANE looked as spectacular as SOUTH PACIFIC meets THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE given this film was set both in the 1920s and on Bora Bora. Within 2 weeks the distributor sent another print to the theater. Gone was half an hour and HURRICANE shrank from 120 mins to 90mins overnight. Other comments here complain about how boring it is but really it isn't HURRICANE is quite exquisite a bit silly and a lot beautiful... then whoosh mighty seas and winds that see our ukulele crossed lovers up a tree. Great special effects a church squashed by a freighter in the middle of the storm and that heavenly plunking and strumming. HURRICANE deserves re appraisal and a DVD release with extras set and costume pix and clips and maybe Mia Farrow and Timothy Bottoms hosting a chat. It was made with real heart and basically is a slow tropical drama with a mighty windy finale. But that music! Oh! so sublime.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Avalanche Meteor and such other creatively titled TVmovies as Fire! and Flood! there were few places left to go except to dig into Hollywood's past and remake The Hurricane. Thankfully the cycle finally burnt out before such epics as Landslide Hail or Mud Puddle could be produced. Original director Roman Polanski became embroiled in his still not completely resolved! statutory rape case causing him to withdraw from the troubled project though Farrow stuck with it for reasons known only to her. She plays the single daughter of a strict naval Captain Robards who is in place in 1922 Samoa to uphold order. Once there she catches the eye of a young man Ka'ne who is in line to be King of the local natives. When he tosses aside the bride who had been arranged for him in order to canoodle with Farrow both his people and Robards who nurses a barely concealed incestuous bent for his daughter are up in arms. Meanwhile young naval officer Bottoms who has feelings for Farrow himself and sneering Sergeant Keach who delights in looking down on the locals set their sites on Ka'ne as well. As the passions and tensions reach a high point the title event descends on the area with little warning or even surprise it seems! and decimates virtually everything and everyone. Farrow though only 34 is far too old for her role. She tries to inject some degree of feeling into her part and is sometimes ably photographed by cinematographer Sven Nykvist with whom she was having an affair during filming but it's pretty hopeless. A lot of actresses look great wet but scrawny finehaired Farrow is not one of them. Also her illfitting unflattering costumes succeed in making her look even more birdlike and gangly than she already is. This is strange since Theoni V. Aldredge succeeded in making her look stunning only a few years earlier in the same basic time period. Part of the problem must be attributed to her really bad hairstyling on his film. Robards is mostly one note and has a fairly ludicrous role to play. His final scene is particularly stupid. Ka'ne is actually not as bad as one might expect though he needed a more intuitive director in order to give the role and the film its due. He was simply too green. At least he is very easy on the eyes at all times and seems to be giving his all to the part. Bottoms who reportedly tangled with Farrow during filming does all right and Keach is one note though not ineffective. Other names among the cast include Howard as an alcoholic priest and Von Sydow there no doubt at the request of his frequent director Troell as a doctor. Every other cast member performs as if it is his or her firstandonly time in front of the camera and for most of them it was. None of the below the title actors seem to have any concept of how to move look or speak like someone from 1922 a chief culprit being Rutgers as a local society matron. The scenery is lovely the Nino Rota score is strong but the story is hackneyed the screenplay is disjointed the editing is choppy and the direction is weak. In striving for convincing winds and waves the makers forgot to a allow the viewer to clearly see what is happening and b make the viewer care about the people being tossed about and drowned. The finale is unrealistic to say the least with NOTHING in sight except a few bits of debris and the besieged lovers. Where did the massive ship drift off to? Where are the bodies of the many many natives and others? This is the least of the film's problems though. It's just a big expensive misfire.".

The setting adapted from a book by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall bestknown for another adventure with an exotic backdrop Mutiny On The Bounty is a South Sea island run by the American Navy the arrival of the Governor's daughter causes a commotion  the newlycrowned native King forsakes his local girl for the white woman's charms this obviously creates problems between the two sets of inhabitants who do not wish to have their blood minglebut before the situation can be resolved the Forces of Nature contrive to mete out their own form of justice via the titular catastrophe.Jason Robards Jr. is the Governor Mia Farrow his daughter and Dayton Kane the young ruler besides Max von Sydow is a doctor Trevor Howard a priest Timothy Bottoms a Navy officer with feelings for Farrow and James Keach as Kane's hostile keeper the latter having been convicted of his fianc's death who drowned after fleeing a ceremony in which her virginity was to be ascertained!. Despite enviable credentials  producer Dino De Laurentiis acclaimed Swedish director Troell cinematographer Sven Nykvist composer Nino Rota whose contribution is particularly notable and production designer Danilo Donati  the film is something of a snoozer with endless footage devoted to local color and the unconvincing central romanceuntil the spectacular climax but which still isn't really enough to redress the balance! Having reacquainted myself with this I'd already watched it as a kid I hope someday to get a fresh appraisal of the Oscarwinning original as well it was available on DVD very early into the format but hasn't been reissued since going outofprint!".

The setting adapted from a book by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall bestknown for another adventure with an exotic backdrop Mutiny On The Bounty is a South Sea island run by the American Navy the arrival of the Governor's daughter causes a commotion  the newlycrowned native King forsakes his local girl for the white woman's charms this obviously creates problems between the two sets of inhabitants who do not wish to have their blood minglebut before the situation can be resolved the Forces of Nature contrive to mete out their own form of justice via the titular catastrophe.Jason Robards Jr. is the Governor Mia Farrow his daughter and Dayton Kane the young ruler besides Max von Sydow is a doctor Trevor Howard a priest Timothy Bottoms a Navy officer with feelings for Farrow and James Keach as Kane's hostile keeper the latter having been convicted of his fianc's death who drowned after fleeing a ceremony in which her virginity was to be ascertained!. Despite enviable credentials  producer Dino De Laurentiis acclaimed Swedish director Troell cinematographer Sven Nykvist composer Nino Rota whose contribution is particularly notable and production designer Danilo Donati  the film is something of a snoozer with endless footage devoted to local color and the unconvincing central romanceuntil the spectacular climax but which still isn't really enough to redress the balance! Having reacquainted myself with this I'd already watched it as a kid I hope someday to get a fresh appraisal of the Oscarwinning original as well it was available on DVD very early into the format but hasn't been reissued since going outofprint!";

	schema:reviewBody "Although this is a remake of the famous and far superior John Ford masterpiece HURRICANE manages to be one of MIA FARROW's least impressive jobs as an actressnot entirely her fault since the script based this time on the NordhoffHall novel is a mess. It's really not the same storyline used in the Ford film.The only similarity to the original is that it ends with a furious hurricane that cost 22 million to recreate but doesn't save the disastrously weak story from being anything but an unmitigated bore. The love interest is practically nonexistent consisting of closeup stares between Mia and her island sweetheart. Whenever there is any dialog it's about as clumsy as can be. Example When he proposes that they elope he says Come to the altar with the white flowerI will be there with the red. Somebody should of been there with some directorial talent. Jan Troell falls far short of John Ford as does the script. Usually it's worth it to sit through a boring romance to see the howler of a hurricane. In this case not so.".

	schema:reviewBody "The much maligned remake of John Ford's 1937 film or at least the second adaptation of the novel which came out in 1936 is not as bad as its reputation but it doesn't really work. They change things up a bit to make it about an interracial romance. Mary Astor's character now played by Mia Farrow is now the daughter of the governor character played here by Jason Robards and the lead native character played by newcomer Dayton Ka'ne falls in love with her. This being the 1920s their romance is looked down upon by both races. The initial premise change isn't too bad but it weakens the rest of the plot which plays out pretty similarly to the original film. Ka'ne's crime is far less sympathetic than it was there he was arrested for assaulting a racist who insulted him. Here he as chief of his people allows a custom of checking for a bride's virginity before she's married  the girl is so upset about it she drowns herself. Farrow helps Ka'ne escape but their plans and everyone's lives are disrupted by the hurricane. Jon Hall was kind of the weak link in Ford's film but Ka'ne is far worse. Even besides his more detestable crime he's just not that likable an actor. Farrow's infatuation with him never comes off as real love so there's no romance to latch onto. Farrow herself isn't too bad but she's ten years older than the character should be at least. Robards is the best thing about it. Trevor Howard plays the priest and Max von Sydow the doctor. Both are fine but the roles probably should have been reversed. It doesn't really matter though since both characters get short shafted by the script. Timothy Bottoms is pretty good as Farrow's initial love interest he doesn't really have an analogue in the original. The actual hurricane is still pretty good but the ending is lame. The film looks great thanks to Sven Nykvist and you know Bora Bora just being beautiful in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long before I saw Hurricane I bought the soundtrack album in a second hand store.It was a happy purchase. I knew Nino Rota's music for War and Peace the Fellini movies and Death on the Nile but his score for Hurricane was a surprise. It is a seductive blend of mandolin ukulele orchestra primitive instruments wordless chorus and even whistling. The whole thing beautifully captures the mystique of the Pacific islands of legend. It was Rota's last score. He died before the film was released.It's interesting how often those megabudget movies set in Polynesia seem to have been lured to destruction by swaying palms and swaying hips. Mutiny on the Bounty 1962 The Bounty 1984 and Kevin Costner's Rapa Nui 1994 all hit a reef financially. Mind you I find them all guilty pleasures in their own way. Unfortunately Hurricane didn't fare any better. Set in the 1920's Charlotte Bruckner Mia Farrow arrives on Pago Pago to visit her father Captain Bruckner Jason Robards the U.S. Governor. She falls in love with Matangi Dayton Ka'ne an islander destined to become chieftain. Dad is not pleased there are racial tensions and somewhat disturbing fatherdaughter tensions. Then the hurricane hits.Apparently there were also tensions on the set. In fact all those big epics had tensions behind the scenes. Maybe it was the isolation with stars and crew trapped on their respective islands for weeks on end. According to an article in The Independent at some point during the making of Hurricane Mia Farrow fetched costar Timothy Bottoms a smack in the mouth.Few critics had a good word for Hurricane. The love affair between Charlotte and Matangi doesn't quite register. Dayton Ka'ne was a goodlooking surfer plucked from obscurity but he struggled with his lines. He made one other movie and retired from the screen  he died a few years ago aged only 61. The film suffers from some onedimensional characters but the storm at the end is good if a little long although it is called Hurricane after all. I feel the film has a certain ambience definitely helped by Rota's haunting score. It's a long way from being the worst movie I have ever seen.".

It's absolutely terrifying especially because the buildup to the disaster is such an innocent sweet love story.Next to the special effects Nino Rote's beautiful score is the most famous part of the movie.

Good things going for it??...Had Jan Troell directing it as if that means anything!!...Jason Robards was good... I mean COME ON!! Sure...the opening title credits of HOWARD THE DUCK were welldone but does that mean the film has any merit at all? Children of the Living Dead had TOM SAVINI a great makeup artist in it but does that redeem that awful excuse to waste good celluloid at all? HURRICANE is SOOOOOOOOOOO bad that it can be summed up in TWO WORDS Dayton Ka'ne or is that 3 words because of the stupid apostrophe in his last name? And is it pronounced Kaaaah nay as in Kaaaant Act or is it pronounced CANE as in This film is so far from Citizen Kane that it makes Revenge of the Nerds 3 look like Hamlet? Maybe it was a play on words created by that mastercraftsman Jan Troell who is CERTAINLY deserving of being a TROLL for dropping this dreck on society and the movie was intended to be titled HurriKa'ne. Maybe Dayton was taking too long in his trailer fixing his hair rather than reading his lines and Troelldoll had to yell into his megaphone...HEY DAYTON...we are ready for the 123rd take on your opening lines!! Report to the set before I attack you with a Ka'ne!! Oh...and as for MIA FARROW...she never could act her way out of a wet paper bag anyway and even when the paper bag is drenched in Hurrika'ne water she STILL was dreadful. Plus...she weighs about 17 pounds so if the winds were really that strong wouldn't she simply blow away and then land somewhere on the set of a Woody Allen film? Lucky for her the 37 people who actually saw this film in theaters got the treat of watching her spout off lines that are so embarrassingly bad that you are almost WISHING you could've run screaming out of the theater and into the next one to watch...AVALANCHE. Ooops...ANOTHER Mia Farrow disaster movie. Let's face it. Dino DeLaurentiis was NO Irwin Allen. Mia Farrow Jason Robards and Dayton Ka'ne are NOT disaster movieworthy actors. They simply aren't the type. Robards while a GREAT actor...stunk in this thing and the upcoming Raise The Titanic. By 1979 even IRWIN himself couldn't sell a disaster film. The genre was dead. Why they continued to make these when the audience was WAY past them is beyond me. It was a sad ending to a great genre. A FUN genre as well. From 19721976 DISASTER rules the theaters. It was FUN to go to the movies then. But then Meteor The Swarm Hurricane Avalanche Raise The Titanic When Time Ran Out and Airport '79 had to screw it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hurricane 1979  out of 4 This Dino De Laurentiis remake of John Ford's 1937 classic will always be remembered for two things. One is that the 22million budget which ended up losing money. The second thing is that this was the movie Roman Polanski was suppose to be making before fleeing the United States. After seeing this film I'm starting to believe that perhaps Polanski was fleeing having to make this wretched thing. A white woman Mia Farrow goes to the island of Samoa to stay with her Naval officer father Jason Robards. Once on the island the white woman breaks a taboo and begins a relationship with a native Dayton Ka'ne who has already been promised to another woman. Soon we have double crossed love a court trial and then a large hurricane that rips through. HURRICANE is a disaster movie in the purest sense because it really is a complete disaster from the opening frames to the closing credits. There's not a single thing that goes right with this thing and I guess it would be easy to throw some blame towards Polanski since his departure pretty much threw the production into the air where they had to bring in another director very quickly. It's clear that director Troell can't handled anything here and I can't say I blame him because the screenplay is also quite horrid. They have Farrow and Ka'ne running around like a couple teenage virgins and their romance scenes together are so laughable that you can't help but think of THE BLUE LAGOON and consider that movie a masterpiece in comparison. Another problem is that the entire taboo subject matter just isn't all that taboo and you can't help but feel they're making a lot out of nothing. I'm sure the racial political and religious tensions could have made for an interesting movie but the film never really looks at any of it. The performances by the allstar cast are just another reminder that actors signed onto pictures like this to cash a paycheck. Robards sleepwalks through the entire film and I'm curious if he even remembered doing it. Farrow gives one of the worst performances I've seen from her as she hasn't an inch of energy and really brings the film to a halt. Trevor Howard James Keach Timothy Bottoms and Max von Sydow aren't any better. The film is a remake of the Ford film but they share very little in common outside the setting a few other plot points and of course the hurricane. I think it's important to show this picture and the original together whenever people say old movies can't hold up with current technology. Just show people the hurricane sequence from both versions and I think people will see that the original holds up incredibly well and still looks effective while the stuff here is decent but you will be wondering where all the money went.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the few horror films that I can still sit back and enjoy.  It scared me pretty badly as a kid.  I still feel all the haunting vibes and chills as an adult.It may not be action packed although the scene with Reed trying to kill his soon in the pool was terrifyingand ultrarealistic but it certainly gets under your skin.  This film is about mood and it is both beautifully entrancing and ominously mesmerizing.  I actually found the acting quite good.  Reed was wonderful.  I loved the two weird siblings Roz and Brother Burgess Meredith wonderful actor.  Their adoration of the house sends chills up my spine.The true stars of the movie are the music Bob Cobert's amazing Music Box Theme and the house Dunsmuir House  Gardens in Oakland California. For true horror buffs out there this movie inspired the creators of PHANTASM to drive up to Oakland and use this same mansion as the infamous Morningside Mortuary.  Which is probably when the opening moments of PHANTASM rolled in 1979 I already had such fear upon seeing the mansion again on screen!  I have to wonder if other elements of BURNT OFFERINGS inspired PHANTASM as well.  Note the creepy old lady upstairs at the end.  Reminds one of PHANTASM's eerie fortuneteller.  How about B.O.'s terrifying hearse chauffeur?  He's kind of like a forerunner of the Tall Man!BURNT OFFERINGS is well worth the viewing.  Don't expect any real jolts or screams.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the few horror films that I can still sit back and enjoy.  It scared me pretty badly as a kid.  I still feel all the haunting vibes and chills as an adult.It may not be action packed although the scene with Reed trying to kill his soon in the pool was terrifyingand ultrarealistic but it certainly gets under your skin.  This film is about mood and it is both beautifully entrancing and ominously mesmerizing.  I actually found the acting quite good.  Reed was wonderful.  I loved the two weird siblings Roz and Brother Burgess Meredith wonderful actor.  Their adoration of the house sends chills up my spine.The true stars of the movie are the music Bob Cobert's amazing Music Box Theme and the house Dunsmuir House  Gardens in Oakland California. For true horror buffs out there this movie inspired the creators of PHANTASM to drive up to Oakland and use this same mansion as the infamous Morningside Mortuary.  Which is probably when the opening moments of PHANTASM rolled in 1979 I already had such fear upon seeing the mansion again on screen!  I have to wonder if other elements of BURNT OFFERINGS inspired PHANTASM as well.  Note the creepy old lady upstairs at the end.  Reminds one of PHANTASM's eerie fortuneteller.  How about B.O.'s terrifying hearse chauffeur?  He's kind of like a forerunner of the Tall Man!BURNT OFFERINGS is well worth the viewing.  Don't expect any real jolts or screams.  But turn off the lights and let it really sink in.  It's well worth a viewing.

But from reading other posters' comments and reviews it seems that many people are baffled by what the title 'burnt offerings' means and what the heck is going on in the movie. From what little I have seen on television the theme seems to be that the house injures and even kills its resident occupants in order to renew itself. Sort of a fertility rite where death was enacted to bring about the Springtime or renewal. Whenever someone gets hurt or killed the house renews a part of itself. Minor injuries may only repair a simple light bulb or bring a few dead potted plants back to life or restore a cracked mirror. But look what happens at the end !!The old lady upstairs Mrs. Allardyce ?sp is supposedly an eightyfive year old woman'. Isn't that the approx. age of the house in 1976? Wouldn't you say the Dunsmuir house looks about that old built in 1891 perhaps? When the professor  renter asks the owners of the house what 'the catch' is why it's so inexpensive to rent the response from one of the owners who are insulted at the idea that it's a 'catch'  their response is 'it's our mother.'  is that intended as the 'catch? that the house is their mother? then the conversation shifts to that she is an eighty five year old woman and that she stays in the upstairs room. I think there may be some symbolism here of the deathandrenewal earthgoddess sort. And by the way this is NOT a 'haunted house' but what might be described as a slightly different genre'  a 'living house.' Not haunted as on the changeling or The Haunting nor 'demon possessed' as on the Amityville Horror but a 'living house'  this one with an appetite and a penchant to renew itself. Lots of old houses to me seem to have a soul and thoughts and demeanor of their own. Enjoy the renewal rites.".

A couple with one kid rent a big mansion for the summer. They bring along the husband's aunt and the 4 start experiencing changes in character. The husband is violent towards the boy. The mother is angry towards the aunt etc. Everyone starts changing after staying at the house for a while. The house itself is seemingly alive and it takes over the family. The last shot in BURNT OFFERINGS the one with the photos is identical to the one in Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING. Truly shocking. Did the author of the novel sue? Anyway the movie is a creepy little movie in some parts and somewhat dull in other parts. Watching Bette Davis dying was eh a bit unsettling. She really looked like she was dying the poor old woman. Good but not great. I really love the idea of the house shedding its skin. If you've seen THE SHINING and not this film watch it you'll be more shock about the similarities than the movie itself.".

A wellkept secret it's one of those supernatural horror films that will still be watchable and will have lost none of its creepiness in 50 years' time. What I personally look for in a movie is atmosphere and this one has it by the bucketload! Despite having been shot in the 70's it has a beautiful timeless quality. It's far from perfect let's face it no film is and its plot certainly isn't original either but it's the film's bleak sinister and unsettling atmosphere possibly in connection with its 70's look that makes it what it is and it's exactly this atmosphere that will stay with you for a long time.Highly underrated and not known by many people Burnt Offerings is very well made. Great script very well shot and extremely well acted. Oliver Reed is fantastic which kind of goes without saying but hopelessly outcreeped by the naturally creepy mother of creep Karen Black. Black and Reed both masters of their chosen craft work like a dream in this movie a solid acting foundation with Bette Davis being the icing on the cake as it were.Certainly a must for Oliver Reed fans although diehard Olly fans will most likely have seen it at some point but it's also a must for fans of good oldfashioned atmospheric horror.Just sit back and enjoy. If you're watching it for the first time you'll likely be wondering afterwards how this one could've escaped you all these years ...".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never heard about this film before I saw it once at a video store once but hesitated to rent it. While at the store around Halloweentime I happened to see it and it was on sale for 10 bucks so I decided to give it a chance. And I actually enjoyed it it was a fairly good movie.Burnt Offerings is pretty much a typical haunted house story but with a bit of a spin to it. It's about Marian and Ben Ralf played by Karen Black and Oliver Reed and their son who move into a summerhouse in the country that is owned by a very strange brother and sister. The price is a steal the only catch is that they would have to supply minimal food and care to the sibling's grandmother who lives in an upstairs bedroom. Marian takes on this duty and the family begins to prepare themselves to have a relaxing summer out at the old manor. Ben's Aunt played by the legendary Bette Davis also is staying with them at the summerhouse. After staying there for awhile strange things begin to happen and Marian becomes very secretive of the grandmother in the upstairs room. In fact nobody in the entire house besides her have even seen the old woman. As tension mounts between Ben and Marian strange events plague the family including apparitions strange sounds etc.The ending of this film was pretty different it may be a bit confusing but it's still good. Apparently the film is based on a book which I may personally like to read myself. There are some parallels to The Shining too even though this was released 4 years before that. But Mr. Stephen King himself noted the novel as one of his favorite horror stories so it leads me to believe he may have taken some inspiration from this story for The Shining. Karen Black and Bette Davis give great performances they are the most remarkable in the film. Oliver Reed was also great and the kid while a little whiny and unconvincing was good enough for his role.Overall Burnt Offerings has a pretty good story good acting and a well known cast primarily Black and Davis. One of the better classic haunted house tales with a different twist on it that makes it stand out a little in my mind. 710.".

Rather than resorting to cheap tactics this film focuses heavily on atmosphere suspense and tension. There is enough suspense in this film for three movies. There isn't a boring moment in this entire film. I was so captivated by this film that the first time I watched it I actually felt as if I lived in the mansion among the characters. Almost never does a film come along in which I forget I'm even watching a movie and can't separate it from reality. This movie did just that. It's story sounds like your runofthemill haunted house film when you simply read the summary but when you actually watch the film it is a unique experience never to be forgotten. It is highly similar to The Shining. Both films are sophisticated chilling horror films that require the viewer to think. Because of that they are both wonderful.It is no coincidence that this movie is from the mastermind behind Dark Shadows. Dan Curtis masters suspense and terror in a way very few can. The musical score by Robert Cobert contributes to the unsettling mood of the film perfectly. It is one of my favorite scores of all time. The acting is incredible. Karen Black Oliver Reed Bette Davis and Lee Montgomery all have great chemistry as a family and are all wonderful in their respective performances. The characters are all likable. I don't usually like happy endings in horror movies but this is a case where I wanted the characters to live because I liked them so much. But sadly that was not meant to happen. Overall this film has everything I could want in a horror film and I am glad to be a fan of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review will contain spoilers... in other words I will expose the ending. But it is needed to show a point. So if you haven't seen this movie and want to be surprised  move on. But if the ending perplexed you  and it did to some people  I will try to explain because I figured it out and I'm here to help.Now I know that many people consider The Shining as the best haunted house movie. Yeah I'll agree that one is spooky. But for pure justtocreepyouout styled chills you can't beat this one. The movie starts out with a young family renting an old somewhat rundown looking mansion for the summer for the mindnumbingly low amount of 900... for the whole summertime not just monthly. The owners a brother sister pair played by Burgess Meredeth and Eileen Eckhardt along with their caretaker played by Dub Taylor are a little strange but nice. The condition they must care for their old mother who lives in a upstairs room. So the family  father Oliver Reed mother Karen Black their son Lee H. Montgomery who despite his mention in The Golden Turkey Awards as one of the most obnoxious child actors ever comes across as a pretty decent actor and Reed's elderly aunt played by Betty Davis who isn't  for once  playing some old nutcase diva or all around selfcentered bitch moves in. It isn't long before we find out about the evil surrounding the house. . . every time someone gets hurt which is often the house starts looking a little better. Not only that but that the house is also purposely doing things to put the family in danger. And what about that creepy old women upstairs that we never see? Mmmmmmm!Okay basic plot aside let's us get to what makes the film scary. It's the fact that the family is up against an evil force they don't understand and it doesn't stop until everything around it is harmed. That means them. Now the acting. Black is quite good as the wife who becomes infatuated with just who the old woman is Black begins to look lovingly at a table filled with pictures of the woman's loved ones outside her bedroom even though she knows none of the people in the photos and starts taking on the mannerisms of the lady. Reed an actor who I never really liked because to me he always looked more like he wanted to beat you up than entertain you is also good as the father who becomes more confused nervous and outright scared as things get stranger. Davis is sympathetic as the aunt who realizes that something is wrong with the house when her health starts to go bad with quick alarm and mentions that they need to get the hell outta there. But the best acting goes to Anthony James as The Chauffeur. Kind of like a featured player in the house's show of evil this guy will give you the willies with his downright satanic smile and menacing demeanor. He's the kind of stuff that nightmares are made of and I assure you he WILL make you cringe with horror.Now the ending with the last scene of the movie showing the pictures on the table being the one of most chilling in the film. Some people just didn't get it so I will explain. The house destroyed the family  or more to the point  devoured them much to the delight and pleasure of the siblingsowners. Their pain was it's nourishment in the audio commentary director Dan Curtis says the best horror movies are the ones where everybody's doomed and nobody makes it out of their dreaded situation alive. After the old woman possessed Black and the father the aunt and the son have all met nightmarish ends the house springs back to life from it's former rundown look  as seen in pictures hanging in the hallway all showing that this has happen a number of times before and will happen again. And for you see all those many pictures on the table outside of the old woman's bedroom weren't pictures of friends sweethearts family and other loved ones. They were pictures with our doomed family being the latest addition... of victims. The End. Isn't fun to be frightened shtless? Because you will be after watching Burnt Offerings!

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was so bizarre but it held my attention to the very end. I loved the home  it was gorgeous especially after it kept regenerating itself. I loved Eileen Heckart and Burgess Meredith. They were so delightfully charming eccentric yet creepy at the same time. I found the premise of the movie very interesting A house slowly steals someone's vitality causing that person to become at the very least injured and at the most it makes them weak enough that they die.I loved how Karen Black's character became slowly obsessed and consumed by the old Victorian home. Her descent into obsession was so subtle and only really became obvious when she started dressing like a Victorian woman and flipped out about the idea of someone being in Mrs. Allardyce's sitting room. I rather guessed her eventual fate. The scene that tipped me off was when she was seen eating the food she had brought up for the old woman that was in the bedroom.Oliver Reed's character was very interesting. He was the reasonable one who instinctively knew something was off about the house. His scene with his son Danny in the pool was very scary. At first I was confused why Bette Davis seemed so upset with his horseplay with Danny until he started holding his head down under the water. I didn't really get what was up with the car and the creepy chauffeur only that it seemed to be some traumatic childhood memory Reed's character had. That chauffeur would give anyone nightmares though. Then poor Reed's fate at the end of the film... Wow! How gruesome. I did not expect it at all. And his poor son.I loved Bette Davis' character. Even though she was a minor character she imbued her part with such panache. She would be a fun aunt to have. Then my god what the makeup department did to her when she was having the life sucked from her body.This was a great film with a very surprising and gruesome ending. I can't help but feel that this film would make a great double feature with the 1975 version of The Stepford Wives. If you think that this film has much in common with The Shining be aware that Stephen King was inspired by the original novel before he wrote his own.".

The story does creep but I think that is what is wrong with today's horror films. Everything is unveiled too soon. If you pay close attention the house they rent for the summer is also used in another legendary horror film from the late 70's. Don Coscarelli's Phantasm. If you wanna watch a film without the gore that has some real fright factor watch Burnt Offerings.".

Which is fine no one can deny it gets the job done. The problem with it is that the movies become inseparable and which one is scarier can only be judged really on which made you jump the most.Burnt Offerings instead creates an atmosphere. It creates it masterfully through character decisions and great use of music. There was a stage early on when I realized nothing eventful had even happened as yet and despite this my heart was pounding. Sure enough a moment later some frightening action took place and I realized for the first time in a long time a horror movie had alerted my subconscience and not my mind. These days in horror movies it's far too easy to predict when the event is coming it's generally when the filmmaker is trying to make you think NOTHING is coming.Burnt Offerings is more than watchable in this day and age. The lines are nowhere near as cheesy sounding as a lot of other pre1980 films make them sound today and the acting whilst not perfect is anything but bad. The suspense will have your heart pounding and it's all building up to something so terrifying it deserves far more recognition among horror buffs. Not to be missed.".

The performances by leading actors Karen Black and Oliver Reed are excellent as well as the rest of the cast. The atmosphere is foreboding and I must say this film creates a lot of tension and suspense. Even though this is a PG rated film  it dose not lighten its tone or wimp out in any way .

	schema:headline " Solid film";
	schema:reviewBody "Between Strangers is the sort of film that never gets made in America not in Hollywood big budget films nor in independent films because it is a film that takes its own sweet time in conveying its ideas to the viewer. That's not to say that it's a great film nor even a pretty good one but watching this 2003 CanadianItalian film on DVD shot in Toronto gives a viewer an insight into how other people enjoy the same basic forms of art.This film follows the lives of three different women each of whom has issues surrounding a trauma involving a little girl and their own troubles relating to the men in their lives. That the film makes heavyhanded usage of a little girl Sydney Pearson that appears to each of them once as a symbol is a flaw since there was no need for symbolism in an otherwise realistic film. The cast is loaded with international film heavyweights not the least of whom is Sophia Loren whose son Edoardo Ponti whose father is Carlo Ponti in his first time at a film's helm wrote and directed this film. She plays Olivia a woman who works in a Toronto supermarket and years earlier married an exathlete now wheelchair bound invalid John played by Pete Postlethwaite a man whose rage at the world is directed like a laser at his masochistic wife. Her secret is that she had a daughter out of wedlock as a teenager and was forced to give her up for adoption by her father. Now the daughter Wendy Crewson is a famed sculptress whose fame seems to coincide with Olivia's own rediscovery of her drawing talent unused since her pregnancy of works of art eerily similar to her daughter's and encouraged by Max Gerald Depardieu her gardener friend at a local park. The second woman lead is Natalia Bauer a photojournalist played by Mira Sorvino whose photos from the war in Angola have landed her a cover of Time magazine much to the delight of her father Alexander Klaus Maria Brandauer himself a legendary photojournalist who both encourages and discourages her passiveaggressively. Yet she is guiltridden by the girl in her photo because she could have saved the child's life rather than gotten the photo. The third woman is Catherine Debra Unger a famed cellist who is stalking her exconvict father Alan Baxter Malcolm McDowell after he is released from prison after twentytwo years. She blames him for her mother's death and this crisis has made her leave her marriage and daughter who leaves plaintive messages on her answering machine.That's the set up. Little overtly occurs in the film. Sophia Loren gives a magnificent performance in what is reputedly the hundredth film of her career. Those who have chided her as building a career on her sexuality have never seen this woman's eyes. She is one of those rarities who acts with every square inch of her body. Postlethwaite as her husband is also very good and it should not surprise that the best story in the film is the one the filmmaker accorded his mother.Yet I felt to a degree as if I were watching a slightly better than average telefilm from the 1970s at times but one that never quite gels into something first rate nor substantial. This is the screenplay's fault and thus the burden lies with Ponti. It is one of those rare works of art that doesn't terribly move you but you are better for having seen it even though it will not haunt you. If that seems like a very mixed reaction then I have succeeded in recapitulating my experience in watching it and for reasons that elude me and despite all its flaws I think you should watch it too.".

Postlethwaite as her husband is also very good and it should not surprise that the best story in the film is the one the filmmaker accorded his mother.Yet I felt to a degree as if I were watching a slightly better than average telefilm from the 1970s at times but one that never quite gels into something first rate nor substantial. This is the screenplay's fault and thus the burden lies with Ponti. It is one of those rare works of art that doesn't terribly move you but you are better for having seen it even though it will not haunt you. If that seems like a very mixed reaction then I have succeeded in recapitulating my experience in watching it and for reasons that elude me and despite all its flaws I think you should watch it too.";

But so does everybody else. The scene in the book store is one of cinema's great moments. The silver screen has invincible power when it used so masterfully. And how very nice to see Toronto play itself for a change instead of acting as a stand in for some other place. A few films like this would do far more to revive the city's shattered image than concerts by the Stones and visits by Conan O'Brien. This film is a keeper!!!".

She is haunted by the fact that the time she spent photographing the child could have been used to save the child's life.Deborah Unger is a concert cellist whose wifeabusing father Malcolm McDowell is released from prison despite her conviction that he should die for his cruelty forcing her to leave her own family in the attempt to end her father's existence.Sophia Loren is a haggard housewife who has devoted her sad life to caring for her wheelchairbound past athlete husband Pete Postlethwaite until she sees her illegitimate daughter she was forced to abandon becoming the sculptor artist she herself always wanted to be. Each of these women have visions of the same small girl at moments when they are forced to confront their pain and each finds a way back to salvation through 'living out a dream'.Some may find the story saccharine but the actors deliver these sad folk in such an honest way that together they manage to capture our hearts. It is a true pleasure to see Sophia Loren act again and even the makeup she dons for her dowdy role cannot hide the fact that she remains one of the most beautiful women the screen has known  and one of the best actresses. All cast members are superb. Just be aware of the fact that this is a bleak story that requires much from the viewer. The rewards are worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Between Strangers is a muted introspective film about several women whose path in life has brought them face to face with emotional obstacles and carefully explores them with depth and feeling if admittedly not completely following through on each arc satisfyingly. Sophia Loren yes she's still alive! plays an aging woman who believes in a psychic link between herself and a girl half across the country who she believes to be her long lost daughter. Her abrasive husband Pete Postlethwaite uses his usual genius to make complex work of a thankless role thinks she's bonkers. An aspiring journalist Mira Sorvino continues to prove how criminally underrated she is suffers a crippling crisis of conscience when her peppy father Klaus Maria Brandeur brings her a job that is beyond morally questionable. Finally in the film's most stirring vignette a lost broken woman attempts to confront her estranged father who killed her mother in a drunken rage decades earlier. Vancouver actress Deborah Kara Unger who makes a point to daringly seek out roles that most would steer well clear of is plain heartbreaking a cello musician who's ultimate chorus is the searing lament and rage towards the hand she has been dealt. Malcolm McDowell is utterly compelling as the father a man so annihilated by his own actions he can barely stand to be inside his own skin. Their story culminates in a quietly devastating face to face interaction that sets the screen ablaze with cold fire a sequence both performers should be immensely proud of. The film has its uneven moments and while neither of the segments has much to do with each other storywise they tie nicely together in the sense that here are three women who take a bold bravely realized look at their own lives and step off the beaten track of what's expected of them and even what they've come to expect from themselves emblazoning important themes of both female independence and reawakening.".

The film has its uneven moments and while neither of the segments has much to do with each other storywise they tie nicely together in the sense that here are three women who take a bold bravely realized look at their own lives and step off the beaten track of what's expected of them and even what they've come to expect from themselves emblazoning important themes of both female independence and reawakening.";

The woman who just made a photo shoot for Time magazine in Angola happens to stumble upon an Angolan woman at the local market. Yeah right. Just to make the storytelling easier I guess. None of the actors really outshines here. Famous names low profiles. The fact that half of the cast is not native Englishspeaking adds to the very slowpaced troubled effort in natural acting.

Briefly this is a halfbaked concept sloppily written around the edges but the handful of actors in the highprofile roles make it worth renting  as long as you're not expecting more. The main characters are excellent in their roles with a supporting cast deserving of award nominations. Sophia Loren does more with few words than most of our cinema stars the rest of the cast match her well. The supporting actors with not quite too many words walk the fine line between doing too much and too little and make each arc come alive for the woman in the middle.But give up on the plot. The three arcs do not share the common thread stated in the promotional materials. The little girl who appears to each is not a herald of emotional transition rather she is Ponti's writerdirector admission that the preceding scene supposedly emotional has a weak ending just as with the movie's ending which is more like a cartoon ending than a highprofile movie. The girl is a popup window with a tiny banner reading missing climax.I don't insist on having a cheesy Hollywood ending where all the loose ends are tied up and the main characters are happy. Between Strangers simply fails to tie the three stories together. They are not intertwined. They're paced similarly but hardly parallel. When the movie finishes at a minor cadence point for each there's no real feeling of resolution or accomplishment any of the three could easily return to the previous life. The loose ends left behind are typical for real life  in fact none of the three seems to feel any need to clean up any loose ends. They all come off as selfcentered thoughtless people in this respect. To be honest several of their loose ends deserve no more. Still the plots start in the middle end at a minor cadence and don't really develop cleanly on the way. Various minor characters drift in and out apparently important to the central woman but the writer never informs us of what they're doing in her life why she pays so much attention to them.".

Her French 17th Century Rocco styled fashions are at times oddball and avantgarde and yet surprisingly cool looking that it's little wonder why American Pop Singer Gwen Stefani has drawn inspiration from this fashion trend for her L.A.M.B. fashion line and to dress her Harajuku Girls.Anna Tsuchiya is also a wonderful surprise as IchikoIchigo the tough talking Yanki Sukeban with a heart of gold. She has most of the best lines in the movie and is also quite a cutie behind the Sukeban makeup.The only criticism I have for the film is the stupid American title Kamikaze Girls. It really doesn't do justice to the film at all and is a real turnoff as it brings to mind a Yakuza film or perhaps a war picture in a stereotyping tongueandcheek way. Why not just call it simply Momoko and Ichigo i.e. Peaches and Strawberry or some other title that is a bit more relevant.Other than that this film is a pure joy and delight and a welcomed change to Japanese cinema.".

	schema:headline " Divine Sisterhood of Kamikaze Girls";
	schema:reviewBody "After a series of well crafted and highly imaginative features strangely initiating their collective march the year 2004 became easily recognizable as a strong starting point for the genre that fuses real life situations with surreal imagery fantasy sequences and eccentric music. Although it has been done before I think lately directors have grown more keen to devoting more time and money into creating something that is as unconventional to the mind as it is hard for people to even categorize or describe to one another. Kamikaze Girls tells a story of Momoko young student infatuated with the 18th century life style and beliefs perfectly enduring a life without any friends and sharing interest in designing summery clothes. Her time of tranquility and virtue are disrupted by the newly acquainted female biker named Ichigo who looks just as tough as she sounds. At first glance both characters seem very vulnerable to overplaying their roles and coming off pretentious and forced but they manage not only to avoid such frailties but also provide good comical sense and delivery without tiring clichs. A then debuting actress Anna Tsuchiya is remarkable and effortlessly showcases her talent by diving into her character's past and portraying someone very different from who she has become now. In some ways she reminded me of Cecilia Cheung and her wonderful debut in King Of Comedy. The conflict of the story is rather light and its resolution is equally fitting without overindulging itself with melodrama and tragedy. It was time well spent and even though I didn't acquire a great piece of mind I know that I enjoyed every minute of this film. Within such genre of limitless possibilities and with these similar yet unique films like Mind Game Survive Style 5 and Otakus in Love the future of visionary cinema is looking exceptionally promising and I hope that some of these first time directors only grow stronger and dive deeper into the realm of their richly ambient senses to express even the simplest tales of life.".

	onyx:emotionText "After a series of well crafted and highly imaginative features strangely initiating their collective march the year 2004 became easily recognizable as a strong starting point for the genre that fuses real life situations with surreal imagery fantasy sequences and eccentric music. Although it has been done before I think lately directors have grown more keen to devoting more time and money into creating something that is as unconventional to the mind as it is hard for people to even categorize or describe to one another. Kamikaze Girls tells a story of Momoko young student infatuated with the 18th century life style and beliefs perfectly enduring a life without any friends and sharing interest in designing summery clothes. Her time of tranquility and virtue are disrupted by the newly acquainted female biker named Ichigo who looks just as tough as she sounds. At first glance both characters seem very vulnerable to overplaying their roles and coming off pretentious and forced but they manage not only to avoid such frailties but also provide good comical sense and delivery without tiring clichs. A then debuting actress Anna Tsuchiya is remarkable and effortlessly showcases her talent by diving into her character's past and portraying someone very different from who she has become now. In some ways she reminded me of Cecilia Cheung and her wonderful debut in King Of Comedy. The conflict of the story is rather light and its resolution is equally fitting without overindulging itself with melodrama and tragedy. It was time well spent and even though I didn't acquire a great piece of mind I know that I enjoyed every minute of this film. Within such genre of limitless possibilities and with these similar yet unique films like Mind Game Survive Style 5 and Otakus in Love the future of visionary cinema is looking exceptionally promising and I hope that some of these first time directors only grow stronger and dive deeper into the realm of their richly ambient senses to express even the simplest tales of life.";

	schema:reviewBody "This a welldone girls' comingofage tale like a Japanese 21stcentury Alice in Wonderland  one Lewis Carroll would probably have liked. And I presume whoever gave the Kamikaze Girls title to the American edition would have titled the Alice work Kamikaze Alice. The underlying themes are independent thinking the value of friendship and the need to pursue one's creative impulses while critically evaluating surrounding people and opportunities.Most the adult figures in the film are  in one way or another  failures. Though seen in an exaggerated humorous or empathetic light they serve as guideposts to the two girls who come to realize that salvation or sallvation as Ichigo misspells it for emphasis lies not in following the crowd not in seeking leaders' approval but in following one's own dreams  as much as they can be realized in this limited 3dimensional mortal world.Early in the film I feared it was headed to be too sweet especially with the main characters being Momoko Peaches and Ichigo Strawberries. But this sweetness is quickly counterbalanced with the challenges and adventures they face.This is a fun and very unique film good for people of all ages. In ways it's set in a society that seems closer to the U.S. of the 1950's  around the beat and the James Dean eras when youth could be wild without police being called and yet neighborhoods could leave front doors unlocked without fear and kids could even hitchhike  an age of greater homogeneity when America had some cultural unity and  with exception of its blackwhite scar  was not afraid of itself.I obtained this film by the way in VCD format not the best but adequate I believe from HKFlix. I couldn't find it anywhere in DVD format.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Very cute story of two 17 yr olds both which are completely different from one another joined by a strange chain of events. The main girl Momoko is comparable to Lizzie McGuire. Cutesy delicate and lives like shes a princess in the 1700s. Her father made a living selling generic clothes with multiple expensive name brand labels and winds up getting caught and kicked out to the country with her grandmother. The second girl comparable to Avril Laviene a dirtiedup biker gang member finds out about her clothes and even though she cant stand her style ridicules her and even headbutts Momoko around shes helplessly drawn to this little girl. Together they're on a hunt to find an exgang member who can sew Ichigos perfect uniform for her gang member's wedding.I loved the movie's fast pace! It was very reminiscent to that of Japanese movie Survive Style 5 and kind of resemblant to Run Lola Run. There's a few segments that are drawn anime style to show past events even quicker and more violent. Its very funny how fast paced the movie runs sometimes but there's slow moments as well that tell the story. The entire movie plays out like a perfectly drawn girls manga with insanely exaggerated characters even more crazy outfits and one male character in particular 5 foot greaser haircut! Its well worth watching for any animemanga fan! The music composed by Yoko Kanno fits very well into this movie and has fast and slow paced music for all of the scenes.Its a girl flick at heart but definitely one to see if you're into anime and manga. Very nice surprise ending as well!".

That is not to say that this is not a good movie. Quite on the contrary KG is tastefully enjoyable.Strip away the slightly exaggerated camera work and montages here and there KG is in its root a human story. In this particular movie it's a story of bonding of friendship of two girls not unlike what we see in Baunsu ko gaurusu Bounce ko gals 1997 which however has three protagonists instead.Quite special but certainly not original are the reversed roles of the two girls from their outward appearance. Momoko Fukada Kyoko timid and fragile on the surface is the tough one who after surviving a parental divorce at 6 has grown to be completely selfsufficient emotionally needing and having no friends at all. Ichigo Tsuchiya Anna the wild and reckless biker is in dire need of a true friend although she is a member of a girl motorcycle gang. The friendship that starts and grows between the two is mildly bumpy and at times quite touching without contrivance.Although the story telling is not entirely conventional there is nothing absolutely outrageous. For example Momoko's earlier flying scenes are later explained as her own imagination. The initial collision followed by flashback narrations plays a little trick on the audience but not as big as the one in The Upside of Anger. The movie moves along without a lot of real happenings but plenty of amusing anecdotes. There is a very conventional climax and heroic rescue.All told there should be enough in this movie to give people a feeling of a little something different and have them leaving the theatre feeling relaxed and happy.".

I've always been interested in the Lolita style and everything related to Japan so I asked this movie for a Christmas gift and I got it. I had to watch it on my computer because it didn't work on DVD for some reason. But that didn't matter at least I was able to watch it.Shomotsuma Monogatari which translates to Shimotsuma fairytale was a cute story about a friendship of two completely different 17yearolds. I never watched Japanese nonAnime movies before now but my mum has seen a couple of Japanese horror comedies. She thought they were funny so she decided to watch Shomotsuma Monogatari with me. Comedy is definitely NOT my favorite genre of a movie but sometimes I just have to take a chance and watch something else than horror.Some parts of that movie were so funny that they made me laugh. Momoko Kyoko Fukada was so cute. I loved all the outfits she wore and wish they could be mine. After watching this movie I've highly wanted to be a Lolita but I have no money and I don't even get anything Lolitalike at this state. Anna Tsuchiya is beautiful too but not in the role of Ichigo. She wore terrible crap I wouldn't wear in public even through you paid me for it! But this movie was good. Not the best in the world but good. My mum thought it was boring so she fell asleep while watching it! If she had watched the full movie she wouldn't think it was boring. It was really funny! I highly recommend this movie for all the fans of comedy movies.".

The story is also nonsensical Momoko a strange and seemingly emotionless girl obsessed with Rococo befriends a Yanki biker and the two experience well...nothing really but empty. There is just not much happening and even at a reasonable 100 mins it just feels to long and stretched out. A nice try but if you like to see eccentric Japanese film with strange humor than there are much better productions out there. So in that sense this movie DOES resemble Amlie it's also overrated if I check the IMDb scores ".

I was not disappointed as it was a delight from start to finish... even if the opening scene did suggest the ending would not be too happy.The film opens with Momoko a girl in a frilly dress being hit by another vehicle as she rides along on a scooter as she flies through the air expecting to die she says good bye to her friends and family before we go back in time to find out just how she came to be there. Young Momoko's father is a fairly incompetent member of the Yakuza who makes a living selling fake designer goods until he annoys the wrong people and has to leave town and live in the countryside. In order to make money to pay for the Rococo clothing she loves so much Momoko places an advert in a magazine to sell her father's remaining stock. The advert is answered by Ichigo a biker girl who is the opposite of everything Momoko is aggressive violent and worst of all dressed in clothes from the local supermarket. Ichigo is most impressed with the goods Momoko is selling and is shocked by the low prices being charged. The two girls form an unlikely friendship which leads the two girls to places neither would have expected themselves to be.Kyko Fukada and Anna Tsuchiya are fantastic as Momoko and Ichigo bringing the viewer into their unfamiliar world. The director has creating a surreal world where the colours aren't quite natural and where flashbacks occur as psychedelic animations. The only negative comment I can make about this film is that the English subtitles on the version shown on the television weren't the easiest to read.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kamikaze Girls has worn us down by its end a film mostly devoid of any kind of stonewall nor indeed nourishing substance although scoring rather highly on the style content. We come away from it recalling the funky camera techniques the colour scheme the sporadic costumes and other things which are generally left to filmmakers whom we feel are in total control of their project and are doing what they're doing for very specific reasons like the breaking of the fourth wall. In short things in Kamikaze Girls do not hold together a film I read has some sort of ground in Japanese Manga comics of which I am unfamiliar in spite of the fact the piece as a whole just felt very dialogue heavy to be more broadly linked to any kind of comic book. The film is I think a comedy although there are very few laughs whereas the room it makes for itself to develop a heterosexual love affair between two people place a homoerotic tie under the microscope or indeed use a fatherdaughter relationship as the basis for predominant material are each sideswiped for the sorts of off kilter content one often finds infuriating when these sorts of projects just don't quite come off.The film opens with a motorcycle accident. We've seen motorcycle accidents in films before but not one which opens after a mockcomic book picture board of varying drawn frames as a lead character then narrates to us in slowmotion how she collided with a van carrying pineapples before hoping she'll be reincarnated in 18th Century France should she die. The as described manner about which the film goes depicting said opening ought to speak volumes. From here a flashback to several months ago begins a host of superfluous tidbits attempting to establish where the lead is coming from. That lead is Momoko Fukada a young girl a character we feel we would not otherwise had seen on the screen had 2001's Ameli not been the hit it was. She speaks of how she really wants to shop in Japan's capital Tokyo but can't and laments being stuck in the town that she is due to the tacky supermarkets which offer consumerist products and don't give provide her what she wants. Ho hum. Her parents are divorced but this doesn't bother her her father a sort of cashcow to whom she goes to fund her image which she constructs around the desiring to look like a baby's doll of some kind.It is her father's being caught selling clothes under the banner of fake labels which ends things here and sees Momoko pushed further afield to her grandmother's living of a quieter life away from shops and general bustle. Momoko sticks to the tried and tested enough to keep in the flow of things and a biker gang inception as well as the bonding with a games arcade dwelling boy named Ryuji Abe sparks a love interest. Aside from anything else the film is a depiction of a bond between lead Momoko and that of Ichigo Tsuchiya a wouldbe rough biker chick whose childhood was ridden with faults and who ended up in the clan of leather wearing bike driving girls that she is. Momoko and Ichigo's tryst carries with it particular homoerotic undertones Momoko's onoff romance with Pachinko gambling Ryuji a substory there to mask what is ultimately a tale of two girls of such stark backgrounds coming together and realising that what they have to offer one another is more important that any sociological expectancy.Principally these two girls of such binary oppositions aid one another in ways neither of them envisage. Ichigo is a disillusioned young girl in need of someone frank and lateral in order to cheer her up. Similalry Momoko has before glanced over her parents' divorce and needs an experience to have her realise how much it ought to have affected her this exposure to a grittier way of living away from the frilly and carefree nature of her old existence with someone who has been through similar childhood hardships the required tonic. It is a shame such a dynamic is often buried under the poorly choreographed aesthetic director Tetsuya Nakashima applies to the material that of bouncy and frilly and just generally juvenile when adult subject matter is trying its hardest to burst out from underneath. Momoko quickly becomes tiresome as a lead her episodic life as she darts from sewing for a living to casino loitering to becoming caught up in an impending biker gang war delivered to us in a fashion that has it too much to absorb without enough bareboned substance to keep us interested. I read it began life as a book and has since had ties to the comic book world  I've no intension of catching up on either medium depicting what I saw here but I imagine all this colour and empty spectacle looks a lot better on the pulpy pages of a Manga novel or on the pieces of paper imbued within that of a book as words and sentences play out allowing its reader to use their imagination to bring to life what's being described. Nakashima brings those words to life here in this film but they are visual incarnations few should find particularly interesting.".

One day they receive a transmission from planet Iskandar with a plan for warp engine and a wave cannon. In their last hope people of Japan uses this information to transform battleship Yamato  a world war II relic that is now exposed out of a dried up sea bed into a spaceship. They set out to Iskandar which exists in the great Magellan nebula in hopes of finding an answer to earth's problem.I see touch of Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica in the overall looks and feel of the props ships and the battle sequences but it's certainly the very best special effects science fiction I've ever seen to come out of Japan. I'd say that Japanese scifi have finally come of age in this movie.The final sequence of this movie is very Japanese in my opinion and might be over melodramatic for the international audience but the movie was made for the Japanese viewers so I don't have any problems there.Takuya Kimura has a habit of stretching out the ending of a word when calling out orders and speaking dramatically which sounded odd at times and the dead pan acting of Meisa Kuroki could have been more charming but overall things were believable and didn't mess up the story.Beautifully done movie with real feeling of being out there in space with unbelievable special effects considering its budget.

There is little feelings of romance between Kodai Susumu and Mori Yuki. It just felt flat. This I attributed to the target audience of the original animated series.2. The melodrama at the end on the bridge was very Japanese..... in the 1970s. It should have been shorter and more modernized. I guess one has to be a diehard fan not to find that scene particularly longwinded.3. There wasn't enough battle footage of the Yamato and her enemies. This I was seriously looking forward to but was left disappointed.4. I wish Mr Kimura would shed a few tears that would have made his performance more believable.That said there were quite a few good points about the movie 1. Realistic spacefighter maneuvers. The big turnarounds of spaceships and fighters in American scifi is just plain BS. The only other scifi that got it right was Babylon 5.2. Up until the bridge scene right at the very end I was actually not aware of the time passing.3. This movie have some of the better Japanese actors in recent years. Overall their performances are well delivered and their friendships believable.4. Swearing and vulgarities are nonexistent in the entirety of the movie or none that I am aware of. This is a rarity these days especially with all the filth coming out of American and European films.5. The graphics and SFX are quite good. They are quite realistic. I have no problem with much of it except for those SFX sounds the lasers and beams made.... sound very arcadelike and very 70s.This movie is worth the ticket you paid for.".

	schema:headline " Finally a true Space Battleship movie... i.e. more RTS than FPS";
	schema:reviewBody "... should have been made by the people who made this liveaction Space Battleship Yamato 2010 movie which is based on the Classic first major space opera after Star Trek before Star Wars animated TV series of the same name  and much closer in style and content to Star Trek The Original TV Series... since it doesn't devolve into the teenangst or slomo action of recent Hollywood blockbusters.The source material is given many judicious updates which largely made sense to me from a story if not production standpoint e.g. the talking robot Analyzer is now a SIM module which you can load into other devices and the aliens are now truly alien with technology and energy signatures which humans have difficulty detecting or understanding.... And the writing is smart enough to make light of the oldschooled stuff they keep like their costumes we're still wearing this? and oneliners. In fact there is so little fanservice or sequel baiting that nonfans probably won't realize that this is an adaptation of a 1970s TV animation series using the ORIGINAL music!P.S. To anyone who thinks that the characters' reactions to the movie's apocalyptic story is unrealistic taking time to make decisions say farewells mournsalute the dead just look at how real Japanese people deal with their earthquakes and tsunamis.Owing to the fact that the Japanese general movie audience is not that much larger than the Japanese animemanga audience there is no faux issue of reimagining the source material for a newlarger audience and the writers rise to the monumental task of condensing many epic if episodic storyarcs which should have taken a trilogy if not a series of 78 movies into a single feature film... by focusing on the STORY! In fact this movie is so tightly structured that the only really unexplained or implausible thing in it is probably all of the actors' great hair... and the secret lies in using scifi movie tropes most of it actually originating from their source material NOT explaining them since no amount of technobabble will turn a plot device into reality.Which is where I believe this movie will divide audiences into fans and nonfans of the source material or scifianime in general a downside of all this emphasis on story is of course a relative lack of characterization.... Though thankfully anime stereotypes have at least one more dimension than their Hollywood counterparts and the casting is mostly SPOTON you who believe skinny anime characters with fluffy hair do not exist in Japan repent! And some inevitably heavy narration and exposition which might have been risible were thankfully short focused and welldelivered with a touch of selfawareness eyerolling by the characters themselves. And as expected veteran actors deliver their lines and inhabit their characters without batting an eyelid while younger cast members are less convincing with their histrionics.So while this might seem like a pretty generic space adventure to general audiences it is and has always been intended as a treat for the fans. And this movie won me over for the simple fact that after decades of Star Wars and Star Trek it could still make me go WOW... every time an alien or a spaceship appeared for all of 34 of a second because it's not what you have it's how you use it!For this is lowbudget moviemaking by Hollywood standards so there is absolutely no pimping of expensive special effects which means that the only time you get to see the aliensspaceships is when they are actually doing something ESSENTIAL to the plot. And scifi fans might also note that they got the relative speeds of capitalships bigger  slower vs fighterships missilefire warpeffects almost instantaneous by comparison RIGHT so there is no such rubbish as waiting for visual confirmation which is meaningless in the vastness of space or capitalships dodging longrange fire which would hit almost as soon as they are detected.All this means going back to the bridge battles of submarinebattleship warfare this Yamato looksworks more like a submarine with a skeletal crew than some cruiseboat or flyingcity which rely more on having good scriptsactors than special effects and people who don't think this can't be nervewrecking should see how they setup the Yamato's SPLITSECOND warpmaneouvers!The budgetary limits really start showing up near the end of the movie but if the money is lacking the heart is not the relatively simple yet distinct special effects design transforming 2stage fighterships! is always a pleasure to behold even when very tight or wide shots are used in order to avoid rendering very expensive details. It may be just a few frames of CGI but the impact will leave you replaying it in your mind...The real only disappointment for me if any would be how the human and environmental issues Living with irradiated earth? Leaders making up white lies? everpresent in the best of Japanese anime is left in the background as both the challenges and solutions presented in the story are essentially alienrelated. I mean I'm ashamed to admit to one of the more touching moments for me was when Analyzer finally took on its robotform hey it had more lines than the red shirts....".

I'm not familiar with the original series or comic so i can not attest to its being good or bad in that sense. What i am familiar with is the historical significance of the battleship Yamato and the symbolism and slight role it played in WWII for the Japanese People. Japan had one of the most powerful navies and arguably the most powerfulin the world at the beginning of hostilities in the Pacific theatre of WWII. By the 6th of April 1945 when the Yamato left port for the last time the Japanese navy had been ravaged they had lost most of their carriers and cruisers with only about 10 of its original naval forces remaining. The Yamato and a few escorts were to attempt to attack the now Allied occupied Okinawa in a nearfutile attempt to deal a blow to the US fleet. She was destroyed enroute to the battle by relentless air attack by the US and never got to use her 9 46cm batteries the largest in existence at the time. This story is about hope honour and the tenacity of the Japanese people as a whole. Of course it was corny they raised the hulk of the ship out of the ground! And besides bearing a resemblance in spirit its clearly not the actual ship its about 5 times as large. The acting was perfectly appropriate for the type of story this was and despite a few drawn out scenes i was still very entertained. Sure some of the CGI at the end was to quote another review dodgy but for the most part actually pretty good. But thats not what this movie is about. Its about the symbolism of a desperate mission which only a Japanese navy would have taken its about remembering history and its about transferring it to a modern setting of hope prevailing in a time of despair. Enjoy the CGI enjoy the space battles don't worry about the inconsistencies with weapons and apparent inept Gamillas forces towards the end maybe new recruits?and instead enjoy the heroes and unmistakable fight to the last man mentality and Japanese spirit which comes through in every scene.".

I watched this movie because it is SciFi and because I always try to find and watch offHollywood movies.Unfortunately Battleship Yamato was not a very good choice.People praise the CGI and they would have been great. In 1990. Perhaps even 2000. Not in 2010 come on fellow reviewers! The battle scenes are OK but... quite unbelievable. A squadron of fighters destroy opponents stronger than them in... orders of magnitude! They defy the laws of physics not just in the ever present space sounds lasers explosions etc. but also in the little matter of inertia. The space fighters love to stop and make 179 degrees turns in ways that would make any human passenger a blob of... you know what. And this is the favourite tactic of our Black Tiger squadron the one that always succeeds. Of course the enemy can accomplish no such feat and is therefore laser fodder.Talking about the enemy... This must be one of the worst caricatures of aliens in SciFi movies. They are close to giant mutant spiders and flesh eating clouds. Their tactical choices ridiculous. Their range in skill spectacular. One of them can kill several elite troopers inside their own spaceship while avoid the bullets from dozens of their colleagues while a little later gazillions of them die storming a vehicle and a sillyvoiced robot. Oh and in case you are wondering this is an individual yet collective mind race. Both yes!All of the above were the best parts of the movie. The worst parts include cheesy dialogue undeveloped not underdeveloped characters for whom you have no sympathy or attachment bad to hideous acting boring camera work a photography that has too few well placed frames and A LOT of awful ones all the clichs in SciFi and WarAction filmography and I left the worst for last a love story that makes you yearn for an Adam Sandler movie. Preferably with Paris Hilton as the object of his undying love!So why the three points? After reading the other reviews and doing some homework all three points are given out of respect for the original Yamato story and for the original productions. 010 for this one.".

Turns out my fears were unfounded.They cast each part with simply the perfect person to play them and despite the re purposing of Yuki and the Starbucking of Dr Sado everyone performed fantastically! The updating of the costumes was something that I really liked as well...they would really fit in with what a realworld version would look like. I want one of those jackets!There's some dodgy CG in a couple of the scenes but for the most part the effects overall really brought the Yamato universe to life.The pace of the film moves along briskly starting with the battle near Mars and not letting up for more than a few minutes at a time to allow the story to breathe. Anyone complaining of the filmstopping love scenes has no clue why they are so integral to the film and they do not in fact even slow it down.I have been a fan of this universe for more than 30 years and I was quite satisfied with the film.

I saw this in Matsudo over New Year with my lady friend and we both loved it. From the stirring opening battle to the dramatic climax I was gripped.This is light years from the cold war posturing of Star Trek it's all about the Japanese and their ties to an iconic WW2 warship and what it means to them. It was built to protect them from the Americans in WW2 and in space it is sent to protect mankind. Star Trek was a rip off of Forbidden Planet anyway so we won't dwell too much on that shall we?The effects are stunning. I have since seen a few episodes of the anime on You Tube and everything is spot on... the Yamato herself has to be one of the most striking spacecraft ever to set sail for the stars.I love it... 1010".

I have since seen a few episodes of the anime on You Tube and everything is spot on... the Yamato herself has to be one of the most striking spacecraft ever to set sail for the stars.I love it... 1010";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Space Battleship Yamato";
	schema:reviewBody "While it is its own film with material drawn from its rich source content the film is mostly based on its 1974 series one cannot help but to see shades of JJ Abram's reboot of the Star Trek film franchise here. Granted there are many parallels between Star Trek and Yamato for starters the legendary space ships are named after their equally legendary real world counterparts and are the best of their fleet and make in the reel world though one comes with seat belts that got seldom used manned by the best crew that an ideology can supply which the story takes some pains to introduce at least their core duties on board. It's also the story of the coming of age of a young captain where in this case Takuya Kimura's Susumu Kodai is the equivalent of James Tiberius Kirk possessing qualities befitting a captain that he needs to realize and grow into with that level of hot headedness and past famed exploits to allow him some gravitas and stature amongst peers and crew members.Then of course this film went for broke in its action sequences beginning much like Star Trek putting the audience right into the thick of a big set action piece which culminates in a loss that will shape the events of things to come and seriously the way the space voyagers attempted to disable an enemy planet's defenses was uncannily similar to the Star Trek one in its approach. I suppose if Yamato had beaming technology then this would complete its Trekkie influence but thankfully it held back on that temptation making it a little more challenging each time it had to reign in crew outside of its hull.Fans of the long running series will have to accept the fact that this is not something from our generation since a translation to film means a huge amount of compression having to take place to tell something worthwhile creating in a sense its own version of events. It's Year 2199 and Earth is plague by radioactive attacks by the alien race Gamilas who are adamant in creating an atmosphere suitable for their race for a total takeover. Gone are Earth's greens and it's up to the crew of Yamato hastily assembled may I add to travel to the planet of Iscandar to retrieve what could possibly be Earth's last hope to restore its environment. This sets off a round trip for Yamato's voyage and along the way the crew will face various hostilities always threatening the ship or to extinguish the hopes of Earth.The special effects are all detailed and intricately done so much so that they really look like something to scale and real making space dogfights in the various Star Wars films seem like a walk in the park. It's incredibly edge of your seat stuff as ships of different sizes battling it out and if watched in a good theatre with excellent sound system you can bet your last dollar of feeling every laser cannon and even the trademark of the Wave Motion Gun round that goes off. Best part is and I think some films and filmmakers need to learn from this is that it's never shy of utilizing its best weapon in its arsenal whenever it can avoiding plenty of the usual clich pitfalls of saving the best for the last. Really whatever for when you have a threat in front of you that you need to neutralize why not deploy the best you have on board?Don't expect too much character development here though because there isn't much time to jam pack so much into what's already close to 2 hours and 20 minutes. As such the first act suffered a little from the lack of a proper introduction on characters and their motivations preferring to keep you in suspense as it slowly unravelled them sometimes just through a one liner in passing. You'll soon acquaint yourself with the crew enough to know their core function and most of them time everyone sticks to their one single function on board the ship. The end result is a rather choppy beginning just as Yamato finds its feet in its maiden voyage before things smoothen out as the voyage progressed. With a new crew in a new ship also come the avenues for mistakes to be made and one of the more telling one is how everyone let their guard down en route to base common pitfall in the military where one's guard should be up until you actually reach paradise.The other issue I found wanting in a minor way though it still worked was Takuya Kimura's presence. He's such a big star and is really charismatic on screen that my memory of the Kodai character pales in comparison but like how Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible was my memory of Yamato was that this was a group attempt and mission which Kimura's star power inevitably made him prominent in every step of the way through the story as if it's solely a one man show often overshadowing that of his costars such as Meisa Kuroki who is a big name herself Toshiro Yanagiba and Tsutomu Yamazaki who plays the ship's Captain Okita responsible for crafting the mission of hope that Yamato finds itself in. Throwing in a romantic subplot for good measure that was expected though hurried and side characters such as Analyzer the robot was fun but could have been better executed rather than a short supporting appearance.Still Space Battleship Yamato is one nostalgic guilty pleasure. It helps if you have a little bit of a background on characters and motivations as the story hits the ground running at breakneck speed from the get go and is a special effects romp that will wow even the most jaded of audiences who have seen one space battle too many.".

	schema:headline " Excellent liveaction with high romance and sacrifice";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen every Space Battleship Yamato episode and movie have been a longtime fan of this series since the 1970's know the words to the theme songs in English as well as Japanese have all of the model kits of all of the major ships and have had crew as well as captain's uniforms tailormade for myself. So as a serious fan I give my total approval for this film. It is just so wonderful I don't know where to begin. Wonderful casting! Kimura looks the part and fleshed out the Kodai character into real life very effectively. I was so glad that his hair was not a recreation of the odd sidecovering bangs of the animated character because that would've just looked stupid. Instead his hair was long and wavy and very Jpop style. Wonderful job on wardrobe! The leather jackets really worked for me because they look like what real flight jackets should look like as opposed to the white shirts they wore in the original anime. There was a great variety of footwear among the crew from shoes to boots to steampunkish numbers to what looked like hiking boots Kodai. My only complaint is that Kodai probably would have looked better with the same calflength boots that some of the other crew were wearing however uncomfy they are to wear. Wonderful space helmets as well quite an upgrade from the 1970's ones which never really made much sense to me.The guns Wonderful job on the rifles but I would have liked to have seen the Astro Automatic Cosmo Nambu which is the trademark Matsumoto gun! The ones in this film looked little more than dressedup Glocks or HK's I'd say Walthers as well but Walthers actually look better than these guns did. Wonderful liveaction recreations of the most poignant scenes from the entire animated series! There is high romance and sacrifice. My only real complaint was there was not enough tenderness between Kodai and Yuki but that may actually have slowed the pacing down too much.Wonderful idea to cast some of the crew as female characters especially Dr. Sado! And she acted like the original male character too especially in the brig scene where she is visiting Kodai. The effects...oh my god the effects...were just unbelievably amazing! The design of the Earth ships in the beginning were the most impressive after the Yamato of course and totally exceeded my expectations for starship design in the Matsumoto universe. Okita's flasghip in fact may have been an homage to the reallife Bismarck because the gun arrangement was very similar to that famous German battleship's. Either that or the Japanese Kongoclass battleship which also had a similar arrangement but the blockiness of the turrets seemed more similar to the Bismarck's! The fighters...omg the fighters...so unbelievably sexy and well thought out! They resemble the original Black Tigers and Cosmo Zero but with stealthy features and thrusters reminiscent of the F22 Raptor and sweptforward wings like the Su47 Berkut! Combining design elements like that in such a thoughtful and logical manner really show that the design team knew their stuff. I was also glad that there seemed to be a muchreduced fighter complement on board seemed like a dozen fighters or less which is MUCH more believable than the 70 or so that the anime version carried...which is just impossible for a ship only 263 m long with most of the internal space being its space engine! And the way the shock turrets destroyed mass numbers of the enemy...brilliant and logical!!! In the original anime you had the shock turrets sometimes destroying mass numbers of targets just by passing them and not hitting them directly which did not make a lot of sense! Obviously the original idea was that they could be used as an area weapon but they were never able to show this convincingly in the anime but they took time to think it through for this movie and made the appropriate effects. And as for the wave motion cannon undulation gun...so cool! My only complaint is perhaps they shouldn't have used it to take the shot at the planetbomber at the very beginning because using that gun was always a big climactic moment in the anime. The plain old shock turrets would have taken that thing out without a problem. Then again...can we really get too much of the wave cannon? All in all a super wonderful production!".

	schema:headline " Yamazaki Yamato is visually stunning but short on story";
	schema:reviewBody "Yamazaki Takashi's long awaited live action adaptation Uchuu Senkan Yamato tries hard to live up to the timeless Uchuu Senkan Yamato Starblazers for Western Audiences anime saga but doesn't quite capture all the human elements which resonated so well with audiences back in the 70s and 80s. With a much more starker and darker storyline than its source material Yamato seems to try to ape the successful J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot as well as the recent TV series Battlestar Galactica by trying to reinterpret itself for modern audiences but in doing so sheds too much of the Space Opera style that worked so well in the original anime series.Screenwriter Sato Shimako most familiar to viewers as the creative force behind the Unfair JDorama TV series does an admirable job trying to condense and streamline Nishizaki Yoshinobu and Matsumoto Leiji's epic 26episode TV series and highlight as much of the notable events that occurred in the series as possible but this seemed at the expense of any real character development. Characters are paraded through the movie at such a breakneck pace that it doesn't leave much time to get to know all the characters outside of a few notables.Kimura Takuya Hero Pride Long Vacation is perfectly cast as iconic hero Kodai Susumu and successfully captures the character's rebel attitude. Kimura's boyish charms and star charisma only help to make Susumu more likable and identifiable. Okinawan JPop idol and beauty Kuroki Meisa also successfully realizes the character of love interest Mori Yuki but rather than play her as an ethereal and delicate beauty as in the anime series she is portrayed as a brash hotshot Cosmo Tiger pilot which is one of the more clever changes made at updating the character. Their romantic scenes are good but do not really capture the same tender and playful romance of the original. Ikeuchi Hiroyuki the brutal Miura in Wilson Yip's Ip Man is a standout with his gruff portrayal of Space Marine  Saito Hajime who was actually a prominent character in the Yamato 2 series. His passionate and raw portrayal of Saito was very memorable. Yanagiba Toshiro Bayside Shakedown was also well cast as Science Officer Sanada Shiro. There are also a number of familiar veteran stars rounding out the cast including Yamazaki Tsutomu Departures who plays Captain Okita Nishida Toshiyuki Tsuribaka Nisshi series who plays Chief Engineer Tokugawa Takashima Reiko Railways who portrays Dr. Sado and Hashizume Isao A Taxing Woman Nada Sou Sou who portrays Earth Defense Commander Todou. They are all very good but their screen times are so far and few inbetween. They might as well have been cameos.As with his previous films such as Returner Juvenile and Always San Chou Me No Yuhi Yamazaki's visual flair and style worked well with the material. Yamazaki and his SFX team do an absolutely outstanding and brilliant job of realizing Matsumoto Leiji's Yamato star cruiser design. The same can't be said of the GamilusGamilon Aliens who seem to be cut of the same cloth as the aliens from so many other alien invasion films of Hollywood. Those expecting to see the regal head of villainous DesslerDessloc may be disappointed at seeing his movie counterpart who is uninteresting to say the least.Fans may also be somewhat confused and ambivalent about the major storyline changes that were done. While it did seem a very radical and interesting take I can't say that it was a right choice for the story.All in all fans will certainly enjoy this big budgeted SFX heavy popcorn movie but those expecting to be emotional moved by the story will be somewhat disappointed .".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GOOD And the reason it gets this vote good CGI. The Yamato crew has the right looks those who watched Japanese movies surely recognized many faces. The uniforms are cool. A couple of nice scenes.THE BAD I watched the whole production serial and movies and I can say that they took the WORST of the first two seasons and mashed it up in an incomprehensible garbage. The acting is totally lame considering the actors I've seen more emotions conveyed by Michael bay's TRANSFORMERS 3 need to say more?!. The battle scenes are unbelievable the Cosmo Tigers had to fight for dear life and those were greatlooking battles while here a couple of fighters can take down a whole Gamilas fleet?!? Where were those pilots during the war for Earth????? The voyage to Iskandar took the better half of one year here it looks like it took barely a week. What made the first season so emotional was the sense of this countdown to doomsday. 'Hurry up Yamato it's only 265 days before the Earth is doomed!' Abraham's Enterprise had it harder guys! Though of course the astronomy has evolved since 1974 and Pluto couldn't be considered a fullsized planet as depicted 40 years ago the lack of the battle to end the Gamilas base in the solar system dulls up the movie. I like the idea of Yuki being a more hardass babe it's more modern but seriously! The gal in this movie is cardboardcut! her socalled 'love story' with GodaiWildstar is something made for the sake of it it has no premises and no development at all. The budget was poor and it shows is that a battleship or a cramped submarine? Not to mention that they used THE SAME SET for Okita's first ship of earth defense and the Yamato's command bridge. Sheesh!THE UGLY Nothing could have been more spectacular than showing the binary system of Gamilas and Iskandar. Take that away and you rape half of the original script. there is no Starsha She's the beautiful queen of Iskandar who gives the Earthmen the Cosmo DNA to clean Earth...and only NOW at the end of the movie we discover the cleaner is a sort of superpower hidden inside Godai?!?!? Why do all this voyage then?? Oh yes to die en masse like on the finale of season II and in even a more ridiculous way. and finally because I got not enough room to list the horror in its fullest details The Gamilas... ARE. YOU. SERIOUSLY. KIDDING?!?!?!? Dessler was the archetype of the 'honorable enemy' witty cruel but capable of complimenting its adversaries stubborn but never crazy loyal to an ideal. A tragic figure that fought a war to find a new home a creature like us despite the blue skin forced to fight for survival...and there is NOTHING of that in this pale excuse of a movie! Heck even Prince Zodar was an interesting character in season II while we have a 'Dessler' who is a funnylooking dull hologram and the gamilas as faceless 'Aliens' drones.yes total destruction of the ship at the end was the best solution and the song that came with the credits will make us remember NEVER to go beyond renting this horror. Long live Yamato the anime!".

The gal in this movie is cardboardcut! her socalled 'love story' with GodaiWildstar is something made for the sake of it it has no premises and no development at all. The budget was poor and it shows is that a battleship or a cramped submarine? Not to mention that they used THE SAME SET for Okita's first ship of earth defense and the Yamato's command bridge. Sheesh!THE UGLY Nothing could have been more spectacular than showing the binary system of Gamilas and Iskandar. Take that away and you rape half of the original script. there is no Starsha She's the beautiful queen of Iskandar who gives the Earthmen the Cosmo DNA to clean Earth...and only NOW at the end of the movie we discover the cleaner is a sort of superpower hidden inside Godai?!?!? Why do all this voyage then?? Oh yes to die en masse like on the finale of season II and in even a more ridiculous way. and finally because I got not enough room to list the horror in its fullest details The Gamilas... ARE. YOU. SERIOUSLY. KIDDING?!?!?!? Dessler was the archetype of the 'honorable enemy' witty cruel but capable of complimenting its adversaries stubborn but never crazy loyal to an ideal. A tragic figure that fought a war to find a new home a creature like us despite the blue skin forced to fight for survival...and there is NOTHING of that in this pale excuse of a movie! Heck even Prince Zodar was an interesting character in season II while we have a 'Dessler' who is a funnylooking dull hologram and the gamilas as faceless 'Aliens' drones.yes total destruction of the ship at the end was the best solution and the song that came with the credits will make us remember NEVER to go beyond renting this horror. Long live Yamato the anime!";

	schema:reviewBody "12 Million Dollars to produce Yamato? Money well spent I'd say! Even though it takes place in limited spaces what is there looks good. Imagine making Yamato with a Transformers budget. That would give time to bring to life the lengthy battles from the original series. Especially the scene fighting the subspacemarine would be interesting to see in a sequel.What I liked about the movie is that it has characters. Somewhat cheesy and overdramatizing characters at times but that's Anime for you. There are some actual hero's voyages here involving more than cutting a distance between point a and b. There is the personal story of every character that makes this movie connect on more than an action level in its best moments.In its worst moments there are a lot of things I don't understand. Enemies there and then gone. A lot of stuff involving why didn't they do it scenarios on either the human or alien side. Plot vagueness might be a good way to call them without giving anything away. The overall picture is recommendable to any SciFi fan. It feels like they crammed a lot into it and don't always succeed with it. As has been said the ending is kind of a drag but it's alright. If I were to chose between this and Transformers Yamato would make the race due to better story development more interesting characters and a higher entertainment factor. I guess the Japanese acting is a bit stiff at times but there is this sense of serenity about it which makes it yet believable and enjoyable to the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about what the necessary ingredients may be for a successful space travelcentric scifi movie. Interstellar used a device to place the images in the past leveraging established movie notions. That was a movie that referenced and mined memories.Jodorowky's Dune would have been unlike anything we had seen then and have seen since. The space ships would have been costumed as if they were boats in an fantastic Italian opera. As I write this we will soon have the Disney Star Wars reboots and I know what we will get there the same battle and ship conventions we've had to live with for decades.So I had high expectations for this simply because it is Japanese successful and has a legacy before Star Wars.In addition to what you require for a sustainable story I think you need these things A selected mythology on which to base your equipment. Often this is just that a mega company has taken over the enterprise and given us what we expect from a soulless but efficient institution. Sometimes we are to believe that the ships and technology spring whole from a single mind that we are separately introduced to. That's where this movie is novel. When the WWII Yamato was built it was and still is the largest battleship ever launched. It was created with great publicity as the event which abrogated treaties and announced the intention of war. National identity fused with the craft the emperor endowed it with his magic and many believed the destiny of the nation and the ship were entwined. It served ignobly as it happens was sunk in the last great sea battle of the war but continues to captivate the hardwarecentric. In the original version of this epic the wreck of that ship was literally exhumed and converted to space travel. Its very presence anchors the inherited mythology.Under normal conditions we as viewers have to get to know the craft. We have to navigate it and get a sense for what is where. It is the whole world for much of a film and we have to learn it. In many good films like Sunshine this is done economically because the functionality of different areas can be read from the outside. None of that is done here. A limited budget forbid it but in any case what could you see? No one seems to have worked out what it would be like inside the nonspecialized spaces like the bridge and engine control room. Surely they believed it unnecessary. After all for many years the TeeVee Star Trek just had us in the similar bridge. But even in that case detailed drawings were circulated and many areas described in the show.The alien craft here have no coherent design ethic I can see other than being the opposite of the phallic hunk of steel. They are weblike and delicate or knobbly carapaces.But when it comes down to the dynamic side of space cinema what we need is to keep up with the evolving conventions.The bad news is that we don't have a good model of space battles. What we've done is stolen from WWI dogfights since Star Wars. Our small space fighters emulate aceflown biplanes more or less with acrobatics and primitive guns. This is slightly less disturbing here but I had hoped that the long legacy with comic books would give us a new perspective here. We desperately need it. Three things can help here movement of the camera tactics and explosions.The first of these we are already well into a revolution in some films. CGI allows the camera to be anywhere and move in any way we can stand. Many even mediocre filmmakers are experimenting with this and our ability as viewers to accept ghostly vision is evolving quickly. Peter Jackson's WETA is in the forefront here and soon I expect the spatial logic of space battles to soon be reinvented.For us to get better and more realistic tactics we have to abandon the notion that talented kids are flying their solo craft and shooting by holding buttons. As it happens I worked on mixed swarm tactics and can say that when we get there cinematically viewers will be thrilled. But the tension has to be removed from whether that one buzzer with one teen pilot can hit hisher target. Perhaps it will be an advanced toy market that drives this.Finally and perhaps independently of the others can we have a new model of space explosions? They don't have to be realistic. Little in these films is. I believe that we can create a new model of space explosion with new POVs that is ever so much more exciting than fireballs one that uses physics against itself.Other than all that the kids here are just silly. Worse than Ender's Game.".

And when compared with Battlestar Galactica the flight deck of that ship looked far more impressive.The directing is childish and the camera doesn't move very much. It is always front and center and I suspect this has something to do with the tiny sets.Space Battleship Yamato. Great special effects but... not much else. 510.".

Most of the characters are pale and dull and seems they are speaking the lines without any emotion attached to them beside being overacted roles which deliver the usual japanese performance of looooooooooooooong cheesy lines. anyone said Eli Wallach in The Good the Ugly the Bad?....  If you are going to shoot shoot do not speak just shoot!. Kimura Takuya delivers his usual performance nothing great but the rest of the crew is plain and even silly including the venerable Captain Okita. The movie relies heavily on the mental image created by the audience based on the original anime characters and do not make any effort on creating new psychological features that could give emotional deep to the characters they are just soulless caskets. The plot is basically the same as the original anime version but focuses completely on accomplishing a mission rather than on the journey. They go to Iskandar by crossing the galaxy jumping a couple of times to warp speed and fighting the Gamilus's forces but that's it plain and simple. There is no Odyssey attached to it there is no costly enterprise full of sacrifices and selfimmolation that built characters and join the crew as band of brothers. The director made a terrible job in terms of time management.The trip seems to have taken no more than 2 days instead of the original 1 year there is no pace no tension after one could say Oh my God the clock is ticking the earth is gonna die c'mon Yamato!. In addition the design does not present anything relevant or vaguely original everything seems plastic and fake people do not sweat bleed or cry and to make things worst...insectoid aliens for god sake! The original Anime series delivered a compelling conflict by making the aliens a Humanoid race whose planet is dying and need to colonize other planet. In this movie the Aliens are the insectoid kind who are super dupper evil that's it bad for the sake of being bad.And the ending... the ending...c'mon! Where did that children come from? Maybe I'm missing something but Do I have to assume he is the fruit of a 5 minutes relationship?Do I have to assume that Love is just 2 persons Kissing each other? Even PadmeAnakin's relationship is more credible! I could spent hundreds of line complaining about how the creative team behind this movie raped the original series and gave us the loyal fans to the Yamato Universe the biggest disappointment since Dragon Ball Evolution.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not familiar with the original series but watched this as I'm a fan of scifi. Hoping for some light entertainment I was appalled at the reactionary content of this film and cannot understand its success.

It might be to save Earth this time but it clearly refers to WW2 including a specific reference to the TenGo Operation on Okinawa a suicide mission which was to involve kamikaze attacks on American ships and troops. I can naturally understand the need to try and honour the memory of those Japanese soldiers who were needlessly slaughtered during the war but I don't see how presenting this as a model to follow today or in the future is going to do any good.

The VFX overseen by the experienced Director Yamazaki are surprisingly good for the most part but everything else acting alleged comedy endless melodrama is just awful and only laughable now and again so it's dull too. The production values are pretty paltry so you never feel the huge scale of the adventure and static isolated scenes on the bridge of the ship more LAND OF THE GIANTS than STAR TREK really grind the momentum down it's way overlong anyway. Scenes on the surface of Iskander reminded me of STARSHIP TROOPERS or rather a videogame based on that modern scifi classic. And don't get me started on the charisma vacuum that is Meisa Kuroki as awful here as she was in ASSAULT GIRLS. Romantic scenes between her and Kimura totally lack chemistry and just resemble two narcissists feeling each other out before a poutoff! Tsutomu Yamazaki doesn't have much to do as bedridden Captain Okita who will remind British viewers of Captain Birdseye above all else.

When I heard from a friend that it was being released as a movie in Japan where I currently live   I just had to go see it. So much so that I rewatched the TV series and did some research about it on the Web. Some interesting factsThe Argo in the US release was originally called the YamatoThe Yamato's namesake was a WW2 Destroyer.The Yamato was built right where I work at today!There is a museum near Hiroshima dedicated to the shipNow for the movie. I watched this last week in Yokosuka JP. Despite being in Japanese I felt confident I would be able to follow the storyline even if they changed it to adapt it for cinema. OK I go into the late showing and it's the theater is practically empty. Not a good sign of the 3 day after the release. The beginning was promising but slowly it became obvious that they made some major revisions to the story. That in itself isn't bad or unexpected but they removed several key elements or neutered them. They had a huge palette of source material and made a film that felt halffull. Let me explain. First the good Wildstar was still pretty crazy shootem up kind of guy. The Wave motion gun still owns. Nova Yuki  was still hot. Plus now she punches people and flies a fighter ships! Special EffectsCGI were well done. The Bad  Starsha? Where are you? Your sister is also missing. Thanks for still managing to get the Wave motion gun blueprints to us without appearing in the film.  Dessloc is no longer the witty archenemy he's some weird crystalline hologram.  Gamelons look like the flying lizards from Pitch Black.  5 fighter ships can take on the entire Gamelon fleet  The radiation purifier is inside of Wildstar. Weirdness.  Everyone gets drunk for no reason.  The music...you have got to be kidding me  Long scenes of a character staring into space for some unknown reason.  The spaceship only has 12 people on it apparently. I would have been an extra...for free!  The ending...I won't spoil that for you. It's a major disappointment.  Don't pick up random ships and let them inside of yours...it could be a trap. Or a bomb. There is no reason it had to be this lame. I'm still glad I went to see it as it was my first Japanese movie in a Japanese theater. The experience was good but the film was lacking. My recommendation is to wait for it on DVDNetflix unless you want to donate money to the film in hopes they make a worthy sequel.".

Many years later I found out that Star Blazers was the North American bastardization of Space Battleship Yamato one of the most acclaimed animes in Japan as well as in the rest of the world whose story combined drama romance and science fiction into an excellent scifi premise which was also adorned by an extraordinary production design. So with nebulous memories of the spaceships and the setting I started watching the film adaptation of Space Battleship Yamato made in live action and I ended up liking it pretty much.The film Space Battleship Yamato fulfilled with my geek necessity of witnessing dynamic combats in zero gravity fast spaceships with an elegant design and space exploration. In the narrative aspect Shimako Sato's screenplay doesn't only make a tribute to the original anime but also to many famous scifi works from Independence Day to the Star Trek franchise without forgetting about Star Wars.Space Battleship Yamato also employs clichs which belong to a long tradition of war and naval films you know what I'm talking about...the inspiring speech before the final battle the noble and stoic captain willing to take the most difficult decisions the talkative comic relief etc.. In fact the Yamato spacecraft is a reference and tribute not only in name but also in design to the Japanese battleship which played an important role in the naval theatre of the Pacific Ocean during World War II including the crucial Midway battle. So the fact that Space Battleship Yamato sticks to the same practices of military cinema from 20th century is quite natural. That formulas may provoke the drama to feel occasionally obvious and over the top but on the other hand they complement the solid screenplay pretty well.So it might not be a great film but I enjoyed Space Battleship Yamato pretty much and I recommend it as a very entertaining film with a good screenplay competent performances and excellent special effects.".

There WAS some stopmotion footage thrown in probably it's for old time's sake.Still this is a better more memorable movie than Selick's last one and certainly not nearly as bad as the miserable boxoffice returns and scathing reviews would lead you to believe.

It's more of a visual hodgepodge than Selick's previous two worlds the first of which owes its look largely to Tim Burton partly because it was realised through an illchosen mixture of costume CGI stopmotion and set design ... our eyes must constantly adjust yet the overall look is strong enough to make it worth the effort.As for the film's flaws well they've been greatly exaggerated.  I suppose there were as several American critics complained some bodilyfunctionbased jokes but I can't recall that many  certainly not as many or as witless as in Shrek and besides at least some of the jokes in Monkeybone are actually funny.  That's because they're characterbased and not solely reliant on the alleged shock value of someone suddenly farting or burping.All that's really wrong with Monkeybone is that it lacks the brilliance a premise this bizarre demands.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how but somehow Henry Selick got his hands on millions of dollars to make a movie that's going to appeal to only a small handful of odd movie goers. Monkeybone is a visually delightful darkly humorous and totally refreshing fantasy flick full of great special effects likable characters and a style that mixes everything from Brazil and Cool World to Hellraiser and Eraserhead. It reminded me of  Dark City Freaked Forbidden Zone and the work of Sid and Marty Krofft but at the same time completely fresh and original.Monkeybone does suffer from some flaws but they seem like the manipulations of some behindthescenes tinkering to make the movie more normal. The most visible scars occur when our hero Stu  Miley Brendan Fraser who is quickly becoming a great comedic actor first arrives in Monkeybone's nightmare land. These early scenes in the fantasy world seem rushed and poorly plotted. I hope there's a special edition DVD or something to see more stuff. But the stuff that was left in is great. I couldn't believe what I was seeing sometimes Stu's black and white surgery nightmare was one of the creepiest things I've seen on the big screen and Bob Odenkirk appears as a organhungry doctor in scenes that seem to be taken right out of his HBO series Mr. Show. Chris Kattan is outstanding providing some hilarious ReAnimatorstyle hijinx as Organ Doner Stu Dave Foley is also funny as Stu's manager and Whoopie Goldberg is really good as Death whose head explodes when she gets mad.But the real stars here are the fantasy characters who inhabit the nightmare town. Like in The Nightmare Before Christmas the background characters are just as coollooking and diverse as the leads. It's a shame that more time isn't spent dwelling in this world or in Death's land and that most of the movie takes place in the real world.Anyway see this movie while you can it'll probably be out of theaters by the time I finish writing thi too late.".

The ornery Monkeybone represents all of Stu's repressed feelings you see. This is not uncommon among cartoonists or comicbook artists or for that matter any artist the product on the page is often the result of the demons within the artist's tortured soul. Anyway Stu has a lovely girlfriend named Julie Bridget Fonda who just happens to be a doctor. Monkeybone's about to hit big and Stu's friendagent David Foley is trying his damnedest to merchandise the hell out of the uncontrollable penis with legs. There's a notsosubtle symbolism at work here of course Stu represses his emotions including all sexual feelings and releases them only in the form of Monkeybone on the page. The day that deals for the commercialization of Monkeybone reluctantly by Stu of course are made tragedy strikes. A freak car accident leaves Stu in a coma although somehow his girlfriend escapes unharmed. So there he is lying in a hospital bed. Trust me folks there's comedy afoot here. We're only now getting to it. While clinically dead Stu finds himself in Hell. Everyone down there knows him because he's suffered through nightmares for many many years and they've served to inspire him in his artistry too. In 1991 there was a movie called Cool World that covered some of the same ground. In that film cartoonist Gabriel Byrne ran into all of his old creations  in this one Stu finds that the denizens down there have been audience to his nightmares since they began and they've been counting on him to churn out more. Keeps 'em alive apparently. Oh but just to complicate things Julie the doc has found out what causes nightmares. Actually I guess that actually makes things nice and simple not more complex. What's worse down in Hell actually an offshoot of Hell called Downtown Monkeybone is quite the center of attention and even has a standup act that humiliates the reserved and introverted Stu.   The movie really consists of two main parts Stu down in Hell although not quite dead yet in real life trying to find a way back up and Stu back on terra firma trying to Save The Day. What connects the two parts is that the nefarious Monkeybone who's ostensibly been helping Stu to get an exit pass has actually schemed to return to the land of the living himself  in Stu's body. So that's where the hijinks really begin at least that was the plan. Once Monkeybone gets back up there things seem to fall into a familiar plotline which is a shame. There are many scenes down in the underworld that are positively funny including Whoopi Goldberg as the Lord of the Dead. Oh and some good bits with Grim Reaper recruits. And the sets! VERY good fascinating stuff. If you're a fan of scenes how things look  set design set decoration the whole bit  then this movie has oodles of eye candy. It's very well designed. And here's a bit of praise for someone I thought I'd never give it to Chris Kattan. See after Monkeybone returns to Earth in Stu's body Stu has to find a way back up there himself. He's sent back in the body of a gymnast who was just killed in a car wreck broken neck. The scenes of Stu waking up on the dissection table then being pursued by a mob of angry pathology doctors anxious to get his organs which of course were supposed to be donated are priceless as is the bit of how Stu quickly copes with his brokenneck problem. There's a lot to look at here and although the characters themselves are rather cardboard and Fraser himself while amiable might be a little miscast I think this was an overlooked movie. It has everything Cool World had back in 1991 except it also has pardon the pun a soul. This one made you like Stu and root for him which is of course essential to any silly comedy. This one's just a silly comedy with some bite to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "MONKEYBONE  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchMonkeybone takes us on an energetic and lively rollercoaster ride through the bizarre mind of a troubled cartoonist trapped inside a nightmare of his vary own imagination. The film is somewhat bad in its storytelling ability but the filmmaking and creative juices save this otherwise preposterous picture. Henry Selick the genius behind similar movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach once again uses a variety of eyepopping indulgent gimmickry to provide a delight for the senses. Model puppets elaborate set designs computer animation stopaction photography claymation convincing and complex makeup far out costumes and even some nifty voice effects preside the entertainment of Monkey Bone. Selick creates a world so full of energy and inventive characters that it justifies the movie's existence. Brendan Fraser makes another fool of himself as Stu Miley a modest cartoonist who finally achieves success and does not know what to do with it. His long time girlfriend Julie Bridget Fonda comforts loves him and is ecstatic when Stu's cartoon primate creation Monkeybone a wisecracking and obscene libido portraiture becomes a national television show. His manager wants to market the franchise big time but Stu wants his simple life to stay simple with one major change he wants to marry Julie.Before he has a chance to propose a car accident leaves Stu in a coma and his spirit plunged into a weird subconscious world called Downtown a waiting place while a person is between life and death. The carnivallike realm inhabits a variety of unusual characters like Kitty Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker an attractive waitress dressed in a feline furnish Hypnos Giancarlo Esposito the halfman halfgoat ruler of Downtown Death Whoopi Goldberg the cynical head honcho who determines the visitor's fate and even the concoction of his own  imaginationthe aggravating nuisance himself Monkeybone voiced by John Turturro. Back on planet earth Julie struggles to keep Stu's fanatic sister Megan Mullally from pulling his plug. Stu conceives a plan to escape Downtown by stealing an exit pass from none other than Death herself. He tries gets the pass but Monkeybone betrays his crafty creator and takes it for himself. Now inhabiting the body of Stu Monkeybone is free to wreak havoc on Stu's lifestyle. While Stu himself possesses the body of a dead gymnast Chris Kattan from House on Haunted Hill to save what is left of his relationship with Julie. The scenes depicting Stu's nightmare reality are absolutely extraordinary. The artful sets special effects costumes animation and makeup are some of the most intricate and tasty examples of effective eyecandy.  It's like we've entered an imaginative dreamscape of zany and entertaining characters. Everyone involved feels alive and inexhaustible especially Brendan Fraser in a very effective performance. Monkeybone himself is quite annoyingbut in a fun kind of way. The involving and fresh atmosphere make this world a memorable movie experience. There are several hilarious sequences one involving a dog's nightmare where several of his feline nemeses secure him and prepare to detach his manhood and another when a walking organ donor loses his guts during a fight sequence. By now you are probably realizing despite the cartoon qualities this movie is not intended for small children. Monkeybone contains all sorts of sexual innuendoes horrific concepts and suggestive situations. During the screening I attended a woman instructed her three young children to leave the theater. However the movie is clearly too goofy and comical for serious mature audiencesso what is the target audience? Monkeybone provides enough positives to outweigh the negatives. The production is worth a watch to experience some of the dazzling imagesbut I would not see it again for free.".

Henry Selick the genius behind similar movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach once again uses a variety of eyepopping indulgent gimmickry to provide a delight for the senses. Model puppets elaborate set designs computer animation stopaction photography claymation convincing and complex makeup far out costumes and even some nifty voice effects preside the entertainment of Monkey Bone. Selick creates a world so full of energy and inventive characters that it justifies the movie's existence. Brendan Fraser makes another fool of himself as Stu Miley a modest cartoonist who finally achieves success and does not know what to do with it. His long time girlfriend Julie Bridget Fonda comforts loves him and is ecstatic when Stu's cartoon primate creation Monkeybone a wisecracking and obscene libido portraiture becomes a national television show. His manager wants to market the franchise big time but Stu wants his simple life to stay simple with one major change he wants to marry Julie.Before he has a chance to propose a car accident leaves Stu in a coma and his spirit plunged into a weird subconscious world called Downtown a waiting place while a person is between life and death. The carnivallike realm inhabits a variety of unusual characters like Kitty Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker an attractive waitress dressed in a feline furnish Hypnos Giancarlo Esposito the halfman halfgoat ruler of Downtown Death Whoopi Goldberg the cynical head honcho who determines the visitor's fate and even the concoction of his own  imaginationthe aggravating nuisance himself Monkeybone voiced by John Turturro. Back on planet earth Julie struggles to keep Stu's fanatic sister Megan Mullally from pulling his plug. Stu conceives a plan to escape Downtown by stealing an exit pass from none other than Death herself. He tries gets the pass but Monkeybone betrays his crafty creator and takes it for himself. Now inhabiting the body of Stu Monkeybone is free to wreak havoc on Stu's lifestyle. While Stu himself possesses the body of a dead gymnast Chris Kattan from House on Haunted Hill to save what is left of his relationship with Julie. The scenes depicting Stu's nightmare reality are absolutely extraordinary. The artful sets special effects costumes animation and makeup are some of the most intricate and tasty examples of effective eyecandy.  It's like we've entered an imaginative dreamscape of zany and entertaining characters. Everyone involved feels alive and inexhaustible especially Brendan Fraser in a very effective performance. Monkeybone himself is quite annoyingbut in a fun kind of way. The involving and fresh atmosphere make this world a memorable movie experience. There are several hilarious sequences one involving a dog's nightmare where several of his feline nemeses secure him and prepare to detach his manhood and another when a walking organ donor loses his guts during a fight sequence. By now you are probably realizing despite the cartoon qualities this movie is not intended for small children. Monkeybone contains all sorts of sexual innuendoes horrific concepts and suggestive situations. During the screening I attended a woman instructed her three young children to leave the theater. However the movie is clearly too goofy and comical for serious mature audiencesso what is the target audience? Monkeybone provides enough positives to outweigh the negatives. The production is worth a watch to experience some of the dazzling imagesbut I would not see it again for free.";

It's a kind of createasyougo market and it's hard to go wrong especially with the special effects and technology available today.  Mixing fantasy and comedy however is a whole different thing and even in the abstract it is bound to wind up in a very subjective arena and to be successful it must be created and presented with great care vision and an innate sense of what works by the filmmaker.  Monkeybone' directed by Henry Selick and written by Sam Hamm is well none of those things which is unfortunate for everyone involved with the project but mostly for the unsuspecting audience upon which it is sprung.The movie begins with a short Monkeybone' cartoon a pilot created from a popular comic strip written by Stu Miley Brendan Fraser which has just been picked up by Comedy Central and contracted for a number of episodes. The cartoon depicts the origins of Monkeybone himself and the appeal is purely infantile and that's being kind.  After the premiere of this animated masterpiece Stu attends the promo party with his girlfriend Dr. Julie McElroy Bridget Fonda who is indirectly responsible for the existence of Monkeybone in the first place.  Stu had suffered from a sleep disorder due to nightmares since he could remember and it was Dr. Julie who turned his life around treating him at the sleep clinic into which he checked himself when he finally couldn't take it anymore.  At that point in his life Stu's cartoons ranged from the gruesome to the downright disturbed all extensions of his nightmares then Julie suggested drawing with his left hand instead of his right and the result was the emergence of Monkeybone who apparently is supposed to be the flip side of his nightmares.  Which may be true for Stu but not necessarily for the audience.Monkeybone himself with voice provided by John Turturro sounding like he's been inhaling helium is far from being funny cute or endearing in any way shape or form an annoying little spud who grates on the senses from the moment he appears on screen which beyond the opening cartoon begins with Stu's descent into Down Town' the land of nightmares residing within his own mind into which he slips when a freak accident puts him in a coma. It's a freakish place a kind of demented Toon Town' populated by besides the everpresent and irritating Monkeybone such illustrious  nightmare mongers as Edgar Allan Poe Jack the Ripper Lizzy Borden Attila the Hun and Stephen King yes the real King in a cameo appearance.  The crux of Stu's problem is that he has to get his hands on an Exit Pass' in order to defy Death Whoopi Goldberg and make his escape back into the land of the living.  Brendan Fraser has to be given credit for not being afraid to take on challenging some would say questionable roles from the comic antics of George of the Jungle' to the comedydrama of With Honors' to the actionpacked Mummy' films that have been so successful.  Overall he's made a career out of taking chances and ferreting out parts that have quite effectively showcased his versatility and talent as an actor.  And it's easy to understand why this vehicle would've appealed to him.  On paper at least it probably looked like it would work and Stu as written probably seemed like a character that would give him another opportunity to spread his wings and show some range.  Unfortunately it's a long long journey from script to screen as they say.  And even an Oscar worthy performance in this case and it wasn't couldn't have saved the day.  The best that can be said is that Fraser did as well as anyone could have with the material he was given.As for Bridget Fonda one has to ask how an actor of her caliber gets caught up in such a thankless generic role as this which served the story as little more than fancy window dressing.  Fonda is simply too good and too deserving of better than to wind up in a part as forgettable as this.  But then again it may have looked good on paper.  We'll call it that.The supporting cast includes Chris Kattan Organ Donor Stu Giancarlo Esposito Hypnos Rose McGowan Kitty Dave Foley Herb Megan Mullally Kimmy and Lisa Zane Medusa.  Sometimes it's fun to just relax and watch a movie that doesn't require much effort or thought and just lets you roll with the flow but Monkeybone' isn't one of them.  This is the one that never should have made it past the first draft of the screenplay and Fraser and Fonda should invest in some whiteout to try and expunge this from their respective filmographies.  There's magic in the movies but not when the wires are exposed and you can see the trap door in the stage.  So file this one under Sorry but try again' and we can all move on to bigger better and happier times.  I rate this one 110.".

The only funny cast member is the guy playing Stephen King he got a laugh out of me. Yes that's only one laugh out of the whole film! Now the story is stupid and cheesy.

Monkeybone on the otherhand remains one of only a handful of movies that has left me simultaneously awestruck and angry stupefied and seething. A cringe and groan inducing mess that is certainly my official pick for worst movie ever made.Brendan Fraser stars as a successful cartoonist who falls into a coma after an accident the details of which are too stupid to mention and ends up in a parallel universe inside his mind where he meets his creation Monkeybone voiced by John Turturro. Monkeybone a lascivious little monkey with a penchant for chaos takes over his body and wreaks havoc on his relationship with his girlfriendpsychiatrist. Fraser still in his own head we think makes a plea to Death played by Whoopi Goldberg and is loaned a body to win back his girl before Monkeybone gets his dirty ape hands on her.Costars Bridget Fonda Megan Mullally Dave Foley Rose McGowan and Chris Kattan roundup an unremarkable list of talent that were hired to stand behind stopmotion models and in front of rejected Beetlejuice sets. The dark atmosphere of the movie struggles to integrate its scatological humor most of which is provided by an obnoxious cartoon monkey. Its obvious the film was edited into oblivion in postproduction which would account for the lion's share of the plot holes but my question is to what end? Sure it made the movie shorter thank god! but the plot still took two acts to actually get moving. Once it did it sprightly rushed into the last 15 minutes like a morbid Tom and Jerry cartoon.What was the prime demographic for this movie? I think the David Lynch crowd is a bit beyond poop jokes at this point and its far too dark for children. Arguably the saddest thing about this film however is the lost potential in director Henry Selick whose previous work includes Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. While Selick has since redeemed himself with 2009's Coraline Monkeybone presents the director at his nadir.Monkeybone truly bats and misses on all points. Its An ugly looking hatchback with no engine a busy yet boring quagmire. At its very best its a slapdashed movie that is literally all dressed up with no where to go. It showcases bad direction bad acting bad editing bad cinematography bad script bad story. I honestly would be ashamed to be this film's boom mic operator which is visible in one scene. The failure of this film is actually quite spectacular when you think about it. Watch it if you're masochistic otherwise stay far away from Monkeybone!httptheyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Life couldn't be better for cartoonist Stu Miley Brendan Fraser. He has created a hit comic strip featuring Monkeybone a petulant rascal with a penchant for wise cracks and racy antics. Stu happy and in love with his beautiful girlfriend Julie Bridget Fonda is on the verge of big success as his comic strip is about to become a national television show. But on the night Stu is to propose to Julie he is struck down in a freak accident. While Stu's body lies comatose  and Julie maintains a constant bedside vigil  his conscious spirit is transported to Downtown a purgatorylike limbo existing between life and death. Downtown has a carnival landscape populated by mythical gods and creatures who revel in the nightmares of the living. Upon his arrival Stu learns his ominous fate There's no turning back. And just as things seem like they couldn't get any worse Stu's alter ego Monkeybone springs to life to stir up some trouble. Now Stu must outwit Death Whoopi Goldberg in order to return to the world of the living before the doctors pull the plug on Stu's body. But Monkeybone has hatched his own plot that could thwart Stu's plans...Monkeybone is a very strange bizarre film. As a comedy it only works to a certain extentthere are a couple of laughs but that's it really. However as an effectladen film it works beautifully. The special effects are amazingThe surreal images the stopmotion animation the various creatures featured in downtownand the production design are all simply incredible creative different.... The film is mostly a showcase for these effects and they definitely made it a more enjoyable experience. Director Henry Selick has several other bizarre flick on him resume as well including the excellent Nightmare before Christmas and james and the giant peach. Selick clearly doesn't make people flicksthis is especially obvious by the awkwardness of the scenes featuring actors and large amounts of dialouge. Both Nightmare and Giant peach shows that given a screenplay that requires lots of effects and creativity he can work wonders. With a film that tries to be funny though.....610.".

Because he really couldn't come up as to why they were deleted.  We can't say he was short on cash either.  The scene's were shot.  And what up with the censored blurs on the deleted scene's?  He doesn't explain that either. If this movie had come out in it's entirety I'd give it a 7.   But as it stands with those scene's taken out.  It's at a measly 410.

But after the great success that also this movie had in Denmark Erik Balling and Henning Bahs sat down behind their typewriters again to make another film.In my eyes movie no. 6 is the first Olsenbanden movie that is really perfect. Now they have every details that the later films made good  Bjorn WattBolsen as the big businessman with criminal background or Ove Verner Hansen as Boffen.In the movie Egon has to steal the famous Bedford Diamonds out of a safe in Switzerland for HolmHansen Jr. But he is cheated and now he and his gang try to get the diamonds which HolmHansen wants to sell to an Arabian prince for themselves...As I said the best Olsenbanden film until that day. It had been very sad if it had stayed the last one. But fortunately Balling and Bahs made their best movie ever in the year after Olsenbanden pa sporet. But I think also Olsenbandens sidste bedrifter belongs to the Top 3 Olsenbanden movies.".

	schema:headline " More great trademarks added in another unforgettable entry";
	schema:reviewBody "The previous film in the series was incredibly entertaining and sophisticated... those are some big shoes to fill even for the same writers and main cast. Fortunately they not only wore them they made wearing them look good. More of the trademarks are added probably the very last of them... ironically this was originally supposed to be the last in the series. Fortunately it was such a huge success that more were produced. We finally get Ove Verner Hansen as Bffen the part he was born to play... a Mafiaesquire hitman who takes great pleasure in his work. Coupled with Bjrn WattBoolsen as the thoroughly capitalistic and only somewhat criminal businessman we have the recipe for a delightful piece of Danish comedy with the Gang. With immense amounts of tiny clever details this is sure to keep you laughing. The plot is very wellwritten and takes our leads down a new paththough basically towards the same destination with another variation on the opening scene in front of Vridslselille state penitentiary. The pacing is flawless. I wasn't bored for one moment even knowing most of what was coming. In addition to the aforementioned two recurring characters Ole Ernst finally takes over as the younger police official portraying a cowboyish eager young detective. He compliments Axel Strbye's dry experienced fedup and realisticpessimistic investigator perfectly. This and the next one are the only two that start in the Gang's dream destination... Mallorca. The humor is satirical and has that wonderful touch of humanity making for pure hilarity. With fewer coincidences and easy ways out of situations than in the previous films this is among the best of the series. Taking the audience along both to Zurich Germany and the Danish stock exchange and featuring the memorable shot of the balloons being released this also has some of the most goodlooking shots of the films. I recommend this to any fan of the series or any fan of Danish comedy in general but I definitely recommend having seen the others before this. 810".
