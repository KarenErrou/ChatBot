I got Sticky Fingers!The title song says it all. Sticky Fingers is one of the most hilarious films ever made and done so with such a style and even a type of elegance that has kept it fresh and funny for every viewing. Two roommates and best friends Lolly and Hattie are struggling musicians who can't pull in the attention of anyone past the civilians in Central Park New York. One day out of the blue Diane Hatties dope dealer leaves them with a mysterious bag with important contents inside. It is yes almost 1 million dollars. Eventually everything is crazy and all mixed up. These two women who are honest decent people in the Big Apple are transformed by the green power slips into petty lightheaded money grubbers. Soon the cash begins to run on and the two have a lot of explaining to give Diane...and the mob men who have been watching their every move...Helen Slater is the not so bright Hattie. She surely gives a new name to the word 'energy' in this one. With her quick and witty dialog and sharp timing she is amazing and always turning on the laughmachine. Melanie Mayron is the squeaky nervous Lolly. Mayron is up to par with costar Slater giving off the same amount of energy and confusion. Needless to say Christopher Guest is as usual a treat to watch as the love interest of Mayron. Other cast members include Loretta Divine Eileen Brennan Carol Kane and an absolutely outrageous Danitra Vance who steals the show with her every scene.The comedy used in this gem is a bright blend of slapstick and witty stand up with honesty as a key factor bringing in solid goods. It is a shame that this one was never received as well as others in that time. The film is well representative of it's time1988 and it's popculture wackiness. I suppose it was the different factor that says just why the film was little known if at all. This film does have a different tone and even more so it is very general. Sometimes the smaller more overlooked things are funny. Sexual lingo and politics are restricted very restricted. This film is not Majoy League or a National Lampoon film or even like any of the Porkey's movies either. It stands out completely on it's own with ultimate originality and sharp comic texture and context which make it a real riot to watch over and over again!".

Soon the greed wealth and power becomes too much for them and all hell breaks loose! Intriguing and very well made. So much more than a movie when one looks at it the right way. A Social commentary of feminism on one level showing us that woman are just as much to blame for money levels in the U.S.  also showing that woman are as much in control. A Commentary on being true to yourself on another level These two characters are lost in the money that they forget what they love most in their lives and the money becomes all to them. Over all this is a commentary on the greed that money sometimes CAN BE the root of all evil. Fun and wacky comedy has the best actors in the world doing their best to pull of a good script. Helen Slater shines the highest as the main character who can't stand up for herself Hattie and Melanie Mayron does just as good as the troubled Lolly.  Eileen Brennan and Carol Kane are the sisters in which own the apartment complex that Slater and Mayron live and they are a hoot!

Carol Kane gives us a great subplot and earns her money something name actors don't always manage to do in recent movies.Check it out next time you have an hour and a half free and nothing better to do. You'll laugh I almost guarantee it. OK so maybe if you aren't into intellectual humor this won't be your thing but everyone else will laugh.

Opportunity of course finds them and so the consequential events occur for a reasons however when one of their dope dealing friends suddenly asks them to babysit a bag of cash while she's out of the country for a few weeks. At first the young women see this as a moment of unwanted emergency until they figure out how to turn the situation into their opportunity though going overboard.Any smart person would know that the last thing you should be doing is getting greedy with dirty money. And these girls can hardly control their amusement after a while which lands them in big trouble with the friend a mysterious man who keeps following them friends who don't want to get involved and the problem of trying to recuperate the money unsuccessfully numerous times.The movie has its moments especially towards the end when it seems like one calamity after another happens. The subplots involving the two young women's relationship follies tend to drag the story down as do a few other unnecessarily slowmoving plot points. But overall once the story gets off the ground a good assortment of quirky characters fueled by a good cast make it welldeserving of an audience. Fans particularly of the cast or obscure 80s bmovies should have fun with it mostly female audiences.If you like this check out the 1982 indie comedy Blue Money which stars Tim Curry as an impoverished aspiring actor who suddenly finds opportunity when his frequent client he works parttime as a cab driver leaves a suitcase full of cash in his car. Lacks the new wave 80s style of Sticky Fingers but they are similar plots.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan or of one of the two leads there's nothing about this film to recommend.The story as others have said is dull almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy. I watched it to about an hour hoping it would turn a corner a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no... It's not unwatchable it's just dull. It goes by. It goes by with bits of running around madly lingering shots of feet at strange angles bits of shouting madly but I didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun it just came across as forced. Needless to say also there was nothing to laugh at particularly. A bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.Don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female. If anything it's actually cloying... Two female leads fine excellent the drug dealer is female okay their landlord is a landlady alright their friends are female okay the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building oh female... I wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt again a bit forced and cloying.On the plusside if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of Helen Slater she's fun and enjoyable to watch. There's also some screentime for Carol Kane which is great but not enough...Overall 310. If you're a huge fan of the 80s Helen Slater and Carol Kane you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny which hinders it substantially. If you're not a fan of those things you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful haunting and complex film noir";
	schema:reviewBody "Rather than films like Citizen Kane 1941 and The Lady from Shanghai 1947 neither of which am I a big fan of Touch of Evil evidences directorwriterstar Orson Welles' capacity for cinematic genius. The story is engaging suspenseful tight and well paced the cinematography is consistently beautiful inventive and symbolic the setting and overall tone of the film including the performances are captivating yet slightly surreal and otherworldly and there are many interesting subtexts. This all combines to create a complex artwork that will reward however far a viewer wishes to dig into the film.Based on a novel by Whit Masterson Badge of Evil Touch of Evil is a battle between two policemenHank Quinlan Orson Welles and Ramon Miguel Vargas Charlton Heston. Parallel to this is a kind of border battle between the United States represented by Quinlan and Mexico represented by Vargas the film is set in two border towns frequently crossing over.As Touch of Evil opens we see a bomb being placed in the trunk of a car in Mexico. A construction company owner Mr. Linnekar gets in with his girlfriend. Vargas and his new wife Susan Janet Leigh manage to walk along next to the carthey're all crossing the border into the United States. Shortly after crossing the bomb goes off. This brings the gruff Quinlan into the picture. His investigation of the bombing brings him into Mexico for suspects. Meanwhile Vargas and his wife are being threatened by Joe Grandi Akim Tamiroff a Mexican mob boss and his underlings. Both Quinlan and Vargas are well respected in their countries and both are used to getting what they want. But the bombing investigation ends up putting them at loggerheads and Quinlan gradually turns out to have more than a touch of evil.As with many of his films Orson Welles ended up having to battle the studio to realize his artistic vision. Usually as here the battle was unsuccessful for him. Despite his 58page memo detailing various problems with Universal's nondirector supervised reshoots by Harry Keller and reedits because they felt that Welles' final cut could use some improvement the film was released in a form that was not satisfactory to Welles. The fiasco has resulted in various versions of Touch of Evil appearing throughout the years. The 58page memo was thought to have been lost but a copy was discovered relatively recently in Charlton Heston's possession. The film was recut in 1998 based on Welles' memo. So make sure that you watch the 111minute version first released by Universal on DVD in 2000.The opening scene of Touch of Evil is famous and rightfully so. Beginning with the timer being set on the bomb then the bomb being placed in Linnekar's trunk before he gets into the car we follow both the car and the relative ebb and flow of Vargases as they roughly walk alongside the car all in one very long tracking shot that covers a lot of ground and features a lot of unusual angles. Welles stages the scene so that there are all kinds of complex background and foreground elements interacting with the car and our protagonist pedestrians. The suspense built up in this scene is incredibleyou just know that bomb is going to go off but you don't know just when or who it is going to hurt. Compositionally the scene is simply beautiful. The film is worth watching for this opening alone but the whole of Touch of Evil features similar meticulously planned artistry filled with suspense.Welles as an actor tends to have a very peculiar way of speaking that is full of affectations. Sometimes this can be a detriment to the film as it was in The Lady from Shanghai. Here though the oddity works and this despite the fact that like Woody Allen he seems to direct his whole cast to deliver their dialogue as if they were him. As a result Touch of Evil has very peculiar contrapuntal scenes where people frequently talk on top of one another with odd phrasing. It works because of the particular kinds of personality conflicts that Welles set up in the script. These are people who frequently would talk on top of each other and occasionally not pay attention to each other.But that's not the only odd thing about the film. Welles managed to find locations that shot in this highly stylized and cinematographically complex filmnoir manner seem almost otherworldly. Except for a couple expansive desert shots Touch of Evil feels eerily claustrophobic even though most locations aren't exactly enclosed. The various modes and settings are all perfect for their dramatic material which is mostly dark and moody. One change that Universal made was the excision of a lot of comic relief material featuring the Grandi family. Universal was right to cut it and wisely Welles agreed.The music in the film is also extremely effective but unusual. Most of it is incidental. Latin and rock 'n' roll emanates from radios for example and the climax intermittently has a repeating contextually haunting theme from a pianola.But of course the story is just as important. Although Welles stated hyperbolically at various points that he was trying to infuriate the audience with a somewhat inscrutable plot and it's true that the plot isn't exactly given in a straightforward manner once you figure out the gist it's relatively simple but extremely captivating. At the same time it is full of symbolism and subtexts including commentary on justice systems and perhaps some irony about the popular conceptions of the U.S. versus Mexico made more complex by the fact that Quinlan spends just as much time south of the border and Vargas seems to spend a lot of time north. But as for being annoyed you're more likely to become infuriated with Quinlan who becomes more and more deliciously despicable as the film unfolds.".

	schema:headline " Another touch of brilliance from Welles";
	schema:reviewBody "Considered by many to be the last classic noir film ever made and perhaps the last masterwork from child prodigy Orson Welles who looks about sixty in this film despite his 42 years. In TOUCH OF EVIL the noirish dark streets and shadows are darker than ever practically swallowing up the soft tones like a murky swamp. The action takes place in a nondescript U.S.Mexico border town where the worst that both sides has to offer is most in evidence. The famous opening scene a 3 12minute continuous shot where we witness a time bomb being placed in the trunk of a Cadillac is masterful. The camera pulls in and out of the city scene as it follows the motion of the vehicle winding its way through streets littered with pedestrians thus effectively creating a level of anxiety that could not be duplicated with multiple edits. After the inevitable explosion the drama dives into a seedy world of corrupt police justice and malevolent decrepitude which is filmed with such a stylish flair it is almost weirdly humorous and playful! Mike Vargas the good guy is played by Charlton Heston and seems more than a wee bit miscast as a Mexican narcotics officer with his face darkened by makeup. When U.S. Police Captain Hank Quinlan Orson Welles first meets him he remarks He doesn't look Mexican. Quinlan is the ultimate repugnant cop gone bad and Welles has the camera looking up into his nostrils most of the time making his character look even more monstrous. But Quinlan is also pitifully sad. A man who once had the instincts of a cat and the intelligence of a fox has been reduced to an insignificant mass of tissue who's instinct is having a knack for finding evidence that he himself has planted. And while he may be revered by the local officials in law enforcement he's acutely aware that he is a fraud and petrified that Vargas has seen him naked.".

His powerful vision drives the film from the singlecut opening sequence to the catandmouse finale.I suggest watching the 1998 restored version over the original theatrical release but regardless of which version Touch of Evil will have you stuck in your seat questioning your views of morality until long after the last credit has rolled up the screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seldom have I seen so many comments with so little understanding. The movie is not about Heston's Mexicanness or lack of it. The movie is not about the 5 or 8 or 10 minute opening shot. The movie is not even god help us about Welles' descent from the heights into slumming it in a Grade B flick.The movie is about two things  filmmaking and character. Every shot worth remembering and there are few that aren't is an exercise in the possibilities of film particularly black and white film. Woody Allen makes movies in black and white that are  all conversation. Welles made movies in black and white because that's where the colors of the characters the location and ultimately the meaning of the movie are possible. Black and white film is about the infinite possibilities of shadow. Touch of Evil is about the infinite possibilities of human nature.Heston for those of you who just can't see past a bad accent is about rigidity and shortsightedness. What kind of idiot would leave his wife in all those threatening situations? The kind of idiot who can't imagine that anyone would harm HIS wife simply because she IS his wife! Akim Tamiroff's Grandi is about flexibility to the point of breakage. Always playing ALL ends against the middle he is the essence of harmless corruption that ultimately harms everyone.And Welles' Hank Quinlan ... I just don't have the time or space to explain that Quinlan is about the true cost of police work when the humanity has gone out of it. Ultimately Quinlan would kill his best and only friend the only one as Dietrich has it who really loves him. At one time perhaps Quinlan WAS the image that Pete  Menzies saw. But the man behind that image was eaten up long ago with alcohol and frustrated grief. It's all about winning and losing now and things he would never do. Until he does them.There are so many other moments and characters that I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the film with your eyes and your mind open instead of shut to get it. Pay attention to what's on the screen instead of the smart cynical hip comments you can make about an actual work of heart.Well what the hell. Joan Didion said it best. Film criticism is petit point on kleenex.Raoul Duke".

Here is the perfect example of why Orson Welles should be considered a genius. He has made this film look so effortlessly easy that it could almost be considered film making by numbers. From the famous opening sequence to the closing titles this is the film students' reference book. Welles portrayal of the bloated cop Hank Quinlan is only bettered by his Harry Lime in 'The Third Man'. He gets right inside the seedy corrupt Quinlan but still leaves room for just the lightest touch sympathy because we know that after all he's a fallible human like all of us. We almost feel sad at his fate especially when Marlene Dietrich gives her sad soliliquay about him.This is another film that can only exist in black and white and begs the question why can't directors work effectively in this medium today? Some have tried but none have have really suceeded. David Lynch's Eraserhead is probably the best modern example of a black and white only film. Woody Allen's Manhattan tries hard but ends up looking too much like a documentary. I don't think that directors today use this medium enough too many rely on colour and the efffects that can only work in colour to get them out of trouble. So put A Touch Of Evil on your 'must see' list and enjoy a work of film making artistry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Orson Welles' Touch of Evil is a complex ironic examination of the relationship between the law and justice... The film must stand beside the very best in detectives genre...Its enormous confused tracking shots its low angles its tormented lighting its obscure intelligent photography its great use of the wideangle lens its hard complexity and complete fictional nightcity word all represent a brilliant essay of pure cinema establishing Welles as an alarming genius one of the greatest filmmakers with movies years ahead of their time...Touch of Evil is an outstanding achievement of a great cinematic mind displaying a powerful range of Gothic expressionism... Welles' first appearance as a corrupt usedup Texas police captain Hank Quinlan is no less surprising...A police car comes to a stop to the scene of a murder and unexpectedly there is Welles sitting in the back seat gross unshaven sweaty and with a cigar clenched between his teeth... He seems a repellent person with intuition manifesting that sensation of evil as no crime movie has managed to do since a suggestion of corruption that is the key to the fascinating and doubtful character he plays... Welles character will cheat lie and murder in order to prevent the truth from emerging... One hates his toughness yet one still understands him and feels pity for him than for his victims...Joseph Calleia his slightly more presentable assistant is like Dana Andrews in Otto Preminger's Where the Sidewalks Ends a villain with unchanged methods he waits watches leaves the police work to others remains loyal to his profession and to his bossbut could not exist without him or in another environment...From that moment we are caught between admiration of his brilliant directorial effects and fascination with his characterization of Quilan a chief able to make a quick arrest by the simple expedient of framing the most likely suspects... He appears to have been using the techniques for years but before this he has usually fitted the frame round the guilty party... It is a performance which frequently gives great energy to the screen...Stanley Kubrick once said that the first shot of a movie should be the most captivating... Definitely Welles' legendary opening shot satisfies one of the key requirements of the movie mystery... Of course Russ Metty deserves a lot of credit...The long traveling shot starts with a closeup of a timebomb being placed in the trunk of a car by a shadowy figure then the richest man in town Rudy Lanniker and his mistress appearing from the background getting into the car and driving away across the border from Mexico to the United States and through the border town... By this time the roving camerathat seems never to come to a standstill has offered to us long view of the surroundings crumbling arches peeling walls poor hotels and night clubs and a lot of trash which will enclose the plot...While the convertible stops at a crossroad the camera descends swiftly to introduce a Mexican gentleman an idealistic justice department lawyer Ramon Vargas Charlton Heston and his bride the blonde American Susan Janet Leigh walking toward the frontier...The superlative camera tracks the couple for some time catching again the car as both Vargas and the automobile meet at the U.S. Customs post... We see and hear a conversation between Vargas his wife and the border guard as the vehicle moves out of the frame... We proceed with the couple about to cross the border until the bomb goes off and the car explodes... The killing is the start of the conflict between policemen from both sides of the border...Touch of Evil is great and memorable for the distinguished description of its scenes its images its acting and its sound track... Its importance lies entirely in how the event is told 'not' in the message or material...In addition to its wonderful opening the film contains other outstanding sequences The deplorable ambiance of a closed nightclub where Marlene Dietrich wisely advises Welles to lay off the candy bars. Honey you're a mess she says when she finally recognizes Quinlan and at the end of the picture when he asks Come on read my future for me she replies You haven't got any. Your future is all used up. Why you don't go home.The single shot in the murder suspect's apartment where Welles handles his cast with great skill... There is much overlapping conversation as everyone talks at once and half a dozen characters are brilliantly delineated...When the camera meets a group of three characters crossing the street across a hotel lobby and into a restricted elevator and rides with them slowly up to the second floor until Vargas who has left them in the lobby reappears at the very moment the elevator door reopens...The horrifying siege of Leigh at the isolated Mirador Motel by a gang of young punks... Perhaps the finest things about Touch of Evil is the cold strange and unsympathetic atmosphere of its night city narcotics gangrape racism prostitution an almost universal corruption...It's unlikely that there will ever be a more unpleasant or offensive or disgusting detective than Welles or a more fascinating one...Watch for Mercedes McCambridge in it... but look quickly or it will be too late.".

His director geniality is seen through the outstanding performances by great actors like himself Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietricht and actors not that great like Charlton Heston. Several lines of this motion picture are amongst the greatest of all times specially the Dietrich ones. The credits scene that runs uncut for about 3 minutes is one of the greatest moments in the film history along with the pianola tune at Tanya's place.

	schema:reviewBody "That's a great epitaph Marlene Dietrich and Mort Mills put together for Orson Welles's character police captain Hank Quinlan. In a sense since Welles directed himself in Touch of Evil he both created the character and the circumstances that bring him down.Two stories intersect in Touch of Evil. The first involves a particularly grisly murder in a TexasMexican border town of a man named Rudy Linnaker. The weapon was a car bomb that went off just as Linnkaer and some chippie he was seeing crossed the border. Driving in the car just behind the late Mr. Linnaker was Charlton Heston as Mexican police detective Mike Vargas and his wife Janet Leigh. Heston is returning to Mexico City where in a few days he's taking the witness stand in the trial of a local drug kingpin. The kingpin's brother is Akim Tamiroff who's the local crime lord in that border town. Heston's case against Tamiroff's brother and Welles's investigation into the car bombing are completely unrelated but do to some cleverly worked out plot machinations they get intertwined together.Charlton Heston has been quoted many times in saying that Orson Welles was the greatest director he ever worked for. He also rather modestly has stated that he did not give Welles his best screen performance. My own thought on it is that he really is not a terribly convincing latino. Maybe someone with Robert Mitchum's gift for dialect or a latino actor like Gilbert Roland might have been better. Still it's an earnest effort and Heston has nothing to be ashamed of.In fact Heston says and I agree that the story is really about Welles and his destruction. Welles has great instinct as a detective but he's not really all that scrupulous about due process. That's what has Heston's back up and it forces Welles into an unthinkable alliance with Tamiroff. Janet Leigh gives us a sneak preview of what was in store for moviegoers in Psycho when she's trapped in that motel room with those punks that Tamiroff has sicced on her. One of the punks in fact was Mercedes McCambridge doing a little gender bending generations before Boys Don't Cry. At the motel Dennis Weaver has a marvelous bit part as the useless and feckless 'night man.'Welles put a lot of his favorites in small roles here. Ray Collins took time away from Perry Mason on television to play the District Attorney. Joseph Cotten has a small bit as a medical examiner Harry Shannon was the state's attorney it was a regular Citizen Kane reunion.Marlene Dietrich who was Welles's foil and partner in his magic act plays the owner of a border town dive and his mistress who loves him though she recognizes all his faults. This was a banner year for Dietrich because she also did her highly acclaimed role in Witness for the Prosecution. One part though that should have been up for an Academy Award was Joseph Calleia who was Welles's devoted subordinate who in the end ironically helps to bring him down. It's a great piece of acting and Charlton Heston said that Joseph Calleia never did anything better in his entire cinema career. I wouldn't argue the point.Now that the 'director's cut' is available we can now see Touch of Evil and realize what Welles's vision was for this film. Indifferently received when first out it's grown to become a classic and probably one of the three or four films Welles the director gets the most acclaim for.And now it's probably better than when first seen by the public.".

The Mexican Chief of Narcotics Miguel Vargas Charlton Heston is spending honeymoon with his American wife Susan Vargas Janet Leigh in the border town and will testify in the case of the drug dealer Grandi that is arrested in Mexico City. The idolized exalcoholic American Police Captain Hank Quinlan Orson Welles is in charge of the investigation since the murder happened in the American side of the border but Mike Vargas participates as observer since the Mexican citizen Sanchez Victor Millan is the prime suspect. Meanwhile Uncle Joe Grandi Akim Tamitoff unsuccessfully presses Susie trying to convince her husband to drop the case. When Hank plants two dynamites in the house of Sanchez in a shoe box that Vargas had seen empty ten minutes before he confronts Hanks. Joe Grandi witnesses their argument and associates to Hank to discredit Vargas dishonoring Susie.Touch of Evil is a masterpiece of malevolence and loss of humanity and one of my favorite movies ever. The long sequence in the beginning is in my opinion the best in cinema history with a perfect timing. The black and white cinematography is amazing with the perfect use of shadows and lighting. The story is fantastic and Orson Welles is awesome in the role of a despicable policeman that believes in his hunches eternally grieves the loss of his wife and wishes to bring justice no matter the means and without any ethic. Janet Leigh performs a strong female character unusual in the 50's. Charlton Heston has also an unforgettable performance in the role of an ethical police office that is the opposite of Hank and prioritizes his work to his family leaving his wife alone to seek the truth about his opponent. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Marca da Maldade The Mark of the Malevolence".

	schema:headline " Worst 4 star movie of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "After sitting through almost 40 minutes of this unwatchable film I just had to turn it off. The acting was poor the screenplay was disjointed and the storyline was illogical. Some examples Charlton Heston is supposed to be a Mexican. They give him a Cisco Kid mustache but his accent is from Iowa. His new bride Janet Leigh and he are on their honeymoon in Tijuana. If you are taking Janet Leigh on a honeymoon there are certainly much better places to take her than a scruffy border town. But catch more of this logic. Heston is a law officer in Mexico who is pursuing a drug gang. Right at the border near where they are walking a bomb blows up a convertible with two people inside. Heston is with his wife. Logic says that he would assume that this is a dangerous place not only for him but his wife. But that does not stop him. He tells her to go by herself back to the fleabag hotel where they have chosen to spend their honeymoon. On the way she is accosted by a bunch of toughs who say that they have a message for her husband. And she follows them! Later on she is undressing in her hotel room which has no shades and someone shines a flashlight on her from a window across the street. After she covers up what does she do? Does she turn the light off in her room? Does she call the management? No she climbs up and unscrews the hot light bulb in her room without a tinge of pain and throws it across the street into the window where the light came from and she hits a bullseye. Try throwing a light bulb once. It's like throwing a pingpong ball. Later Heston can't seem to find another hotel in the town so the takes her to a fleabag motel in the boondocks where she is the only guest. I half expected it to be the Bates Motel. She lounges around the room in a bustier while a gang of toughs in hot cars arrive. She shows absolutely no fear or trepidation at this turn of events. Meanwhile her husband still does not seem concerned over her safety even though the motel is owned by the drug gang chief. At the point I turned it off Heston was holding a meeting with a few American cops and takes them to his hotel room which looked perfectly fine. Why then is she in the boondocks? Note that there are pointless cameos of Marlene Dietrich and Eva Gabor and even Dennis Weaver whose acting consists of looking back and forth nervously behind a set of overly large glasses. For those of you who view this film positively you must have watched a different movie than the one I watched.".

So much so after I finished watching it I felt the desperate urge to see something better so I wouldn't to lose my faith in movies something like Plan 9 From Outer Space or Gigli for ex... I'm not exaggerating. How bad this film is? Well it's so bad even true Mexicans here look phony as if they had been imitating the bad acting of the Americans playing them especially Chuck in one of the worst miscasts in film history. And if you consider that even at best of times he isn't a great actor not even a good one imagine how bad he can be when playing Mexicans. And hisfor the occasionblackened mug doesn't help either he looks like having spent the last 24 hours sweeping chimneys not to mention his phony accent in both languages. When speaking Spanish or English he sounds like an American badly impersonating a Mexican badly impersonating an American...you get the picture.For starters the plot of the movie is amateurish and full of holes a tenth grader would have done a better job at it. The acting goes from bad to awful and the Mancini scoreintrusive  strident at timesis more a nuisance and a mood killer rather than a mood maker especially during some crucial scenes as it distracts you from ongoing events not that such events are much worth seeing. The only good thing about TOE is the cinematography which may be useful for film students. The long shot from a craning camera at the beginning is worth mentioning as the series of shots from different angles during the final shootout. Apart from that there's little of value here.Here's a stupid plot I said unfolding in an idiotic fashion carried on by dumb characters. I only needed 10 min. to come to that conclusion and I don't need to abound on that as already many reviewers have delved on it I'll just state that by that time Vargas  wife have proved to be the dumbest romantic couple ever walking on Earth. Exs. right after a terrorist bombing he sends her away alone in an unknown and hostile land telling her to go back to her hotel only to see her almost run over by truck right therewhich doesn't bothers him the least anyway. But then she proceeds to show she's even dumber than him when following a total stranger to a place she doesn't even known only because the guy is holding a paper in which someone has written that he got something which could interest her husband. Aw what can I lose? She murmurs innocently before marching on at the heels of the strangerYour life dummy! Moments later Wells himself shows up a caricature of the bad guy in some cheap B movie displaying his arched brows his evil stare driving with a hedge hammer the point that he's the real villain in this film. But all that's topped later by the even dumber shouting match between sheVargas and Brandi which brought memories of the original TV Batman seriesonly that in this case we are supposed to take the confrontation seriously. And that brings me to the subject of the characters themselves.They are not even stereotypical they are simple cartoons. Caricatures of caricatures. Speedy Gonzalez is a better developed character than Heston's Vargas even if he's just a mouse. And Leigh doesn't fare much better either her sheVargas here is just a parody of her Psycho's Marion Crane. She may be a great actress but she doesn't have anything to work on there's no meat in her role as the film sorely lacks in tension and conflict simply because the villains here are also caricatures nothing more than pathetic mock ups of the real stuffjust think about the current drug war in that same region which has claimed the lives of almost 30.000 people in the last few years and try to put Brandi and his nephews in that picture. No way. They are simply laughableso much so even Leigh can shout the clan boss down even calling him pig in his face with no unpleasant repercussions. But that's easy for her to do as Brandi looks and acts more like a watered down innocuous version of De Vito's Penguinrather than a mob bossand his nephews like rejects from auditions for some Broadway take on West Side Story. While watching them I couldn't help thinking that here's probably where the creators of the orig. Batman TV series got the inspiration for their villains. See that fight with Vargas in the bar for ex. the only thing missing there was those familiar Bang! Auch! Slam! As for Wells he doesn't even look menacing only fat unkempt even disgusting. I wouldn't come anywhere near that guy before eating and neither after. But the worst of them all is that utterly superfluous fruitcake of night motel managerWhat is his raison d'etre here anyway? In any film with true villains the atmosphere's set in the beginning in images scenes that strike the viewer's imaginationlike a horse head in a bed for ex. or the Spectre minion failing in his mission and then being eaten by sharks. That's cinematographic genius. In TOE instead Wells uses that same technique to destroy the mood of his movie to deconstruct it. That scene in the lot when Brandi slaps his nephew and in response this one gives him a finger indicates that we'll have no villains here just a sad lot of clownish punks. From that moment on you couldn't take the Brandi clan seriously anymore and that killed all possible suspense tension and with that the movie.210 only for the cinematography.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1950's critics and audiences did injustice to some movies.  They dissed the dreamy chilling VERTIGO and spurned THE SEARCHERS for failing to present the usual Simonpure hero.  In one case though I think the '50's generation was right and today's movie fans are wrong.  TOUCH OF EVIL should have remained in the oblivion to which its contemporaries consigned it.The storyline follows Mexican policeman Mike Vargas played by Charlton Heston!!?? and his wife Susan the ravishing Janet Leigh as he investigates a car bombing and she gets threatened a lot by some gangsters against whom her husband is going to testify.  The story ends up dividing into two very tenuously connected plots as Susan is isolated at a motel with an idiotic night man shades of PSYCHO while Mike at first tries to help and then tries to thwart bigoted detective Hank Quinlan Orson Welles.Welles wrote directed and starred in this movie.  Yes I said starred Vargas may be the cleancut hero but everybody's eyes are on Quinlan. Welles makes a great heavy in the literal as well as figurative sense and he is scary as hell.  In the starring department he's great in the directing department he's madly inconsistent and in the writing department he stinks.Now I am sure to be burned at the stake for heresy in questioning Welles' direction in this movie.  Certainly his use of the camera is extremely imaginative as in the stupendously long opening shot he cuts back and forth with superb timing in the suspenseful conclusion he has some neat continuous shots in an apartment and an elevator and he does a truly ghastly murder scene by flashing lights.  But there's more to directing than just camera work.  You have to handle your cast and Welles doesn't. Allowing Heston to be cast as the lead was insane even though Welles owed the directing job to Heston he could have given him the role of Peter Menzies.  And where was Welles when Akim Tamiroff and Dennis Weaver were overacting like the sky was about to fall?  Even if their absurd approaches to their roles were their own idea and not Welles' responsibility Welles should at least have demanded retakes of all their scenes and told them to calm down or else he'd find some better actors.However what really sinks the movie is the sheer absurdity of the script which Welles himself adapted from a cheap novel.  A tiny explosive barely the size of a hand grenade dropped in a trunk blasts a car off the ground like the eruption of Mount Saint Helens.  A woman is then called in to identify the charred burned and dismembered corpses.  Displeased with Vargas' investigation a punk throws dark sticky Movie Acid at him that sticks to a wall and burns through it like a hot knife through warm butter. Then Janet Leigh is driven by a friendly policeman to the Amazing Coincidence Motel which just happens to be owned by the gangsters who've been threatening her.  They don't need to threaten her any more since they have an incriminating photo to blackmail her with but they do it anyway and the photo is never mentioned again.  A dopehead whispers through her wall about the joys of mainlining injecting marijuana.  Then as she shivers and cowers unarmed goons slowly stalk into her apartment and she lets them assault her even though she has a loaded gun in easy reach this despite earlier scenes that established her as a fiery combative woman. In sum TOUCH OF EVIL pays no more attention to detail and character consistency than any directtovideo thriller of the present day.  This is bad in any movie but worst in a mystery thriller where even the most casual audience members are keeping an eye out for the little details that will catch the killers and unmask the frauds later on.If you thought that SNAKE EYES was genius you should love TOUCH OF EVIL. But if you refuse to let slambang camera antics distract you from the absence of characterization poor plotting both depend heavily on deus ex machina devices and uneven acting you'd best avoid both of them.".

It was the restored version according to the announcer. Over the weekend I watched it again hoping that my faith in Orson Wells's talent would be renewed and instead I was shocked to see how bad it really looked today. Totally overdone overstylized overdramatized overacted with a convoluted plot that was unconvincing. In addition the casting of Charlton Heston as a Mexican was totally ludicrous and almost at the level of slapstick. It was just bad all the way...unbelievably bad! Even Orson Welles's performance was excessive cynical downbeat and unreal. I had to struggle to watch the entire two hours as painful as it was.I went back to the book I have The Films of Orson Wells by James Howard and renewed my knowledge of the production. The studio considered the final cut unmarketable and fragmented and took it out of Orson Welles's hands completely. Even though Orson offered to reshoot certain scenes to their specifications he was barred permanently from the lot.Shades of the final results of The Magnificent Ambersons at the RKO studios!.A new director Harry Keller was brought in to reshoot some of the scenes and some cuts were made as well. Most people have probably only seen this version rather than Welles's original version. Which may explain why it has a better reputation than it deserves.A lot of us sentimental fans of Citizen Kane keep hoping against hope apparently that age will redeem some of Orson Wells's other films so that he will not be forever considered as having had beginner's luck with his first film with an assist from a very good screenplay writer Herman J. Mankiewicz brilliant! and interesting subject matters concerning William Randolph Hearst. Alas...it doesn't appear to ever be possible. I'll take a second look at some of his other films but Touch of Evil looks just terrible today...terrible! What a shock! Best regards Steve".

The actors performs as if they were on stage and the audience is 20 yards away. In other words extremely overthetop. Charlten Heston managed to score probably the worst acting job I've seen. The storyline is told almost entirely through dialog  and bad dialog that is. Normally I would labor through an entire film even if bad just to see how the ending turns out. But watching ToE was just too painful. I stopped after about 30 minutes and couldn't care less how the ending turned out. Thank goodness movies aren't made like this anymore. ToE deserves a Rotten Tomato.".

None of this would matter if the movie were any good but it's two intercut holding patterns that have no tension and nothing filmic going for them except maybe composition once that first shot is over.

Idolized alcoholic Police Captain Hank Quinlan Orson Welles and his Sergeant Pete Menzies Joseph Calleia are in charge on the US side and Hank soon has a suspect . But things go wrong when Vargas discovers Quinlan puts fake evidences against the prime suspect . Quinlan joins forces with Grandi Akim Tamiroff  who seeks revenge against Mike  to impugn Vargas's proofs . This overwhelming masterpiece of the strangest vengeance ever planned is plenty of suspense and twisted intrigue from start to finish . Awesome opening  justifiable known  shot in stylistic way begins this overthetop picture . Touch of evil failed in the U.S. but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair  here directorplayer proved that he was still a filmmaking genius . Excellent acting by the great maestro Orson Welles playing the life of yet another ruthless character  he stars a corrupt inspector with a shady past and obscure present  planting evidences to detain suspects . Orson Welles was originally hired only to act in the film  but due to a misunderstanding Charlton Heston thought that Welles was to be the director  to keep Heston happy producer Albert Zugsmith allowed Welles to direct . Support cast is frankly magnificent  such as  Akim Tamiroff  Joseph Calliea  Dennis Weaver  Ray Collins  Joanna Moore  Marlene Dietrich  Zsa Zsa Gabor  among others . Oscar winner Mercedes McCambridge only appears in the film because she was having lunch with Orson Welles during filming and Welles convinced her to film a scene . Attractive and dazzlingly photographed in black and white by Russell Metty . The entire film was shot on real locations apart from the infamous tenminute take in the Mexican shoe store clerk's apartment which is actually a set  Welles and Metty insisted on filming in a real city  settling for Venice California when he couldn't get his initial choice of Tijuana .

Although much of the music used throughout the movie was from sound sources that pertained to the film radio transmissions jukeboxes player piano . And being ulteriorly reconstructed according to Welles'notes in 1988 . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Orson Welles who shot predominantly at night in order to fend off meddlesome studio suits . Welles was a genius who had a large and problematic career . In 1938 he produced The Mercury Theatre on the Air famous for its broadcast version of The War of the Worlds . His first film to be seen by the public was Ciudadano Kane 1941 a commercial failure  but regarded by many as the best film ever made  along with his following movie  The magnificent Ambersons . He subsequently directed Shakespeare adaptation such as Macbeth  Othelo and Chimes at Midnight or Falstaff . Many of his next films were commercial flops and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948 . In 1956 he directed this great masterpiece Touch of evil 1958 but Orson was fired as director during postproduction and the film was recut contrary to his wishes  before his death he left instructions on how he wanted the film to be edited and in 1998 a version was made the way he intended . In 1975 in spite of all his boxoffice flops  he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1984 the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor the D.W. Griffith Award . His reputation as a film maker has climbed steadily ever since.".

And being ulteriorly reconstructed according to Welles'notes in 1988 . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Orson Welles who shot predominantly at night in order to fend off meddlesome studio suits . Welles was a genius who had a large and problematic career . In 1938 he produced The Mercury Theatre on the Air famous for its broadcast version of The War of the Worlds . His first film to be seen by the public was Ciudadano Kane 1941 a commercial failure  but regarded by many as the best film ever made  along with his following movie  The magnificent Ambersons . He subsequently directed Shakespeare adaptation such as Macbeth  Othelo and Chimes at Midnight or Falstaff . Many of his next films were commercial flops and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948 . In 1956 he directed this great masterpiece Touch of evil 1958 but Orson was fired as director during postproduction and the film was recut contrary to his wishes  before his death he left instructions on how he wanted the film to be edited and in 1998 a version was made the way he intended . In 1975 in spite of all his boxoffice flops  he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1984 the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor the D.W. Griffith Award . His reputation as a film maker has climbed steadily ever since.";

None of the other actors rises above the script they have and the night man at the motel gets special kudos for apparently having failed 8th grade drama.The plot here is also nothing special corrupt cops doing bad things vs the good cop doing the right thing.A few semiserious comments Heston looks 100 silly as a Mexican since they use some sort of makeup to make him darkerone suspects in color he'd be orange and his makeup looks so bad becuase none of the other Mexicans gets the same makeup treatment so his contrast is all the more striking.

	schema:reviewBody "I have thought it convenient to see again Touch of Evil before daring to comment this main work in the history of cinema. I don't pretend to be original saying that this movie attains the highest levels of visual beauty and not just in cinema but in the whole art of the 20th century. The lights and shadows the photography the camera motions the backgrounds... it's all too stunning to be described pure work of genius. There is enough matter for a thousand Ph. D's in cinematographic techniques.The part of the story concerned with Quinlan and his evil deeds is quite good. Quinlan is a very interesting character superbly interpreted by Orson Welles. It should be noted that he is by far the nicest character in the movie and it's almost impossible not to root for him perhaps this is a precise artistic choice by the author Orson Welles.Now forgive me for criticizing the heavy improbabilities and flaws we find in the story of Touch of Evil. The whole subplot about Vargas' wife Susan Janet Leigh is just nonsense from the very beginning. The celebrated Mexican policeman Vargas Charlton Heston neglects his spouse in their very wedding day ! to investigate a crime which by no means concerns him and furthermore committed in the USA territory I guess this is an unacceptable impropriety... And then Susan is openly threatened and pursued by his mortal enemies the Grandi's and the cunning Vargas finds nothing better than leaving her alone at a deserted motel owned by the Grandi's!... By the way also Susan looks incredibly stupid...  When finally Vargas remembers that he's a married man runs to the motel in anxiety for his wife and searches her room he neither looks in the bathroom to check if say Susan's corpse is not in the bathtub cut to pieces or something... Really a great job by a firstrate policeman! And the audience even in 1958 could wonder why the Grandi's don't ACTUALLY rape and drug Susan instead of just faking it. I realize that such stuff would have been too hot for the censorship of the 1950s but then it would have been much better to delete the subplot with Susan. In the finale we find further absurdities still regarding Vargas and spouse.I regret to say that these flaws of the plot seriously damage Touch of Evil a great masterpiece from any other point of view.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another one of those grand rediscovered masterpieces that critics invent superlatives to describe while the average film fans cannot figure out what all the hoopla is about. Orson Welles must lead the pack in the most overrated director category. His Citizen Kane is easily the most overvalued production in history  an emotionally glacial epic still gliding on the controversy of its day because it was thinly veiled inspiration of William Randolph Hearst's life. Years later we get Touch of Evil which is obviously meant to be a latter day homage to film noir but lacks the depth or intelligence of any of the best examples of that genre.The film opens with an impressive tracking shot preceding a car explosion. Critics and film students will write entire dissertations about this opening shot and insist that one must view the film for it alone. This conveniently overlooks that literally nothing of worth happens after this and if you have no interest in elaborate tracking shots then the film will hold no value to you. The storyline is an utter mess  a lurid illogical and tedious gradeB crime melodrama which blends themes of drugs corruption gangs and muted sexual sadism in a Mexican border town into an inscrutable mishmash. Welles casts himself as a corrupt cop at the center of the intrigue and spends the majority of the film lumbering around in a semistupor as if moving from point A to B was a feat too much to expect from a man of his girth. If his intent was to convince that evil is banal and boring he has succeeded in spades because that is exactly how his performance comes off. Charlton Heston  never the greatest actor  is even less adequate here than usual criminally miscast as a righteous Mexican lawman caught up in the action and I use that term advisedly while on his honeymoon with his nubile intellectually dim wife Janet Leigh. Heston is apparently Mexican by way of Middle America and the makeup booth. If Welles spends the film lumbering then Heston spends the film pontificating inane dialog while posturing in overthetop displays of piety.Considering the accolades heaped on this film it is incredible that so few of its fans notice its laughable lapses in logic. Heston is supposed to be an intelligent and sympathetic guy yet he spends the entire film repeatedly abandoning his wife in a strange country where violence seems to occur every few moments and barely gives a thought about it. At one point he insists on moving her out of their more populated hotel to one in the backwoods that makes the domicile in Vacancy look like a Hilton. The film is positively schizophrenic about the Leigh character. Some scenes depict her as a tough nononsense lady but then they are followed by scenes where she inexplicably devolves into a cowering victim who illogically keeps placing herself in danger  usually in a state of provocative undress. By the time that threatening bikers and their butch molls crash the hotel it becomes surreal that Leigh is still strutting around in a googleeyed palsy wearing outfits that would make Madonna blush. And let's not even touch on Marlene Dietrich's glorified cameo as an enigmatic fortune teller or a wildeyed Dennis Weaver as the shifty hotel manager. Subplots come and then are abandoned without a thought  characters filter in and out of the film with little to no impact. But let us never forget according to Welles fanatics it is not the story or acting that count it is those great camera shots! After all camera shots make the movie.By the time the film limps to its uninspired underwhelming and thoroughly unsurprising conclusion precious few will give a damn about any of the people on screen. Dietrich's final line of dialog describing the Welles character is hilariously pointless which perfectly sums up the film that we have just watched. As film noir goes one can find infinitely better sources  ones that actually have coherent plots and characters that make some degree of sense. Unless one wants to endlessly tout the technical aspects Touch of Evil only emphasizes Welles weaknesses as a director  much like an early day George Lucas he is obsessed with the technical aspects of his film lighting camera work etc. but has no interest in the story or the people populating his landscape of light and shadow. As a result many of his films  and Touch of Evil is no exception  have a tendency to be empty emotionally joyless exercises geared only to film insiders who want to endlessly pontificate on infinitesimal technical minutiae and laborious camera tricks.".

Whether this actually happened and how much of the film is based on fact I'm not sure. However the Nazi persecution of homosexuals is welldocumented but not often seen on the screen.

This is a splendid film that succeeds largely because of particularly nice interpretations  it deals with a daring breakout from inescapable Scottish concentration camp carried out by Nazi officers incarnated by a good star cast and magnificently realized by Lamont Johnson . It's partially based on facts adapted by William Norton from a bestselling written by Sidney Shelley titled The Bowmanville break . The continuous escapes have caused the British staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the officer prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp called McKenzie  being commanded by a harddrinking Major Perry Ian Hendry who efforts to stifle riots of the wily Nazis . Irish Intelligence captain named Connor Brian Keith  a special troubleshooter  is sent by General Kerr Jack Watson  to Scotland for resolving conflicts in the problematic camp .

This is a splendid film that succeeds largely because of particularly nice interpretations  it deals with a daring breakout from inescapable Scottish concentration camp carried out by Nazi officers incarnated by a good star cast and magnificently realized by Lamont Johnson . It's partially based on facts adapted by William Norton from a bestselling written by Sidney Shelley titled The Bowmanville break . The continuous escapes have caused the British staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the officer prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp called McKenzie  being commanded by a harddrinking Major Perry Ian Hendry who efforts to stifle riots of the wily Nazis . Irish Intelligence captain named Connor Brian Keith  a special troubleshooter  is sent by General Kerr Jack Watson  to Scotland for resolving conflicts in the problematic camp . Connor suspects astute captain Schlueter Helmut Griem of being the mastermind behind the scheme about a mass escape and he is supposed to stop the action .

	schema:headline " An allegory about the death of Empire and a thrilling POW film in its own right.possible spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "'The McKenzie Break' is very much in the tradition of the POW movie that seemingly dominated British screens in the 1950s.  There is the same elaborate tunnelling the same standoff between Brit and Nazi prisoner and commandant an introduction of a theatrical scene to emphasise the idea of roleplaying to deceive one's enemy.  There is the same pitting a maverick officer against his staid bythebook superior.  There is the tense suspenseful escape scene and a rejection of easy Americanstyle heroics. Character is reduced to shorthand.  Despite the greater mobility and fluidity of the camerawork making certain scenes very vivid the film's violence belongs more to the 1950s than the bloodsoaked era of Peckinpah and Penn and there is absolutely no swearing even in those more permissive times.  The whole film has that admirably dour emphasis on the literal mechanics of plot  of getting the job done  which is unglamorous but has an integrity that gives you an illusion of realism and makes the lollipops of escape suspense or action all the more satisfying.So with the exception of colour there is very little difference between 'Break' and all those 1950s films invariably starring John Mills and Richards Attenborough and Todd.  It even begins with a timehonoured shot a god's eye view of the camp from the surveilling post emphasising the seeall power of the confining power.  Of course this surveillance has only access to the surface of things the escape route is under ground. This is also a metaphor for the game of wits between the Germans and their respective captors Major Parry and Captain Conner. Parry like his sentry can only see the surface of things and hence his impasse symptomatic as he admits of his general mediocrity.  Conner's job is to look behind the surface as a crime reporter he is used to infiltrating the underworld now he must literally search under this world of the first shot.  Conner's former job gives the film the air of a transposed policier with the wily old Inspector trying to nab a fiendishly clever criminal.  This point is brought out by the decoy use of police made by the prisoners in the escape.There are a couple of incidental nonstructural changes to the old format that completely revolutionise it.  The prisoners are German.  Further they are not sympathetic nonNazi Germans as in 'Das Boot' but the kind of glassy fanatics with no compunction in slitting an honourable colleague's neck.  And yet they are subversive attempting to overthrow an established order  the opening scene where they group like striking workers and tackle the soldiers regrouping like shielded police that must have had an ironic frisson only two years after 1968.  In the 1950s POW movies there was never any attempt to make the soldiers likable  they were tough professionals doing their job the fact of their Britishness and the shared experience of the war gave the audience the involvement and emotion absent from the films themselves.  Narrative logic suggests that we will be on the side of the prisoners the people who are trying to provoke action  the essence of film  not contain it.  And when they do break out there is a sense of excitement a gush of fresh air AND surrealism a small army of disguised Nazis driving through a sleepy Scottish town.  But these are Nazis.  Rarely has personal morality and narrative demands clashed so disturbingly in so downbeat a fashion.Further this typical British movie marginalises the British.  The one major figure  played by England's most underrated supporting player Ian Hendry  is decent enough but practically useless.  The film is a game of chess between a Nazi and an undisciplined Irishman with little gra for order justice or the English just a gambling man's love of impossible odds. Maybe it's some hidden patriotism on my part but Brian Keith is a wonder a drunken Irishman who seems to be the only one able to establish order but actually deliberately? creates chaos.  Seeing as the Irish spent the war in inglorious neutrality and the IRA supported the Germans you wonder what exactly the very Irish and not AngloIrish despite the Trinity College interiors Conner's motives are  as his German rival says the Brits have been murdering his ancestors for centuries.  It is surely no accident that it was Ireland and Germany who through a long struggle for Independence and two World Wars effectively destroyed the British Empire hence their superimposition at the end. England may have won the battle...This seems to me the true subject of this excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Basically the story of a duel of wits between a German submarine captain Helmut Griem ranking officer in a Scottish POW camp and an Irish captain in the British army Brian Keith who is sent to administer the camp and investigate the reasons for the POWs riotous behavior. It develops that Griem is organizing the escape of 28 submariners because Germany needs experienced crewmen. The escape is successful. It leaves poor Brian Keith behind. Until the very end that is when the escapees are discovered boarding a Uboat off the Scottish coast and alerted by Keith a British patrol boat interferes with the escape. The Uboat submerges with most of the escapees aboard already but it leaves Griem and a few others behind in their rubber boats. Keith watching the events from atop a cliff is given the last words. Well Willi it looks like both you and I are in the house. Interesting film in which nobody really wins. One or two dozen German sailors manage to get away but to what? Another Uboat patrol? After May 1943 those patrols were suicide missions. And it's unusual to see Brian Keith as a genial quiet thoughtful Irishman outwitted by a ruthless German like Griem. And he IS ruthless. Unnecessarily ruthless. One of those dedicated Nazis who kills his comrades without compunction in order to ensure the success of his mission. The role is really pretty retrograde harking back as it does to the Gestapo spies of the 1940s. Other than his tendency to humiliate and kill such skanks as homosexuals Griem with his handsomeness and overall Aryan quality exudes a good deal of charm. He and Keith listen to a recording of Beethoven's third symphony. Toscanini? asks Griem. Keith nods and comments with a smile Furtwangler did it better. Furtwangler was not only a German conductor but a German conductor who played footsies with the Nazis. The thrust and parry extends to prison yard scenes as well. There's quite a bit of action.It must have been filmed in Scotland. I don't blame Griem and the rest for wanting to escape from there. Whew. What dreary weather  clouds rain constant dampness and chill. Not to blame the DP. The atmosphere is perfectly captured in the photography.Anyway is this story based on fact as they say? If so it leaves a couple of questions unanswered that wouldn't otherwise be necessary to ask. Eg. where did they get the truck for hauling explosives?".

	schema:reviewBody "Keith and Griem fight a battle of wits and wills in this intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying prison escape drama. Set during WWII Griem is a Nazi Captain being held prisoner along with 600 of his men in a Scottish POW camp. When the current camp commander Hendry is unable to maintain control of the prisoners gruff Irish Captain Keith is called in to suppress the men and maintain control over the camp. Unfortunately for Keith unrest in the camp is the least of his worries. It seems that Griem's men are burrowing a huge tunnel with plans to let two dozen prisoners escape to a rendezvous with a UBoat. Keith realizes what's happening but opts to let the plan progress so that he can score the bigger coup of not only stopping the escape but of capturing the UBoat as well! What could have been a gripping involving suspense film is marred considerably by an inexplicable decision on the part of the filmmakers. About one fourth of the dialogue in the film is presented in German but without the benefit of subtitles! It is up to the viewer to figure out what is going on based on the nottoodemonstrative body language of the German actors. This cuts the plot line off at the knees and makes for very difficult viewing for those who didn't take German 101 in high school. Obviously one can still follow the bulk of the action without the dialogue but the motivations of the characters is muddled horribly. Animosity towards a homosexual inmate isn't explained fully enough and one character's traitorous actions are left with the meaning behind them up in the air. The ending also leaves a lot to be desired. That said there are some memorable scenes of tension and conflict in the film. Keith gives a solid performance thought his accent is pathetic and wavers greatly throughout. Griem who seems born to play an icy Nazi is a strong adversary. The dank muddy atmosphere only adds to the bleakness of the situation. The film was shot in Ireland and oddly Turkey though it isn't immediately visible which parts were done in Turkey or why! Credibility is strained in a couple of spots such as how can all the dirt from the tunnel fit where they put it and how does a POW get a pair of women's shoes and makeup for the little show they do? There is entertainment value here. It's just compromised by the sad decision to leave a fourth of the dialogue inaccessible to those who don't speak German.".

It's due to the presence of UBoat captain Helmut Griem who has taken over the leadership of the prisoners unofficially. Griem plays Captain Willy Schluetter as I conceive Reinhard Heydrich to be a handsome charismatic leader totally dedicated to the Nazi cause and one stone cold killer.British Intelligence in trying to get to the bottom of things sends Captain Brian Keith who from his accent I'm guessing is an Ulster Protestant. Keith's a smart guy but just maybe a bit too smart for his own good.The McKenzie Break is dominated by Helmut Griem as well it should be. This man has to dominate or otherwise the film would make no sense at all. As charismatic as Griem is as Schluetter he's both fascinating and repellent. His objective is to get as many UBoat people back into the fight. He will sacrifice everything to achieve that objective and I do mean everything.Sad to say this film is a forgotten gem and deserves to be better remembered than it is. Catch it by all means if it's broadcast you will enjoy the surprise ending when neither Keith or Griem get everything they want.".

It is about the use of foreign languages in this case German in American movies.There were several occasions when the German POWs were talking amongst themselves in this film and  quite rightly  the medium of communication switched then from English to German. The problem with this is that only a few of the actors who play Germans in this film are Germans and the result is a bit offputting.  I would categorize the Germanspeaking in this movie into 4 classes1. Nonnative speakers who don't have clue what they are doing they rush their lines very quickly but are virtually incomprehensible.  It is not even German with a strong accent it just comes across as gibberish.2. Nonnative speakers who do have a clue they speak more slowly and are understandable but sadly they all seemed to speak with a fairly strong and easily identifiable accent.3. Germans who speak normally.4. Helmut Griem.  One can tell that he is stagetrained because he tended to speak with this peculiar cutglass highly articulated accent stage actors are trained to use so that the people right at the back of the theatre would still understand what they say.  It doesn't sound very real though  it doesn't in English and it doesn't in German either. Perhaps Griem instinctively wanted to compensate for groups 1 and 2 and surely the director wasn't in a position to tell that he was overdoing it.What some American movie makers and this is a prime example another one would be 'Die Hard' fail to realise is that whenever the original version of such a film is viewed by native speakers then foreign language scenes built on such premises will not work they just make the knowing viewer cringe. Just think about what it would do to 'The Great Escape' if some of the inmates were played instead by German actors who speak English with a strong German accent.".

I used to like buying war comics like Battle and Commando and used to love watching all those B  W war movies  but I was disappointed with THE McKENZIE BREAK first time I saw it probably because the plot mainly involved British guards going into a prison compound  getting beaten back by the German prisoners  Repeat every 15 minutes After seeing it again recently I do realise that my memories are somewhat simplistic but that doesn't mean the film has suddenly improved in my eyes . If I have to be brutally honest then I have to say it has diminished further . Since I first saw this movie I have seen many similar movies like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI  THE GREAT ESCAPE etc films that are either more dramatic or more entertaining than this one  that's probably the problem with TMB it's rather serious in its tone without being compellingly dramatic and the one subplot that I found interesting during its recent broadcast of one of the prisoners being a suspected homosexual by his Nazi peers is rather unexplored There's a couple of other things that stuck out in my mind about this movie and not in a good way . One thing was when a character mentions that a couple of prisoners escaped and made it into the Irish free State . As every schoolboy from my generation knows not one single German prisoner held in allied captivity escaped back to Germany . I know it's not implicitly stated that these two escapees made it back to Germany but it's unlikely they'd be interned in Ireland . Secondly I couldn't help noticing a large German contingent were wearing Wermacht uniforms . Where would they have been captured and why go to all the trouble of keeping them in a Scottish POW camp ? Wouldn't they have been kept in the same region they were captured ? A very average film that will only appeal to people interested in men standing on roofs singing Nazi marching songs".

Connor and the others realize that their prisoners are planning an elaborate escape and Connor has an idea that could either lead to glory for him or be a bad bad mistake.There are no true heroes and villains in this interesting unusual evenhanded narrative scripted by William W.

While ordinarily one wouldn't be rooting for the Nazis you can't help but admire these characters' determination and ingenuity. As the story plays out it becomes more and more a matter of a race against time and it keeps the viewer riveted.The characters are colourful and compelling. Both Keith and Helmut Griem as his primary foe are flawed but charismatic. They're both excellent and receive very strong support from a cast including Ian Hendry as the major in charge of the camp Jack Watson Patrick O'Connell Horst Janson Gregg Palmer and Michael Sheard. The relationship between Keith and Hendry is kind of a thorny one as they differ over methodology but it's just as fascinating to watch them butt heads as it is to see Keith and Griem engage in their little chess game.Granted the camp personnel end up not looking very good since the Germans are able to pull off so much. But overall this is an over looked and sometimes exciting wartime film from a capable journeyman director Lamont Johnson The Last American Hero One on One.Eight out of 10.".

Evidently based on some actual incidents during WWII the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. One very likely reason is that  in the print I saw on TCM anyway  none of the scenes where the Germans talked among themselves were given titles. This interesting directorial concept  to let the nonGerman speaking viewer just guess from context what the Germans are saying to each other  is in my book an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. Also the way the movie begins  just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup  is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here but the reputations of The Great Escape and Stalag 17 will not be challenged by this flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a subgenre is established in the wonderfully diverse cosmology of film you can bet that someone in this postmodern media savvy world will add to it. Only they'll have knowing winks to the audience when the usual hoops are jumped through or they'll play with those expectations and pull the rug out from under you by subverting them and twisting the plot. We all know the score they know we know we know they know we know ad infinitum or more often nauseam. It comes as a surprise to me that someone was at this in 1970 with a humble POW movie.The inmates are tunnelling out. Dummies in for escapees at roll call check. Uniforms manufactured in camp check. Tunnel cavein during the escape check. It's not all by the numbers though. We have a vaulting horse. No tunnel mouth there though as you can see right under it. Good topsoil on the turnip patch but that's not where they're hiding the spoil. That this is a British POW camp the those escaping are German prisoners is unusual and welcome. Maybe the biggest twist of all is that the whole escape has been rumbled by the authorities but they let them escape in order to net a bigger prize.OK it's not as knowing as anything since 1994 but it does play with the genre well albeit a little hamfistedly at time. Underneath the genre trappings there's a good little drama with a central duel between an Irish Captain in British Intelligence and the UBoat Commander commanding officer in camp. Both are willing to bend and break the rules in pursuit of their aims. One of them will even kill to achieve his aims. Both are highly flawed individuals. Both are selfcentred and neither of them succeed. From a simple set up at the start the film reaches a fresh and unexpected conclusion to give a true standout film.There are some clumsy cuts and overlays to demonstrate simultaneous actions in various locations as the escape progresses that really don't work and the drive of the second half of the film falls flat. The feuds within the camp both that between captors and captives and between the Luftwaffe and the Submariners are edgy. The tension created evaporates as soon as the escapees are out of the camp. It all gets a little clunky. However overall this is a good film and definitely one to watch if you like your postmodernism freshly minted from the 70s.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Snow Angels' is a movie based on a book by Stewart O'Nan. It is directed by David Gordon Green and stars Sam Rockwell Kate Beckinsale and Michael Angarano. Rockwell and Beckinsale portray a recently divorced couple with a daughter who were high school sweethearts. Angarano plays a teenager who used to be babysat by Annie Beckinsale. The movie follows the lives of several people including Annie and Glenn Rockwell Arthur Angrano and his parents and others as some relationships are built and others are destroyed.The movie has a strong reallife feeling to it thanks to great writing by Green and great acting skills by the cast. There are scenes where Annie yells at her child that may seem to be out of place at first glance but are actually amazing truetolife ways to express how sometimes parents can lose their tempers with their children. The scenes show how sometimes kids can try to push their parents' buttons or play their parents against each other without even knowing it.The acting is absolutely wonderful  the actors show a wide range from joy to sorrow and from humor to violent anger. There are times when you love and sympathize with the characters and there are times when you hate them so much your blood boils  that's how strongly the audience connects to the characters. By the end of the movie you feel drained as if you just watched someone you love die.There were times when the whole audience laughed together and there were times when the whole audience grew silent in discomfort. The way that this movie consists of laughoutloud moments and moments when you just want to tear your heart out and break out a box of tissues is what makes it an outstanding movie. This movie doesn't even have to try to get its audience to love it. The script is chockfull of wit life at its best and worst and humor for every generation. The movie left me walking out of the BAM theater smiling and wishing I could watch it again not wondering why I'd wasted over 10 bucks on a ticket.The only problem I found with the movie was that its setting was a bit confusing. There were scenes where the characters used cell phones and others where there were those record players for LPs. But other than that the movie was flawless.Beckinsale is at her best here not only in looks but in acting range. She took me on another world as I sympathized with her felt angry at her felt happy with her and watched her as her character's story unfolded before my very eyes. This is one of her best movies and to me it IS her best movie.1010 for sure.".

	schema:headline " Heartbreaking tragic and sensational.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the hands of a less capable director this devastating tale of loneliness murder adultery and budding teenage love could have easily turned into a melodramatic soap opera filled with completely unlikeable characters. However David Gordon Green once again expresses his genius by displaying human characters with real emotions. The film begins and ends with a montage of standard everyday activity in your standard American town showing that these people aren't in extraordinary circumstances or any different from you or I. They are human and they are very flawed.Another genius decision by Green is who he decided to put in the middle of the film. In a story filled with such tragedy it is surprisingly centered around Arthur Michael Angarano a young band member and his budding romance with quirky new girl Lila Olivia Thirlby. Their adorable friendshipturnedrelationship is so sweet and pleasant that when they are on screen alone you completely forget about the chaos that is surrounding this town. At the beginning of the film we hear two gunshots as the band is preparing their big number for the football game at the end of the week. So from the start we know that this story is destined to end in tragedy. But in these moments with just Arthur and Lila being awkward and cute with one another expressing their mutual attraction or making love for the first time Green makes us believe that everything is right in this small town if only for a moment.Possibly the biggest story of the film is the destructive relationship of Arthur's coworker and former babysitter Annie Kate Beckinsale and her unstable exhusband Glenn Sam Rockwell. Annie goes through the entire film taking one hit after another. She has so much on her plate between raising a child alone taking care of her mother and her affair with Nate Nicky Katt who is coincidentally her best friend's Amy Sedaris husband. Slowly everything in her world unravels until a point where she is nothing but an empty vessel of what may have been a happy woman at some point in her life back when Glenn used to make her life. Glenn himself is an absolute wreck in every aspect of his life. On the surface he appears to be a despicable hypocritical character who preaches about how Christianity saves him but then falls right back into drinking and neglecting his daughter. However in the writing and in Rockwell's flawless performance he becomes one of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in many years. It's a film filled with real people who keep falling into horrific circumstances.At the center of the entire film is Green's sensational writing and directing. But his brilliant work would be nothing without the astounding performances from the entire cast. Sam Rockwell is an actor who I admire passionately but he still managed to surprise me with his portrayal of Glenn. Rarely have I had such an emotional connection with a character to the point where I cry when he does and when he does something that I know is wrong my stomach clenches in fear of what the consequences will be. His performance is a tour de force and one of the best I've seen this decade. Kate Beckinsale is also surprisingly fantastic. The role is very unflattering and at first glance her angelic beauty seems to be miscast but she proves that external beauty can be nothing but a cover for someone who is slowly breaking to pieces inside. She is absolutely devastating and explosive throughout the film. However the most surprising of the cast is the young Michael Angarano who nails the role of Arthur with a reserved internal anguish that is barely let out on the surface but is always clearly dwelling underneath. It's a trait that I could relate so well with and I was amazed at how well he captured this performance. Olivia Thirlby one of my favorite young actresses is also phenomenal as the unique adorable young photographer who gets Angarano to fall for her it's easy to see why.As almost everyone says Snow Angels is an incredibly difficult film to watch but one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. Everyone who contributes in the film is at the very top of their game and it combines for something unlike anything I've ever seen. Green is clearly one of the most passionate directors working today he refuses to add a flare or flashy style to his films but in doing so makes his intimate relationship with his characters instantly recognizable. He is a man who cares so deeply about the people he is putting on the screen that he refuses to let anyone label them or imply anything about them. This film is many things a tragedy a tale of young love a display of flawed human beings falling apart in a small town. Ultimately though to me it's a story of loneliness. Green shows early on that no matter what you have in your life everyone is instinctively lonely. By the end he proves that without love or friendship life can fall apart to results that you would never dream possible.".

Olivia Thirlby one of my favorite young actresses is also phenomenal as the unique adorable young photographer who gets Angarano to fall for her it's easy to see why.As almost everyone says Snow Angels is an incredibly difficult film to watch but one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. Everyone who contributes in the film is at the very top of their game and it combines for something unlike anything I've ever seen. Green is clearly one of the most passionate directors working today he refuses to add a flare or flashy style to his films but in doing so makes his intimate relationship with his characters instantly recognizable. He is a man who cares so deeply about the people he is putting on the screen that he refuses to let anyone label them or imply anything about them. This film is many things a tragedy a tale of young love a display of flawed human beings falling apart in a small town. Ultimately though to me it's a story of loneliness. Green shows early on that no matter what you have in your life everyone is instinctively lonely. By the end he proves that without love or friendship life can fall apart to results that you would never dream possible.";

	schema:reviewBody "For some the best type of films are those that are characterbased there is no action sequences no huge stunts or explosions. Rather there is a story that unfolds and is filled with quiet moments as well as more rambunctious ones that never go over the top into farce. Here writerdirector David Gordon Green handles strong and intense material yet creates a moving and unforgettable piece of filmmaking that I will not soon forget.In the same vein as American Beauty Ordinary People and Little Children this film explores the simple everyday lives of people just trying to exist as best they can. People work at jobs they don't like struggle to relate to their children each other and themselves and in this case deal with some unbelievable situations. In whatever case Green keeps just the right amount of difference at the right time and then shoves it in our face exactly when we need it.To assist him is the cast which is uniformly excellent in its performances. Kate Beckinsale needs to concentrate on serious films after this really sharp and heartbreaking role as Annie a single woman struggling to cope with her daughter who she doesn't truly understand and her estranged husband who she regrets not being able to fix her relationship with. The husband Glenn is played by Sam Rockwell in I think the film's best performance. Glenn is a struggling alcoholic who also is devoutly religious and the way he attempts to correlate the two elements is both cringing and stunning. The most effective relationship in the film is that between two high school students played by Michael Anagarano and Olivia Thirlby. How sweet and wonderful it is to see two people that truly seem to love or at least trust each other in order to have support for their problems. Here Green seems to be teaching by showing that even young people can and do understand the seriousness and complexity of real relationships.As I said before this is a very sad film with most of the sadness directed at Annie and Glenn. What is even more sad is that they try to overcome their shortcomings by digging deeper holes. This is a film that evokes great empathy and you want to reach out to these people knowing they are going to do something regrettable. One thing not regrettable is watching this film which is simplytold very powerful and forever unforgettable.".

	schema:headline " Hard to watch but worth paying the price";
	schema:reviewBody "Snow Angels is a glimpse in time of several relationships some simmering and ready to boil others cooling down and at least one whose flame has yet to be lit. It's also a thriller with a gunshot that is heard as the film opens. The narrative is linear but writerdirector David Gordon Green adapting the novel by Stewart O'Nan takes the couples' stories and interweaves them in such a way that we never quite know all the secrets at the heart of the mystery. The film flashes back as we try to see how we got from there to here. In many ways the overriding theme deals with the promise of what once was versus the reality of what could have been. The reality is embodied in the relationships which are falling apart as evident in the older couples. The promise is represented by the young couple whose lives are just beginning. At the heart of the film is the crumbling relationship between Sam Rockwell as Glenn and Kate Beckinsale as Annie. We watch Glenn almost literally disintegrating before our eyes as he tries to get a grip on who he is and why his marriage is failing. Glenn is one of the most frightening characters I've seen outside of horror films. Kate Beckinsale's Annie is breathtaking in every sense of the word. We bear witness to a life in free fall as everything and everyone she loves seems just out of reach. You know those dreams where you can't quite get to where you want? You try to touch it but it stays at arm's length? That's Annie's world. We so painfully watch as the madness around her takes its toll and she weathers the way rain erodes rich topsoil leaving little but rocky dirt underneath. Amy Sedaris is Annie's best friend Barb. She has her own marital fires to put out and the relationship between Annie and Barb progresses in a way nobody can imagine. She is a joy to watch. In the midst of the darkness there are some lighter moments as well and Michael Angarano Arthur Parkinson Olivia Thirlby Lila Raybern and Connor Paolo Warren have the lion's share of them. They are essentially the light in the darkness that surrounds the rest of the film. It should be no surprise to fans of Angarano that writerdirector David Gordon Green would have chosen him to play Arthur Parkinson. He's not yet comfortable in his own skin a trait which could describe most adolescents. He's a bit shy nervous and even nerdy yet he is charming enough that everyone else seems drawn to him even though he doesn't seem to be aware of it. As Arthur's muse Olivia Thirlby's Lila is the female representation of those awkward teenage years and an almost equal counterpart to Michael's Arthur. Their tender tiptoeing around each other is one of the most touching depictions of first love I've seen in cinema. Connor as Arthur's best friend Warren provides some much needed comic relief. He is a smartass whose ego often backfires. He's funny and not quite as smart as he thinks he is. Among other standout performances is Griffin Dunne Don as Arthur's flighty dad. Or should we say father not really the Dad that Arthur wants or needs him to be but the boy clings to him in this critical time of life when he is most in need of a male role model. But he won't find one here. It's this failure to connect which climaxes in an exchange between them that gave me chills. It was a jawdropping moment.So much of the film is frightening that as Green said in the QA afterward he had to find actors who could infuse some humor into their characters otherwise it would be too heavy. All around me were glistening eyes and tissues wiping away tears. At its heart it is a sad story and the audience was hushed at the end. Many have wondered how much of the film is David Gordon Green's adaptation as opposed to the Stewart O'Nan novel on which it is based. Green did discuss this at length in the QA. After reading the book he knew he had to make it into a film. But he also immediately knew that it would have to be heavily adapted. The more he wrote the more he realized just how much would really have to come from his own hand. The impression I got was that what we see on screen is much more David's work than maybe even he had initially anticipated. Jeff McIlwain and David Wingo's score is haunting as is the film. It is used sparsely only to punctuate the dramatic moments as the subject matter is weighty enough that it didn't need much augmentation. It's used efficiently and effectively. The film is visually stunning. No surprise here as it was shot by Green's longtime collaborator Tim Orr. His work is unmistakable  gutters dripping swings on a swing set clouds contrails aluminum siding  you can always tell his work. He sees language in shapes and movement of inanimate objects. He then connects them to the action in the story often with a wink and a nod. Blink and you might miss it. The beautiful winter landscape of Nova Scotia gives him a palette from which he can choose many colors. The juxtaposition of Orr's beautiful photography with the horrors David Gordon Green exposes us to in Snow Angels is nothing short of genius.This is a true work of art to which many filmmakers aspire. Few hit the mark. I'm not sure if that's what David Gordon Green was trying to do here but he did it nonetheless. There is little doubt in my mind that this is a film which will make you think about the innocence of youth and how fleeting it is and make you wonder if it has to be that way.".

Kate Beckinsale is Annie Marchand she works in a restaurant and is separated from her husband. They have a small daughter. It seems he has had some emotional issues received treatment but still behaves like the kind of guy most people don't want to be around. He is a social misfit often saying or doing exactly what shouldn't be said or done in the situation. Meanwhile Annie is secretly carrying on with a married man while her husband seeks to reunite the family.Sam Rockwell is the husband Glenn Marchand and he plays the part very well.

Meanwhile Arthur gets to be friends with a new girl at school Olivia Thirlby as Lila Raybern and they become young lovers. Interesting dynamic when his mother one morning realizes he and his girl had spent a night together she doesn't scold him at all in fact expresses some amount of envy that he is getting some and she isn't.Anyway as wellmade and as wellacted as this movie is when it was over I didn't feel good.

This of course further strained relationships and Glenn went to Annie's house with a shotgun and shells he waited for her shot and killed her.

Sam Rockwell's performance I found extraordinary. His past roles have always reflected a broad range and the character he plays in this film may well be one of his very best. This is a movie that carefully and honestly dissects dysfunctional lives in a small insulated world. What was so amazing to me was the film's ability to create a combination of a storyline being so very sad and bleak while at the same time that storyline's expression being so beautifully and artistically realized.

	schema:reviewBody "David Gordon Green is the most talented and consistently excellent American director to emerge this decade making a splash he has yet to equal with George Washington in 2000 and gaining further recognition with the acclaimed painfully truetolife relationship drama All the Real Girls. Sadly his followup to All the Real Girls the outstanding Undertow failed to register with critics and Snow Angels although better received came and went without causing much buzz. Green's first major studio job stoner actioncomedy Pineapple Express was a big hit and taken along with his unrelentingly grim Snow Angels shows the director attempting to move past his smallscale independent films which initially garnered so much acclaim for him.Snow Angels is another drama from David Gordon Green true but it is also still different from his other films in the sense that it is his most tragic film and also his most narrativelyfocused his previous films were far more lyrical. Here he's also dealing with sorts of characters he only touched on previously and it's also if you don't count his collaborative effort on Undertow his first screenplay adapted from another person's work. I have not read the novel Snow Angels but I doubt there is any detail no matter how painful which Gordon Green didn't unflinchingly transfer to the screen.Although I enjoyed All the Real Girls a lot I found that whenever the film was not focusing on the two leads it lost its edge and became a rather mundane typical sort of film with few truly interesting characters aside from the main two. Snow Angels perhaps partially due to it being an adaptation doesn't fail to create interesting although certainly not sympathetic characters out of every last major player in this film. The story connects a teenager who is falling in love his former babysitter her estranged husband and their daughter in an involving focused narrative which is never exactly unpredictable but is always absorbing and deeply deeply affecting. It's not an enjoyable film exactly at least the final hour isn't but it is hypnotic it is stunningly stunningly welldirected and photographed by David Gordon Green and frequent collaborator Tim Orr respectively there are certain shots which are too beautiful to put into words and I was absolutely transfixed for the entirety of this film. Another film in what Nathan Lee formerly of the Village Voice terms the 'familiar turf of the SmallTown Midwinter Tragedy' which Lee insists the film transcends Snow Angels is right up there with The Sweet Hereafter and Paul Schrader's Affliction I was even surprised to find that Russell Banks wasn't the author of the novel this was based on and for my money better than those two films. I quite like the SmallTown Midwinter Tragedy as a subgenre so I'm not going to say that this doesn't fall under that label but I will say that Snow Angels achieves a sort of real honest drama that can only come through true insight into the characters in an interview with the Onion A.V. Club Gordon Green stated that this was a very personal project and it shows and a real understanding of them. In that sense it goes far beyond most tragedies the vast majority are shallow miserable soulless tearjerkers no matter how far back in history you look and although it's unpleasantly dark and grim there is humanity to the film mostly observed through the young couple in love these scenes are somewhat reminiscent of All the Real Girls only without the complications which really elevates this beyond your typical downbeat film as ultimately devastating and depressing as it is.The film would be nothing without the performances and as someone who couldn't have cared less for Kate Beckinsale before seeing this I now think this was easily the best female performance of the year so far. If the Academy didn't require extensive lobbying for a film to get a nomination Beckinsale would almost certainly be up for Best Actress come early 2009. The rest of the cast are excellent too in particular Sam Rockwell who may annoy a lot of viewers with his performance in this film but it is absolutely necessary for the character to work and is eerily reminiscent of someone I used to know and all the more effective for it. I don't want to see this film again for a long long time and in this case that's a good thing. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "The only enjoyable thing about seeing this movie is to watch Michael Angarano's performance. Clearly he is a talented actor with a bright future. Other than that we in the theater jointly agreed... what was the point and why do these movies get made. As the viewer we are tossed into this dismal depressing world of rural PA. and left there to wonder... why don't these people seek some therapy  get some help... maybe try to move up the food chain. Why I wondered were these people stalled in this life how did they get there why aren't they leaving? And then all I could wonder was why should I care? No one in this movie shows any compassion why should the audience? The direction is limited the story convoluted and the Art Direction clearly without budget They couldn't even afford to change the light switches. Not to mention the snow... non melting fake snow... gross. I hope Sam Rockwell spends some time choosing his next project as well as Griffin Dunne what is he doing here. These guys are great actors stuck in a boring story. A storylife most people are trying to escape and by escape I don't mean murder suicide. lastly I wish when people are determined to kill themselves in a murder suicide that they take care of the suicide part first. See something else. R".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is quite fantastic a character study of a small town and the everyday craziness that can happen in it. From the trailer one will understand that this will be a very deep story culminating into some dark event that will serve as a catalyst for either growth or degeneration for those involved. Green however never takes the easy road to show us a conventional leadup to said occurrence. Instead he commences our journey into the town with a lengthy portion of the comedic mundanity of life. We begin to understand these characters and their relationships with one another we are thrust into their lives while they have all reached a crossroads of faith and find themselves on the cusp of either taking a step forward or a giant leap back. The familiarity greatly increases the emotional impact of the climatic tragedy that serves to push them all to their breaking point. It's a slow boil to utter devastation and it is handled to perfection.A lot is going on characterwise and it all is intertwined together. Unlike most pieces of this nature lately Snow Angels allows each role to exist individually while also having a cursory connection to the rest. They don't walk into each other's lives in contrived ways for the sake of the script. These are real people in close proximity that inquire about and interact with others in their hometown much like you do in real life. A high school trombone player named Arthur is our central entry point into the tale as he touches the most people along the journey. He works at a restaurant with Annie who was also his babysitter and an early crush many years previously leading to a nice scene of the two reminiscing in the backroom now that they are both older as well as her friend Barb. Glenn becomes involved through his marriage with Annie and their daughter Tara while the new girl in school Lila begins a relationship with Arthur to enter herself into the tale. Everyone's parents ask about the others in more of a polite manner than anything else. They all know each other and try to stay on top of things despite any real caring. I think at least three people ask how Annie's mother is doing not because they want to know but because it is what neighbors do. You have a stake in the lives of those around you because you are all involved in a community. It may be a tenuous bond but it is a bond nonetheless one that may connect you moreso than you might have thought.Green really allows his audience to find their own bond with the people on screen. We begin to feel for Glenn as he tries to pick the pieces of his life back up off the ground. A man chased by the demons of alcohol he has all but lost his wife and keeps only a thin hold on his daughter after attempting to kill himself before finding God. He is a man that means well but might not have the capacity to endure what is happening around him as his wife is seeing someone else and still holds a small fear of him and his actions. You hope that Glenn can stay on the right path but as you watch him continue on through everything you begin to wonder if he can. Credit Sam Rockwell with this because he is absolutely amazing. Always relegated to be the funny guy Rockwell shows the range he had starring in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind with a devastating role. One can't praise him enough.We connect to the others as well through their strong performances. Michael Angarano is great as Arthur growing into an adult and experiencing things that he may not be ready for. Finding his first girlfriend in Lila a nice turn from Olivia Thirlby he must also confront the past a selfish father leaving and returning what he sees fit into his wife and son's lives Griffin Dunne in a well portrayed bit and the death that has gotten strong in the air. Kate Beckinsale as Annie shows that she can act when not wearing tight leather in vampire films going through the biggest changes of everyone with her mother to care for the return of her husband an affair with Nicky Katt's Nate and the responsibilities of being a mother.True the actors are the real shining grace here but Green deserves praise for their work and that of the aesthetic look on display. The final act tends to drag in parts as it leads to the inevitable conclusion but that is the only blemish from the whole. His compositions are stunning with many scenes standing out. When Dunne and Angarano are walking and talking at the father's campus Green chooses to continue panning left even as they have stopped not lingering on their final words but instead the void left empty in front of them as they are stalled figuratively and metaphorically in their relationship with one another. Along with instances like that we are treated to multiple closeups of people and objects throughout whether it be the marching band conductor's speech or the camera that Lila takes around with her. Green has deft control on the proceedings infusing the right amount of light humor to diffuse the darkness deep within the town. Tragedy affects everyone differently showing some the futility of life and others the preciousness of it. It is a tough thing to lose a child either through divorce death or complacency and Green puts it all on display to see whether his characters can continue on or fall forever from grace.".

	schema:reviewBody "WriterDirector hybrid David Gordon Green returns to his pattern of beautifully entwining the lives of small town characters in his new drama Snow Angels which depicts the act of floating through life at its simplest and purest all of these characters despite their numerical ages walk the dangerous tightrope between child and adulthood leaning from one side to the other with every step.Based on Stewart O'Nan's novel by the same name Snow Angels is set in a confining New England town where it seems that young love can only be found when an older love completely fizzles out. Glenn and Annie Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale respectively are that latter couple as separated parents they struggle with the maturity required to share custody of their young daughter while simultaneously resorting to the childish behavior of relying on their parents for help. While Glenn seems to be the one who has given up on any light life may have to offer it is Annie who comes across as the most immature character at first glance. She is the young mother who is still putting her own juvenile needs first. She works a deadend restaurant job something usually reserved for teenagers and engages in an affair with a coworker's husband Nicky Katt. Perhaps that is why she reconnects so easily with her former babysitting charge Arthur Michael Angarano. What redeems though Annie is the wellmeaning but overwhelmed way in which Beckinsale portrays her she paints on a bright smile to try to seem like everything is okay and together but her eyes are tired behind it allowing the audience a glimpse of just how beatendown she really feels. Even in the moments when she snaps at her daughter she comes across a lot softer than would be expected in such a situation.Arthur is very much an old soul trapped in a teenage boy's body though he is just a high school student he is swiftly being introduced to all of love's grandeurs and pitfalls when he simultaneously falls for new student Lila Olivia Thirlby while facing the implosion of his own parents' marriage and monetary security. Angarano's big wide eyes are not those of wonder or awe in Snow Angels they too seem prematurely exhausted with the weight of everything going on around him. It is no surprise then that he clings to the one person who used to take care of him when he was a child Annie. It is their friendship that is the deepest bond in the film because it is a pure agendaless emotional connection.Green expertly weaves tales of the daily grind from the mundane acts of Arthur's marching band practice to Glenn's defeat when he momentarily lets his faith slip and reaches for the liquor bottle yet again to the shortlived triumphs like a stolen moment laughing between two friends. It is when Glenn and Annie's daughter goes missing that these menchildren realize all of the pain in which they have been wallowing is petty adolescent dwelling and they have never before truly known horror but just tedium.Snow Angels is never sappy nor melodramatic as Green chooses subtlety and quiet desperation over loud explosions from his characters. Glenn is the one character that rides that line sometimes sobbing to himself and something banging his head against a truck. Rockwell is an incomparable talent in the current film business but he pulls out all of the punches here going above and beyond to make his character the scared confused little boy trapped in a grown man's body that is so common for those to whom life has just seemed to happen. It is only when Glenn is considered a suspect in his daughter's disappearance that he awakens from the stupor that has become his life. In the moments that follow both he and Annie grow up in a profound way being forced to reevaluate their situation and try to pick up the pieces of their lives.Some may go into Snow Angels expecting a suspense thriller and therefore find the methodic pacing a bit slow. Upon walking out of the theater though it is impossible not to notice that you don't feel drained because you spent the last hour and fortyfive minutes bored but rather because you went on an emotional journey that made you smile warmly one minute and tear up the next. Green and Snow Angels makes you feel and that is the greatest gift a film today can give. More than a year after the film first debuted at Sundance to critical acclaim Snow Angels is finally getting a wide release and it couldn't have come at a better time. After the barrage of uninspired formulaic romcoms and CGI monster flicks of late we could all benefit from some real raw feeling.".

Playing a his character Rockwell shows us his great acting talent and being a master of manysided personality.";

	schema:headline " A masterpiece much deeper than it is being given credit for";
	schema:reviewBody "Snow Angels is a film that one release has been relatively accepted as a competent straight forward depressing drama. I believe however that the themes of this film reach far deeper than that of a typical depressing drama.Originally I had read an interpretation of the film praising the contrast between Arthur and Lily's relationship representing perfect bliss and happiness and hope and Glen and Annie's relationship of blackness and destruction. However after looking deeper into the film I believe Snow Angel uses not two relationships to portray its themes not three but four Arthur and Lily Barb and Nate Don and Louise Parkinson Arthur's parents and finally Glen and Annie. What's brilliant about this movie is how each one represents a step in the process of a relationship from perfect beginning to total black ending and how each step bleeds into the next chronologically going from perfection to the shattering of this perfection to the fall in its course to destruction and death.Arthur and Lily are the first step through them we see a relationship's beginning or really its birth. We see the first meeting and eyeing their courting their first kiss their first sex... the relationship is born and blossoms and we leave them in perfect happiness. Arthur and Lily are in fact perfect beings completely untainted and incapable of wrong.The line then jumps to Barb and Nate. They represent simply the incident that causes the rift or breakup in the couple the shattering of perfection the beginning of the fall. While the jump in terms of age and status is big from Arthur and Lily to Barb and Nate in this case age doesn't matter... the symbolism of going from happiness and stability to getting hit with the rift moment is the same. Barb and Nate get the least screen time and development in this film but their place is essential to this progressive arc.Continuing where they left off Don and Louise Parkinson Arthur's parents show the results of the incident and separation. They're formally separated as opposed to Nate being just kicked out of the house. Another difference is that Nate in the film is still a half goofy character leopard underwear was there for a reason and is very calm when confronting Glen. Meanwhile Don is seemingly more sombre he has an air of creepy offness not yet developed. Don and Louise are obviously on the edge but with Don's mixtape at the end we leave them in a moment of most importantly hope a dominant theme in the film... Their fate is still ambiguous they can turn this thing around. Or they can't...The last step is obviously Glen and Annie who show what happens when you don't turn it around when you lose all hope hit total destruction and blackness. They of course end up falling deeper and deeper into darkness until absolute tragedy and death.What's even more brilliant about this is that it ties overall into the basic from comedy to tragedy meter. The basic classification of all stories is you begin at the top with comedies where you have a happy ending and innocent perfect beings but as you go further and further down the drop almost like a fall into a hole you get more flawed complex beings who do more and more morally wrong things until of course you hit the bottom complete tragedy and destruction of the human soul completely. These stages are in essence symbolized and brought out in Snow Angels. You could also tie the film into our loss of innocence from childhood into less and less joy and more and more frailty as adults until we finally reach death. I'm no Catholocism expert but I'm guessing you could tie that in there somewhere too... the heaven and hell thing or whatever or just birth  life  death.Oh and has it been mentioned this movie is amazingly acted shot and edited? I'd heard the Beckinsale can actually act chatter but ho.ly. cow... she jumped from Scarlett Johannson level to give her an Oscar level in like one film. Rockwell matches her just brilliant. With the heavy melodrama these two are asked to pull off it'd be VERY easy for most actors to slip into overacted and falsehood but they pull it off immensely. Angarano Thirlby stars of the future. Arnette Dunne Katt Sedaris all great.Do not miss this film it's one of the finest of the year Review written for worldofkj.comforum".

This tragedy only adds to Arthur's own tenuous coping with becoming an adult and how Glenn and Annie deal with loss results in a profoundly sad ending that is accompanied by the incidental music of the high school band performing on a winter field in this place where things just happen. There is little to add light to the story except that the performances by each of the actors are exceptionally fine. Director Green manages to create a fine ensemble feeling from these actors and while there are few characters with whom we can consistently empathize Green manages to draw wellfocused small town folk who remain in the mind long after the film is ended. Not a happy film but a solid one. Grady Harp".

The range in the movie from the brilliant acting to the outstanding storyline touched my soul deeply.The first thing that caught my attention was the brilliant setting in the movie. For anyone who has ever lived up north they can relate to the constant snowy overcast depressing days winter brings. The director seemed to capture this setting brilliantly. This was a movie that definitely had to be set in an very somber dejected environment. The snow was brilliant the cloud cover was outstanding the cold weather was amazing. They all played a huge role in capturing the underlying theme of the movie.The story line was also brilliant. A very subtle realistic storyline. There was not the happy ending there was not the special effect nor was their the big budget to depend on. The director had to rely on brilliant acting and realistic moments throughout the movie. As angry as Glen made you feel throughout the movie at some points I also felt very sorry for him. You began to realize that he was a conflicted individual with much deeper issues. You understood that deep in his heart he wanted to be the best for his family. Glen reminded me of a few saddened figures in my life. His frustration and dejected feelings also brought me back to some low points in my life.But there was a great balance. In the midst of all the depression and anger you had 2 innocent young High School kids wrapped up in innocent love. It reminded my of my first High school love and the natural glow a situation like that brings. I even love how Mr Gordan lightly focused on the declining marriage of Arthurs parents. A scene becoming more common in today's world.I cannot express my appreciation for Snow Angels. The humble story line and the brilliant acting captivated me. I have watched the movie at least 5 times within the last 2 weeks.".

	schema:headline " Snow Angels Leaves You Cold";
	schema:reviewBody "Snow Angels is set in a small town in America during a nonspecific time. There are few details that define or accentuate time and place. It could be any small town USA and for all we know it could be the present. All we really know is that it is cold and wintertime. Directed by David Gordon Green Snow Angels is a somber affecting meditation on sadness and fate based on the novel written by Stewart O'Nan. It chronicles two weeks in the life of the central characters whose lives are all connected in some way.The movie begins with striking images of winter barren trees and snow. A high school marching band is rehearsing outdoors for the football game. They are lethargic and out of tune. Their instructor chides them and we here the sound of what might be gunshots in the distance. Everything stops and the story goes back to two weeks prior where the characters are introduced. We see Arthur Michael Angarano the high school student busing tables in a Chinese restaurant. He works with his older friend Annie played by Kate Beckinsale the newly separated mother who used to babysit for Michael when he was young. Annie gives Arthur a ride home when his mother forgets to pick him up. Arthur's parents played by Jeanette Arnette and Griffin Dunne are also going through a separation.Later we meet Annie's estranged husband Glen played by Sam Rockwell. Early on we learn that he has had problems with drinking and keeping a job and even tried to take his own life as a result of his life apart from Annie and the baby. Somehow he survived the suicide and has become a born again Christian but his stability remains uncertain. We also meet the new student Lila played by Olivia Thirlby who befriends Arthur. Lila is the outsider who takes photographs as a hobby. She is on the outside literally peering in like the audience. Early on she shows Arthur her photographs of the town. Since her family moves around a lot she likes to take pictures of her first impressions of the new places she moves to. They are beautiful portraits all black and white mostly of them empty landscapes and snow. Coldness and alienation is a constant theme that wraps around the characters to a nearly suffocating extent.Green's direction is deliberate and slowly paced. The camera rests patiently upon the characters giving them time to grow and breathe. Even in awkward moments as there are in the life of a teenager and in the tension rising moments of the adults who are enduring emotional pain the shots are long and deliberate with a quiet gentle soundtrack that does not try to manipulate or force the action. Green allows the dialog and the performances of the actors drive the story. There is no melodrama just painfully sad realities.Snow Angels has the feel of an independent film in its simple storytelling and without bloated production values or faux sentimentality or gimmicky performances. It feels like real life real people in a real town. The only problem is that it's real real sad. In fact it's too sad. Despite the artful direction and nuanced performances the film itself has little balance nothing to contrast the heavy weight of angst that smothers the characters as well as the audience. Fargo 1996 was a similar movie  a tragic tale of human failings set in a vast winter of emptiness. And yet there were many contrasting elements which balanced the mood such as hilarious dialog and mannerisms a riveting driving musical score and shocking unexpected violence. Many aspects of that film were recognized for achievement in filmmaking and I believe it even received Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I would also dare say that this movie energized the careers of several of its little known actors and deservedly so including Steve Buscemi William H. Macy and Frances McDormand. But Snow Angels provides no such relief from its oppressive tone. I get the feeling that Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale needed an immediate retreat to a warm tropic island after making this picture or at least a few sessions of therapy and through no fault of their own. Their performances are great but the movie over all leaves you with the need for immediate cleansing or escape to anywhere that's warm.".

It feels like real life real people in a real town. The only problem is that it's real real sad. In fact it's too sad. Despite the artful direction and nuanced performances the film itself has little balance nothing to contrast the heavy weight of angst that smothers the characters as well as the audience. Fargo 1996 was a similar movie  a tragic tale of human failings set in a vast winter of emptiness. And yet there were many contrasting elements which balanced the mood such as hilarious dialog and mannerisms a riveting driving musical score and shocking unexpected violence. Many aspects of that film were recognized for achievement in filmmaking and I believe it even received Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I would also dare say that this movie energized the careers of several of its little known actors and deservedly so including Steve Buscemi William H. Macy and Frances McDormand. But Snow Angels provides no such relief from its oppressive tone. I get the feeling that Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale needed an immediate retreat to a warm tropic island after making this picture or at least a few sessions of therapy and through no fault of their own. Their performances are great but the movie over all leaves you with the need for immediate cleansing or escape to anywhere that's warm.";

Annie is lost and fragile unsure of appropriate action at this particular crossroads in life. Their story is laced with that of other residents in the town and you'll be pleased to know it's not all doom and gloom a budding romance plays out with the talents of Michael Angarano and the wonderful Olivia Thirlby. There's also work from Griffin Dunne Nicky Katt and the excellent Tom Noonan in an extended cameo that bookends the film's enigmatic emotional climate. Rockwell seeths with regret and heartache lashing out passively at first until his behaviour becomes very destructive to himself and those around them. Beckinsale has never been better downplaying Annie by bottling up her feelings and letting them corrosive erupt in a third act of unimaginable tragedy that demands courage and compassion from the viewer. A highly complex grounding story of lives gone off track and the not always so simple way in which we humans conduct ourselves with each other. A must see.".

Essentially this is a film that explores the ups and downs of human life and how people deal with them. This dialogbased film has some powerful but key moments that show the audience this. These scenes are genuinely emotional and may induce a tear or two. Difficult as it may be to watch this film is a plus of cinema.David Gordon Green's film explores several characters and their relationships with each other. We see a shy high school kid his old babysitter and her estranged husband and how their lives interconnect with each other.The acting is nearly flawless. Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell deliver some of their finest and perhaps careerdefining performances yet. Beckinsale proves that she does not have to be a vampire in the Underworld films to find out she can take these kind of dramatic roles just fine. She does have the emotional depth for these parts. We all know Sam Rockwell is a great actor and this is one of his craziest but strongest roles.Overall this is the smallbudget masterpiece you'd come to expect. David Gordon Green has a way with giving his characters an emotional core. You come to sympathize for them no matter their flaws. This is just outstanding art that explores characterization to the deepest. With a strong script and engaging story this is a film every film geek should watch. I rate this film 910.".

Stuffed to its seams with idiots this world may be but there is often at least a fair chance that a movie rated over 7 is worth one's time. Agreed? Well... not so here.From its very beginnings S.A. is mired in a claustrophobic narrative progression devoid of any definitive development from which it never quite recovers thanks to its perfectly listless screenplay.In this very movie we are told at some point that sometimes we do things we can't explain. Indeed having watched this movie in its entirety you'll probably be saying the same of your time spent trying to work out why anyone bothered going to the trouble of making a motion picture from such a rambling pointless and ultimately disengaging collection of takes  all bundled together under one biworded title.Unfortunately for us  the movie's hapless viewers... S.A. is a plodding exercise in banality punctuated at randomuneven points throughout its duration by certain potentially salient observations and events that the viewer might believe are central to the plot of the movie such as that guy is weird or a child shouldn't be left in the car like a dog or hey I was just thinking we should go out because I've a new job etc. In most movies such a comment might form the basis for some plot steering. But not so here... For each time such happens the viewer may at first think that finally he's found something which is core to the screenplay and might disengage his mind from staring repeatedly at his watch to concentrate on events which might just promise to deliver some form of entertainment. Yet each time the viewer is soon after left disappointed by an incessant directorial return to the same plodding nothingness which permeates throughout this movie's screenplay. For this is a movie which teases far more than it ever delivers.That being said the acting is mostly very good which is in perfect contrast to S.A.'s bland screenplay. The movie is stuffed full of realistic and plausible dialogue for which the viewer need not suspend belief for a moment. It's all boringly too real in fact. To someone who needs a movie which requires almost no suspension of belief  well... here is your movie  except that watching a motley bunch of forgettable characters and rambling takes is not exactly my idea of fun nor time well spent.Of all the movies I'v watched this would definitely be in my top 10 of those where it would be almost impossible to say something about it which could possibly spoil the enjoyment of someone who has yet to see it. For so much happens of such little consequence between so many people that it all ultimately amounts to nothing but a waste of the viewer's time in trying to concentrate on same.If this is some people's idea of 'exciting' or even 'engaging' watching I dare to say that such persons are very much mistaken. What a waste of time  unless that is you have a very boring life! Admittedly there might even have been some interesting moments in this meandering  pointless movie but it's almost as if anything with the slightest potential to be interesting was just glossed over by the director in the race to put the next scene before the viewer's eyes. How not to make a movie 310".

Here's what I do know. You won't see a more depressing movie this year and as the film lacks any meaning you won't find a more fatal combo. This ensemble piece would have us believe that every adult living in the small town in which the film takes place has nothing but problems causing endless unhappiness. Story primarily follows Beckinsale and Rockwell high school sweetheats who are now separated. Rockwell is a totally unlikable character who moves between alcoholism depression selfhatred and religious foibles. I could never figure out why Beckinsale was with him. She's the type of girl who always escapes this small town dreariness and winds up in LA or NY usually on the arm of some millionaire. That being said anyone paying the slightest attention could even see the tragic end coming from the first or second scene. Also the happy relationship between the two teenagers gives us a hopeful ending that contradicted everything else in the film and was dishonest. The only thing we could reasonably expect is that they too would wind up as unhappy as every adult in this picturesque yet miserable town. The acting was the only thing that saved the film from being a total disaster. Sometimes I wonder whether the indie film movement exists so that films like this can get made. While it is true that some of the great films of the last 20 years have come out of the indie scene there needs to be some limits on uberdepressing films that illuminate nothing more than misery. Don't be misled by some of the comments that you've read on this site and elsewhere. A total bummer.".

This movie does have some good features IMHO but mostly it seems to belong to that genre of misogynistic movies in which misery is the main though uncredited character. Just not my cup of tea but to each his or her own.The acting is on the whole fairly good with a special standout performance by Sam Rockwell as Glenn. But the characters are drawn so unpleasantly that it's very hard for me to feel much sympathy for any character over the age of 17. When I think about it that's an interesting datum but that agedivide doesn't seem to be a theme to be explored at all in this movie it's just a coincidence. But generally the movie seems to be driven by a desire to depict any and all adults as unappealingly as possible. That to me doesn't make for a very engaging movie and does make for a very unpleasant script.There are some nice scenes and some interesting camera technique ... such as focusing on a face and then slowly drifting left or right till the face is out of the picture even though the character is still at the center of a scene. I think that makes for some interesting camera work but of course the execution really reinforces the generally misogyny of the movie ... and if the movie doesn't like its own characters enough to treat them with greater respect why should I? I do think there's much to be said for tragedy as a genre ... but this almost seems the opposite in a way because tragedy always treats the tragic hero or heroine with some sense of honor decency and respect. This movie depicts largely selfinflicted misery and seems intent on an absurdist treatment of such misery that is far from respectful or humanistic but rather dystopian and disrespectful.To anyone thinking about seeing this movie unless stories about unappealing people wallowing in selfinflicted misery is inviting I would recommend a pass on this movie.".

We follow two stories  Laura played by the ravishing Fanny Valette is a 19 yearold philosophy student committed to Kant and to rationalism in the midst of a pietistic household which to put it mildly does not share her enthusiasm for philosophy as his pious sister remarks philosophers take aim at their target and hit the bullseye  problem is they're aiming at the wrong target. So taken is Laura by Kant that she imitates his daily promenade every day at the same time...unlike Kant however Laura's stroll happens to lead her past the door of the darkly handsome Algerian clandestine immigrant alongside whom she works as a janitor in the evenings. The rest is not hard to predict but Abdou's direction is always restrained subtle understated. There is never a moment in which here characters' words or actions ring false. This is by the way one of the best portrayals of philosophy I have ever seen in a film  we often see Laura in her philosophy class where a Derridalookalike prof discourses  rather eloquently  on freedom versus the law in Kant. This stuff actually matters to Laura but the Law she is concerned with is of course the law of the Torah. Can freedom be reconciled with obeying the Law? That's Laura's dilemma and Albou treats it with dignity yet without sententiousness.The other main focus of the film is Laura's older sister Mathilde played in an award deserving performance by Elsa Zylberstein. Married with four children she is deeply pious and sure of herself until she discovers her husband's been fooling around. Her only solace then is the ritual bath and she seeks sexual advice from its wise attendant in order not to lose her husband. It would have been easy to treat this scene as slapstick but instead it's done with the greatest respect for the characters involved  Mathilde who is afraid of losing her modesty and giving way to the dark tendencies of her soul is astonished to learn that yes according to the Torah she is in fact allowed to touch her husband's genitals. Watch also for the lovely scene where Mathilde asks for sexual advice from her mother the excellent Sonia Tahar. Every dialog rings true and the superstitious mother who initially comes across as a domineering harpy is revealed as a woman of depth and dignity  not because she evolves or sees the light but just because we get to know her better.This is a deeply humanist film set against a background of the utmost contemporary relevance a synagogue is burned and a group of soccerplaying Jews is attacked by a group of masked thugs . It's impossible to come away from this film without a deeper understanding of and therefore respect for an entire aspect of Sephardic Jewish culture from a feminine point of view".

	schema:headline " Bringing the conflict to France";
	schema:reviewBody "La Petite Jrusalem 2005 written and directed by Karin Albou was shown at the Rochester High Falls Film Festival as Little Jerusalem. The title refers to the section of suburban Paris that is inhabited by firstgeneration Jewish immigrantsmost of them from North Africa.The MuslimHebrew conflict has apparently been transported to France where each group is suspicious ofand hostile towardsthe other.Two Jewish sisters are trapped in conflicts. The older Mathilde Elsa Zylberstein is a wife and mother residing in a modern developed country but still living under marital rules and customs brought from her native Tunisia. She realizes that there are problems in her marriage but doesn't know where to turn for help. Seeking formal therapy would be out of the question. Instead she receives counseling from the attendant at the mikvathe ritual bath. This pivotal supporting role is portrayed beautifully by Aurore Clment. Another brilliant supporting actor is Sonia Tahar who plays the girls' mother.The part of the younger sister Laura is played by Fanny Valette. Laura is a brilliant philosophy student who works at night as a cleaner at a school. She falls in love with a young coworker from the Muslim community with predictably problematic results.This film could not be more timelyas I write this review the immigrant communities in France primarily Muslim have risen in revolt against what they perceive as discrimination and prejudice against them within French society. Being an immigrant can never be easy. What makes it so hard is portrayed very well in this movie.La Petite Jrusalem offers a glimpse of a world most of us will never know. The district isn't very attractive and it's certainly off the beaten path for tourists. The people who live in Petite Jrusalem have to cope as best they can. This film shows how they go about this precarious balancing act. It's a wonderful movie and is definitely worth seeking out. In French Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles.".

	schema:headline " A Philosophical Exercise Is Warmly Humanized by 2 Orthodox Jewish Sisters";
	schema:reviewBody "La Petite Jerusalem Little Jerusalem is a French intellectual exercise that manages to let feelings come through. Unlike Eric Rohmer's static arguments about mind vs. desire as between two middleaged guys in Claire's Knee here the clash of philosophies is demonstrated through a year in the intimate daily lives of two Orthodox Jewish sisters.While the intellectual discussions are very didactically presented through these two incredibly naive but very intelligent women the very frank portrait of life in an intensely religious North African immigrant community which debut writerdirector Karin Albou comes from is moving. The older sister Mathilde Elsa Zylberstein represents the unquestioning rule follower of formal religion. She's married with four children but has evidently never experienced nor knows anything about orgasms and she seems to have had no formal Jewish education as she just parrots lines about faith in all powerful Hashem and knows the rules of kashruth and going to the mikveh for the monthly cleansing ritual which we see full frontally but not much else. She is atypically isolated from the usually close women in her community who could provide her information and support. Hers seems a peasant Judaism.The rebellious younger sister Laura a very appealing Fanny Valette is some sort of nonmatriculated philosophy student but is also teaching and working as a cleaner. She follows to the letter first one than another secular philosophers' dictates including celibacy as rigidly as her brotherinlaw headofthehousehold is apparently following the daily prayers weekly Shabbat and seasonal rules of Judaism. Her intellectual rigidity leads her to reject the handsome Jewish medical student who comes to her for philosophical tutoring because he is too interested in the romantics and because her mother encourages the relationship with superstitious charms. The widowed mother's faith in magic is posited as a third way along with the warm love of her children that is challenged but never wavers.Both sisters are faced with a heart breaking crisis of romantic passion in their lives that their philosophies don't seem to be able to reconcile. Sorry but it is beyond ludicrous that every woman in the household is mystified that the younger feels a certain stirring when a young handsome darkskinned Arab looks at her and it's too bad that we learn so little about him except that he too is an intellectual who is torn about being a rebel within his family and culture. But I saw that each just matured and learned that their views were immaturely narrow and illinformed. They hadn't realized that for thousands of years folks have been reconciling human nature with intellect and finding a way to live with both as gently pointed out by their mentors. Each learns to bend while finding strength in their individual beliefs in unpredictable ways.The best part of the film is the realistic depiction of celebration of the Jewish holidays amidst multicultural life within the crowded les banlieues surrounding Paris very comparable to neighborhoods in Brooklyn NYC where we also saw romantic tensions in Lila Says Lila dit a and Games of Love and Chance L'Esquive. The film opens with tashlich the symbolic discarding of sins for the new year moves on to the celebration of the Torah in Simhat Torah and on to Purim. If this was an American family we'd see a seder and menorah lighting but here Passover and Hanukkah are represented simply as special synagogue services. Here we also see the antiSemitic violence that has threatened French Jews since the Intifada spilled over into Europe which I haven't seen in films before. It is very ironic that this Tunisian Jewish family is as much refugees from North Africa as their Muslim Algerian neighbors who reject them.".

You get inside their lives rites routine family life status of each member machismo religion vs. reason sexuality taboos one would think would have fallen in the XXI century urban decay how little philosophy students earn even in the first world  and so many other topics that would be tiresome even to read.The film is fun to watch it's very easy to relate with the characters from Todeschini's very believable Ariel ! to of course Zilberstein one of the most beautiful faces in French cinema and Fanny Valette simply startling. Aurore Clment exudes classy intelligence as in all her roles. In here her role is pivotal albeit small. Religion is not opposed to pleasure. Thus she makes things change for good.Elsa did a classy prostitute with a hidden heart in Tenue correcte exige 1997 thus showing here how big is her actoral range. The only aspect I wasn't very convinced of was Djamel and his family. For starters I just don't see him as a good romantic partner for spellbinding Laura. Maybe it's that she's more amenable to our western idea of beauty and success at work. He on the contrary seems to do nothing but stalk at her at nigh like a serial killer. We hear he says he was a journalist but we get to know nothing about him besides he's got a bigot family. And quite stupidly he takes her without seemingly having asked before if she would be accepted. The Arabs are shown as narrow minded as the Jews only in a more brutish manner. One of the little phrases that matter is Laura's What did you do back home. Everybody was something else presumably better before coming to a Paris really off the beaten track us tourists love to watch. Franois Marthouret a staple of classic French cinema portrays a very solid philo teacher. Engaging intelligent and fun. You really want to enroll in a College course afterwards! I have to admit Kantism seems a tad rigid but definitely not so asking ourselves the eternal big questions justicelaw vs liberty how much can we attain by reason alone what is our duty and so one. By the way I am surprised a College teacher has to wipe floors and clean schools at night shifts for a living in the first of first worlds. Again the film doesn't shy away from showing real life. But what sets it apart is the vivid portrayal of the Jewish ritual both the male's everybody drinking toddling their altars including the kids and drinking Vodka heavily and female's Mikva very interesting water as purification as usual but with a twist. The other one I liked was the families gathering on Sunday banging their feet and emitting shrill voices just like it must have been in the tribes 2000 years ago. Enlightening how so much remains the same while only a few things have changed.Enjoy it and take care of your loved ones! PS Another aspect I liked was how both Djamel and Laura suffered when they had to repress their feelings passions or just lust.".

The tension between the spiritual Jewish life and the temptation of sexuality deeply felt by the two sisters one married and one not and up to a certain extent the relationship between the younger sister and the Arab Muslim coworker are depicted in a direct and quite effective style.

Lumet had used Fellinis set decorator and Antonionis photographer and as Sharif said it was not quite Fellini not quite Antonioni and not quite Lumet.So Metro panicked recut it without Lumet and did not release it to cinemas.

	schema:reviewBody "Buttonedup divorce lawyer in Italy still living parttime with Mom spies a smoky beauty on the streets just outside of Gucci cuing composer John Barry to drum up an intensely romantic theme in the background. These two are obviously destined to meetbut she may have an impure past which prevents wellintentioned men from marrying her. Movies such as The Appointment are easy targets for critics looking for something to ridicule.

	schema:reviewBody "Federico falls in love with Carla but is not sure wether she is a prostitute or not. And he has got to find out. Beautiful slow paced movie. A little silly with the salutes in italian and the dialogue in english though but I'll survive that. The name of Sidney Lumet in the opening credits made me watch the whole thing. And I didn't regret it at all. I liked it a lot.warning spoilers don't read this unless you've seen the movie.I thought this was an interesting movie. All the characters in it only give hints of the truth since they are too embarrassed or afraid to say it out loud. The people in it are having difficulties understanding eachother and so are we trying to understand them. Everything is done in silence which opens up a big mystery. This wouldn't be a movie if the characters in it were more frank and to the point. But since they are shy proud and embarrassed it becomes interesting. There are a couple of scenes that you can interpret in many different ways. Especially the ending. It's one of the better most disturbing endings I've seen. It reminded me a whole lot about the ending in the pledge with j.nicholson. The ending doesn't kill your curiosity on the contrary you are even more interested about the truth after the movie has ended than while it is going on. I don't know if the ambiguous ending is deliberate or if it's just poor directing. Anyway it turned out great wether it was intended to be that way or not. I thought about different interpretations of the ending 1 Carla was never a prostitute and federico had been wrong all along on suspecting her. The 100000lire prostitute was really someone else. 2 Carla was a prostitute but the woman on the phone only told half the truth by saying that she had had an accident but was coming back. She could easily have found another woman afterwards to take carlas place.Federicos reaction about this phonecall is also hard to interpret possible cases1 he was convinced he had been wrong all the time. 2 he was convinced carla was the girl and he got annoyed when he heard the woman on the phone saying she still wanted to see him knowing it was a lie. 3 he didn't care anymore about wether she was the one.Anyway I had never heard about this movie before I saw it but I really enjoyed its brilliant ending. A big part of me wanted to see a more ordinary ending where u get all the pieces together but that movie would have been forgotten quickly this one stays longer in your mind.Another interesting topic of this film is Federicos reason for so desperately searching for the truth. I think he had different reasons at first he probably just wanted to sleep with her and was simply curious. Later it became an important issue to him since he felt jealous as being her husband. Anyway a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone familiar with Sidney Lumet's best work Serpico Dog Day Afternoon Network etc. will know of his meticulous attention to character depth and plot detail.  The Appointment has none of this. Rather than tell a story Lumet instead takes his shot at making a stylish Europeanish sort of art film complete with sullen closeups highangle shots and carefully constructed compositions perhaps just to see if he could do it.  Some of it comes off rather well I liked the longshot of Omar Sharif trudging dutifully away down a hospital corridor while two nuns hurry in the other direction and a sequence at a fashion show that features a cluster of models dashing in and out in various costume changes and hair styles including one in the flapping and swaying of butterflies is almost worthy of Fellini.  Almost.  On the other hand a shot of the two lovers in a field pulled back and upward into the high distance until the couple is drowned out by the island they're on goes on too long and is less effective.   I wonder what Lumet is trying to accomplish there by obscuring the lovers and placing the entirety of the island squarely within the picture frame.     There is very little dialogue in the film everything is inferred and gently disturbing.   I think Sharif and Anouk Aimee are fine in their roles but what is a little offputting is the coldness and sterility of the affair and their movements even during passionate scenes.   When the tragic moment occured toward the end I felt nothing.   I give Lumet an A for effort and I must admit I was fascinated by the whole thing but fascination doesn't neccessarily equal enjoyment.  This movie puts me in mind of Woody Allen's Interiors for all its emotional distance.  And as Woody himself once said about Interiors it's an interesting failure.".

Some of the camerawork along the streets of Rome reminds you of Boorman's Point Blank 1967 or Goddard's Alphaville 1965. It has a pointless helicopter shot of the lovers in embrace in an open field which six years later was used with great elan by Arthur Penn in another existential story Night Moves as the final shot in that movie. The film has no semblance to the typical Hollywood cinema of late sixties it is closer to European cinema which Boorman was able to capture quite effectively with existential dilemmas presented on screen. Lumet went on to make much more memorable films one of which was Equus.The story of a doubting lover a jealous husband has been presented on screen several times. It is an Othello story retold. Omar Sharif's lead role appears plausible but he seems to overdo every detail. His cigarette smoking scene was meant to be a picture of nervousnessyet he is rarely seen smoking during the course of the film. Lumet seems to overlook details. Or is he teasing you?Anouk Aimee is great to watch because she is so good looking not because she acts wellat least she is not convincing in this film. What is her relationship with the young man on the island? Lumet makes us wonder with the meaningful shot of the man's face on the second trip of the couple to the island. We are left guessing about Aimee's true character even after the end. Everything is open ended except for the Othellolike lead character. Probably this was the reason for the film being nominated for the Golden Palm at Cannes. Lumet succeeds in fleshing out the male character but fumbles with the female lead character. Perhaps it was his intention to leave us guessing.The film remains a puzzle a good effort that pales in comparison to Lumet's better works like Equus 12 Angry Men and the Verdict.".

Like others have commented if you saw this with no knowledge who made it I don't believe anyone would be able to guess Sidney Lumet was the director. This is a completely European film in style and content. Some beautiful cinematography and lovely Italian locations are the main recommendations also a supporting performance by Lotte Lenya as a procuress. Her character is not all that evil despite her admission that she was a fascist and supporter of Mussolini but no other actress could so effortlessly bring a touch of the sinister than Lenya did just by showing up. The main problem with Sharif and Aimee is that other than not being the most expressive of actors though they sure look good their characters just plain do not act like real people would  they both seem damaged and the screenplay makes them behave in ways that make one long to slap them both. Still I enjoyed the leisurely pace and 60's fashions and ambiance enough to be glad of the opportunity to see this warped love story.".

The fact that MGM who did not have any faith in the film acquiring any successful word of mouth upon release which I find in my opinion to be rather obvious that it very well could have achieved success rather than not gaining much of a release at all although Lumet received a Palme d'Or nomination at Cannes which today on that strength with audiences for film now the releasing studio would have felt much more guaranteed a strong theatrical release. And to rip out one of John Barry's with Don Walker most inspired and right on the mark themes and music scores when shown on television it was replaced with a rock score by Stu Phillips shows the ultimately perplexing hypocrisy of the film business always being recycled as an art form. The editing Thelma Connell photography Carlo di Palma and acting is all superb.

He was mysterious in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA wooden in FUNNY GIRL and here he just looks lost. I'm in a good mood so I won't make any jokes about his moustache. But he seems totally disconnected from everything going on around him.Strike two is a Jewish man from New York trying to be very European. Nobody understands New York city as well as Lumet. Woody Allen runs a good second but Lumet has the edge here.The wooden stake through the film's heart though is actors who are not native speakers of English trying to speak a language not their own. That creates so much distance that meaning and nuances of speech get lost.And clothes from the 1960's look ridiculous today. Just watch the original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR to see how styles have changed.It would be interesting to see how Lumet feels about this film today. If I've seen a mention of it in the many articles about and tributes to Lumet I don't recall it.".

Sharif looks very Mastroiannilike but certainly does not have the charisma his role warrants. Aimee wanders the streets of Rome in a depressed fog.

This ranks right up there with Woody Allen's September in the category of Great Directors Directing Badly. It was one of the exceptionally few films that after a certain point I have said what is the point of watching any more? and switched it off. The words turgid glacial boring and pointless come to mind. None of the main characters is interesting nor engages the viewer's interest in any way. The story line moves with the alacrity of molasses in December. Even a key plot development like the revelation of Fendi's lawyer friend that he suspects his fiance Carla of being a high priced prostitute is revealed with all the dramatic tension of the quotation of the price of pork belly futures on the commodities market. What is evidently supposed to be Fendi's growing romantic fixation on Carla comes off more as the onset of a severe case of constipation and intentionally or not Omar Shariff conveys an overwhelming sense of pusilanimity in Fendi's character. Nothing moves nothing advances nothing happens. Nice atmospheric shots of Italian street life though. Avoid this like poison.".

Although he has not managed to overcome the obvious handicap of dubbed and postsynched dialogue especially with the support players he has pulled off some marvelously inventive even showy by his standards sequences including a fantastic helicopter pullback on to the island and a fascinatingly long tracking shot through the hospital corridor. Atmosphere in fact is the film's strongest feature. A fine music score helps. On the other hand he script is somewhat tenuous. It concentrates on Sharif and Anouk. Fortunately their delivery is okay and they thus manage to keep and hold our interest despite plot digressions and the generally slow pace. Lumet uses his Italian locations most effectively though the photography in the print under review is a little on the dark side  and not altogether flattering.".

Because he was not only able to imitate the look of his idols many great actresses and singers from the 30s to the 60s. He could also  imitate the voices of the women. In the film he plays a gay character which he really was who shares a flat with a schizophrenic woman and makes his unbelievable shows at the evening. Craig Russell died too early of AIDS and he made only two films Outrageous and the sequel.

The film opened in Manhattan during the early fall of 1977 without so much as a trailer or publicity of any kind...just word of mouth. Within one week people were queuing up in droves to see it! Not coincidentally Craig Russell the film's star was staging his brilliant one man show A Man And His Women right around the block from the cinema. This masterful stroke of showmanship made him the toast of Manhattan. Outrageous! is a film about human relationships and acceptance...of loving supporting and encouraging those people whom you care about. It's filled with character studies that are rich and evocative. Craig Russell was truly a genius. He was in my opinion the greatest female impressionist of all time. By utilizing his own vocal talents facial expressions and simple makeup and costume changes he would transform into Mae West Talulah Bankhead Bette Davis Judy Garland Carol Channing or Peggy Lee to name but a few so seamlessly one would easily forget they weren't witnessing the genuine article. His one man show A Man and His Woman  which played at Theatre Eastin Manhattan allowed audiences to see the true extent of his talent that was only touched upon in the film. Outrageous! is a film that dramatically changed and enriched my life. The film should be restored and reissued both theatrically and on DVD. It sends a profoundly positive message that should be passed on to future generations.CheersR. Stephen Weber Burbank CA".

	schema:reviewBody "Bittersweet story of a hairdresser in Toronto who becomes a drag star sort of and his friendship with a schizophrenic girl trying to start a life away from her mother and hospitals. As played by Craig Russell and Hollis McLaren we see two fragilebutbelievable characters struggling to find themselves in New York City.McLaren's character of Liza has been released after years in a mental ward. She's still defiant and wants to experience life. She moves in with Russell in Toronto and has ups and downs and ends up pregnant. Russell is drawn to performing in a local club and loses his job giving him the excuse to pursue his drag act full time eventually moving to New York. After Liza loses her baby she follows Russell to New York and realizes that the bone crushers she often hallucinates have stayed behind in Toronto.The main focus though is Russell as he prepares for and then performs his act. He channels Tallulah Bankhead at the drop of a hat and with a series of wigs and quick changes he impersonates Bette Davis Joan Crawford Carol Channing Pearl Bailey Ella Fitzgerald Bette Midler Ethel Merman Marlene Dietrich Mae West Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland. The Midler is not great but the others are pretty much spot on.Best of all is is a fulldress Peggy Lee singing It Ain't Easy. This is Russell's best act and the song is terrific Paul Hoffert wrote it. It also bring us to the marvelous and surreal ending when Russell still in full Peggy Lee drag tells Liza that she's not crazy just special and that she must simply be herself embrace her madness and make it work for her. He tells her we are all mad and then teaches her to do a deep Bankhead laugh saying maaaaaad maaaaad.Also in the cast is the very funny Richert Easley as Perry a wouldbe drag queen who has a passion for Karen Black. As he's begging Liza for the loan of a dress he grabs one out of the closet and she tells him that's my best dress. He looks at her and opines This is your best? Also in the cast are Helen Shaver as a lesbian friend.A word must be said for the wonderful music by Paul Hoffert who in addition to It Ain't Easy also wrote Step Out sung by Cecille Frennette.".

Hollis Mc Laren is AMAZING in her role she rips your heart out. Definitely should be part of any gay movie collection. I question the label... this is 2006 after all and personally I am tired of labels. Why can't we all just love? Let's have a Whatever Pride Parade! Craig Russell demonstrates the bravery inherent in the early proclaimers of the gay movement but his message speaks to everyone be yourself and society be damned!

We never expected nor intended a sequel be considered when the original first few books of short stories were published. One reviewer says Margaret was bipolar Margaret's way of removing the stigma of schizophrenia. The term did not exist 40 years ago! From her adolescence onwards she had been hospitalized on a few occasions. During our marriage on several occasions Margaret went off her meds to prove she did not have schizophrenia with ensuing issues and shortterm hospitalization to get her back on her meds. Comments by the other reviewers are interesting and mostly heartfelt. Craig became an excellent female impersonator. He would practise in front of a mirror of course and in front of his circle of friends. At the time I knew him he never considered nor discussed serious acting. He liked performing. This explains why in the TV programme Streets of San Francisco Craig did not act. He did the voiceovers for all of the singing of the female impersonator character. With regards to his impersonation of Mae West Craig was her personal secretary for a period of time. This was well before his drag career. 40 years ago is a long time to remember details.".

The final bike jump is like something out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon acme physics at work.I know German cars are well built but the beating all these Mercedes take in that movie is just hilarious ! And they still roll ! Alison King is cute but she can't act. But hey what can you do with such a stupid script ? If you have 90 minutes to waste like really really waste then this movie will do that for you.But they will be wasted forever no refund so think about it !".

Of course the plot is not very realistic which action movie is? Everything is exaggerated to make it more exciting. But compared to many other action movies the plot is cleverly constructed and makes sense. There are even some humorous elements  like the way this young man tries to hold on to good manners in the midst of chaos or the scene where a police commando storms the workshop of the young man's uncle who thinks this is about unpaid parking tickets. I have no explanation for the sharply negative comments on this page. It could be that the English version which I have not seen yet is much worse than the German version but I doubt it. I also don't understand the complaint about German police not speaking in their native language. But this may be due to the fact that in Germany all foreign movies are dubbed and therefore I am used to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie doesn't even have enough laughs to be in a worst film festival. The plot as near as I could make out was an innocent man wrongly accused of being a super assassin so clever she thinks she can coerce a man into doing something that would require a spoiler to tell you how stupid it would be. The assassin has killed all the witnesses against some important rich guy on trial except for one. She tries to make this guy kill the last witness for her. There's too much that is worse about this movie to go into the flaws of the plot. First the movie is car chase after chase. Bond movies got away with car chases because there were plenty of cutaways and the chases weren't overdrawn. Some movies like Road Warrior gave us open top vehicles with wild costumed people inside and intriguing backgrounds such as the desert. The reality is car chases are boring because motor vehicles are boring except to red necks dorks and yokels who've never seen a car I suppose. And nothing is more boring than watching cars driving speeding wrecking who cares down boring city streets. Then there are some characters whose English cannot possibly be understood the blonde girl enunciates so bad she probably utters two words that a viewer can interpret. Just go ahead and put subtitles on instead of let them speak gibberish! And every stereotype scene you can imagine is in here. The actresses are so bad they make the lame actors look like de Niros in comparison. It is truly impossible to watch this film without fast forwarding most of it particularly the dull car chases that seem to take eons. When you see the last witness finally led on screen and you're hoping that this stereotype isn't there be prepared it is and I dare you not to groan. The film tries to work on a juvenile level but fails even there. Someone could make a poll what is worse in this movie the writing acting or directing? I propose that we make captured terrorists watch this film until they crack. I don't care if it's inhumane beyond all reason. It would put this celluloid to good use.".

	schema:headline " Makes the remake look like a bad joke SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "It is impossible for me having been exposed to The Birdcage first to not compare the original and the remake. Almost from the word go I sensed a great disparity within the two films even though the remake ended up being and uninspired copy and paste writing job. The first thing that lends itself to creating a different tone is the music composed by Ennio Morricone. The music in the Birdcage by Mark Mothersbaugh and Jonathan Tunick is forgettable seeing as I've seen the remake three or four times and can't remember a single note while I've seen the original once and can still remember Morricone's score.Ennio Morricone's gentle music takes us into a world that we shouldn't be afraid of. The key word to thinking about his music is sensitive. It exudes softness tenderness which is aped by the action and the actors who are not ridiculous characterizations but with real people and real emotions. Due to the fact that all scenes include practically the same dialogue it is a huge complement to Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault that they made their characters more threedimensional and real than Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.The American interpretation of this film is also vastly different than the French. Due to the fact that this film deals with homosexuality which is a topic that still is tinged with taboo here Americans have to turn the film into a farce of a farce. In other words the movie has to be ridiculously over the top to be accepted. The pathetic part of the remake is that it perpetuates stereotypes and while the stereotypes do exist for how do stereotypes come into being? by merely making them more human we can see beyond a stereotype to the person portrayed. A perfect example of this is the opening scene. They are the same in both films. Renato Armand in the American version tries to get Albin Albert onto the stage to perform his act. In the American version Nathan Lane makes his character seem like a whining melodramatic painintheyouknowwhat because of this the scene is very funny but emotionally superficial. In the French version practically the same dialogue is spoken but because of the way Michel Serrault delivers his lines and because of the more subdued expression he has on his face the words take on weight. They have meaning they come across as real concerns for the relationship as opposed to a paranoid delusion and an excuse not to go on stage. It made me believe the affair was a possibility all over again and made me forget about the son and his impending marriage.The deception of the possibility that Renato is having an affair is aided by the son's appearance. In the American version he was cleancut and Ivy League here the son in full 1970s look long hair included.La Cage aux folles in 1978 even in France was a more progressive film depicting a gay relationship a gay couple who had raised a son and how the couple still had to pretend in certain social situation while longing to be completely honest. By 1996 in the United States homosexuality was not such a hot topic of controversy yet a slapstickesque context is the only way the mainstream will be able to accept gay characters. Dramas about homosexuals are sole dominion of the art houses.This is a film that does something very difficult to do. It takes a situation that is rich with comedy and imbues it with humanity and warmth. Making this a layered comedy which is something rare regardless of the country the film is made in. Le Cage aux folles is a really fun film which takes a serious look at human relationships and society's perception of people's lifestyles without putting any one down or getting preachy. It's a lot of fun.".

In the American version Nathan Lane makes his character seem like a whining melodramatic painintheyouknowwhat because of this the scene is very funny but emotionally superficial. In the French version practically the same dialogue is spoken but because of the way Michel Serrault delivers his lines and because of the more subdued expression he has on his face the words take on weight. They have meaning they come across as real concerns for the relationship as opposed to a paranoid delusion and an excuse not to go on stage. It made me believe the affair was a possibility all over again and made me forget about the son and his impending marriage.The deception of the possibility that Renato is having an affair is aided by the son's appearance. In the American version he was cleancut and Ivy League here the son in full 1970s look long hair included.La Cage aux folles in 1978 even in France was a more progressive film depicting a gay relationship a gay couple who had raised a son and how the couple still had to pretend in certain social situation while longing to be completely honest. By 1996 in the United States homosexuality was not such a hot topic of controversy yet a slapstickesque context is the only way the mainstream will be able to accept gay characters. Dramas about homosexuals are sole dominion of the art houses.This is a film that does something very difficult to do. It takes a situation that is rich with comedy and imbues it with humanity and warmth. Making this a layered comedy which is something rare regardless of the country the film is made in. Le Cage aux folles is a really fun film which takes a serious look at human relationships and society's perception of people's lifestyles without putting any one down or getting preachy. It's a lot of fun.";

It was funny uplifting gay positive and made me realize there is nothing wrong with being gay. Seeing it again over 20 years later it's not as funny or uplifting as it once was but I still enjoyed it.The plot is old hat and the movie is directed by the numbers but the script has some very funny lines and all the performances are great. Particularly funny are Michel Serrault as the more feminine gay man and Michel Galabru as the minister of moral order. The final dinner party sequence is absolutely hysterical! Some people have said this film has stereotyped gay characters and that Serrault's constant screaming is annoying. I disagreeI found nothing offensive about the characters there are gay men like SerraultI've met them! and his screaming is actually pretty funny. A very good French farcewell worth seeing. Ignore the R ratingit only has that because of the subject matter which was pretty risky for 1978. If it were rerated today it would easily get a PG13.Skip the two sequels and the Americanized remake The Birdcage in which they use the exact same script as the originalwith all the same jokes and some bad new ones added in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Already considered a mainstream cult classic La Cage aux Folles ranks as one of the biggest crossover boxoffice hits ever to land on American soil. And for very good reason.   Italy's Ugo Tognazzi and Gallic Michel Serrault are the most inspiring and oddest couple to appear on screen since Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and just as entertainingly colorful as Siegfried  Roy!Tognazzi essays the role of Renato a suave successful overthehill cabaret owner whose nightly drag revues spotlight his longtime partner Albin who goes by the stage name Zaza a touchy temperamental hopelessly mincing diva who has got to be seen to be believed.  A neurotic wreck most of the time Zaza Serrault is a fulltime job for the exasperated Renato needing constant coddling and stroking when it comes to her age she's up there figure a deep fondness for chocolates hasn't helped and affairs of the heart they are celebrating their 20th year anniversary but the invariably jealous AlbinZaza is sure Renato is playing around while she's performing.  Getting the insecure Zaza on stage every night usually includes your usual number of psychoanalytical sessions shoethrowing tirades and prescription medicines.The fun begins after Renato's son Laurent conceived during a temporary moment of heterosexual abandon you should try everything once informs his father of his plans to marry  a girl!  The daughter of a staunch rightwing bureaucrat whose political party is in the midst of a shocking moral scandal Laurent is obligated to introduce her priggish parents who think a big traditional wedding could restore the party's reputation to his straight parents.  The fiancee has passed them off as a respected cultural attach for the Italian embassy and a Catholic housewifemother of six.The resulting farcical setup unleashes a barrage of priceless comic moments as the pair must not only refurnish their gayly luxorious apartment which is right above the nightclub but pass themselves off as heterosexuals.  The crme de la crme of all scenes takes place at a restaurant where the somewhat more virile Renato instructs Albin how to drink tea butter toast and walk butch  la John Wayne!  The dinner party segment too is absolutely crammed with riotous sight gags especially the eroticallydesigned soup bowls and shoeless butler bits.The cast is impeccable.  Serrault and Tognazzi are to be cherished for pulling off such an acting coup.  Under normal circumstances these two roles could be hammy forced and quite offensive.  But in the hands of this pair they are not only funny but credible and even touching.  Serrault in particular is a marvel with every gesture tone and vocal inflection coming from a real emotional center while Tognazzi's  charming boulevardier provides the perfect straight man to Serrault's antics. Together their I am what I am message really hits home.  You believe these two as a couple. You believe their longevity.  You believe their spats.  You believe their devotion.Michel Galabru and Carmen Scarpitta are superb as the strict moralminded parents who slowly come to the horrifying realization that all is not right with their prospective soninlaw's family.  Benny Luke has some wonderfully outr moments as the gay couple's barefoot livein French maid who dusts the house in skimpy hot pants and very little else.  Claire Maurier is effective as Laurent's estranged mother who tries to get back in Laurent's good graces by agreeing to be part of the dinner party charade.  Two lesser sequels and an abominable American remake cannot tarnish the beauty of the original.  WARNING When renting this video make sure you rent the version with subtitles not the inferior Englishdubbed version. Much of Michel Serrault's magic is in his voice.".

But I would agree that the second half was a lot more funnier than the first. Never the less. Serrault is excellent. But he's not alone so is Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Galabru. I love that guy ever since as a kid I watched him in the Gendarme series with Louis DeFuns.Excellent musical score by Ennio Morricone.

	schema:reviewBody "The issue between this film and its American remake The Birdcage is not whether the second film glossed over the issues of homosexuality. French culture in 1978 simply did not allow a diplomat's daughter to marry the son of a nightclub owner regardless of whether or not the nightclub was a drag club or not or regardless of whether or not the diplomat was the secretary of the Union for Moral Order. Molinaro's point about Albin as a drag queen and Renato as his partner was made quite well and several of the scenes where Albin goes straight are quite funnybut they weren't really the point of the movie. But this film couldn't be PERFECTLY remade retaining all of the original facets of the French movie. Mike Nichols couldn't possibly have made a comparison about the two cultures clashing in the film in 1996 America. ANYWHERE in 1996 America for that matter not just South Beach Florida. If you criticize the movie on those grounds it's not quite fair. Molinaro's original was made to amplify the horror of the culture clash by using a gay pair as the groom's parents. Nichols' remake is meant to ONLY accentuate the fact that Armand and Albert are liberally gayflagrantly soand not that they aren't in Kevin Keeley's class. The original is better for audiences who want something deeper and more meaningful in that sense but it doesn't mean that the remake is any worse for it. La Cage is less of a farce than Birdcage and that was intentional. I give both about the same ratingthat is excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many Americans I saw the remake Birdcage first. Only recently did I get a copy of the original. La Cage aux Folles is a great comedy well deserving of its praise and classic status I just wish I had seen it before I saw Birdcage.The reason is through no fault of the original French filmmakers and actors the American remake is one of the few films that did a good job of suiting it for American audiences. They got some of the most recognizable and endearing actors and they really played on the humor of America's brutal division between Conservatives and Liberals. In other words it hits home.La Cage carries more of a nostalgic distance in the fact that it's both European and an older 70s film. Like watching Casablanca you can get engrossed in the film but you never quite picture yourself in context ...especially when you keep thinking of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane who both did an excellent job of staying true to the original characters played by Tognazzi and Serrault.OK enough irrelevant comparisons. I just wanted to get that out first in case you're pondering whether to watch La Cage or Birdcage first. Definitely start with La Cage.La Cage aux Folles is simply fabulous. With a screenplay by Francis Veber whose pinpoint comedy and wit makes him a modern day Moliere you can't go wrong. Gags are handled with the perfect finesse even the corny slapstick ones. The scene where Michel Serrault is learning very unsuccessfully how to butter his toast like a real man had me howling. I can't imagine how Ugo Tognazzi could keep a straight face.Other memorable gags happen throughout the film and whether you're French American or Martian you've got to understand the universal language of comedy. Serrault's high pitched yelp gets my vote for funniest and most infectious sound uttered by a human since Homer Simpson's D'OH! The story itself while purportedly being about drag queens of loose moral character haha is safe clean and absolutely fun for the whole family. Sexuality aside it's simply a classic comedy of errors that anyone can enjoy.".

She was unapologetic about not wanting to raise a child. In this day and age of slow moving public acceptance of gay couples and hopefully one day gay marriage I found this challenge to the stereotyped notion of motherhood to be more refreshinglyshocking than the gay issue. I barely remember how they explained the mother in the American version I believe the parents had been married and were divorced and the implication was that the mother was in the sons life I might be misremembering. Not all women have this maternal instinct that society insists they have. I was happy to see a successful career woman with no regrets for her choices.I'm glad that they tried to hit on gender issues class race AND issues of sexuality instead of just focusing on one to the exclusion of all others.p.s. it reminded me a of Ang Lee's Wedding Banquet  I wonder if he was influened by this film or maybe trying to appear straight to appease traditional parents a common issue that many people have had to address.".

	schema:reviewBody "So flamboyant decadent  and truculent  La Cage aux Folles or Birds of Feathers in Shakespeare's language is one of the sweetest and most delightful synopsis' of French Cinema a gay couple one's son who wants to marry the daughter of a rightwing conservative whose political reputation is severely tarnished by a sexual scandal at the end two setups that brilliantly culminate during a memorable dinner where the two gay men must pretend to be straight. That's Birds of Feathers a sumptuously designed magnificently orchestrated and superbly acted FrenchItalian comedy. And I insist on the FrenchItalian branding because the dual nationality shows in every detail. The director is French Edouard Molinaro who specialized in comedies of errors BUT the setting is a beautiful rendering of the traditional Comedia Del' Arte with this underground ambiance that lets our warmest and craziest fantasies bloom the time of a night.  The film is in French language with a mainly French cast BUT it possesses an incomparable Fellinian flavor exuding from the atmosphere of the titular burlesque cabaret 'La Cage aux Folles' a circus of zaniness where transvestites parade jovially and naturally in an oasis of freedom disclosed from the worlds' conventions.  And naturally there's the iconic tandem that 'made' the film the Italian Ugo Tognazzi and the French Michel Serrault two icons in their respective countries the Alphamale and the eternal clown. One of these exquisite ironies is that Tognazzi was renowned for his macho roles but he gave his most defining performance as Renato Baldi the cabaret manager and companion of Albin aka Zaza Napoli.  And as Zaza Napoli Michel Serrault reaches the peak of his comical talent providing his most hilarious performance rightfully awarded by a Csar French Oscar. His pairing with Tognazzi is not just the typical funnyguy and straight man duo so to speak but something more poignant or melancholic always endearing. Indeed as we watch them arguing and reconciling we never doubt that these men lived for 20 years and that they love and care for each other.This is another point to insist on because it will probably raise the most criticism. The complicity between Serrault and Tognazzi is crucial not only because Tognazzi took the role that belonged to Serrault's alltime partner Jean Poiret who cowrote the original play with the famous screenwriter Francis Veber but also because the contrast between the two men is the key to appreciate and enjoy Serrault's overthetop performance.Yes Serrault acted like a drama queen or capricious diva but wasn't he annoying for Renato as well? Or the whole 'Birds of Feathers' crew for that matter? It is possible that Birds of Feathers is dated campy or have this 70's vintage feel that didn't embarrass itself with conventions and stereotypes. And this is an argument I don't want to get sucked into for a simple reason the very remake made in the 90's in an era that wasn't deprived from political correctness used the same concept the same acting and the same stereotypes because the director Mike Nichols understood that Albin's personality was the very device to make the whole intrigue believable.And that's to the credit of the screen writing would you believe an effeminate man like Albin could pass as a virile John Wayne's like figure or maybe would it be more believable for him to impersonate a woman? Granted the film isn't Tootsie and belongs more to the Some Like it Hot category still any crossgender story requires some suspension of disbelief. And there is something absolutely irresistible in the couple formed by Renato and Albin and their interactions with Renato's son who's just announced his intent to marry  a girl. If Albin is adorable by overplaying his maternal side leading to the ultimate disguise Tognazzi deserves also a mention as the restrained figure of the film a man who easily passes as a macho figure when compared to Albin but doesn't fool anyone. And the reason to be of Birds of Feathers blossoms during such hilarious moments where Renato teaches Albin how to act like a man to smear butter in a toast and not make a fuss over it getting pierced Serraults' highpitched reactions oh the humanity! to walk like John Wayne and so on and so forth. And the dinner is so full of moments where you expect the worst to come and get even funnier when the masquerade works. Not quite so though when the soontobe fatherinlaw played by Michel Galabru notices some Greek men in weird position in the plates or Renato is startled by a sudden champagne pop the comical timing is so perfect it would have made Billy Wilder jealous.Now is the film better or not than the remake? Well it's not better simply because it's the original but because there's something more crafted in the film the directing of Molinaro made of slow and suspenseful closeups and tactful zooming and traveling served by a joyful music from Morricone gives the feeling that we're immersed in a whole new world. The film was Oscarnominated in 1979 for Best Director Best Costume Design and naturally Best Screenplay. And I guess Veber's name would ring a bell to movie fans for the writer is responsible for some of the cleverest and funniest French comedies of the last thirty years.There are a few improvements in Mike Nichols' Birdcage especially in the father's character that was enriched through the performance of Gene Hackman but overall there's something classy that screams 'classic' in Birds of Feathers which fittingly became one of the most successful French film of the 70's winning the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.Birds of Feathers is to savor without moderation like a good Pistachio Macaron from Castel or gluttonously munch on like a toast with strawberries jam... God forbid you ever pierce it!".

	schema:reviewBody "At first sight Cherry Falls is one of the many harmless teen slashers that came out in the late 90s and early 00s in what was called the horror revival started by Scream back in 1996. While the movie can't hide the trademarks of its generation and it is definitely not very original it offers some new twists to traditional clichs of the genre and a higher quality than the rest of the slashers of its time. Also it is fair to point out that the movie we know as Cherry Falls is not what its director Geoffrey Wright conceived originally. It suffered several cuts to attain an RRating losing most of its planned edginess.The story is set in the small town of Cherry Falls where suddenly a mysterious figure begins to kill the virgins in town. Sheriff Brent Marken Michael Biehn is specially concerned about the case not only because he knows that his beloved daughter Jody Brittany Murphy is virgin but also because the case brings back memories of a dark event in Cherry Falls past. Meanwhile the local teenagers organize a huge party to have sex and stop being potential victims.Written by Ken Selden the story mixes dark comedy with the horror genre pretty much in the vein of Scream using a clever twist to the genre clich of the virginal survivors. The mystery of the killer's identity is very well handled and the story unfolds as Jody's investigation takes her to discover the town's past. Surprisingly the movie never gets boring or tedious and it serve sits purpose as a thrilling mysteryhorror film.However the film promises too much and there is never a proper payoff. Director Wright conceived his film as a comedyhorror about sex and violence in the genre but the severe cuts the movie received took away all the sex and violence the director intended to portray leaving an incomplete product that is really unsatisfying. This severely hurts the film particularly at the finale which is sad because it is really a very well crafted setpiece of nudity and violence that is badly edited to please the prudish MPAA.Geoffrey Wright follows a subtle style for the most part of the film and according to the script it was done that way because the killings were supposed to be gory. Again with the edition of this it left the film incomplete with scenes that build up very good suspense without a payoff. The suspense is broken with badly edited cuts that lead to the belief that a lot was missing.The main cast is very good particularly Jay Mohr as a concerned teacher who is truly worried about his students. Brittany Murphy is very good in the lead role is quite believable as a common teen girl something not all slashers can say. The rest of the cast do a very good job but nothing really outstanding outside the leads.Cherry Falls is a sad testimony of what further edition to a completed job can do. It certainly turned a promising great movie into an slightly above average horror film. Hopefully a Director's Cut will be available someday but by now Cherry Falls remains as a movie that could had been a lot better if it had remained true to its director's vision. 610".

I was never quite sure if I was watching a comedy or a slasher or more specifically if the funny bits were actually meant to be funny. Having watched it again I now realise it was done with tongue very firmly in cheek. That said it still has some genuinely scary moments but they're just icing rather than cake.There is a certain genre teenshockcomedy that Hollywood seems to do really well at recently and this is another example. A fine cast good balance of comedy and thrills just enough gore to keep you satisfied. It's a formula that works well and a tribute to the artists that freshness is maintained.My advice is ignore the plot and revel in the humour and artistry. This was never intended to be a cult horror film. It is a fun movie and should be judged according to entertainment value. It's a film to easily amuse when you don't have the energy or enthusiasm for life's drudgery. And if you're a Murphy fan don't miss it.UPDATE Following the sad passing of the young lady who since I wrote the above went on to become my favourite actress ever I urge you to watch this movie if you haven't already. Brittany Murphy is simply irreplaceable as a person and as an actress. She never got the credits she deserved in life so I hope Heaven treats her well. There will never be another like her.".

Michael Biehn seems merely to be going through the motions and his eyes never change from the glazed expression he sported in 'The Terminator'.  One actor Keram MalickiSnchez has a spark of originality but even his efforts are wasted in a film this bad.The plot is a bundle of cliches an empty high school a mouldy old disused house.  It even steals note steals doesn't pays homage to doesn't reference steals unashamedly from such classics as 'Psycho' as the killer dresses up as his deadmissing mother. It could be perhaps forgiven if it was referencing in a 'Scream' sort of way but there are no knowing winks or nods to an intelligent audience.Another problem the editing.  The editing and visual effects are not at all good like the rest of this film.  For exampleat one point our heroine and exboyfriend are running away from the killer through some woods.  He falls flat the camera cuts to a different angle and he is suddenly almost on his feet!!  Terrible editing.  Some camera effects seem to be thrown in just for good measure when the deputy hears that her Sherrif has been killed the camera goes into jerky slowmo for about three seconds!! Whats the point!! It has no effect when used in this way!!  Grr.Throw in a some truly fake and OTT screams some massive character inconsistencies some random bits I still don't get when the principal is killed he has 'VIRGIN NOT' scrawled on his forehead with a knife. Someone shoot the script writer and you have a movie that is worse than the sum of it's already terrible parts.NEVER watch this film unless you have already had a lobotomy.110 no reason for the 110 but imdb won't let you vote 010".

Sure I can appreciate the classics like Halloween and the original Friday the 13th but they were never top of my list. And the postScream era has blown it all. Since this movie everybody thinks they can make a horror film. The only thing they need is a few good looking girls who can yell very loud and a stupid outfit to give to the killer. This is kinda also the big idea behind CHERRY FALLS but compared to most others there are several good aspects and twists in this one. The story for starters... The killer's targets are exclusively virgins. This of course give a lot of opportunities to insert all sorts of humor. shy girls computer geeks who never get laid slutty girls It's all pretty predictable but it works. For example I laughed pretty loud when some character said about another   She thinks Fellatio is a characters in a Shakespeare play As most films in the genre the film tries to be as violent as possible I was one of the lucky ones who saw the uncut version. If you're planning to see it try to get your hands on this version.The story develops pretty well. The killer's background gets revealed bit by bit and it's scary enough to keep you interested. A few good twists too I may say. Cherry Falls stars a few very decent actors. Michael Biehn  always one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood IMO  is very convincing as the sheriff who discovers the truth behind the gore murders. His teenage  virgin of course  daughter is played by Brittany Murphy. She gained fame and fortune lately by starring in that stupid Eminem film and a few others. She wasn't that famous yet when she did Cherry Falls so I could enjoy her part. Her boyfriend  named Kenny  looks a lot like a young James Spader. So if they wanna do a remake of Secretary withing 15 years they know who to cast... I also recognized a dumb looking DJ Qualls  Road Trip The New Guy The Core I think this guy is doomed to play the nerd for the rest of his life. Oh well... In general Of the thousand stupid slashers who got released over the past 8 years this certainly is one of the best. You'll forget about it pretty soon but it'll sure give you 90 minutes of fun and violence.".

Pointed out in Scream whenever you have sex in a horror movie you mark yourself out as a victim however here the twist is that virgins will die and those having had sex will live.  The film is quite enjoyable and has the odd tense moment but quickly falls into line with every other horror clich in the book  right down to the big twist over the killer's identity and true to Scream it's a big leap!The film is a little modern ironic but doesn't get much mileage out of it. More interesting to me was the angle that in this day of AIDS and STD's those HAVING sex were actually protected while those saving themselves and being careful were actually risking death.  I'm not sure if this angle was thought of when making the film but it didn't get any significant air time or comment  I guess the film only wanted to be ironic or post modern if it didn't involve any thought or effort.  That said it still sort of works even if it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the teen slashers but then what does?.The cast are soso.  Murphy is OK in the lead and Biehn is a familiar face as her father.  Jay Mohr has a small role but happily isn't awful.  The rest of the teens tend to fall into high school stereotypes of jock nerd joker etc and only really serve to be victims rather than characters.  There are no really gory moments but there are lots of quite cruel ones which happen just offscreen but are no less horrific for it.Overall the film is OK but can't really do anything intelligent with it's unique twist.  I knew it was clever to do things like this but the film gets no mileage out of the wider ideals AIDS etc and quickly falls into being a standard teen horror movie complete with shadows twisty end and so on.

The systematic killing and marking of this killers victims is really a nice break from the insanity. The fact that the killer is targeting virgins is puzzeling i cant figure out why only virgins. But as the story unfolds it becomes clearer. The VIRIGN NOT carved into the Principal's head is kinda telling. It is the killers one break in consistency it shows hes finally getting to the point.

The systematic killing and marking of this killers victims is really a nice break from the insanity. The fact that the killer is targeting virgins is puzzeling i cant figure out why only virgins. But as the story unfolds it becomes clearer. The VIRIGN NOT carved into the Principal's head is kinda telling. It is the killers one break in consistency it shows hes finally getting to the point.

For that thought I was not totally disappointed but because I had that thought the movie was also enjoyable in some weird ways.The story is about a killer who is slashing virgins from a local high school. After 'Scream' 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it is not the most original idea. The movie rips all kind of ideas from those movies. The whole slashing high school studentsconcept from 'Scream' a visit to a very quiet place from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' a scene with a certain aggressive artifact hitting a door from 'The Shining'. It didn't bother me much because it was all ridiculous anyway. All the clichs from the movies above the same kind of characters a revealed secret and of course the killer you never thought it would be.Like I said the whole thing was kind of ridiculous. There were scenes I really enjoyed because of the stupid events on screen. One of the scenes involves a whole group trying to lose their virginity at the same time on some kind of party. You think it is nonsense which it is but scenes around that event are quite funny. I had the idea it was made that stupid on purpose to give the movie some kind of comic release but my guess is there were better ways to do that. The comedy in a movie like 'Scream 3' works better although the movie wasn't that much better. In this movie sometimes it succeeds if that was the goal of the scenes. If it wasn't I still enjoyed that parts so it didn't matter much anyway. If you are going to watch it just think you will see absolutely nothing at all and you might enjoy it a little.".

Im not sure if the director is having an off day or if the cast are  but Wright is unable to get anything more than mediocre performances from the cast . Check the scene where the sheriff walks into class after the first two murders have been commited  its difficult to believe the usually competent Michael Biehn has ever had an acting lesson in his life as he delivers his lines with the passion of a speak your weight machine . As the rest of the direction in the movie its very flat .The script by Ken Selden is both dumb and unoriginal . A lot of people on this site have compared it to SCREAM but I doubt if the two are comparable . CHERRY FALLS lacks the post modernist humour  wit and originality of SCREAM and Im not even sure if its meant to be a darkly comic movie . The script shows signs of underdevelopment and contains several major plot holes . For example after the first murders the pathologist examines the bodies and realises the female is a virgin but its never explained why the authorities conclude the murders were carried out because the victims were virgins . Perhaps the biggest plot hole is this  How on earth would the killer know his victims were virgins ? Go back to your own teenage years and youll realise theres nothing more unrealiable than school gossip especially if it involves the sexual habits of school mates .Never listen to gossip and dont watch CHERRY FALLS unless youre addicted to teenagers getting stalked and killed by a knife wielding looney".

Really the plot is predictable the acting except Jay Mohr and Michael Biehn is wooden and then there are plenty of mistakes made by no less than Geoffrey Wright.The movie has difficulties to decide which sort of film it should be. There are parts that are a bit scary there are parts that are a bit funny except one dialogue that really is funny a officer says 'Sorry kids I must hold my position I can't split' and then comes the maniac and splits him in the first sense of the word there are parts that tend to be somehow erotic and finally there are parts that tend to show blood. But the one who watches it because he wants to be frightened doesn't get what he wants nor the one who wants to laugh nor the one who wants to see hot scenes nor the one who wants to see gore gets what he wants.So nobody gets what he wants and everybody will come out of the theaters still 'hungry'.And then there are many scenes that really look cheap and it certainly isn't a question of budget.I hope Geoffrey Wright's next movie proves that 'Cherry Falls' was only a wrong step of his and not that 'Romper Stomper' was a lucky achievement.".

But the one who watches it because he wants to be frightened doesn't get what he wants nor the one who wants to laugh nor the one who wants to see hot scenes nor the one who wants to see gore gets what he wants.So nobody gets what he wants and everybody will come out of the theaters still 'hungry'.And then there are many scenes that really look cheap and it certainly isn't a question of budget.I hope Geoffrey Wright's next movie proves that 'Cherry Falls' was only a wrong step of his and not that 'Romper Stomper' was a lucky achievement.";

Jay Mohr which isn't an actor that I like delivers a fine performance as the two face teacher.The death scenes are actually very good and have some decent gore. The ending is also nice but not that shocking as some might think.Cherry Falls follows the Scream style but with more character development and best situations.

Ben Affleck has a small but a very funny role. JK Simmons hardly does anything wrong about his acting. Others are good in their context.The best thing about Extract is that the humor is maintained throughout the movie. It's neither cheap vulgar comedy nor downright stupid comedy. The comedy is an elaborate mix of these two poles and that's why this movie is like able. All the characters seem to be performing on a high wire and carry themselves very naturally. There is never a dull moment taking into account the short running time. Besides the soundtrack is so cool. Really lovely songs.Overall Extract is a good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "In some sideways alternate universe I'd like to believe Mike Judge is a Judd Apatow or an Edgar Wright which is to say a modern comedy director whose upcoming projects are actually followed with any degree of anticipation. Of his two previous liveaction films Office Space for its flaws has a special place in my heart and I appreciated Idiocracy more than most. So along comes Extract a subtle straightforward comedy about the little things in life. You know inane neighbors workplace politics sexual frustration male gigolos and horse tranquilizers.Okay maybe it's not all that subtle but Extract is less boisterous than Judge's previous films while retaining their biting sardonic banter and oddly believable caricatures. Probably the reason the director's work hasn't caught on with mainstream audiences is that their stories and characters are always paramount to their gag writing which in turn gives them a comparatively low jokeperminute ratio.The plot itself isn't as interesting or ambitious as Office Space or Idiocracy respectively but the terrific casting and lowkey performances keep Extract charming even when its story falters. Particular scenes and sequences sag around the middle of the film and the plot lines never dovetail as well as they probably could but the narrative while simple is strong enough to shield the film from ever becoming an outright bore. Judge's respect for his storytelling transcends the temptation to pack the film with gimmicky gags or disposable pop culture references which is refreshing in comparison to the blisteringly unfunny and now highestgrossing Rrated comedy of all time sequel greenlit The Hangover. Jason Bateman of Arrested Development fame returns as another corporate mogul though of considerably less affluence than Michael Bluth and the role unsurprisingly fits like a glove. It's not exactly a retread for the actor either who exhibits an empathetic vulnerability that hasn't existed in his previous roles.Extract's Joel Reynolds is an interesting antithesis to Michael Bluth in that he offers a completely opposite take on the pragmatic modern businessman. Michael is a man who assumes his hardest work has yet to come where Joel considers his dues paid and at the outset of the film is looking to sell his plant and embrace an early retirement. Joel is indicative of Mike Judge's greater analysis of the American working class and reminiscent also though not in a derivative sense of Peter the protagonist of Office Space in that both characters long for a life outside of the workplace. Michael Bluth wants to work Mike Judge's characters have to work.The rest of the cast including Mila Kunis as a conwoman catalyst J.K. Simmons as name challenged manager and Ben Affleck as a worldly hipster doofus all perform admirably. Extract is its cast and there isn't a bad performance in the bunch.Judge's latest is a film that really needs to be taken on its own merits. It's a warm entertaining if unambitious film that may not be as funny as some expect but is never unfunny if that makes any sense. If you're not laughing it's because the film isn't trying to make you laugh which is almost a foreign concept in modern comedy and sure to leave some audiences cold. That being said there isn't much reason to rush out and see the film either. If you're interested in something somewhat more mature when The Hangover 2 hits theaters Extract will make a pretty good rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Awkward situational humor has really been the staple of all of Mike Judge's films and TV ventures besides the immortal Beavis and Butthead and his latest effort Extract is really no different. The viewer I'm guessing is supposed to laugh at these situations and just take it from there allowing the actors to feel around. This takes the emphasis off the actors and more on the story and therein lies the problem. Extract is a comedy built for one thing and written for another and in the end it becomes a mildly yet forgettable movie.Extract is so obviously written to be the next Office Space which will forever remain Judge's crown jewel as far as films go. The situations are awkwardly funny yet there really doesn't seem to be a balance to most of it. Judge's newest is rather repetitive in its approach  Joel goes to work is unhappy. Joel comes home is interrupted by his annoying neighbor. Joel goes to the bar. Ben Affleck says something witty. Mila Kunis looks hot. The film continues down this path aimlessly not really offering to build up any suspense as to what could happen with our characters until a really useless event in the plot causes the movie to end. It experiments with a bit of character development in the lead role of Joel but everyone else is either a clich someone who is not worth developing or a plot device.You'll notice that I said the film is written to be an awkward situational comedy and it clearly is  however the comedians cast in parts are not really meant for these kind of roles. For some Jason Bateman Dustin Milligan it works and they fit their characters well. For others Mila Kunis Clifton Collins Jr. both actor and character seem out of place like they belong in a more slapstick or more vulgar andor stereotypical comedy. The real plus comes from Ben Affleck who is hilarious just about every time he graces us with his presence while Kristen Wiig is VASTLY underused. Clifton Collins Jr. is great as well while Mila Kunis is almost as out of place as she was in Max Payne. If anything this film has the most random cameo of all time from Gene Simmons.Maybe Judge has lost his touch though I doubt that because he has a great cameo in the film as well...but his writing is done in a way that it feels like he's building up to one huge punchline that never comes. Don't get me wrong most people will have a few chuckles and smiles at Extract but with Judge's name on it you'd expect it to be a bit better than the occasional laugh and grin. It doesn't know whether to be absurd as some characters and jokes are or the awkward comedy that Judge is so great at doing.To put it simple Extract lacks the strength of plot relatability and character development that Judge's previous works have had. Joel is no Peter from Office Space. Ben Affleck's character an obvious rehash of Deidrich Bader's character from the same movie is the one saving grace and even he isn't good enough to stop this from becoming nothing more than a mediocre comedy that's best saved for a DVD rental.".

Well it seems that making a great comedy can be like waiting for a lightning strike.Extract is not at the level of Office Space but it's still very funny. Jason Bateman plays Joel the owner of an extract factory 'extract' is in flavoring like vanilla extract. His sex life has become nonexistent and some problems are arising at the workplace. He's tempted by the arrival of a gorgeous temp Mila Kunis who also happens to be a thief and con woman. He finds himself hanging out at the office with his buddy Dean Ben Affleck who advises him to hire a gigolo for his wife. This sounds like a terrible idea until Dean gives Joel a horse tranquilizer which seriously impedes his judgment.And much hilarity ensues.The cast is terrific including those named above and Kristen Wiig as Joel's wife JK Simmons as Joel's partner Dustin Milligan as Brad the gigolo and David Koechner as the neighborhood bore Nathan. Gene Simmons has an excellent small role as Joe Adler a local ambulance chaser who advertises on bus stop benches.The film takes some unusual twists and turns and on the whole offers a lot of laughs. It does not hit the heights of Office Space but after the dreadfully dull Idiocracy it makes for a nice film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Extract is the new comedy which is written and directed by Mike Judge from who made some films that weren't too successful such as Office Space and Idiocracy. They have both became cult hits on DVD but they were both flops when they were originally released. I loved these films just because of how truly hilarious they are. You can imagine that Extract would be no different.The basic plot is about Jason Bateman's character who owns a factory where they make Extract and he wants to sell it. After an accident occurs the company might get sued which would bankrupt them and he wouldn't be able to sell the company. There's a subplot involving Jason Bateman having problems with his wife not sleeping with him played by Kristen Wiig from SNL so Ben Affleck who plays his bartender friend convinces him to hire a gigalo to sleep with his wife so that he could cheat on his wife with Mila Kunis's character guiltfree. We also know that she's a con artist who is trying to get the company sued.The plot of this movie is quite a mess. Some parts could have definitely been cut down and others could have been expanded on for this to be a much more effective comedy. I thought anything involving the gigalo was hilarious and that includes the actor who played the gigalo and Ben Affleck. Both of their deliveries really help to sell their lines and most of the times that I would laugh in the film it would be to these two. J.K. Simmons was also very funny as one of the factory workers who couldn't remember anyone's name.I still think that Mila Kunis didn't even have to be in the movie and she just expanded the plot. She could have at least had a smaller part involved more in the gigalo plot rather than a whole other subplot about her blackmailing the company. If we would have seen more of everything else it would have been a stronger movie.Jason Bateman was basically just playing the straight man. Also I thought that David Koechner played the part of the annoying neighbour perfectly. Every time he was on screen it looked like he was making everyone uncomfortable and I was constantly cracking up at that even there wasn't anything too funny about his lines. Him and Ben Affleck probably made me laugh the hardest.I don't think Extract can actually be called hilarious in fact it's even somewhat disappointing for a Mike Judge comedy. I have to admit that it was very funny but it was probably more amusing than hilarious. It's just not going to be groundbreaking like Office Space was. It does work as an interest companion piece to Office Space but it is no where near the quality.I have to give Extract a 7.510. It was very funny but it had the potential to be better. Still this is a slight recommendation or at least a rental and it is still worth seeing because it's still far better than some of the other comedies that are coming out these days.".

I didn't expect this movie to be funny either. OK so it is not funny in a way like a comedy sit com is funny jokes are not laughable. This movie has dark humor it is situations and what happens to people that makes it comical and even tragic.Main character Joel is the owner of an extract factory that he built from scratch with hard work. He is having some marital problems his wife is not having sex with him anymore. In the meantime a young attractive temp Cindy gets hired as an employee. Joel turns to his bartender friend Dean a very comical role by Ben Affleck for advice who talks him into hiring an amateur young stud Brad to seduce Joel's wife. If his wife gives into temptation then it is only fair for him to do the same a seemingly logical way to guiltfree cheating.I really enjoyed this movie and it somewhat reminded me of American Beauty maybe because it was about problems of classic suburban families. It successfully portrays flaws of people such as prejudice sexual temptation addiction greed ambition career aspirations and being intrusive and most of all miscommunication. I am really sorry that people didn't enjoy this as much as I did. If you can view this without any expectations you may find that is a quite remarkable film and definitely deserves a rating higher than 7.".

I mean I seriously can not remember once that more than a smirk appeared on my face.The ads didn't help me see this in theatres nor the Mike Judge name attached despite he made one of my all time favorite comedies Office Space. In addition even though I love Jason Bateman and J.K. Simmons they weren't a draw for me. I simply waited for video and a recommendation from a friend. On the flipside I can't say this movie was horrible it just wasn't at all good nor funny in the least. I almost forgave the blatant character ripoffs from Judge's other comedy Office Space  they even had the same mannerisms and lines! But what I couldn't forgive is the wasted talent and time the main stars are throwing away.Take for example Bateman who had his comeback a few years back with films like Hancock and Juno and granted with fame comeback heroes generally will just make about anything for attention and a buck. UhTravolta? Battlefield Earth Michael or just about 70 of anything past Pulp Fiction. Next we see the strikingly gorgeous Meg Kunis. She's only going to look like this for so long. Pick smarter scripts even comedies. And definitively don't drive down MeganFox Lane. Finally J.K.'s forgiven as he seems to be always that number three or lower cast member despite the fact he's always good.A quick snip of the plot line PhonedIn Bateman stars as Joel who built his extracting business from the root up and apparently read on people he hires. The typical worker humor scenes ensure and Joel wants to sell. A scene I'm guessing to be funny and even if it were hilarious it was ruined by the trailer has idiot coworkers causing an accident deformation and as usual without remorse one of my pet peeves even when its fictional. Oh and in addition Joel's not getting any at home and spends more time bromancing Dean Affleck of all people.To confuse the plot more stop here  seriously slapstick comedies such as this need to keep it simple. Once you go past 3 or more subplots you lose your target audience as well as any sign of a box office. Extract's no exception.they throw in a poolboyprostitute in which they don't even cover up the Desperate Housewives ripoff a bunch of drug scenes that Bateman did NOT take advantage of for potential comedic scenes and a lone criminal who's trying to well extract as money as she can from a company run by monkeys and injured worker who mimics most primates.Will it all work out in the end? Who really cares? When it ends you'll probably spend more time shaking your head than laughing. Especially that offwall ending. A movie this solely reminded me off despite the stolen Office Space characters was the 150 better Election. Watch that movie. Even after a decade Election with a lot of the same principals but much more smartly developed holds up extremely well. I can imagine this one not only forgotten soon but simply disappearing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best comedians do not laugh at their own jokes. Instead they let the audience laugh. The new Mike Judge movie Extract qualifies as the kind of low yield humor movie that maintains a straightface throughout its 89 minutes but lacks a tenth of the humor as Idiocracy. Judge looks like he told everybody to behave like nothing funny was happening in his absurdly insane bit of nonsense. Nobody gives a bad performance in this comatose comedy.Extract is neither a laughoutloud comedy nor a Beavis  Butthead wet dream. The scenes are subtle with humor. The characters are complete cretins from the protagonist Joel Jason Bateman who owns and operates a flavor extract factory with the most nitwits that you will ever see. Judge treats Hispanics exceptionally well while he is not so sympathetic whites. Into the marginally sane world of Reynolds Extract comes sassy Cindy ass hot sexy Mila Kuniswho looks like she walked out of a wetdream and knows it. The first scene where Cindy sasshays out of a guitar shop with a 3000plus electric guitar while two smitten sales clerks are away getting her another guitar is a hoot.Extract is largely a hoot itself but it doesn't like to toot its own horn. Ben Affleck who seems to be taking time off from starring in movies to playing supporting roles is Dean the best friend that Joel has and can trust. Dean is a bearded bartender who tries to help Joel solve his problems with controlled substances like horse tranquillizer and marijuana. He takes Joel to see one of his stoner buddies who smokes pot out of an eightfoot bong. It seems that Joel has not been getting laid by his frigid wife who puts on the sweat pants at 8 PM and refuses to give it up. Clifton Collins Jr. is cast as Step an incredibly idiotic redneck who loses a testicle in a hilarious factory accident that plays out like a Rube Goldberg stunt. The plant itself is basically a convey belt run factory with employees putting bottles of extract into boxes and moving them around the premises with a forklift.Kristen Wiig is Suzie the wife of the protagonist who does the moronic pool cleaning stud fifteen times. Initially Joel pays Brad Dustin Milligan to have sex with Suzie while he tries to score with Cindy. Actually Cindy is scoring with Step and trying to get him to sue Joel and his company for restitution for his lost testicle. Kiss vocalist Gene Simmons plays an accident shyster who represents Step it in his law suit against Reynolds' Extract. The funniest guy in Extract is David Koechner as Nathan an obnoxious neighbor that Joel and Suzie struggle to avoid at all costs. He means well but he is a complete nincompoop. Don't leave your seat until you have seen the two scenes during the ending credits. You may smile a lot occasionally laugh but you will not laugh out loud.Extract is nowhere as much fun as Idiocracy was.".

I'm a big fan of Office Space but maybe that was part of the problem that I was expecting something of that caliber. This is definitely not up to par I think that any of Office Space's worst jokes is easily funnier than one of Extract's best jokes if there is such a thing. Where to begin...I am also a fan of Justin Bateman he was the man on Arrested Development and had a couple of other good roles lately but really he just flat out disappointed in this one. No emotion whatsoever guy. Mila Kunis was equally disappointing though it was mostly her character  story and not her acting it basically went no where. The story is awkward and trying to be funny but I dunno... the best analogy I can think of is having a magician on stage pull a rat out of his hat and expect an applause afterward only to hear crickets instead. The only possible reason I can think of to recommend this movie to someone and mind you this is a pretty sad reason is to watch Affleck play a mildly funny  notgiveash!t type of character. Couple of chuckles but nothing great. Last but not least a couple of comments to others from reading the forums 1 I cannot possibly imagine why anyone would want to watch this more than once 2 Seeing people defend this movie claiming that they are either too dumb to get it or that the movie must be made for people of higher intellect.... seriously?

	schema:reviewBody "From the mind of Mike Judge Office Space comes Extract a movie about the mundane daily struggles of Joel Reynolds Jason Bateman. Joel is the owner of a flavoring extract plant where he is forced to babysit his mismatched and unmotivated employees and dreams of the day he can sell the company off and stop working altogether. His wife Suzie SNL's Kristen Wiig sits at home depressed and lonely while Joel struggles to make it home before the eight o'clock deadline when she puts on her sweatpants and all hopes of coitus are squashed. A conwoman Mila Kunis comes into the picture hoping to capitalize on a pending lawsuit against the company as well as catching Joel's eye. Not knowing what to do he turns to his drugpeddling bartender friend Ben Affleck who in turn suggests he hires a gigolo to have an affair with his wife so he can go forward with his own affair guiltfree.If it sounds ludicrous and overthetop it is. Mike Judge's films always have a way of spinning everydaylife situations in the wildest ways. What starts out with the best well sort of intentions quickly spirals downward into a mess beyond repair. Like Office Space Extract is Judge's version of what happens when the everyday workingclass man gets bored and decides to do something about it. Is it meant to be a cautionary tale or simply a social commentary? Whatever the answer it works on both levels. You'll laugh at Joel's misfortunes while a little part of you feels sympathy knowing deep down that he is simply a nice guy gone wrong and that things like this although not as extreme could happen to any one of us. That sort of twisted reality is what makes a good Mike Judge film and no doubt this is another of his that is destined to become a cultclassic.Thankfully though the movie isn't so wacky that it loses its humanity. Despite some odd performances in the film achieved brilliantly by Affleck David Koechner and J.K. Simmons who with his baldhead somewhat resembles a character in one of Mike Judge's cartoons and the outrageous events that unfold the film still keeps its heart firmly in place. Granted you won't laugh as thoroughly as you might during other comedies but during Judge's fourth featurelength film you'll squirm enough in your seat during the awkward moments to know that you were delivered a solid story with real characters and humor derived from their pain and suffering. Extract is at the end of the day an intelligent hardworking and quirky little comedy that will no doubt find its audience in the years to come much like Office Space. Unfortunately the film isn't doing so hot right now debuting at 10! so I urge you to go to the movies and give it a shot. I promise you won't be sorry.".

The conflict between the two men is complicated further when a group of soldiers registered as killed in action arrive in the area and begin to involve themselves in the existing drug war.This is a good Walter Hill film that has plenty of good old fashioned western style action.  The plot seems a little strange for most of the film because you're not quite sure where it's going.  At the start you assume that the main focus of the film will be the relationship between Power Booth's Cash and Nolte's Benteen but after 15 minutes the focus shifts onto the arrival of the army unit and stays split between them and Nolte. Because you're not sure what the unit is doing in this situation it keeps your interest throughout.  However this means that Boothe is sidelined for most of the film which is a shame.Both Boothe and Nolte are good with Nolte doing his usual tough guy stuff. However the real pleasure comes from the depth of famous faces in the supporting cast.  Maria Conchita Alonso is in a thankless role as the girlfriend torn between Cash and Benteen Rip Torn is the local sheriff while the army unit includes many now wellknown faces of Michael Ironside Clancy Brown William Forsythe and a small role for the always recognisable Tom Tiny Lister Jr.The action is good throughout despite being a little flat and without any great style.  The wild bunch style ending is exciting if a little unlikely and is typical of Walter Hill.Overall a good modern day western with a strong cast good plot and good action.  It's nothing out of the ordinary but it's still entertaining decades after it was made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Extreme Prejudice is a greatunderrated 80s Action classic from Walter Hill that combines great directionaction and cast and is one of Hill's most overlooked films. A great mixture of Action and Modern Westernthis is one Hill's best films and a movie that deserves more attention from Action fans.Set in TexasExtreme Prejudice tells the story of a Texas Ranger named Jack BanteenNick Noltewho has to deal with criminals bringing drugs across the border from Mexico. Unfortunatelythe drug supplier is his old best friend Cash BaileyPowers Boothwho is not only on the opposite side of the law but also share love for the same woman SaritaMaria Conchita Alonso. While dealing with Cash BaileyJack also has to deal with a group of military men led by Major Paul HackettMichael Ironsidewho do classified missionsbut this time they're in Jack Banteen's territory and Banteen has to deal with Cash and the military men with...Extreme Prejudice.I am shocked and surprised that Extreme Prejudice has been underrated and overlooked by Action fans and Walter Hill fans. 1987 was a great year for the Action movie genre with great Action classics like Lethal WeaponPredator and Robocop also being released that year. While those three films became Box Office hits and became classicsExtreme Prejudice sadly flopped at the Box Office remains obscure but in my opinion Extreme Prejudice is one of the great Action films of the 1980s and deserves more love. and I think one of the reasons Extreme Prejudice works so well is because of the main characterAction and modern Western setting. While Walter Hill paints the main character with a bigger than life scopethe characters also have depth. The character Jack Banteen is pretty much old school Western cowboy in a modern settinginstead of dealing with just drunks and bar fightsBanteen has to deal with drug dealersviolence and his best friend. Jack has to do something about the violence and drugs in his territory and he can't have second thoughts about it. Jack wants to deal with his old friend Cash his own way whether it means doing it by the book or breaking the law. It's a simple yet complex story that Hill brings with excellence. I love the Action that Walter Hill has in this film because it's bloodyviolent and horrific. The violence and Action in the film is more in the tradition of Sam Peckinpah where the violence is ugly and brutal not like the Action films of the 80swhich I lovewhere after a violent scene it's followed by a oneliner or pun with the ending of the film is definitely a homage to Peckinpah's Western classic The Wild Bunch and you feel like when a person gets killed in the film it isn't fun or lightheartedit's grittydark and uncompromising and I guess it felt kind of out of place during the 80s because you will feel like no character in the film is safe from the violence in the air. Where slow motion in today's Action films are used to look coolExtreme Prejudice uses slow motion to show the horrifying and dangerous effects of violence. That's one of the things that separates Hill's Action films from the Action films made today. Hill keeps the film moving at a great pace and keeps you glued to the film with great storytellingmemorable characters and excellent atmosphere. Hill has always said every film he has made is a Western and that is true statement with this film. Even though the film is set in the 80syou can feel the tone of the old west through out the film with most of the characters wearing cowboy hats and getting into Western style shootouts. I feel when watching the film the movie has an almost timeless look to it where you feel like the film could've taken place in any decade or time period by the way people dress and talk. When characters step in the dirt and dust you can feel it coming off the screen and feeling like you're getting dirt on yourself. While none of the film's main characters don't have sixshootersride on horse have stagecoaches or gold coins you smell the great Western genre in this film and it's one of the reasons that Extreme Prejudice is amazing. The ending of the film is great and is filled with intense Action and brutal violence that Walter Hill is an absolute master at doing and will definitely remind viewers of the Western films of the past. It's a an excellent conclusion to the film. The whole cast does a great job with their roles. Nick Nolte gives one of his best performances as Texas Ranger Jack Banteen bringing a memorable depth and dimension to the role.Excellent performance. Powers Booth is a wonderful delight as Cash BaileyJack's old friend who's now a drug lord. Booth's scenes with Nolte are amazing. Michael Ironside is terrific as Major Paul Hackettthe man who leads his secret military group. Maria Conchita Alonso does a wonderful job as SaritaJack's girlfriend and a woman Jack and Cash both love. Rip Torn gives a fun performance as Hanka local sheriff who is also a Father figure to Jack. Clancy Brown is great as Sgt.Larry McRoseHackett's second in command. William Forsynthe is wonderful and humorous as Sgt.Buck Atwater. Matt MulhernSSgt.Declan CokerLarry B. ScottSgt.Charlie Biddleand Dan Tullis Jr.Sgt.Luther Frygive good performances as well.Walter Hill does an exceptional job with the direction with the filmbringing a grittydirty tone to the film and also does a great job with the Action scenesmaking bloodyfast and unforgettable.

	schema:reviewBody "There are films that are great because of the plot.  There are films that are great because of the star and sometimes you get a film that is great because of the star the director the supporting cast the script and it's locale.  Those are the best films out there and EXTREME PREJUDICE into that category.  Walter Hill has long since been revered as a great director by Hollywood insiders and those that know his work.  But if you are a casual fan of film then you probably have no idea who is and what he has done. But just know this the man has had a hand in films like all of the Aliens 48 Hrs and Brewster's Millions.  He is quite versatile in his genres and in his propensity to switch his duties on a film.  He directs writes produces and even executive produces.  And in all of that I believe this is his best film.  Aliens is a great film but that has to be more attributed to Cameron because he directed it.  But this was Walter's from the beginning.  And what we have here is typical Walter Hill brilliance.  It is testosterone laden a little sexist and filled with colourful characters.Nick Nolte gives what I think is the best performance of his career.  He was great in Prince of Tides but he is amazing here.  He plays an incredibly stoic Texas Ranger whose job is plain and simple.  Keep the peace and keep the drugs out of Texas.  It is the latter that gives him a bit of trouble as his best childhood friend Cash Bailey played with complete evil smugness by Powers Boothe is now a major drug influence on the Mexican side of the border.  But stoicism honour and duty win over comrarderie and memories of years past.  This is the first part of the story.The second part involves the love interest of both men.  Her name is Cerita  Maria Conchita Alonso  and both men have loved her for a long time. The issue here is does Cerita have enough love to stay with Jack and his average life or does she want to sacrifice love and go for wealth and power with Cash?The third part of the film is the best part and it is the story that involves a covert military team of supposedly dead war heroes.  Every one of the team when put into the computer shows up as dead.  One died while difusing a bomb the other in a helicopter crash and so on.  This supporting cast is one of the great casting jobs and as another reviewer said one of the best ensembles put together including Reservoir Dogs.  Clancy Brown plays Larry McRose Michael Ironside plays Major Paul Hackett and William Forsythe plays Buck Atwater.  Forsythe has the best performance in the film and this is a film that is rich with great performances.  I think the only reason that he got overlooked in 1987 was because this was a litttle scene film and Carolco was still in it's infant stages as a studio.  But if Mario Kassar or Andrew Vajna released this picture now it might get a better look and more respect but that is a different story.This covert team is apparently in Texas to get some documents that are in Cash Bailey's possession.  But what they are really there for no one knows and that includes all of the team except for Hackett.  So somehow all three stories and all of the individuals are going to cross paths until you have the final gunfight.  Now I am not an expert at gunfights nor have I seen every film out there that has great gunfights but this has to be up there as one of the best.  It goes on for about fifteen minutes and there are some really great shots of people dying and blood spraying and such.Extreme Prejudice is a tour de force in direction and it is a great script. All of the actors give some of the best performances of their career and if you can give this film a chance  it seems kind of slow at first  you will be rewarded.There are only a few reasons why you are reading this review.  One of them is that you have seen the film and you want to see what other people think about it.  Another is that you are checking out Nick Nolte's filmography and this is one the films you haven't seen or the same could be said for the other people involved in the film.  I'm sure there are other reasons but if the reason I just mentioned is why you are here then let me just tell you this.Rent this film please.  You will be very surprised and if you like intriguing characters and a great script with one of the best gunfights in film then this is one film that you should see.  It is now 13 years old but it hasn't aged at all.  I watch it about twice a year and I still get a kick out of it.10 out of 10A true hidden treasure.

	onyx:emotionText "There are films that are great because of the plot.  There are films that are great because of the star and sometimes you get a film that is great because of the star the director the supporting cast the script and it's locale.  Those are the best films out there and EXTREME PREJUDICE into that category.  Walter Hill has long since been revered as a great director by Hollywood insiders and those that know his work.  But if you are a casual fan of film then you probably have no idea who is and what he has done. But just know this the man has had a hand in films like all of the Aliens 48 Hrs and Brewster's Millions.  He is quite versatile in his genres and in his propensity to switch his duties on a film.  He directs writes produces and even executive produces.  And in all of that I believe this is his best film.  Aliens is a great film but that has to be more attributed to Cameron because he directed it.  But this was Walter's from the beginning.  And what we have here is typical Walter Hill brilliance.  It is testosterone laden a little sexist and filled with colourful characters.Nick Nolte gives what I think is the best performance of his career.  He was great in Prince of Tides but he is amazing here.  He plays an incredibly stoic Texas Ranger whose job is plain and simple.  Keep the peace and keep the drugs out of Texas.  It is the latter that gives him a bit of trouble as his best childhood friend Cash Bailey played with complete evil smugness by Powers Boothe is now a major drug influence on the Mexican side of the border.  But stoicism honour and duty win over comrarderie and memories of years past.  This is the first part of the story.The second part involves the love interest of both men.  Her name is Cerita  Maria Conchita Alonso  and both men have loved her for a long time. The issue here is does Cerita have enough love to stay with Jack and his average life or does she want to sacrifice love and go for wealth and power with Cash?The third part of the film is the best part and it is the story that involves a covert military team of supposedly dead war heroes.  Every one of the team when put into the computer shows up as dead.  One died while difusing a bomb the other in a helicopter crash and so on.  This supporting cast is one of the great casting jobs and as another reviewer said one of the best ensembles put together including Reservoir Dogs.  Clancy Brown plays Larry McRose Michael Ironside plays Major Paul Hackett and William Forsythe plays Buck Atwater.  Forsythe has the best performance in the film and this is a film that is rich with great performances.  I think the only reason that he got overlooked in 1987 was because this was a litttle scene film and Carolco was still in it's infant stages as a studio.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say anything that already hasn't been said Extreme Prejudice is a great movie with a great cast and criminally underrated. It definitely has a 1980's modern western feel in the vein of Lone Wolf McQuade but solid writing and the lean direction by Walter Hill make this film about much better than the unintentionally comical Chuck Norris flick. Extreme Prejudice is old school action and it is raw and powerful from the start until the end and there is some great dialog throughout the whole movie too...although probably only 'great' to those with a more conservative libertarian bent but what would you expect from the pen of veteran action ideologue John Milius. The acting is all class and every character you remember and has depth always a sign of a worthwhile movie. Nick Nolte plays the straight edge but likable Texas Ranger Powers Boothe is the archetypal selfaware 'bad guy' and once again my man Michael Ironside steals every scene he is in and is the perfect foil. Rip Torn is the funny Sheriff and Reagan era hottie Maria Conchita Alonso even has a topless scene.This is a quintessential film for fans of either action movies westerns or 1980's nostalgia. The movie was produced by Carolco which always meant that the action was going to be good and elaborate and this film is no exception. The Peckinpah inspired final shootout is bloody and epic and really sticks out in an era like today where soft PG13 action by guys like Will Smith or Nicholas Cage have forgotten that realistic firearms violence can add so much more to a story than CG.And now let me ask...WHEN IS THE REGION 1 WIDESCREEN DVD VERSION GOING TO BE RELEASED? It is a crime to have to watch this first rate classic in Pan  Scan especially when so many awful titles from the 1980's have gotten the widescreen treatment. Somebody start a petition already.".

Benteen's biggest problem is Cash Bailey a powerful crime lord who lives over in Mexico and who is responsible for a number of crimes on Jack's side of the border.Hill's script was written by John Milius Apocalypse Now Red Dawn so of course things quickly get political. A large portion of their film revolves around a mission impossible styled subplot in which a group of offthegrid soldiers plot to take Cash out themselves. One of the great things about the script is the way Milius juggles both story arcs and then merges them during the film's grand finale. In an age of cookiecutter action plots its nice to find a genre film that keeps us gripped an hour into the film and we still don't quite know what's going on or how things tie together.But most of all Extreme Prejudice is director Walter Hill's love letter to Sam Peckinpah. The film plays like a combination of Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia and The Wild Bunch Hill serving up brutal gun fights strained romances slow motion squiboperas and the kind of sweltering Mexican heat that Peckinpah's best films ooze. This is a film filled with men weathered and beaten by the Texan sun haunted by an inability to get things right and willing to lay their lives down on matters of principle. Incidentally the character of Cash Bailey is based on Orson Welles' corrupt lawn man in Touch of Evil. Touch of Evil was itself set on the Mexican border and featured a similar cast of sweaty gringos and snarling Mexicans.7.910  Hill's early films were visceral genre pictures several inches ahead of the curve. His later films however concede to rather than challenge the conventions of action cinema. This film is a bit different though. Skip its poor first act and ignore Milius' stupid politics the whole film is right winger's extrajudicial pop an immigrant fantasy and you have an atmospheric rift on Peckinpah's Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia combined with the apocalyptic ending of The Wild Bunch.Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " Walter Hill's Tribute to Sam Peckinpah";
	schema:reviewBody "48 Hrs director Walter Hill's modernday macho western Extreme Prejudice emerges as a bloodthirsty tribute to writer  director Sam Peckinpah. For the record Hill adapted the Jim Thompson cult novel as a screenplay for Peckinpah's superb Texas bank robbery saga The Getaway 1972 costarring Steve McQueen Ali MacGraw and Ben Johnson. You can spot some of the ideas that Hill appropriated from that memorable Peckinpah masterpiece and put into this uneven but aboveaverage actioneer. The bank robbers use explosives to distract the local constabulary while they waylay the bank and they cut the local communication lines to keep the authorities from knowing about their audacious deed. Unfortunately the problem with Extreme Prejudice is that Hill and his scribes struggle to streamline two movies into one.

	onyx:emotionText "48 Hrs director Walter Hill's modernday macho western Extreme Prejudice emerges as a bloodthirsty tribute to writer  director Sam Peckinpah. For the record Hill adapted the Jim Thompson cult novel as a screenplay for Peckinpah's superb Texas bank robbery saga The Getaway 1972 costarring Steve McQueen Ali MacGraw and Ben Johnson. You can spot some of the ideas that Hill appropriated from that memorable Peckinpah masterpiece and put into this uneven but aboveaverage actioneer. The bank robbers use explosives to distract the local constabulary while they waylay the bank and they cut the local communication lines to keep the authorities from knowing about their audacious deed. Unfortunately the problem with Extreme Prejudice is that Hill and his scribes struggle to streamline two movies into one. One plot concerns an ATeam of military soldiers deployed to perform ultrasecret missions that would otherwise embarrass the government. The second plot focuses on the relationship between the hero and the villain who were once the best of friends and are not rivals for the love of the same woman. Despite the uneven complicated nature of this contemporary western Hill has fashioned a good crime thriller that maintains attention throughout its 104 minutes with compelling characters exciting shootouts and showdowns and atmospheric settings.Extreme Prejudice casts Nick Nolte as lean mean and incorruptible Texas Ranger Jack Benteen while wolfish Powers Boothe is at his villainous best as Benteen's chief adversary Cash Bailey.

	schema:reviewBody "Walter Hill's Extreme Prejudice is a larger than life piece of southern fried shoot em up pulp that plays like a Sam Peckinpah film that's been left out in the sun too long and has solidified into a bloody nostalgic fossil. The characters who inhabit this sun drenched southern vista are more like weathered archetypes than actual people at first glance but the genius of Hill is that he always subverts that initial cartoony feeling with excellent writing pacing that demands attention and without fail he casts his films with character actors who give the story the painstaking unpretentious attention it deserves. Hill has always had a way with casting and here he composes a symphony of tough guys and gutter poetry spewing hard boiled cowboys that leaves you feeling like a shot of whiskey marinated in a deer skin sweat lodge. Nick Nolte just emerging from his pretty boy cocoon and into the second age of his career as a cold blooded tough guy plays Jack Benteen a Texas ranger attempting to rid his county of the drug pollution flooding across the Mexican border. Ironically the front runner and kingpin of the trade is his old buddy and fellow hell raiser Cash Bailey Powers Boothe who has zero intention of quitting his wicked ways even at the behest of an old friend. Boothe is an actor that the camera and mic just loves and here he theatrically inhabits the role of Cash like a white suited scorpion with a a five o'clock shadow from hell and a voice like granite slabs making love with sandpaper. Truly a memorable villain. This drug war gone personal provides a nice 'clash of the southern American Titans' style aesthetic as the two go head to head with the obligatory girl of both their dreams Maria Conchita Alonso caught in between. Just to give the plot another shot of tequila infused adrenaline there's a team of ex special ops mercenaries in town to pull off a mysterious heist that to this day after at least ten views of this film I still cannot discern what they have to do with the main plot at all. But no matter as that sub plot gives a bunch more awesome actors a chance to flex their bulldozing tough guy chops. Michael Ironside plays their leader Paul Hackett a snarling desert dog of a prick. Clancy Brown plays the level headed low key bruiser. It's a youthful William Forsythe however who steals the show as Buck Atwater a rowdy rootin tootin flippant wiseass of a merc who functions like redneck black ops version of the joker. Rip Torn shows up as a salty county sheriff as well. All of the characters eventually get swept up in a rip roaringly violent showdown south of the border with Nolte and Boothe's characters colliding like dusty fire and ice in an explosion of flesh shredding bullets booze and sweat cocktails flooding the air like smog and an old fashioned sense of Hollywood escapism aided by Hill's commitment to not only pushing the detonator on the action but giving the characters time to talk things out get to know each other and most importantly allow us to get to know them and actually care about their outcome so we damn well pay attention when they get their heads blown off in a gunfight. Highly recommended.".

Other than many movies of the kind Extreme Prejudice has an excellent cast. The story is not more promising than your average action flick but this movie scores with good violent action and great performances from actors such as Nick Nolte Powers Boothe and Michael Ironside.Jack Benteen Nick Nolte is a tough Texas Ranger who does his job near the Mexican border with a great sense of duty. His major ambition is to take down a drug cartel run in Mexico by the American Cash Bailey Powers Boothe and he has dedicated himself to this goal irrespective of dangers or fatalities. Not only is Cash Bailey a druglord however he is also Jack's best childhood friend and the former lover of Jack's sexy Mexican bar singer girlfriend Sarita Maria Conchita Alonso. Apart from Jack a bunch of former soldiers lead by a mysterious Major Michael Ironside also have some task to carry out in the desert borderland...The story is OK but nothing spectacular and the film's major qualities are the violent action the characters' macho attitude and toughmindedness and especially the great cast. Nick Nolte is excellent in his role of the silent toughguy Texas Ranger. Powers Boothe also delivers a great performance as the unscrupulous druglord Cash and beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso fits in her role very well. Michael Ironside is a great actor and his specialty is playing tough guys or sinister characters. Both attributes apply to the his role in Extreme Prejudice. The cast furthermore includes Rip Torn as a Sheriff as well as William Forsythe Clancy Brown and Tommy 'Tiny' Lister in an early role. All things considered Extreme Prejudice is certainly no masterpiece but friends of toughminded action flicks should be highly entertained! 610".

It's the different and exciting story that makes it kind of two stories wonderfully colliding together you could say. Once childhood friends Texas Ranger Jack Benteen Noltedead solid perfect and drug kingpin Cash Bailey Boothe in one of his performances here are now warring against each other especially after Nolte's close friend and deputy Rip Torn is slaughtered. Both enemies vie over old girlfriend Alonso never looking hotter especially near the end in the saloon scene who had ended up with Nolte. Interfering with the investigation Nolte has a bigger mess to clean up where later on this problem could wonderfully solve his. A elite army of undercover CIA soldiers lead by their unwavering hard as steel captain Ironside some seedy all presumed dead have popped up to take down Bailey and company. They are after these documents he has Cash once one of them but turned. This is one of those stylishly different action pics as well as being one of Hills that only comes along once one you shouldn't miss. The action shootouts are well staged especially near the end with a great cowboy like showdown it kind of seems weird and puts in a weird disarray as you don't expect this. Nolte shows what solid character acting is but it was Boothe who really impressed me here speaking such great dialogue any actor would love to get their hands on. The dialogue seemed meticulously chose it had me spouting off some lines after seeing it a few times over twenty five years ago. The title is kind of worrying when matched it to the movie's story a better one for something like this could of been applied. All too was the small display of title etc over a rising sun. In this R rated version the M played cinema wise in Adelaide more bums on seats you get what you asked for heavy squirts of blood and some spillages. You will be humbly satisfied. The whole bloody well made film is just different you know and today still stands alone.".

I liked the premise of good against evil as a result of human choices and not supernatural or paranormal ones and what makes this story more humanlyconditioned is the fact that back in the days Banteen and Bailey were best friends both on the wrong side of the law and at some point one has made a choice to lead a righteous straight path and the other just stuck to his evil ways. Major Paul Hackett Ironside surely commits to a choice of his own in leading a group of highly trained military men of different backgrounds to rob the bank where Bailey holds his money and other conspicuous documents supposedly for the purpose of weakening Bailey's business and that turns out in the end to be just a total cover up and lie manufactured by the Major himself. Setting this story particularly in Texas adds more western feel to the movie especially in the use of that type of shotguns and Nolte's stern yet vulnerable portrayal of a man trying his best to do the right thing yet is often faced by his dark past. The action direction is quite fitting on behalf of Hill which has been his trademark in many hit movies like The Warriors Another 8 hrs. Red Heat etc..".

I liked the premise of good against evil as a result of human choices and not supernatural or paranormal ones and what makes this story more humanlyconditioned is the fact that back in the days Banteen and Bailey were best friends both on the wrong side of the law and at some point one has made a choice to lead a righteous straight path and the other just stuck to his evil ways. Major Paul Hackett Ironside surely commits to a choice of his own in leading a group of highly trained military men of different backgrounds to rob the bank where Bailey holds his money and other conspicuous documents supposedly for the purpose of weakening Bailey's business and that turns out in the end to be just a total cover up and lie manufactured by the Major himself. Setting this story particularly in Texas adds more western feel to the movie especially in the use of that type of shotguns and Nolte's stern yet vulnerable portrayal of a man trying his best to do the right thing yet is often faced by his dark past. The action direction is quite fitting on behalf of Hill which has been his trademark in many hit movies like The Warriors Another 8 hrs. Red Heat etc..";

It's a fun actionWestern from director Walter Hill a filmmaker often at his best when portraying tough male milieus. With story credit going to Fred Rexer and the colourful John Milius it deliberately makes its way towards an exciting confrontation when bullets fly and countless squibs go off. This will mean that some viewers will be turned off but others will enjoy the visceral quality of this material. Certainly one of the movie's prime assets is a kick ass cast of cool actors not just Nolte and Boothe.The two leads play former childhood friends now on opposite sides of the law a familiar enough premise. Jack Benteen Nolte is a Texas Ranger and Cash Bailey Boothe is a big time drug dealer and Jack wants to give Cash every chance to surrender peaceably. While this is going on they fight over the affections of a saloon singer Sarita the very sexy Maria Conchita Alonso and a team of mercenaries led by Major Paul Hackett Michael Ironside has their own plans that involve a bank robbery.You know you'll have a good time when you see that Hackett's comrades are played by among others Clancy Brown and William Forsythe. Rip Torn makes the most of his screen time as Jack's colleague Sheriff Hank Pearson. Other familiar faces in the cast include Larry B. Scott John Dennis Johnston Luis Contreras Gary Carlos Cervantes Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Marco Rodriguez Mickey Jones and a briefly seen Lin Shaye. Forsythe in particular tears up the scenery. The sun baked cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti Texas and California locales and soaring Jerry Goldsmith music are all credits to the movie.The audience should be able to enjoy the twisty plot the interplay between the two main characters and the big finish. All in all this proves to be a solid outing for Hill and his cast  crew.Seven out of 10.".

Extreme Predudice is pretty much The Wild Bunch set in the 1980's on the U.S.Mexican border . It is almost as good as The Wild Bunch also which is a huge compliment as The Wild Bunch is one of the best films ever made. The pacing on this is quicker. Expect lots of action  great dialogue and stellar performances . Most of Walter Hill 's movies are underrated in my opinion and this is one of his finest works. This is also my favorite western in a modern day setting . I also really like Lone Wolf McQuade which John Milius wrote also and is my favorite Chuck Norris film.

I have to accept that there are some holes in the plot but who cares... This is a good action movie and it delivers what it promises  graphic violence bloodshed and lots of swearing.Also Rip Torn puts a great acting in this movie as well as Michael Ironside and William Forsythe I would say they are all comparable to Nick Nolte.Extreme Prejudice is a good flick for the ones who like action and blood.

They're deceiving of faking manner to the prospector by means of stealing the map of the Alaskan gold mine and to profit from him .This following to Lucio Fulci's White Fang with Franco Nero  Virna Lisi and Fernando Rey  is a tepid and lighthearted adventure about known and classic novel by Jack London. Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian landscapes . It's a passable sequel that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Weak screenplay from Giovanni Simonelli and Sandro Continenza who wrote in similar similar style to former movie . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Rustichelli who also composed White Fang . The film is rated PG13 Parents guide because contains some violent scenes about killing a cruel fighting between bear and dog and brutal biting . The motion picture is regularly directed by Tonino Ricci a below average director who in the 90s also realized other dogfilms as Buck with John Savage and Buck and the magic bracelet  with Matt McCoy . Other adaptations about Jack London classic are  Call of the wild  by Ken Annakin with Charlton Heston  White Fang1991by Randal Kleiser with Ethan Kawke as young prospector and Klaus Maria Brandauer and The return of White Fang1994 by Ken Olin with Scott Bairstow and once again Ethan Hawke. Rating  acceptable and passable.".

They're deceiving of faking manner to the prospector by means of stealing the map of the Alaskan gold mine and to profit from him .This following to Lucio Fulci's White Fang with Franco Nero  Virna Lisi and Fernando Rey  is a tepid and lighthearted adventure about known and classic novel by Jack London. Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian landscapes . It's a passable sequel that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Weak screenplay from Giovanni Simonelli and Sandro Continenza who wrote in similar similar style to former movie . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Rustichelli who also composed White Fang . The film is rated PG13 Parents guide because contains some violent scenes about killing a cruel fighting between bear and dog and brutal biting . The motion picture is regularly directed by Tonino Ricci a below average director who in the 90s also realized other dogfilms as Buck with John Savage and Buck and the magic bracelet  with Matt McCoy . Other adaptations about Jack London classic are  Call of the wild  by Ken Annakin with Charlton Heston  White Fang1991by Randal Kleiser with Ethan Kawke as young prospector and Klaus Maria Brandauer and The return of White Fang1994 by Ken Olin with Scott Bairstow and once again Ethan Hawke. Rating  acceptable and passable.";

This is essentially a later era Spaghetti Western made at a time when the form was becoming pass. To jazz them up Italian directors were making hybrid versions with KungFu subplots comedy shenanigans or in this case plundering the writings of Jack London  moving the locations up into the Rockies played here by the mountains of Sweden and still coming off well.Crime thriller star Maurizio Merli is brought in as the indomitable prospector looking to avenge the murder of his former partner and finding himself saddled with the movie's requisite plucky young tyke an obnoxious element thrown in the mix to appeal to the film's target audience of 8  12 year old boys. Sexy Gisela Hahn plays the saloon harlot with the heart of gold necessary to keep the tagalong fathers interested and the always enjoyable Henry Silva takes on the Jack Palance role of the crooked town crime boss who's schemes the hero interrupts. This one has the added twist of Merli adopting the identity of his murdered friend in a bid to get to the bottom of things which of course requires lots of desperate walks through the snowy wilds bar room fistfights shootouts with the bad guys and displays of wintertime survival skills.But the star of the film is of course the dog arbitrarily called White Fang There were about a dozen of these Jack London derived Doggy Adventure Snow Westerns cobbled together and the real hero is a German Shepard unconvincingly cast as a white timber wolf who befriends our plucky young tyke saving him and Merli's necks a bunch of time as he does clever and exciting things like bearing down snarling on secreted assassins finding the key to the jail cell or fighting off the inevitable wolf attack that is also a vital if unfortunate element of the formula. I say unfortunate because the animals were more or less coaxed to actually fight on camera and sensitive viewers might be concerned that the doggies were perhaps being exploited. Chances are they were but for 1.00 per DVD nobody seems to care.Then there's the bear. One of the more absurd subplots in this outing has the local shysters bring in a bear which is substituting for the hired killer role of this were a standard issue oater and White Fang has to contend with the beast on no less than two snarling sprawling overlong fight sequences that once again remind us that in 1974 nobody gave a damn about animal rights. For a family film it's pretty fierce stuff and kids may want to know why the bear and the doggie are fighting when in all actuality they would probably have just avoided each other if they weren't thrown into a pen together by a bunch of thickskulled Italians.But those segments aside this is a very passable if somewhat violent movie that you can pretty much all watch together and fans of genre cinema will be delighted by some of the familiar supporting cast faces like Renzo Palmer Benito Steffanelli Luciano Rossi and the insane Donald O'Brian. Written in part by Giovanni Simonelli with music by the always dependable Carlo Rustichelli and directed by Spaghetti Western legend Tonino Ricci this is actually a film with some respectable talent on display and interesting low budget production design. What's going around is a fullframe English language printing on various public domain DVDs priced appropriately at about 1.00 and you can do a lot worse for that 1.00 I've already watched mine about six times which is a pretty good cost to entertainment value ratio if I might say.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucio Fulci's White Fang must have been a hit because Tonino Ricci made an unofficial sequel to it casting Franco Nero lookalike if you squint a bit Maurizio Merli as the hero. This was Maurizio's breakout role and he would go on to punch 96 of the male population of Italy in the face in various Eurocrime films. Good call Tonino!Maurizio was just minding his business up in the mountains when his faithful dogwolf just a dog really White Fang alerts him to the fact that his best mate who has just struck gold has been murdered and robbed by bandits Donald O'rien and Luciano Rossi who is dubbed by a Peter Lorre soundalike for good measure. These two head off to the local town where evil businessman Henry Silva learns that there might be a gold seam out there hooks up with the bad guys and starts scheming against Maurizio who has assumed his mate's identity and come to town looking for revenge. On reflection the only reason I can think of him stealing the identity is to set up a couple of subplots.You see a kid who has just lost his mother has wandered into town looking for his dad and guess who that now is? Maurizio has to pretend to be this kid's father is hitting on a local woman who was taking care of the kid and is also trying to keep a low profile from local Mountie Renzo Palmer who is deeply suspicious of everything that's going on. Tonino Ricci is a bit of an erratic director. For everyone good one like Night of The Sharks we get a never ending snorefest like his Close Encounters ripoff Encounters in the Deep. He does good here though and seems to realise that everyone was going to get bored with the stolen identity thing so he switches to a crosscountry trace when Maurizio's son is kidnapped with the Mounties chasing Maurizio. For those thinking 'wasn't this about a dogwolf' there's plenty of dog action mostly thankfully not involving other animals.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a lowerbudgeted sequel to Lucio Fulci's near classic WHITE FANG of 1972 which spawned an official sequel and lots of cheaper imitations made by the likes of trash auteurs Joe D'Amato Alfonso Brescia and this film's director and my personal favourite of the bunch Tonino Ricci. Ricci was a man who dabbled in the genres throughout the late '60s and early '70s before finding his niche as an action director giving the world such classics as THE SHARK'S CAVE and RUSH THE ASSASSIN in the early '80s. Despised by many Ricci can always be relied upon to deliver a cheesy actionpacked escapade and WHITE FANG TO THE RESCUE an obscure item thankfully now seeing the light of day thanks to an el cheapo DVD release in 2001 is no exception packing lots of chases shootouts and fistfights into its predictable but appealing storyline.Most of the appeal comes from the exploitation cast which nearly equals that of Fulci's first shaggy dog story. Any fan of Italian cult movies will see lots of familiar faces popping up but more on that later. First up is the visual appeal of the film which makes great use of supposedly Alaskan locations actually filmed in Austria I think like the rest of this unofficial subgenre all snowy hillsides bleak forests and small mining towns. You can almost smell the atmosphere and the chilly setting is a nice change from the scorching dry locales of the spaghetti western. The script makes some fine attempts at characterisation and the decent dubbing makes it easier to take the on screen activities more seriously than usual. Although there are no special effects aside from a couple of dodgy shots Ricci creates an impressive movie by focusing on the acting and actors. Sure the action isn't topnotch but it involves people we get to know and love or indeed hate in the case of the baddies which makes it interesting and darned entertaining.The one thing I didn't like about this movie is the bearbaiting sequence which is nearly as bad as the animal snuff seen in the Italian cannibal genre which surfaced five years after this movie was released. In it a chained bear is repeatedly attacked and mauled by an Alsatian dog supposedly White Fang with both animals trading blows and bites. Very hard stuff to watch and dwelled upon far too long this is both distasteful and cheap exploitational filmmaking at its lowest. Ah well what more can you say? Some people would film anything for a buck and it makes for the film's one true moment of horror. WHITE FANG TO THE RESCUE is worth sitting through to be gobsmacked at the hilarious conclusion set in the middle of nowhere which sees bloody battles men shot dead and the villain being savaged and brutalised by the dog before his lifeless body  or perhaps that of a dummy  drifts down the river. White Fang goes on to save the life of a boy hanging off the edge of a cliff. Here the funniest moment of the film comes  Fang slips himself and falls in leading to a quick cut of a what looks like a sack of potatoes covered in fur being chucked into a river! A hilariously inept effect and one which had me reaching for the rewind button.Castwise the lead is taken by Franco Nero look alike Maurizio Merli playing a character incredibly called Benjamin Dover! Merli appears in his breakthrough performance here and his first hardedged leading man role although he's noticeably softer and more likable than in his badmannered Inspector Berti type roles in the Italian polizia genre which made him famous. Saying that he still gets to engage in plenty of fisticuffs so Merli fans are well served. Meanwhile the supporting cast is made up of the attractive Gisela Hahn as the icy love interest and the inimitable Henry Silva as the scary bad guy one of my favourite screen villains just because of his evil intense ol' face. Finally there are two great turns from Donald O'Brien and Luciano Rossi as a sleazy pair of bandits  the latter has a very amusing dubbed voice that makes him an unforgettable character. The cast is an added bonus and enhances this family adventure tale into being something good and worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Waits is a very talented songwriter. He is perhaps up there with the top five American songwriters of the past thirty years. He is also a fine actor those of you having watched movies like 'Down by law' and 'Short Cuts' will not doubt agree. He rarely if ever puts a foot wrong in his main chosen arena of the arts music.Apart from a few badly judged moves the same can be said of his film work. 'Bearskin' is I'm afraid very much one of those 'badly judged moves'. It is in fact a major' foot wrong'. The blame however doesn't lie with Waits performance its more than acceptable but the script is dire the supporting cast are uninteresting and the camera work is stiff.The story is quite unbelievalbe and no matter how well Waits represents the scripts better intentions this film goes nowhere. I've long hoped Waits would get the chance to show off his acting in larger more commercial roles something he hasn't really done yet. Sure he's appeared in cameo form in some big Hollywood efforts but his abilities deserve so much more. Much much more than 'Bearskin'.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tom Waits is a very talented songwriter. He is perhaps up there with the top five American songwriters of the past thirty years. He is also a fine actor those of you having watched movies like 'Down by law' and 'Short Cuts' will not doubt agree. He rarely if ever puts a foot wrong in his main chosen arena of the arts music.Apart from a few badly judged moves the same can be said of his film work. 'Bearskin' is I'm afraid very much one of those 'badly judged moves'. It is in fact a major' foot wrong'. The blame however doesn't lie with Waits performance its more than acceptable but the script is dire the supporting cast are uninteresting and the camera work is stiff.The story is quite unbelievalbe and no matter how well Waits represents the scripts better intentions this film goes nowhere. I've long hoped Waits would get the chance to show off his acting in larger more commercial roles something he hasn't really done yet. Sure he's appeared in cameo form in some big Hollywood efforts but his abilities deserve so much more. Much much more than 'Bearskin'.";

	schema:headline " Tom Waits as a Punch  Judy puppeteer. almost enough said but there's more";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a semiforgotten film that got advertised largely by the presence of Tom Waits. This isn't unnatural since he was the most recognizable face in the film  there are a couple of character actors from Britain Bill Paterson and Alex Norton who have appeared in many things and Charlotte Coleman  but the film was or if it is at all today continues to be sold on Waits and of course he is the major reason to see the film. This doesn't mean to say the movie is bad and it actually is enjoyable and engaging in parts. The main problem at the script level is that the two filmmakers don't know how to keep the tonal glue together and not even Waits' cool can save that.This is a movie that reminds me a little of something from Guy Ritchie especially those bits where the two gangsters argue about crabs and shellfish and such nonsense in the car or RoegCamell's Performance where a criminal on the run due to gambling debts takes a job as an Entertainer's Assistant and becomes part of the work of a young mute woman Laura and the man who does the Punch  Judy puppet show for local kids Silva played by Waits. It's a scattershot kind of story in ways both good and not so good but it's all anchored by Waits' performance. I wish I could tell you Damon Lowry uh who? brings the goods as well but he's only 'fine' as one might say. The other performers only bring so much i.e. one actor you can tell is a bad guy due to a ponytail.Matter of fact without him in it and how he has a very particular physicality watch how he can as an actor inhabit a space so seemingly with little effort and slink about an actress like the one playing Ms J in a scene and that voice which is truly distinctive this movie wouldn't be very memorable at all. What the filmmakers are trying to do is what the title suggests create a 'fairytale' out of a story that has a lot of elements of crime and the underworld and seedy things like violence and rape that second thing comes out of nowhere in the story simply as a plot device for Johnny that could have been done in a more clever or less typical way. They aren't at all poor directors and in fact have a good sense of where to put the camera and locations and where to set the scene. It's at the script where things feel... odd and unresolved at points. Think like if Guy Ritchie during his crime movie heyday only put in half the work that was needed.And yet while the whole never quite comes together and a certain twist that really isn't doesn't work at all involving a character's supposed death I enjoyed this more than I expected. Again a good lot of this comes down to being a fan of Waits and how he clearly took what was a fairly standard cool guy on paper and made him... legitimately cool and that he can be in a leather jacket and smoke a cigarette but that isn't what does the acting for him it's him and his soul and what he is as a person. If the rest of the story and the cast rose up to his level then this would be more highly regarded today. But it's not so here we are with an obscurity that is seeing another light of day due to Amazon Prime.".

The second part of the movie consists of Harold climbing up the side of a building. Forget that this movie was made in 1923. This scene is one of the most hairraising things ever filmed and will have you on the edge of your seat. It builds and builds with one gag after another climaxing in the timeless movie image that everyone has seen of Harold hanging from the hands of the clock on the building. Every time I watch this scene I get very nervous. I highly recommend this film even if you are not a fan of silent films.

The scene where Harold and his roommate hide in their coats you'd have to see it to know what I'm talking about got an enormous laugh which lasted for a long time followed by some applause. I remember that there was a slow section lasting about 5 minutes after Harold's fiancee arrived in the city but other than that this film was consistently hilarious. And then during the building climbing scene there were so many laughs and gasps applause and shouts OH MY GOD! coming from the audience. It was probably the single most hairraising scene that I or most of the other people in the theater had ever seen. And the climb which lasts I believe 12 stories should have gotten old. But it never came close to getting old. Each joke was masterful. After having seen the film I was unfairly comparing it to the silent film that I had seen the previous week at a theater with live piano Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr. Well nothing is really comparable to that film. I consider it the funniest film I've ever seen. I was planning to give Safety Last a 910 but after some thought I realized that I laughed a lot harder and more at this film than 90 of the other comedies I've seen. At least 90 but probably much more. I have to give this a 1010. This film really should be on DVD or at least VHS. Harold Lloyd shouldn't be as forgotten as he is.".

Another day I saw Hugo and Martin Scorcese pays a tribute to Safety Last! showing the scene of Harold Lloyd hanging from the Bolton Building clock and I have decided to see this film again.If Harold Lloyd himself or a stuntman climbed the building it does not matter. The breathless scene is among the most known in the cinema history and Safety Last! is a mustsee film for any generation. My vote is nine.Title Brazil O Homem Mosca The Fly Man";

	schema:reviewBody "Wiry athletic bespectacled Harold Lloyd may rank third after Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in silent age comedy polls but when it comes to perilous pulseracing gravitydefying stuntwork he's the King of the World!The aptlytitled Safety Last is without a doubt Lloyd's signature film. The indelible still taken of Harold dangling from the minutehand of that Big Benlooking clock is definitive silent screen imagery. A shame too for it is only one classic moment from a tireless legacy of work that is too often overlooked.Isn't it amazing that despite knowing the outcome of this movie knowing that Lloyd survived all these crazy stunts your heart still skips a beat every time he scales that 12story building floor by floor encountering every obstacle imaginable...or unimaginable?  Those pesky pigeons the mouse the flagpole the painters the rope the mad dog and of course the clock.  What adds to the intrigue is knowing he did his own stunts that he had lost fingers prior to this filming in another movie mishap that there were no safety nets underneath and that there was no trick photography used.  I say Harold deserves a more prominent place in movie history suffering for his art as no other artist has. The plot leading up to his daredevil antics is fairly pat but sprayed throughout with inventive sight gags.  Harold plays your simple hapless smalltown 'everyman' who goes to the BIG city to seek fame and fortune leaving his true love played by Mildred Davis his reallife wife at home until he's makes it.  Fresh off the bus he eventually manages to scrape up a job as a clerk in a department store a job that takes him nowhere fast. To save face he keeps sending expensive trinkets back home that indicate otherwise.  Convinced that he has indeed made it she heads off to the BIG city to join him much to his chagrin.  Desperate to earn quick cash before she discovers the truth he takes his boss up on an offer and works up a publicity ruse to drum up sales for the store.The rest is classic Lloyd.  Wearing his trademark straw hat and hornrimmed glasses the meek mouse suddenly turns into Mighty Mouse as our boy through a series of mishaps literally moves up in the world  scaling heights even he never dreamed of!All's well of course that ends well as we've been saying for centuries. Sure we know how things ended back in the good ol' days but isn't it great to know that when Harold got the girl he STAYED with the girl?  In real life Harold and Mildred remained sweethearts for over 45 years.Highly recommended for those who want to see more of this genius's amazing work is Kid Brother and The Freshman.  For me this guy still provides one heck of an E ticket rollercoaster ride.".

That is because in one moment on the screen he engraved himself forever into the minds of movie lovers something oddly enough Chaplin and Keanton never quite did in a single moment of film. Lloyd of course became immortal for being the man suspended from the clock of the building he was climbing in the concluding half hour of this wonderful comedy. There is more to the film than that of course. Harold here in love with his home town girlfriend Mildred Davis who was his wife in real life has sacrificed money to buy her jewelry and has been sending her letters lying about his business success. He claims he is a bigwig at the department store he is a clerk in. Actually he is constantly in hot water with the pompous floor walker Mr. Stubbs Westcott Clarke. After he sends a second gift to Mildred she decides to join him in the city. He manages to pass himself off as the store's general manager don't ask  you have to see how he does it. But she wants to get married now  he's making enough supposedly for a house. His best friend is a human fly Bill Strother so Harold proposes to the actual general manager a publicity stunt wherein a mystery man will climb the department store facade 15 stories. Unfortunately Police Officer Noah Young has a grudge against Strother and keeps preventing him from climbing. So Harold has to climb up the side  with Strother promising to take over at the right moment once he shakes off Young. Although Chaplin and Keaton's physical comedy included dangers to them Keaton and the water fall in OUR HOSPITALITY for example the climb up the store's facade is considered in a class by itself. Certainly it is one of the few comedy stunts that have been taken apart and analyzed over the years even when we know how it was done it still impresses us. The stunt got a life of it's own beyond the famous clock photograph because the film's theme is the success theme in American business life. Harold wants to make it in business and he's just a downtrodden clerk. To make it rich and to get his girl he has to risk all on a 1000.00 gamble. He does in the end with his climbing having been cleverly compared to climbing the business ladder or getting ahead in America. When he seems to retreat at one point some of the onlookers shake their heads and point upward. Once he is on his route to success he can't turn back. The film is more fun than that particularly good interpretation makes it sound. It deserves a 10 for it's success at remaining a humorous and lasting peace of cinematic comic art and a fitting monument to that comedy master Harold Lloyd.".

In this sense it is probably the BEST film of its typeby Lloyd Keaton or Chaplin. However because it has so many stunts it lacks some of the charm of his other longer moviesespecially if you see the short version. The longer adds the rather familiar plot of Harold meeting a sweet girl and wanting to make good. This is familiar but handled very well.

	schema:headline " The boy";
	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton may be the two bestknown silent comics but there was a third genius of slapstick who is in the same league even if he is no longer a household name. Like his betterknown contemporaries Harold Lloyd cultivated a unique and appealing character that made him into a comedy persona as opposed to just another comic actor. His glasses character an awkward yet enthusiastic youngster drove a particular brand of silent humour that gave him a successful niche. Safety Last! is not quite his best picture but with its even mix of touching romance and daredevil antics it became his most iconic.Unusually Lloyd did not write a lot of his own material Hal Roach described him as being not the best comedian but the best actor who ever played a comedian but at the Roach studios this didn't matter too much because they had a strong and efficient creative team. You'll always notice in Roach comedies the wording of the title cards is generally very witty something you never got with Chaplin whose Achilles' heel was verbal comedy. And at Roach they weren't ashamed of a bit of plagiarism. The opening scene of Safety Last! with what looks like a jail and a hangman's noose is thieved from a Buster Keaton short. Later there's some business with crowded streetcars that is reminiscent of Chaplin's Payday short. But there is nevertheless cunning originality in the way these gags are pulled off and the professional polish of these movies is enough to make them seem fresh and funny.Such was the division of labour at Roach studios that Safety Last! even has two directors. Fred Newmeyer was one of the Roach's most experienced shorts directors and he handled the storytelling scenes. Sam Taylor was one of the studio's top writers and he was responsible for shooting the comedy. There is actually a good deal of similarity between their approaches. A lot of Taylor's gag construction is based on a pullbackandreveal move. We start with what we think is one thing then change angle and realise something different is going on. An obvious example is the opening scene but actually jokes like this are going on all the time such as when Harold leads the policeman into a shed the camera pans right and we see the cop simply walk out the other door. And similarly Newmeyer will start a lot of scenes with an elusive closeup  such as Jobyna Ralston reading one of Harold's letters  then pull out to reveal the situation.Essentially Taylor and Newmeyer have put together a picture that relies a lot on cuts and camera moves quite a contrast to the long takes and elaborate routines of Chaplin and Keaton. But this is what suits the Lloyd style and after all it is Lloyd everyone comes to see. Part of what makes Safety Last! unique is its breakneck pace and sense of danger. I think that because Lloyd was not the sort of comic who care about showing off his own comic routines he was more willing to be seen flying through the air or clinging to the outside of a speeding car letting the mechanics of the gags dominate. And in the end this is what makes the character so lovable the way we see him in brief glimpses his legs stiff like drainpipes and his mouth an O of shock. And funny as it all is we really don't want this poor kid to get hurt. The fact that in a picture like Safety Last! the audience gasps as much as it laughs makes us warm to this plucky yet slightly vulnerable young lad.".

	onyx:emotionText "Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton may be the two bestknown silent comics but there was a third genius of slapstick who is in the same league even if he is no longer a household name. Like his betterknown contemporaries Harold Lloyd cultivated a unique and appealing character that made him into a comedy persona as opposed to just another comic actor. His glasses character an awkward yet enthusiastic youngster drove a particular brand of silent humour that gave him a successful niche. Safety Last! is not quite his best picture but with its even mix of touching romance and daredevil antics it became his most iconic.Unusually Lloyd did not write a lot of his own material Hal Roach described him as being not the best comedian but the best actor who ever played a comedian but at the Roach studios this didn't matter too much because they had a strong and efficient creative team. You'll always notice in Roach comedies the wording of the title cards is generally very witty something you never got with Chaplin whose Achilles' heel was verbal comedy. And at Roach they weren't ashamed of a bit of plagiarism. The opening scene of Safety Last! with what looks like a jail and a hangman's noose is thieved from a Buster Keaton short. Later there's some business with crowded streetcars that is reminiscent of Chaplin's Payday short. But there is nevertheless cunning originality in the way these gags are pulled off and the professional polish of these movies is enough to make them seem fresh and funny.Such was the division of labour at Roach studios that Safety Last! even has two directors. Fred Newmeyer was one of the Roach's most experienced shorts directors and he handled the storytelling scenes. Sam Taylor was one of the studio's top writers and he was responsible for shooting the comedy. There is actually a good deal of similarity between their approaches. A lot of Taylor's gag construction is based on a pullbackandreveal move. We start with what we think is one thing then change angle and realise something different is going on.

	schema:reviewBody "Film aficionados know that Harold Lloyd  along with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton  was the third member of the greatest movie comics in silent movie history. Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle could have been a fourth member had his career not been ruined in 1921. Harold Lloyd whose trademark was a straw hat hornedrimmed eyeglasses and a regular suit made more films than Chaplin and Keaton combined. For a time he was even more popular than they. Most of Lloyd's films were shorts many of the Lonesome Luke variety. Safety Last was one of his earlier features and it is so good that it appears on some Top 100 listings of American films. It certainly belongs on the best listings of silent films in 1994 it was preserved in the National Film Registry. And it made Roger Ebert's top 375 list.At a train station we are initially fooled to think we are in a prison the boy Harold Lloyd says goodbye to his girl Mildred Davis in Great Bend to make good in the big city Los Angeles. Only then will he send for her to join him in marriage. In the big city Harold shares an apartment with his friend Limpy Bill to save money. He does get a job as a regular sales clerk in De Vore's Department Store. He scrapes together all he has to send Mildred a pendant all the while exaggerating his position and pay. When Mildred's mother finds out she advises her daughter to go to the city to see Harold as the city is dangerous for a single man with all of that supposed money. Happy to see his fiance Harold realizes that he needs to demonstrate a high position in the store by a series of silly antics. If anything Harold's lowly position of 15 .00 weekly is precarious as he has to watch out for the martinet floorwalker. Then Harold overhears his general manager declare that more publicity needs to be done to drum up business. He is willing to pay 1000 to anyone who climbs up the Bolton Building actually the 1912 Brockman Building that houses De Vore's store.By a complication it is awkward Harold who is reluctantly forced to scale the twelvestory skyscraper. As a crowd gathers and watches in amazement Harold monkeys up the building's exterior. He meets all kinds of obstacles. They include his getting whacked by a plank and getting assaulted by three kinds of animals birds a pit bull a mouse. Harold winds up dangling from the hands of the large clock that lies on the side of the building's tenth story far above the 1922 busy street traffic. Than the clock's facing opens and  Lloyd's iconic image was cemented that day. Note that Lloyd had already lost a thumb and a finger on his right hand from a 1919 accident The injury was hidden by his special gloves.. Even after escaping he concludes by tripping on a rope and staggering along the building's upper ledge at the roof line. Waiting for him on the rooftop is Mildred.In an era before computergenerated imagery and advanced camera tricks Harold Lloyd does appear to be doing his own stunts. And even though there was a scaffold below him with a mattress should he fall there was no guarantee that he was out of danger. A threestory fall on a mattress is not assurance of safety Safety Last indeed!. By the way it took four months to shoot the famous Brockman climb. After the movie was made Harold married his sweetheart Mildred for real.In the beginning 1913 Lloyd may not have been a natural comedian but his stunts and gags were eventually good enough to outgross both Chaplin and Keaton in the 1920s. He was a top ten movie star for years. Perhaps his success was such that he looked like the common man that audiences were able to identify with unlike say a Chaplin tramp. Although he did not always do the right thing in his films he was generally decent. In real life he was a good businessman who bought and saved his films before they could be lost or destroyed like those of so many others like 1920s cowboy star Fred Thomson. Even though Lloyd faded more than Chaplin and Keaton with the advent of the talkie era he was both chipper and happy to keep his works preserved like Grandma's Boy 1922 The Freshman 1925 and Speedy 1928. It all worked out in the end and as of this writing his granddaughter helps keep alive his famous legacy.".

Parting with the girl he loves Mildred Davis with the promise of marrying her once he has made good our hero departs for the big city to make his fortune. He shares accommodation with a pal of his Bill Strother but their collective savings are always dwindling and often nonexistent. To make ends meet Lloyd works as a clerk at a prominent department store but just about everything he earns is used to buy gifts for his girl. Writing to her seven days a week his letters and presents are usually accompanied by a false commentary of the success he is currently enjoying and hopeless assurances that marriage is right around the corner.Paying the rent has become a problem. Lloyd unbeknown to his roommate had managed to pawn the record player for twelve dollars but this money went towards yet another gift to be sent home. Lloyd's friend is sympathetic to his friend's situation and isn't bitter about the missing record player though he certainly keeps a closer eye on the potentiallysellable records scattered across the table. They are good friends occasionally getting into bouts of mischief together.The first half of the film relates to Lloyd's desperate attempts to simply stay afloat. If he loses his job he knows that his life is ruined. And so when Lloyd is unwittingly driven away from the doorstep of his workplace by the deaf driver of a van with automaticallylocking doors he has ten minutes to get back to his job or else he risks getting inharmoniously fired. We find many a laugh in this scenario  Lloyd is unable to find a place on a ludicrouslyovercrowded tram and the offer of an automobile driver to give him a ride turns out to be more trouble than it's worth for both driver and passenger. An ambulance eventually offers Lloyd the salvation he was looking for and his inspired ploy to get to work on time nearly gives the paramedic a heart attack of his own!Having finally made it to work his lateness relatively unnoticed we discover that Lloyd's job presents him with more troubles than he encountered trying to get there. The women customers about him are absolutely ravenous clutching violently at lengths of fabric and shouting deafeningly to be served next. His disheveled appearance gets him into trouble with Mr. Stubbs the snobbish and selfimportant floorwalker. Things get much much worse when Lloyd's girlfriend mistakenly believing that he is now successful enough to support a family takes a train to the city to be with him. Surprised and embarrassed to see her Lloyd promptly pretends to be the general manager of the department store loudly reprimanding his coworkers and even his superiors to maintain the deception.Accidentally overhearing the real general manager of the store Lloyd strikes upon a grand solution to his monetary troubles. If he is able to bring hundreds of potential customers to the building he asks will the manager reward him with one thousand dollars? Yes he will. Lloyd then rushes off to enlist his Pal to spectacularly climb the 12storey department store building having seen him do something similar earlier whilst escaping from a police officer. Finally everything is arranged and Lloyd needs only to sit back and wait for the extraordinary bonus to come his way.Things as we might have expected do not quite go to plan. It truly is a wonder that I have come this far into my review without even a mention of Lloyd's famous building climb the spectacular extended sequence towards which everything in the film had been leading. That iconic image of a panicstricken Lloyd the street traffic leering ominously below him dangling precariously from the hands of a clockface has become permanently imprinted in the minds of millions many of whom have never even had the pleasure of seeing 'Safety Last!' Even more than eighty years later the illusion of height remains incredibly convincing practically flawless in fact. Though various theories have floated around over the years about how the deception was achieved a likely theory is that the building Lloyd climbs was actually a fake wall constructed on the roof of a skyscraper. Through clever photography and camera angles we are wholly duped into believing that below Lloyd lies a 12storey fall and certain death. All the more remarkably Lloyd achieved these complex stunts using only 8 fingers having lost a right thumb and index finger in 1919 when a prop bomb exploded in his hands.His Pal being temporarily engaged in other matters Lloyd is inevitably forced to climb the building himself and he is besieged by just about every obstacle imaginable a pesky flock of pigeons an entangled tennis net a plank of wood a swinging window the celebrated giant clock a loose rope a ferocious dog a flimsy flagpole a mouse that climbs into his trousers a revolving weather vane watch how the film delightfully keeps us in suspense as Lloyd's head comes within centimetres of the spinning object on several occasions and a second rope which gets entangled around Lloyd's ankle.A solid silent comedy with one of the most engaging final sequences in any film ever made Harold Lloyd's 'Safety Last!' is a marvel of 1920s comedy filmmaking. Sometimes called the third genius Lloyd though actually the most commerciallysuccessful of the three in his day has often stood in the shadows of the incredible Charlie Chaplin and the inimitable Buster Keaton. My first foray into Lloyd's films has proved an exciting one and I will continue to look on with interest!".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people like to lump Chaplain Keaton and Lloyd into a stew as great silent comics but they are all incomparable.  Of the three Lloyd is perhaps the most modern.  He looks like a pushover and played one in The Kid Brother but his character was more like a Bill Murray character today irreverent occasionally mean sassy and ultimately good hearted.Safety Last was Lloyd's best feature though some would argue for The Kid Brother a metaphor for America's rise to the top in the 1920s after a long struggle.  Only after World War I could America really assert its dominance on the world stage though it was also just then very isolationist.  The stock market was booming.  People sought cheap thrills and daredevil acts were everywhere  flagpole sitters wingwalkers human flies . . .Lloyd plays a poor young man who leaves his home town sweetheart to make his fortune in the big city.  Some time later he's working at a counter at a department store and still very poor.  Two things happen simultaneously  he learns his girl is coming to the city to see how he's succeeding he's been writing letters home that are full of deception  and he learns the store wants a gimmick to attract more people.  Lloyd's best friend is a construction worker.  The two of them previously played a practical joke on a mutual friend who is a policeman  but it's the wrong policeman.  He doesn't see Lloyd but chases his friend who escapes by climbing a building.  The friend later confides to Lloyd he used to have a human fly act.Lloyd persuades him to climb the department store and then sells the human fly gimmick to the store's head honcho.  But as Lloyd's friend arrives at the building he finds the policeman who's looking for him is hanging around.  He's chased up through the building.

	onyx:emotionText "Many people like to lump Chaplain Keaton and Lloyd into a stew as great silent comics but they are all incomparable.  Of the three Lloyd is perhaps the most modern.  He looks like a pushover and played one in The Kid Brother but his character was more like a Bill Murray character today irreverent occasionally mean sassy and ultimately good hearted.Safety Last was Lloyd's best feature though some would argue for The Kid Brother a metaphor for America's rise to the top in the 1920s after a long struggle.  Only after World War I could America really assert its dominance on the world stage though it was also just then very isolationist.  The stock market was booming.  People sought cheap thrills and daredevil acts were everywhere  flagpole sitters wingwalkers human flies . . .Lloyd plays a poor young man who leaves his home town sweetheart to make his fortune in the big city.  Some time later he's working at a counter at a department store and still very poor.  Two things happen simultaneously  he learns his girl is coming to the city to see how he's succeeding he's been writing letters home that are full of deception  and he learns the store wants a gimmick to attract more people.  Lloyd's best friend is a construction worker.  The two of them previously played a practical joke on a mutual friend who is a policeman  but it's the wrong policeman.  He doesn't see Lloyd but chases his friend who escapes by climbing a building.  The friend later confides to Lloyd he used to have a human fly act.Lloyd persuades him to climb the department store and then sells the human fly gimmick to the store's head honcho.  But as Lloyd's friend arrives at the building he finds the policeman who's looking for him is hanging around.  He's chased up through the building. He tells Lloyd to go up the first story and then he'll swap coats and hats and go the rest of the way. Lloyd's character is wary but committed to the act.Unfortunately every time Lloyd gets to a higher floor the policeman has caught his friend.  Lloyd has to climb one story after another and each time a new and original obstacle is put in his way including the infamous clock which produces Lloyd's iconic image.Like the best comedies it starts with a plot and believable characters then builds inexorably and even inescapably toward one of the funniest halfhours in motion picture history as Lloyd's character scales the side of his store to success and love.A documentary on Lloyd produced by the BBC called Harold Lloyd The Third Genius gives some spoilers as to how the climb was accomplished.

After starting off with the short High and Dizzy very good stuff we decided to watch Safety Last on the amphitheater screen where we live. I found that I had forgotten many gags from the first time I watched it many of them on the climactic human fly sequence such as the pigeons attacking him and getting his foot caught in a net. Also I tried to pay attention to Lloyd's right hand during the climb sequence to see if I could notice his missing fingers. Sure enough his thumb never moves and his index and middle fingers move as one indicating a prosthetic glove. One thing I didn't like this time around and I take this as a sign of the times is that Harold's girlfriend came off as kind of a bimbo. I guess she has to be for the plot to work. Watching the film on a large screen was very rewarding the finale sequence nearly half an hour long longer than I remembered remains thrilling as ever. One device is Harold's friend the real climber who consistently promises Harold just one more floor while I ditch this cop. Even if you know it won't work you're right with Harold in hoping that this one last floor will be it then he can rest. By the time Harold got to the third floor I decided that idiot friend of his is never going to get rid of that cop is he? KEVIN We decided to view Harold Lloyd's classic comedythriller on the amphitheater to enjoy the stunts on a big screen. As expected I had forgotten many of the gags in Safety Last since I last saw it including the scene where he finds himself on the other side of town with mere minutes to get to work. And there's the very funny string of gags when his girlfriend Mildred Davis comes to work and thinks he's the manager and he tries every trick in the book to keep up appearances. One of the things I didn't know about Harold Lloyd when I watched this film years ago was that Lloyd lost his right thumb and forefinger in a freak accident some years before. So when I watched it this time I kept a close eye on his right hand. Lloyd hid this with a special prosthetic glove. I noticed that the thumb is always straight he always points with two fingers and he always grabs things with his left hand. And during the film's classic human fly sequence Lloyd always climbs up with his left hand followed by his right. I had also forgotten many of the individual gags during that classic scene like when he's molested by pigeons and I noticed this time that many of the onlookers or residents who are mean to Lloyd often get some kind of comeuppance. Of course no one could forget the classic image when he hangs off the clock face. And I especially loved Carl Davis' hilariously tense musical score.Last film Robin Hood 1922. Next film viewed Girl Shy 1924. Next film chronologically Our Hospitality 1923.The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through year by year one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period the films of the era and each film in context while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies most of which we never would have watched otherwise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Odd Man Out is a terrific piece of cinema. It is set in Ireland and stars James Mason as Johnny McQueen leader of an underground Irish organization that engage in a robbery that will enable the organisation to steal the funds it needs to continue it's activities. However the heist goes sour. Events conspire against him and Johnny ends up wounded and alone in the city of Belfast. The police then launch a huge manhunt to find the criminal and lead him to justice and what follows is a desperate struggle by Johnny and Johnny's friends to get him to safety. Before the film starts it claims that it is not about the state of Ireland at that time but rather the effect that the state of the country has had on it's people and that is exactly what the film does. The neutral people in the film are caught between whose side to be on helping the police will keep them out of jail and for some make them feel like they are doing the right thing but nobody wants to get on the wrong side of Johnny's organisation as that could also be detrimental to your survival. All of the characters in the film have some affiliation to the state be it good for them or more commonly bad for them.Odd Man Out is an adventure. It's an adventure about one man's struggle to get from point A to point B. Like all good adventure films he meets people along the way some that will help him some that won't. It's exciting in this respect but the film isn't only an adventure. As he did in his other masterpiece The Third Man Carol Reed succeeds in giving a thriller a great substance. That's one of things that's great about this film on the surface it's entertaining and therefore can be enjoyed by anyone but if you take a look under it's skin the film has depth also which firmly places it in the film buff category of films. Odd Man Out clearly highlights the paranoia values and fears of the era and these are explored through the main character.Odd Man Out is one of the best directed films that I've ever seen. Carol Reed is an excellent director and one who is worthy of more acclaim. Here he indulges in many tricks with the camera including a terrific sequence that sees our hero see multiple images in a puddle of spilled beer. Reed pulls all of these tricks off and none look out of place. Considering that this movie was made in 1947 it's a piece of technical wizardry. Reed also uses many different cinema styles at different times to further his story. The film is dramatic at certain points where the characters are interacting but at the other end of the spectrum it's very cinematic at certain times most notably in the scenes that see Johnny being chased through the streets of Belfast. These scenes are extremely atmospheric and very aesthetically pleasing. Despite indulging in many different tricks and styles the film is never gratuitous. Where another lesser director might have gone over the top Reed doesn't and it keeps the film very much on the level which is to his and this piece of art's credit.Overall Odd Man Out is a masterpiece that is on par with if not better than The Third Man. It's a shame that it has seemingly been forgotten as this movie can surely take it's place among the best of all time. A glorious must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most beautifully directed Carol Reed and photographed Robert Krasker films I have seen. The story revolves around the attempts of various citizens of Belfast to either aid comfort or kill a wounded revolutionary gunman. A great deal has been written about this picture concerning mostly its meaning and I'm going to heretically skip over these issues and focus instead of why I think the film works so well as a piece of art rather than try to figure out what it's saying.Essentially what Reed and Company have done is create a dark and gloomy urban landscape and made it seductive even precious to us by making us care about the people we meet there. Not that these are especially likable people. Many of them aren't but they're presented fairly and till near the end without too much melodrama and the way they're offered to us which is to say their environments vastly warmer and more enticing than the cold night streets the bleeding fugitive is staggering through create a series of dramatic contrasts between the real world most of us have to move through and the more imaginative safer worlds of our homes where we can retreat to and imagine we are something else. The wounded Johnny McQueen can afford no such luxury on this bitter night as each little warm nest offers for a brief while a ray of hope that this time he will come in from the cold for good get warm rest a little have his wounds taken care of and maybe even if he gets really lucky find himself a warm bed to sleep in. Alas this is not Johnny McQueen's night. Some of the people he encounters treat him decently enough for a while till they figure out who he is and then calculation sets in and selfishness wins out in the end. The film is full of the kind of nocturnal yearnings anyone who has ever lived in a cold city feels as he walks the streets whether to a pub or train station home or restaurant wondering what on earth he is doing out on a night such as this. One goes past this little rowhouse on a sidewalk or that little walkdown cafe and looks in the window sees the people inside and wishes one were there. Yet cold nights have their pleasures and even rain has a beauty as puddles reflect the light of streetlamps and rainstreaked windows make rooms that much more inviting.Odd Man Out takes these moods and the musings that accompany them and raises everything to the max. Johnny isn't merely a man walking down a street he's a hunted criminal. As we feel as he does everything comes more intensely into focus than it would normally as a phone booth can look like the most wonderful place in the world when the snow starts falling. The film makes us see and feel things as we seldom do in normal life and the result is a kind of compulsive aestheticism that may well be accidental. Anything is or can be beautiful under the right circumstances and all interior places are inviting when the temperature drops one hasn't eaten in hours. I suspect that this wasn't the filmmakers' intention that they were hunting bigger game looking for larger meanings and the trappings of their picture were intended perhaps as incidental pleasures or maybe not as pleasures at all. But it is precisely these thingsthe visual tropes not the philosophical and theological underpinningsthat I find most interesting and gratifying about the movie. In the end films have their own meaning and this one makes me more attentive to the smaller things in life rather than the larger issues to snow rain beer to boots and overcoats to the thin white blankets of snow that drape cities on winter nights.".

Here he plots a robbery of a Belfast mill to fund his underground organisation the robbery doesn't go to plan and Johnny kills a man in a struggle outside the mill he himself is shot and fails to make the getaway with his accomplices...If ever there was a film that defines the statement of film on canvass then this is it it's a gorgeous piece of work relying on striking imagery and dialogue driven smartness to realise the demise of Johnny McQueen. We watch and listen intensely as Johnny lurches through the back streets of Belfast knowing he is dying he has most of the city looking for him be it the law or friends or those that want to cash in on him his destiny is not so much carved in stone but more like written in blood in the snow.The amazing feeling I got with this film is that I felt like I was dying as well and I think that is one of the film's great strengths director Carol Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker put you into the mindset of McQueen the doom hangs heavy the distortion and hallucinogenic free fall for the last reel hangs heavy on the viewer it's a stifling masterclass. Some of the shots are beautiful especially once the snow starts to fall to accentuate the Victorian backdrops but consistently we also get moist and misty cobbled streets lit by gas lamps providing moody shadows of humans and buildings alike. While Krasker offers up his photographic atmospherics Reed excels with scenes such as portraits forming together in front of McQueen or faces appearing in spilled beer bubbles images wrung out of McQueen's feverish mind.James Mason as Mcqueen is brilliant and yet he doesn't get long periods of dialogue here the script doesn't call for it yet the performance is simply wonderful with just one look of desperation Mason acts out of the top draw. There are a number of great characters in the film like borderline insane artist Lukey a bountiful turn from Robert Newton or bum for a pound Shell F.J. McCormick no character is merely a walk on part they all add weight to this clinically structured piece of work. The score by William Alwyn is right on the money and integral to realising the film's thematic heart and the ending is noir nirvana it took me 5 minutes to digest it fully during the close credits. A haunting and poetic piece of work that rare old beast that is bleakly beautiful. 910".

In a time when there are so many blow em' up action movies with actors showing the talent levels of my radio this movie can show you that there can indeed be great films that don't involve huge explosions and that much gunplay and also this movie proves that so much of a story can develop within a five mile radius if not that big and show you just how intense human drama can be. James Mason in one of his best performances ever plays Johnny McQueen an IRA member who is hunted by the law. After he is shot his friends seek help having to leave him alone in order to find someone that will help him. He must run after the cops almost find him. What ensues is a movie that is not proIRA or proBritain but an incredible characterdriven movie in a movie you would not expect to find one. The movie takes place all over the city as Johnny McQueen and all of those associated with him have an incredible adventure not to mention his love interest. The acting is beyond phenomenal these actors give these characters a great amount of depth and they seem to realize the backdrop of the conflict at hand and play the scenario perfectly.This time does not exist anymore the conflict of which this movie takes place in might but fifty years later attitudes traditions and conventions of the day have changed a lot. This movie is almost an incredible time capsule capturing the feeling of the time and the conflict of the time without telling any names you know the organization that the movie is talking about but no name is mentioned and a name really doesn't need to be mentioned. This movie is all around phenomenal in the message it conveys and the way it conveys it. Odd Man Out uses this conflict to portray an idea of peace an idea to stop killing and to stop violence. In this film the movie lends the conflict to senselessness by the end of the film the goals of both sides seem like a moot point and that all that happened as a result of the conflict was a lot of violence murder turmoil and nothing achieved. I cannot say enough that the one key to the success of the film is the acting. James Mason is in top form as the gunman that wonders around the unnamed town the supporting cast is nothing short of spectacular the acting makes this movie.By some critics this was called the best British movie in the Post World War 2 era for a number of years. In the immediate years following the war that is hard to debate odd man out is quite a spectacle a phenomenal film without question. The movie is so many things a great character study a brilliant film exploring man's own problems with it's own kind a sad movie a love story and a movie that exemplifies the way movies should be made obviously I give this movie a glowing endorsement. Many people say that movies in this time had shallow characters that were unoriginal and unrealistic. This movie shows just the opposite and if you were to watch most mainstream movies today you would find that accusation true of most modern movies but this movie shows just how strange and sometimes remarkable we are and shows very mush in it's own way how different we are and I love movies like this where the characters are what make the movie the plot is important too but it is the unique and unexpected characters that make this movie so much more than a standard movie this movie is a classic. This is a movie that is almost mesmerizing engrossing to the point you almost forget where you are few movies achieve that this is definitely an achievement for British cinema and an achievement for cinema overall.".

Recently escaped from prison he plans to rob a mill to provide funds for the organization though his colleagues urge him not to be involved. Awarded Best British Film at the British Academy Awards and nominated for an Oscar for Best Editing Odd Man Out directed by Carol Reed The Third Man is the story of a botched robbery that leads to murder and the attempt of a seriously wounded man to elude capture. Pursued by The Inspector Dennis O'Dea Johnny is helped by Kathleen Sullivan Kathleen Ryan a young IRA woman who loves him and tries to smuggle him out of the city. He wanders helplessly in the dark streets and alleys of Belfast buffeted by rain and snow living in cellars with derelicts constantly exposed to danger looking more like a walking zombie than a revolutionary. The tone of the film is dark and Kafkaesque with its thin line between reality and nightmare. Johnny is one of Mason's best roles especially during the early part of the film but he is submerged in the second half by a string of exaggerated supporting characters that include a demented painter Lukey Robert Newton who wants to paint his death mask a priest W.G. Fay who wants to save his soul sisters Rosie and Maudie Fay Compton and Beryl Measor who give him shelter but force him out and con man Shell F.J. McCormick who wants to use him to make money. Odd Man Out is not a political film or even a suspense thriller but a surreal allegory of the limits of man's compassion. When Lukey looks at Johnny and says I understand what I see in him. The truth about us all we can see ourselves  running for our life scared and alone awaiting the encroaching night.".

It is strange and almost at times hallucinatory but after all Johnny is often hallucinating in his pain and fever and this dreamlike quality is quite appropriate  the slow thoughts of a man before he dies as he tries to figure out what it was about and where he may be going. Reed does so much with film without dialog  his closeups of faces his soft dark streets and odd angles turn very difficult concepts and feelings into a visual masterpiece.

	schema:headline " Johnny McQueen  not Norman Main";
	schema:reviewBody "In his later years when James Mason was interviewed on television or in magazines he was inevitably asked what role of all of his films he thought his best one  and he gave an honest but unexpected answer. Instead of choosing his best recalled roles in A STAR IS BORN Norman Main or Uncle Nicholas in THE SEVENTH VEIL or Captain Nemo TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA or the Marquis of Rohan in THE MAN IN GRAY or Humbert Humbert in LOLITA or Van Dam in NORTH BY NORTHWEST he chose Johnny McQueen the doomed IRA man in ODD MAN OUT. It certainly was a good performance  whether it is his best performance or his star turn with Judy Garland in A STAR IS BORN remains for individuals to guess. But it certainly is compelling. It is also a serious allegory on the abandonment of a Christlike figure.Johnny McQueen does not start out Christlike  he is a gunman planning a bank robbery with his gang including Cyril Cusack for funds for the IRA. But there are a series of problems that arise in the bank robbery culminating in Johnny killing the manager of the branch and getting seriously wounded. His coconspirators in their panic abandon him to get away. They are the first people in the city of Belfast who will continuously abandon or dump or try to use Johnny in the next twentyfour hours while the police Denis O'Dea and his loyal girlfriend Katherine Kathleen Ryan and his priest Father Tom W.G.Fay try to find him before it is too late. But O'Dea is seeking him for eventual trial and execution while Ryan and Fay want to get him out of Belfast back to Eire.What happens is like a repudiation of the story of the Good Samaritan with Johnny as the injured man passed by good people. Nobody who Johnny stumbles on wants to touch him. A pair of women whose home he stumbles into doesn't want the husband of one of them to see him. William Hartnell as a bartender is angry when Johnny is dropped off at his pub  he hides him until he can be dumped into the street. There are also others who would briefly protect him for their own reasons. Robert Newton is a mad painter who wants to have him as a subject he'd be the face of Christ curiously enough. As poor Johnny is increasingly disoriented by his loss of blood and lack of care he hallucinates at this point  and actually has a brief religious moment thinking he is talking to Father Tom. But the latter is unable to speak clearly in Johnny's delirium. Still Johnny is able to recall what his religious faith meant when he was a youth. It is this sequence that is usually considered the highpoint of the story.Given the long history of sectarian strife in Ireland and Belfast in particular ODD MAN OUT does a remarkable job at being fair minded. No hint of religious bigotry rears it's head  it is just a matter of sympathy with an underdog who can't protect himself in a sea of indifferent hostility. The tragedy is played out with inevitability  and yet the film's conclusion mingles a sense of triumph with the tragedy as Johnny finally is brought safely home.".

Whether it be to dismantle a bomb save a kidnapee or to get to a senior prom but so many of them handle it carelessly showing gratuitous shots of clocks the ticking sounds the frantic pacing. If only films could deal with passing moments as beautifully as Odd Man Out.James Mason plays Johnny McQueen an IRA man who has just been shot after a botched robbery in which he killed a cop. During the escape he falls out of the moving vehicle and flees to an abandoned shack. McQueen's only hope is his girlfriend and IRA comrades to come and save him as he bleeds to death.Odd Man out does the race against time concept one better by having the man himself be the goal. Johnny is dying right before our eyes and even though he's killed someone we really want to see him get through this because we know he's good. So every time one of Johnny's partners gets caught or the police search his home we know that's one moment closer to Johnny's death one step away from him being saved. A lesser film would have used Johnny merely as a device to show an array of characters and keep the story moving. But this is Johnny's story and even though there are scenes upon scenes where he doesn't make a sound or where he's in the background as people argue over him  every single moment of this film is riveting right up to one of the best endings ever.".

It portrays a Belfast which seems to have been manufactured entirely in Hollywood where everyone is mistyeyed about 'The Organisation' clearly meant to be the IRA and its perceived struggle against the tyranny of the forces of law and order.

The magnificent eclectic cast of characters and the incredible story of how Johnny McQueenJames Mason the chief leader of this renegade political group who have been selling weapons to people in the city having escaped from prison and struggling with lightheadedness is able to remain free from the authorities due to the often unintentional aid of others..most neither siding for or against himare definite reasons to check this one out. Carol ReedThe Third Man directed with a sure hand perfectly able to capture a city gripped by the activities of McQueen and his crime organization. You witness how others seek to benefit from McQueen since there's a price on his head. The film's emotional core however is Kathleen SullivanKathleen Ryanand her fearless devotion and love for McQueen willing to sacrifice her very life to find him. WG Fay is a delight as Father Tom a beacon of trust for many in his community attempting to offer spiritual refuge to those in need. FJ McCormick is derelict Shell seeking at first to profit for informing others of McQueen's location later recanting such feelings to help him. Mason proves here just why he'd become such an amazing actor for many decades to come. The use of rain and snow is very effective as we witness McQueen trying to forge his way to some type of freedom ducking into alleyways or behind bushes at times seeking rest as his body slowly slips away.

We feel sympathy for Johnny from the very first beginning of the movie  .Johnny wanted to avoid using the guns and finally he never intended to shoot someone. It just was an accident due to the scuffle. Did I kill that fellow? Johnny asked so many times. I mean he really cared about what he had done. So we could ask ourselves What I would have done being in Rosie's position? She was not after the reward! She certainly COULD have hidden Johnny upstairs in the sleeping room and the police wouldn't have found him there would they? You could recognize her sympathy for Johnny her worry about his health in her eyes....but her husband had to do his damn duty! And how much Johnny wanted to stay in the warm and quiet house!Until he heard them argue about him and finally what Rose'husband said about him caused him to leave  but it would have been more than easy to stop him from leaving being in this weak condition It's so heartbreaking to see that Johnny has to leave again  hardly able to stand up or to walk  outside in this terrible rain and into the cold which soon turned into snow....I wouldn't have let him go again!...Every time I watch it Rosie's husband makes me upset!....I am quite sure if her husband would have agreed to care for Johnny and to hide him in the house  she would have done that. But this damn husband had not better idea than offering him some of his whiskey to help him... Every time we see Johnny he becomes weaker and he simply can not find a warm place to rest people to care for his wounds it's a long and sad odyssey but the end even though it is so sad is the best for both! Absolutely remarkable is how much James Mason is able to talk only with his eyes expressing his blank despair even when he doesn't say a word with his unique voice his performance is so gripping...Of course I also have to mention all the other actors in that film which simply also gave a terrific performance everyone of them played just so natural and simply perfect! WHAT A UNIQUE MASTERPIECE !!!BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN!!! Will always be my favorite of all times.".

From here I subscribed to the alltoocommon but completely erroneous idea that Orson Welles had directed parts of the film which might explain why it turned out so damn good. That I hadn't ever heard Reed mentioned as a distinguished veteran of British cinema is disheartening and ludicrous for even after only three of his films I see no reason why he should not be held aloft alongside the likes of Michael PowellEmeric Pressburger and David Lean. 'The Third Man' had an Ealingstyle whimsy that worked superbly well in the lopsided streets of postWar Vienna but Reed's 'Odd Man Out 1947' is equally engrossing a sombre and straightfaced exploration of political unrest in Northern Ireland.Though his film follows  and to an extent sympathises with  the activities of an IRAlike organisation Reed largely avoids making any sort of political statement. The story opens with a brief titlecard in which we are assured that it is not concerned with the struggle between the law and an illegal organisation but only with the conflict in the hearts of the people when they become unexpectedly involved. The involvement of a terrorist organisation in the story is not to show support for the IRA or similar causes but to suggest how political differences have eroded society's morals to such an extent that perfectly decent people will not extend their hand to help a dying man. As Johnny McQueen James Mason stumbles through the bitter winter snowstorm frozen and bleeding following a botched robbery attempt he is passed from one person to another each of whom either turns him back out into the cold lest they become implicated in his crime or they exploit him for their own selfish means.What works so magnificently about 'Odd Man Out' is how authentically Reed is able to establish mood. The story unfolds in a single day the bulk of which is spent in the darkness of a cold winter's night snowflakes falling delicately to the ground lending the film an icy chill that even though it's approaching summer down here had me drawing the clothes tighter to my body. No small praise should go towards Australianborn cinematographer Robert Krasker whose elegant photography captures both the cold despair of the winter snowstorm and the persistent warmth in the eyes of McQueen's young love Kathleen Kathleen Sullivan. In American noir you usually come facetoface with grotesque characters who are frightening and ugly in British films and I'm not exactly sure why this is there's a certain charm about the grotesque. F.J. McCormick plays a doddering bum who tries hopelessly to profit from his discovery of Mason's dying fugitive and yet his character is oddly likable. Robert Newton likewise plays an eccentric humorouslyflamboyant artist whose one obsession is to paint the portrait of a doomed soul.".

	schema:headline " Odd Man Out Is a Winner!";
	schema:reviewBody "Who will ever forget the theme music for Odd Man Out? In an inspired departure from the norm director Carol Reed asked the composer to write the score from the shooting script and record it so that Mason could walk in time to the beat. It's no accident that Reed is the man behind two of Britain's most memorable movies so far as music is concerned. The other of course is The Third Man to which this film bears more than a passing resemblance. In both movies there is a thin shadowy line between heroes and villains. Both Johnny McQueen and Harry Lime have their admirers and lovers. In both films their admirers let them down badly but the lovers remain faithful until the end.On the other hand both films have a distinctively different noir atmosphere. Odd Man has an almost 19th century flavor as the camera tracks down deserted streets crisscrossed with occasional horsedrawn carriages. Then suddenly the heroine is thrust into a hall jammed with American servicemen dancing to strident frantic bursts of music. She leaves quickly and as she closes the door it's almost as if she's shutting the modern world behind her in favor of a romanticized past an aura of lost causes Romeo and Juliet trysts and death as the culmination of love and desire. The end of the enigmatic Christfigure Johnny McQueen is always in sight even as the story twists and turns into unexpected deadends and alleyways introducing a number of wellrounded intriguing characters superbly enacted by Fay McCormick Ryan Cusack O'Dea Hartnell Newton and company.Although a number of critics selected Odd Man Out as one of the best films of 1947 the most important honors in 1948 Great Britain were the National Film Awards. These were selected by picturegoers themselves who voted in the annual Daily Mail polls. The number of voters in 1948? 2781751! The people's choice? The Courtneys of Curzon Street followed by Great Expectations and then Odd Man Out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Who will ever forget the theme music for Odd Man Out? In an inspired departure from the norm director Carol Reed asked the composer to write the score from the shooting script and record it so that Mason could walk in time to the beat. It's no accident that Reed is the man behind two of Britain's most memorable movies so far as music is concerned. The other of course is The Third Man to which this film bears more than a passing resemblance. In both movies there is a thin shadowy line between heroes and villains. Both Johnny McQueen and Harry Lime have their admirers and lovers. In both films their admirers let them down badly but the lovers remain faithful until the end.On the other hand both films have a distinctively different noir atmosphere. Odd Man has an almost 19th century flavor as the camera tracks down deserted streets crisscrossed with occasional horsedrawn carriages. Then suddenly the heroine is thrust into a hall jammed with American servicemen dancing to strident frantic bursts of music. She leaves quickly and as she closes the door it's almost as if she's shutting the modern world behind her in favor of a romanticized past an aura of lost causes Romeo and Juliet trysts and death as the culmination of love and desire. The end of the enigmatic Christfigure Johnny McQueen is always in sight even as the story twists and turns into unexpected deadends and alleyways introducing a number of wellrounded intriguing characters superbly enacted by Fay McCormick Ryan Cusack O'Dea Hartnell Newton and company.Although a number of critics selected Odd Man Out as one of the best films of 1947 the most important honors in 1948 Great Britain were the National Film Awards. These were selected by picturegoers themselves who voted in the annual Daily Mail polls. The number of voters in 1948? 2781751! The people's choice? The Courtneys of Curzon Street followed by Great Expectations and then Odd Man Out.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film in view of its mention in Harold Pinter's play Old Times I was somewhat intrigued by the mention as I'd had the film waiting for an airing for a while taped from a B.B.C. 2 showing.It is interesting that Pinter's play uses the film as one of the battlegrounds of memory jostled for by Deeley and Anna the characters trying to gain the upper hand in terms of their subjective views of what happened in the past. Odd Man Out is surely one of the most atypically artisticslanted British films of the time. While there were the peculiarly powerful Powell and Pressuburger films the artful British Hitchcocks the lucrative Lean literary projects there had been little sign that such a film as Odd Man Out would be attempted. The film positively revels in cinema's possibilities shots are obscured in a stained dizzy relaxing of focus the landscape is opened up celebrated and chastised in its bleakness and beauty. There are many bravura sequences of visual imagery here from the director Carol Reed and his cinematographer Robert Krasker. Tellingly Reed hired Krasker two years later to photograph the legendary The Third Man for him. This is a film where questions of morality and philosophy are intermingled with the distinction of the film's form. If one leaves realism at the door when coming to this film half the battle is won. As the opening disclaimer states the film is not an attempt to confront directly the Northern Irish political troubles. It is a study of human emotion stretched forth upon a wide canvass.Odd Man Out becomes increasingly episodic pretty quickly there is no languid lingering focus on Kathleen Ryan's convincing heroine or the dynamic within the terrorist group. The retina is trained over Mason's seemingly haphazard 'odyssey' through the city he is a man perpetually fading from life it seems barely a verbal player in the film yet a tremulous presence throughout. The support is dynamic the insidious F.J. McCormick the redoubtable William Hartnell and W.G. Fay as the catholic cleric Father Tom who at times seems nearly a charlatan. It's great to see Hartnell as ever... the first Doctor in the lovable British telefantasy series Dr Who. He is always a compelling noteworthy actor here embellishing a very minor brief role with much gravitas and precise methodology. Apparently Wilfred Brambell was in it somewhere... in an uncredited role I can well imagine him somewhere around in this picture. He was indeed Irish of birth.Newton's performance seems caught in some debate or other. Pauline Kael and others have condemned it as showy and exaggerated some commentators and indeed Deeley in Old Times view it as a great performance. Without going into depth on Deeley's character it seems interesting that this comparatively brief appearance of a character be so examined. Be sure Newton's performance like many of his is no attempt at realistic acting Lukey is a largerthanlife 'significant' part... and it works wonderfully. The introduction of this character shifts the picture further away from perhaps the hypnotic effect of the earlier passages. The strokes become broader as this dominating painter enters the picture. This actually works pretty well however providing a certain vivacity to the later parts although an end section truer to the film's early mood may have made the film a more tight consistent experience.In precis this is a remarkably offthebeatentrack accomplishment in the annals of British film. It manages to present a relatively balanced nonhysterical view of the I.R.A. for one thing. Odd Man Out is one of the most beautifully filmed British motion pictures to this day and one of the most ambitious. It is not quite a tencarat masterwork but it is very close  a sprawling resplendent film that encompasses an impressive tableau.Rating  12".

In the end though I can't empathise with McQueen no matter how much he suffers unlike for example Alex in A Clockwork Orange who is much worse because he's responsible by his own actions for the mess he's in. The Organisation is of course a nomdeguerre for the Irish Republican Army and the unnamed city probably Belfast but the film doesn't make the mistake of addressing political issues  it's purely a drama full of compassion and insight into human nature.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Mistress of Spices is based on the novel by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and is the directorial debut for Paul Mayeda Berges. Berges has worked previously with his wife Gurinder Chadha on a number of films including Bend it Like Beckham and Bride and Prejudice. Chadha cowrote the screenplay here with her husband.The movie follows Tilo played by Aishwarya Rai who is a member of an old mystical cult that worships spice in all its forms. She is sent to Oakland to open a shop and help people using the mysterious powers of the spices. Tilo who also has the power to see visions of the future soon ends up helping a whole coterie of characters a man Anupam Kher who is distressed over his granddaughter Padma Lakshmi a woman who has grown up in America and adopted western ways much to his dismay Jagjit Sonny Gill Dulay a teenager who is having trouble with the kids at school Haroun Nitin Chandra Ganatra a cab driver that has a cloudy future Kwesi Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje a man trying to win the heart of a woman.But to be successful Tilo must follow three rules one she must never leave the store two she must never touch the skin of another person three she can never use the spices for her own gain. One day a man Dylan McDermott falls off his motorcycle outside her store and they are both instantly drawn to one another challenging Tilo's devotion to her cause and threatening her control over the spices.This is a nice light film reminiscent in many ways of Chocolat with Aishwarya Rai in the Juliette Binoche role. Rai is luminous on screen and the chemistry between her and Dylan McDermott is good. I didn't think the voiceover narration of Rai's character's inner thoughts was entirely successful although I can't see how else you could really do it funny enough the voiceovers reminded me of another spicerelated movie David Lynch's Dune. The movie explores a bit of the mixing between east and west and the conflict between old and new but not quite as successfully as some of Berges' and Chadha's other films but that is probably due more to the limitations of creating an adaptation.".

Therefore the flawed story has no originality and is quite boring and messy in many moments. However the cinematography is wonderful with magnificent colors highlighted on DVD. Further the gorgeous Miss World 1994 and Queen of Bollywood Aishwarya Rai makes this little film worth with her beauty and participating in most of the scenes. My vote is six.Title Brazil O Sabor da Magia The Flavor of Magic".

I was expecting something simple dumb yet enchanting  something in the realm of Chocolat or Bewitched. This however was WAY below my expectations and I think that could have been prevented by simply adding one ingredient  a different director.Aishwarya is absolutely beautiful and I'm sure that she can act  when she's given something to work with. Unfortunately her only given function in the movie is to stare wideeyed out the window of her shop at the world around her. How disappointing. Then there's Dylan McDermott the beautiful stranger who captures the mistress' attention. He's cute enough to pull off his part well and seems to be the master of sultry stares. Then comes the myriad of regular customers bright and interesting personalities that could have been the highlight of this movie if it weren't for the director's insistence on putting random Tilo voiceovers in whenever the customers were about to say something interesting. Was it really necessary for them to be constantly interrupted?The problem isn't in the story  it's quite enchanting. Banal yes but what movie isn't nowadays? The problem was the lack of subtlety. OH NOES! DANGER! THE CAMERA'S SUDDENLY FOCUSSING ON A PILE OF RED CHILI PEPPERS! The problem got so serious that 20 minutes into the movie the audience including myself would laugh at every chili pepper that came onto the screen. Constant flashes forward to events that may or may not happen? Unnecessary. Doug's extremely random backstory that doesn't greatly affect the plot? Unnecessary. The store suddenly collapsing thanks to mysterious unexplained powers? Weird and again unnecessary. If only Gurinder Chadra the screenwriter had directed this. I really enjoyed her Bend it Like Beckham which nicely mixed cheesy Bollywood cinema with modern dromedy. I think something much nicer and much more tasteful would have been produced.".

Although Toronto has a very large Indian population Indians were a small percentage of the audience at my screening.A few additional comments to the earlier review The director producer author and Dylan McDermott were at my screening to answer questions. Apparently Gurinder has wanted to make a movie of the book ever since it was published. Chitra Divakaruni the author said she was very happy with the movie even though in some ways it is different from the book. The movie tried to retain the spirit of the book even though some details have changed. For example the young Tilo is captured by pirates in the movie but escapes very quickly and swims to the island when she goes to Oakland she keeps her own body thank God!and doesn't turn into an old woman etc.in other wordsthe movie tries to keep to the main story and avoids complications as much as possible.The main problem I had with the movie is that it is very important to accept the magical atmosphere. But the movie starts with Tilo already in the spice shop in Oakland then shows how she got there in a series of flashbacks. If you don't already know the story I think that makes it harder to accept. Presenting the story in chronological order as the book does might have been better since you could understand the magic from the beginning instead of starting off in Oakland which is not a very magical place to most people.Another issue was the stories of the various customersthese stories are necessary to show the various magical effects of the spices but too much of that would distract you from the main story. I think the balance was just about right but there were some loose endsI would like to have seen just a bit more of the Padma Lakshmi character for example. It was these side stories that added the humor to the movie.I am a huge Aishwarya fan and I was happy. She did a very good job and for once the director allowed the camera to spend some time focusing on her face instead of cutting away immediately and there were a lot of closeups. Naturally Aishwarya was in almost every scene.The story itself is fairly simple. Since Aishwarya can't leave the store there's not a lot of actionhow many times can you pick up a handful of spices and make it interesting? But you got involved in the characters and wanted them to get together. When they finally have their night of passion they kiss almost everywhere but the lips...I assume to keep the taboo of Indian films. The director made the wise choice of going for closeups as Dylan undresses hervery erotic.".

She does this by means of a Spice Bazaar store in San Francisco where customers seek her for help. It is quite interesting to see how she helps her diverse clientle and loyal customers through the use of spices which by the way seems very possible as Indian herbal medicine argues that different spices have different chemicals that control our mind and body. However being a mistress of spices Aishwarya is bound by certain rules which she begins to find suppressing and enslaving once she begins to fall in love. What is interesting about this movie is that there is not much of a plot and mainly just a small store for sets. This film looks at the art of using spices to improve lives and delves into Aishwarya's internal conflict between love and duty making this a very interesting and reinvigorating movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult for any one who has a good appreciation for culinary art not to be attracted to this spicy shop spacious tastefully appointed with thousands of colourful spices displayed in so many different interesting fashions. A sheer joy for the eyes.So is Aishwaryi Rai Miss World of 1994 who graces the screen with wideeyed innocence through most of the movie and appears in the last scene radiating with alluring glamour in a bright red evening gown with her hair finally let down falling like graceful ripples to her shoulder.Even accepting the premise of a fairy tale it's hard to believe how Tilo Rai can run her spice shop all by herself without EVER leaving it the first of three conditions for having her power bestowed by the spices. The second is easier to abide by if one is careful not to touch the skin of any human being. The third is not to use the power to benefit herself. This power is a vague ability to see other people's past and sometimes future and to use spices to help them.The romance with dashing architect Doug Dylan McDermott is appropriately lowkey and hence believable. Subplots include Tilo's various customers with their assortment of problems many caused by cultural clashes in southern California.All told this is a delightful little fairy tale which is particularly pleasant visually. I can't help but think that it should also come with these new gimmicks as a movie with smells. This is the perfect movie for it.".

A sheer joy for the eyes.So is Aishwaryi Rai Miss World of 1994 who graces the screen with wideeyed innocence through most of the movie and appears in the last scene radiating with alluring glamour in a bright red evening gown with her hair finally let down falling like graceful ripples to her shoulder.Even accepting the premise of a fairy tale it's hard to believe how Tilo Rai can run her spice shop all by herself without EVER leaving it the first of three conditions for having her power bestowed by the spices. The second is easier to abide by if one is careful not to touch the skin of any human being. The third is not to use the power to benefit herself. This power is a vague ability to see other people's past and sometimes future and to use spices to help them.The romance with dashing architect Doug Dylan McDermott is appropriately lowkey and hence believable. Subplots include Tilo's various customers with their assortment of problems many caused by cultural clashes in southern California.All told this is a delightful little fairy tale which is particularly pleasant visually. I can't help but think that it should also come with these new gimmicks as a movie with smells. This is the perfect movie for it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what to say about this film. I went into it with zero expectations apart from Aishwarya Rai to look stunning. So I was sort of pleasantly surprised. Make no mistake though it is a poor film.Ill keep it short because there isn't really much to say.Story Tilo Aishwarya is part of some ancient mystical cult which uses the power of spices to heal people around the world. So she sets up shop in Oakland. She also has to relinquish any sort of personal desires and can never leave the shop. Then she meets Doug Dylan McDermott and so the normal culture clash thing which pops up in every single one of Gurinder Chadha's films ensues. Blah blah blah...the end There are numerous flaws but Ill start with the positives The Good  Aishwarya looked great. And she had a consistent accent. Performance was relatively good given the other flaws inherent in this film  Santosh Sivan did a great job with cinematography. San Francisco looked fantastic Errm I think thats about it The Bad  The script was weak. there was no character development and it was padded out too much with contrived and unnecessary subplots. Anupam Kher was so badly wasted. I mean I think that some subplot was needed to show the way the spices work or however you want to word it but they really detracted form the main story which itself wasn't up to much in the first place.I think the very basic concept of the film was handled poorly. the makers never seemed to know themselves whether they were making a realistic film or some sort of magicalmystical fantasy. And resultantly there was no sort of ambiance buildup or anything to keep someone interested to the end of it.Absolutely no chemistry at all between Aishwarya and Dylan McDermott  On the same point the performances were average at best. I think the fault does lie in the script and the direction as no one had any real scope for performance and they were all just basically required to look good for the camera.Unnecessary voiceovers really got to me As I said if you go in with no expectations at all you could well enjoy it but its still a poorly made film.410".

So Doug asks her again when she remains quiet ...Is something bad? Like High Carb Spice or something? ROTFLMFAO! Hilariously priceless!Sitting through The Mistress of Spices might not inspire High Carb Spice moments in most viewers but if you're one of those people who appreciate an Independent flick every now and then a sort of escape from your predictably humongous Blockbusters like the ones from your YashRaj banners Karan Johar Et. Al. you'll appreciate The Mistress of Spices.From the novel of the same name by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and coming to from the duo behind sleeper hits like 'Bend it like Beckham' 'What's Cooking?' and 'Bride  Prejudice' Paul Mayeda Berges  Gurinder Chadha. TMOS reunites Aishwarya Rai with a few of her costars Anupam Kher from Bride and Prejudice Mohabbatein Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai  ...Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya  Nitin Chandra Ganatra in Bride  Prejudice and has her starring as the main character a young woman named Tilo whose penchant for clairvoyance since childhood helped determine the life she now lives. She is a child who became a woman too quickly in order to further impact the lives of others. She is an elemental of sorts an angel scarred by a tragic past. Transported via supernatural medium from India to America Tilo now a woman owns and manages a spice bazaar in downtown San Francisco where she works her magic on everyone and anyone who dares to cross her path. Her magic formulas are so good that nobody even bothers to ask her where she came from how she mastered the spices where she lives or what she does in her off time. That is until a chanced motorcycle accident leads her meet Doug Played by Dylan McDermott a man with a dark secret of his own who becomes smitten with Tilo the moment he sets his eyes on her. Before that very moment in the movie we had been introduced to Tilo favourite and most loyal customers Geeta's grandfather played by Anupam KherGeeta is played by Padma Lakshmi Kwesi played by Adewale Akinnouye Agbaje Myisha played by Caroline Chikezie Haroun played by Nitin Chandra Ganatra  Jagjit his mum is actually the customer but he is the one with the problem played by Sonny Gill Dulay. The reason why these people are all key characters is because once Tilo breaks the law of the spices by fraternising with Doug they will all be ultimately impacted by the repercussions of her actions. One of the strictest rules elementals like Tilo have to adhere to is that they must not allow another to touch their body and vice versa and another is the fact that they must not give their heart to another. Initially Tilo tries her best to rebuff Doug's advances but despite the harsh warnings of the chillies in the bazaar as well as her better judgment she allows herself to fall in love with him. This opens up a can of worms literally and otherwise forcing Tilo to choose between her two lovers  the spices and her spiceDoug. Aishwarya Rai plays Tilo to the pulp as an innocent as a young woman wanting to break free and live as an understated beauty who knows nothing but spices and most importantly as an enigma. It was too bad that McDermott couldn't make Doug meet her halfway. In my humble opinion he was miscast in the role. Kher's underwritten character gives room for Rai to use her Tilo to outshine his normally spectacular acting chops. Ganatra turns in another up to par performance and his charming chemistry with Rai is still intact in the scenes they share together. The worst offender here is Padma Lakhsmi who a young rebellious teenager named Geeta Ms. Lakshmi was 35 playing a teenager by the way who is about to marry a Chicano MexicanAmerican against the wishes of her Hindu parents the 'Chicano' scene is another funny one in the movie but Lakhsmi ruins it with her bad acting  emoting. My advice to her is to join Lisa Ray Water BollywoodHollywood at Drama school in London or simply not quit her day job as a high fashion model.I strongly suspect that half of the critics who panned this movie didn't bother to watch it or were just echoing wordofmouth from others. Aishwarya Rai did the best she could with this role and she truly shines in it. She handled even the lovescene very well and looked divine in the one scene where she spiced things up in a red sari. There will always be problems with 'BooktoScreen' adaptations that's a given but the solution is not to blame the actors.What's your Spice? D".

The story was created and directed by Paul Mayeda Berges with help from Gurinder Chada who has given us such fine films as Paris je t'aime' 'Bride  Prejudice' and 'Bend It Like Beckham'. So the question arises as to why this film just doesn't quite make it the reason may be the tough marriage of fantasy with reality assigning more importance to dialog between the Mistress and the spices than to the development of storyline.Tilo the ravishingly beautiful Aishwarya Rai was taken in as a child by a spiritually inclined First Mother Zohra Sehgal who trains young girls the mysteries of spices  their magic their meaning and their rigid life style imposed on the developing Mistresses. Those who gain the secrets of the spices are sent into the world warned never to use the magic for them selves never to touch human skin and never to leave the shops where their spices are shared to help mankind. Tilo moves to the Bay Area and does good deeds for her customers until she meets Doug Dylan McDermott who needs her care after a motorcycle accident. They touch their eyes speak of mutual desire and Tilo is thrown into conflict of being a mistress of spices or of having a love life. How situations and destiny work through the story is the meager line of the tale the majority of the script is Tilo communicating with her spices!The cast contains some fine character actors such as Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje Caroline Chikezie Anupam Kher and of course Zohra Sehgal. And there is enough statement about immigrant status in America to keep the story topical. THE MISTRESS OF SPICES entertains and that is a pleasure.

There is no chemistry between the leading actors. There is very poor character development. Lots of bits of information is thrown in about various characters without linking it to the story. Ashwarya Rai's voice over after a while becomes boring. Lots of other minor characters are added I think just to fill up the blank pages of the script. The spices are only an excuse to give a movie its title. I am sure some of spice add makers could have done more justice to the spices. The music in places is pathetic. Anupam Kher tries hard with his performance but fails to add any relevance to the story line. This film does not deserve to be associated with Gurvinder Chadda. Is her name being used for promoting her husbands lacking talent?".

Right from the beginning the viewer has to wonder about the motivation. Why on earth does Tilo go to San Francisco and why is she designated the Mistress of Spices? Yes of course there is small reference to the upheavals and uprisings in India and going to San Francisco could have been for reasons of escape. However this is not made at all clear and the next time we see Tilo she is in her spice shop greeting a number of stereotyped types with trivial boring dialogue. It doesn't stand very well on its own but when compared to other culturallycentric films such as Like Water for Chocolate East is East it brings up the bottom of the spice barrel. You'd be better off going to a good Indian restaurant rather than wasting your time and money on this film.".

But of course villains enter and want to use 'her gift' to find their fortune. Without revealing too much she finally ends up at her destiny and is transported from India to America to live as The Mistress Of Spices. There she runs a spice shop and continues to help her customers with her spices without revealing the true meaning and job of them. She has the ability to see into their lives and is therefore capable of helping them. Of course for the spices to work she has to live by significant rules she is never allowed to step outside her store never touch another skin never fall in love and love and live only for the spices. Tilo is a character of true devotion that has never visualised temptation until she meets Doug. They immediately are attracted to each other and she starts falling in love with him. The more she falls in love with him the spices begin to go crazy. And her customers are then punished for her actions. Tilo is given a choice should she disown the spices and start a new life with Doug where her customers will be punished or should she stay faithful to the spices and lose the man she loves forever. Aishwarya Rai truly captures the character of Tilo and gives an outstanding performance. She is brilliant in this movie and her on screen chemistry with Dylan McDermott is obvious too. Her appearance in simple at the beginning but she becomes more glamorous and extremely beautiful towards the end.Dylan McDermott also portrays his character well. Doug a man who appears to have everything but feels empty. Overall the film is a huge success Paul Berges has directed with true brilliance and truly captured the title 'The Mistress Of Spices.'".

But she avoids romance in part because her instructor drilled in the need for personal sacrifice in her life's work. Also she has never been to SF despite living so close. One day a handsome motorcyclist Doug Dylan McDermott is injured in front of her shop. Tilo immediately senses that this man is trouble for her celibacy but she mixes a concoction of herbs that heals his wounds more quickly. For his part Doug is attracted to Tilo's great beauty and gentle ways. He makes a point of trying to get her to go on a date. But even spending time thinking of this man causes Tilo to lose balance and blame mishaps to her regular customers on her own inattention. Can Tilo resist Doug? Will a romance upset her world? This is an exotic stunningly beautiful film that is virtually unknown to most of the public. Perhaps fans of McDermott have sought it out lucky them. Part of the film's success lies in the glimpse into the world of Indian spices and heritage especially the strong dedication of Hindi herbalists. The movie also features two lovely performances from the stars and a great supporting cast. Costumes setting photography and a sensitive direction complete its journey to excellence. Do make a strong effort to find this gem romance and quality film fans. It will turn your head and touch your heart.".

Of course I say action but the truth is there was very little action in it.

You cannot watch this movie without going WTF at least a dozen times.

It's not that his performance is dreadful it's just ... empty and he really isn't bringing any soul to his character and I've got to say I really hope he gets better than this because I know he's going to keep trying.Anyway if you watch this brush the sick off yourself and go watch Way of the Gun so you can forgive Ryan Phillippe.In summary even casting a lead that could act probably wouldn't have save this shoddy script but there's a few good moments that will entertain.".

The plot can't decide what type of action movie it wants to be. It feels like the writers just strung a series of their favorite movie scenes from all their favorite movies randomly together. There is no action leading to the next action just 50 running around sticking a gun in everyone's face and explaining the plot over and over again.

There are more better senior actors to play this role but the casting agency seemed still believe this guy got some box office attraction. Believe you me dude he's not because he can only play the same dead fish like character in different titled movies.The other two young actors indeed tried very hard to play the roles but since the screenplay is so formulaic and so predictable they are just two very uninteresting characters in a very boring predictable movie. The only thing that needs to be recommended to these two younger actors is that they have shown been working out daily so the long chase in the busy business area didn't show any fatigue or heavy breaths in the end. Obviously the chase have been shot and edited together scene by scene so they could still look so tireless.This is a very predictable and very forgettable old movie with a new title and different actors.

I've seen much better in B movies.Dead people move their eyes  and not just a little. Bad guys give the main character second changes over and over. Looks like they went to WallMart and bought the make up for people that have been beaten up.And of course to top it all off  the famous I got shot but the bullet hit a cross around my neck saved me.. Some of the actors do an OK job but this movie really isn't worth it.I regret spending 90 minutes on this.";

Mike Gunther simply tries way to hard and is just not good at what he does. The acting plot writing and characters are outrageously cheesy extremely predictable and poorly made. I really don't know why Bruce Willis agreed to even show his face in this movie but then again he has been in some pretty questionable movies. All in all don't let Bruce Willis draw you in to watch the film as hes not really in it. Also stay away from anything Mike Gunther makes andor 50Cent Acts in.".

When one of the employees tries to kill himself Josh's views of Shaw change. He goes to see him and loses his temper and his job. The FBI agent in charge tells him that Shaw might walk and recovering the pension fund is unlikely. She tells him that it's been rumored that Shaw has 20 million lying around if he needs it in a hurry. Josh thinks he knows where it is so with two other fired employees and an evicted tenant they set out to get into Shaw's penthouse to get the money.

Other casts like Ben Stiller usually plays comedy with serious faces and as I predict also in this movie.Indeed this movie brings so much comedy in it that I can't stop laughing so many times. Clever comedy in dialog  scene and even when the action began totally brought me to a fresh moment. It's a refreshing comedy. I like it.There are several twists in this movie which makes the story even better. In things I even didn't think of the story bends a little bit and make a slight confusing moment. But not in the end I don't know why but I knew that the car must be in the pool. I knew that because it's typical. You see the pool the very first moment of the movie but then you didn't see it a lot till the end. The director surely gives clue but in the end He didn't want it to be seen clearly that the pool is the key where the car is hidden.I thought it'll be more tougher than that to break into a tower's penthouse. With all that security camera and protection explained before I don't think it'll be that easy to break in. I think it'll be more interesting if there was more tension in it.Great story. Didn't get bored at all. Perfect plan for a robbery. Good ending even not the best.710".

The last hour or so packs a lot of laughs and while the end of the movie was in most respects a feelgood ending the movie didn't lapse into a complete saccharinefilled conclusion by making sure that Josh Ben Stiller ended up in jail for his part in the heist. The last hour was very strong and the ending was very good and the first part while a bit dry was still good enough to hold my interest.One of the primary problems with the opening half of this is that there are honestly far too many characters to introduce so to give us a taste of all of them who they were what their background was what their purpose to the story was took up a lot of time. The cast could probably have been shaved by a third without a lot being lost. Having said that the cast was likable enough. I thought everyone offered a good performance and while the cast was large by the end no one really seemed extraneous.Aside from Stiller who's always capable enough the primary members of the cast were Alan Alda as investment guru Arthur Shaw charged with fraud including stealing the pension money of the employees in the luxury apartment tower in which he lives Eddie Murphy as street crook Slide who gets taken on as a sort of technical adviser when some of the employees of the tower decide to rob Shaw's apartment to get their money back and Tea Leoni as FBI Agent Claire Denham who's out to get Shaw and develops a friendship with and sympathy for Josh. The story's funny and includes some pretty hairraisingly funny scenes particularly revolving around some of the heights involved in stealing the car from Shaw's apartment. Overall I really enjoyed this. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Tower Heist is about working joes who discover that a fat cat who lives in the highrent apartment in which they work has absconded with the employees' pensions a la Bernie Madoff. So the joes decide to rob the guy to get their money back by way of a wacky plan and the help of a jaded career thief and other standards of the plot.The Tower is a standin for Trump Tower it's been said a high rise with high rollers. Josh Kovacs Ben Stiller is the building manager and like all good managers knows everything about each of his tenants. He even plays chess over the computer with the penthouse resident Arthur Shaw Alan Alda a financial muckitymuck who's so wealthy he owns one of Steve McQueen's old Ferraris. Ah but then Shaw is nabbed by the FBI for running a Ponzi scheme. Josh is quick to defend his friend until he learns that his staff's pensions are gone with the wind  and that Shaw may have 20 million in undeclared money still in his apartment.Josh confronts Shaw and quickly loses both his cool and his job then along with his brother and lawconcierge Charlie Casey Affleck former finance guyturnedsquatter Mr. Fitzhugh Matthew Broderick and the new elevator operator Enrique Michael Pena he comes up with a plan to get everyone their money back in just the way you'd expect from a movie plot  a harebrained scheme. This one involves bringing in a criminal named Slide Eddie Murphy for help and backup. I know what you're thinking Eddie Murphy? Count me out. This will be crap. Please read on.The movie is not crap. I found it to be entertaining. I know it seems implausible but hear me out. The movie is supposed to be inspired by the Ocean's 11 films but it owes quite a bit to a lamentedly overlooked film Who's Minding the Mint?  which starred Jim Hutton and a cast of odd characters trying to break into the U.S. Mint. In that classic a complex plan is invoked with each character assigned a particular cast. Same here fewer characters. Doesn't matter  like the older film unforeseen roadblocks emerge trust is violated and shenanigans ensue.So why did I find it entertaining? It's so well cast. Stiller could have played this as a slapstick caricature role but he plays it mostly straight in fact he forgoes the nebbishness entirely and makes his character believable simply through leadership capability forward thinking and so on. Josh isn't a small man thrust into a big situation he is a normal man who truly does know his stuff and forms a plan to reach a particular goal  just as you'd imagine a reallife hotel manager to be.Eddie Murphy also plays his role with a lot more subtlety than you'd expect. You might think he would burst into fullon Axel Foley role or some overthetop mean ol' gangsta wannabe but he doesn't. Oh his Slide is a bit of a bastard but the point is that he is a completely believable bastard. The script allows Murphy to well act instead of simply playing a role. That's an important distinction I think. How many times has Eddie Murphy played a role that made you think anything other than Oh there's Eddie Murphy? Not many Dreamgirls comes to mind. He's so fluid and natural in this movie that you almost forget he's supposed to be Eddie Murphy Superstar. I think the film is also served well by what appears to be a simple plot. Is it that simple though? Is it possible that you get to the end to find that things aren't quite what they seemed? And when you watch the movie don't you have a preset notion of how it'll end? Perhaps it ends that way and perhaps it doesn't. For me though I found the ending to be the best of all worlds  plausible not too tidy and still at least a mild surprise.I singled out Stiller and Murphy for their great work here but there really are a lot of other good performances Broderick Pena Alda Tea Leoni FBI agent Affleck Stephen Henderson and Gabourey Sidibe the latter is really terrific. Oh and here's the best part. The movie is directed by Brett Ratner but there are no wiseass cops to be found and thank goodness no explosions. Not a one. You'd never know Ratner directed it. Tower Heist succeeds because it doesn't lose sight of what it wants to be  a comedic caper nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be overly complex like those Ocean's films. It doesn't rely on deep characterizations. It doesn't allow itself to get tripped up in minutia. It is simply a wellthoughtout wellputtogether film with fine believable acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "They say don't judge a book by its cover so I guess when it comes to a movie one shouldn't necessarily judge the movie by its title or its lead actor. I say this because I have never really warmed to Ben Stiller all that much and generally find him bland and boring but I guess that is the nature of his characters. In many ways he comes across as you typical hard working pleb and he does so in this film. However what Ben Stiller lacks is easily made up by Eddie Murphy despite him only having a supporting character based upon screen time because it still appears that he is playing a lead role.This film is following on the tails of numerous other films that have appeared since the collapse of the American Banking system and the ponzi schemes that were exposed since in particular Mardoff who has earned the moniker of the 'Bad Guy of the GFC' despite him being only one player is a massive conspiracy of greed. While the story is simply a rehash of the many standard 'give your life savings to some Wall Street financier and then get it back because it turns out that he is a thief' I felt aspects of this film made it very entertaining particularly Eddie Murphy.Anyway Stiller is the manager of an exclusive apartment complex called the tower and he is on good terms with everybody until his boss is arrested for securities fraud and they discover that their pension fund which was invested through him have now become worthless. He one of his coworkers tries to commit suicide because all of the money that he had saved is now gone he decides to do something which involves smashing up a very expensive Ferrari more expensive that it actually appears as you will find out. After losing his job he gets drunk with an FBI agent who proceeds to tell him how to rob the building.So Stiller gets together a bunch of others who have been affected by the crisis and with the help of a con Eddie Murphy work out a way of breaking into one of the most secure buildings in New York. Obviously as I said Murphy simply shines in this roll and every time I see him play one of these rolls it always makes me think of how pretty much 90 of the black comedians who play the fast talking cop or crim are simply following in his footsteps. In a way I suspect nobody really actually connects Eddie Murphy with setting the standard for black comedians over the last 30 years but honestly since his appearance as a smarttalking conartist in 48 hours a new type of character has been born and it is a character that Eddie Murphy has always and seriously will always be able to excel at. I'm not necessarily going so say that he can do no wrong but honestly I really think we need to start giving the guy credit if only if it is a special award simply made up for him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Awesome heistcomedy flick! Forget heavyhanded stuff like DOG DAY AFTERNOON. That's nothing but a character study. TOWER HEIST is what a fun heist flick should be like! What makes it even greater is that it's so relevant! With the whole Wall StreetPonzi scheme fiasco that has been in the news in recent years this film is sweet and funny revenge against the Wall Street fat cats. Not sure how well this film will age perhaps not too well but it's just what many folks need in this economy.Alan Alda was perfect casting as the oily and heartless SOB who swindles all his employees out of their pensions. Plus he swims in a swimming pool on his penthouse roof whose bottom is a dollar bill and he has a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso that Steve McQueen once owned in his possession right in the middle of his penthouse living room! How filthy rich is this dude?!! Sure it's all a bit outrageous but it only makes his comeuppance that much more sweet. Even more outrageous are the shenanigans involving said Ferrari later in the film. But I won't spoil this for anyone. You need to see it to believe it.As for the main cast Ben Stiller is his usual Ben Stiller self. I'm not a big fan of his but this role seems just right for him. But Eddie Murphy was definitely the standout! He had me laughing out loud on numerous occasions. I don't think Eddie has been this funny since his heyday in the 80s. When he gets himself roped into crap like DADDY DAY CARECAMP or DR. DOLITTLE he suffers big time. He is at his best when he plays streetwise bruthas think Axel Foley Reggie Hammond Billy Ray Valentine etc.  and he's back at this schtick here in TOWER HEIST! Easily my favorite Brett Ratner film. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Just to let you know where I'm coming from As usual I avoided reading anything about the movie before seeing it. A film is ALWAYS better if it's like a book by an unknown author that you picked up off a bookstall as you were heading to the airport. Seriously why do film companies essentially blurt out a film story's secrets that will take any surprises out of the first hour of a film? Maybe this is why I enjoyed the first half so much compared to other reviewers. It's a good yarn that is not as obvious as some would have you believe. Ben Stiller doesn't go too far from his safety zone playing Josh Kovacs a reliable serious notexactlyhappybutputtingupwithit manager of a ritzy apartment block. You like him. He's decent loyal and almost a slave to the wealthy privileged tenants who hold a great sense of entitlement to the things the majority of us don't have. Here's the subtext. He's like most of us today who live in a society that is convinced those less well off should get the trickles that come down from government payouts to our betters BTW didn't anybody in power look up the word trickle before okaying this?. And Stiller does it very well. He's getting older and greyer. He's fit and precise but a shade weary repressed by a life of looking after the wishes and feelings of others and foregoing his own. Probably coincidence but an almost interesting one Kovacs backwards is Scavok. Sciavo in Italian is 'slave'. Alan Alda is the initially affable Arthur Shaw a big guy on Wall Street. You like him too. He's friendly avuncular and a man of the people. Director Brett Ratner gives us a sharp and snappy whirl through the characters and milieu with Dante Spinotti's strong and glossy cinematography hitting all the right notes. There's a great support cast of workers of an ethnic rainbow who we already like from their film histories that include Michael Pea and Gabourey Sidibe rising sufficiently above their paper stereotypes to just about forgive the cynical choices in creating them. Matthew Broderick is overly convincing as a crushed and ruined investment banker a personality that exhausts your patience but must have seemed a good idea at the time. Casey Afflek shows a great talent for comedy timing as Josh's unreliable brother in law and Eddie Murphy steals scenes by his observations on Lesbian titties or by simply smiling. The romantic interest is FBI agent Tea Leoni who is invariably wonderful in anything and doesn't fail here giving depth to words that are sometimes as thin as the ink they were written in. She's not a twentysomething anymore and the camera irritatingly avoids real close ups. Ah well. That voice. I'd be happy just to listen to her but would have preferred if they didn't worry so about showing the fortyish female lead as anything less than airbrushed. Like Eddy Murphy she ultimately seems grossly underused. I'm not giving much away in an IMDb review to say that Alda's Shaw turns out to be a Bernie Maddoff character callously looking to get away with ripping off thousands of investors and cheating justice as well. The pensions and savings of tower staff look to be lost and when Josh sees first hand Shaw's indifference to the plight of his fellow workers he gathers a team of unlikely robbers to regain the usual 'hidden stash' in the penthouse apartment. So we come to the big flaw of a film that needed one last rewrite the director and the script writers get us to the top of the building but they don't know how to get us down safely. They are altogether deft and efficient up to this point but run scared when presented with the job of bringing all the threads of action and personality to their just ends. We get resolution without closure. I understand there are other versions of the ending. As is now becoming familiar perhaps the DVD will be the finished product where we are allowed to have several alternatives mingle into a whole and satisfy us beyond the cleancut simplicity of the screen version. nb. There is yet another reference to a chess game between villain and hero that like dozens of others in recent times sounds like the writers' knowledge comes from a single Wikipedia article. Enough with the chess motif!".

The pensions and savings of tower staff look to be lost and when Josh sees first hand Shaw's indifference to the plight of his fellow workers he gathers a team of unlikely robbers to regain the usual 'hidden stash' in the penthouse apartment. So we come to the big flaw of a film that needed one last rewrite the director and the script writers get us to the top of the building but they don't know how to get us down safely. They are altogether deft and efficient up to this point but run scared when presented with the job of bringing all the threads of action and personality to their just ends. We get resolution without closure. I understand there are other versions of the ending. As is now becoming familiar perhaps the DVD will be the finished product where we are allowed to have several alternatives mingle into a whole and satisfy us beyond the cleancut simplicity of the screen version. nb. There is yet another reference to a chess game between villain and hero that like dozens of others in recent times sounds like the writers' knowledge comes from a single Wikipedia article. Enough with the chess motif!";

	schema:reviewBody "Well I had my seat in the cinema. All I would have needed was my pillow and quilt cover and I could have had a nice nap for an hour and three quarters. Such as was how unbearably boring and awful this movie was I wish I had bought them with me. Tower Heist is one of those all the best bits are in the trailer films which is what propelled me and my father to go and see it. One other attraction with Tower Heist is it's confluence of top stars such as Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller Casey Affleck and Tea Leoni. But a star studded Alist cast doesn't necessarily mean a fantastic film as I found out to my disappointment. This film tries to be like Ocean's Eleven as others have already reiterated. Funny clever and slick. Tower Heist falls desperately short on all these fronts. It's not funny where's the comedy!? dumb and boring. There's nothing wrong with the story. Rich millionaire embezzles his employees money that they invested in him for their pension so they decide to get their own back by stealing the money he owes them. The thing is it just isn't involving or fun in any shape or form. Stiller at least gives a decent enough performance along with Affleck and Leoni but with such a poorly convoluted script that is thinner than the edge of a piece of paper there's little they can do. The film starts off far too slow in getting to the core of the story which at this point I was prepared to ignore because I thought it was a build up to an entertaining and clever heist but instead found myself just constantly looking at my watch. The narrative was straightforward predictable and plodding. Nothing remarkable happens during the heist though I did admire how they got the gold bullion car out of the hotel even though it is impossible you couldn't do that in real life. I did also chuckle at a few moments I will admit hence my two star rating not one. But I was unamused for the most part. One of the other biggest grievances I had for this is putting Eddie Murphy in this film who still plays the same boring repetitive loud mouth role he has for the last twenty years. The last thing I found him funny in was Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps which was about ten years ago. Since then and in Tower Heist he is not funny and is loud but just annoying and tries desperately too hard and has the propensity to horrifically overact. It's about time he retired from acting I think. Realising when I read the name Brett Ratner as director who also did X Men The Last Stand which was awful I shouldn't be surprised this was rubbish. Trust me Ocean's Eleven this film isn't. I wouldn't even class this as an actioncomedy as it had little of either. A wasted opportunity that was bungled due to a predictable and unimaginative narrative and poor script that lacked anything resembling a laugh. This is one caper film whose characters I didn't find funny or care about. Skip this and just rewatch Ocean's Eleven instead it's ten times better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone's excited for the new Brett Ratner movie right? Jonesing for another marginal actioncomedy in the vein of Rush Hour 2? You're in luck! Tower Heist fits the bill and despite its allusions to 2011 Wall Street turmoil the familiar flick feels very much of that era. The Ratman's latest is cookiecutter entertainment at its most transient but everyone likes cookies. Right?In Tower Heist Ben Stiller plays subservient chief of staff at a ritzy Central Park apartment complex  but when a tenant Alan Alda swindles him and his workforce out of their pensions it's no more Mr. Nice Josh. He masterminds a robbery with the help of his concierge Casey Affleck an elevator operator Michael Pea a downtrodden former resident Matthew Broderick and a Jamaican cleaning woman Gabourey Sidibe. Unschooled as they are in the art of the steal Josh also employs the aid of petty criminal Slide Eddie Murphy who gives the crew a crash course in crime.The cast of Tower Heist anchored by Stiller Alda and the underappreciated 'other' Affleck is its greatest asset. Gabourey Sidibe pulls a Melissa McCarthy in a similar big girl supporting role and as for Eddie Murphy  it's good to know that there's still a funny guy beneath the Norbit prosthetics. Granted nobody's working with AAA material here but their comic chemistry makes for some laugh out loud moments.Conceived and written by Ted Griffin of Ocean's Eleven and Matchstick Men Tower Heist strictly adheres to caper convention. Assemble the team unfurl the plan set said plan into motion and wait for it all to come undone. It's a tried and true formula which is ironic considering the risk its characters incur. There's even a heavyhanded chess metaphor about sacrificing one's Queen but Griffin is a decidedly defensive player.Then there's the Ratfactor. Poor Brett's an easy guy to hate. Called Hollywood's Ad Impresario by Businessweek he's the dude who wants to make a Guitar Hero movie. He's a purely commercial filmmaker who's helmed competent but inferior followups to beloved franchises like XMen and Silence of the Lambs. And let's face it he's kind of ugly. With Tower Heist the director isn't flexing any artistic muscles but he's got the mechanics down pat.Plus he's got the good sense to hire performers who probably don't need much direction. Guys like Stiller Murphy and Broderick are so well practiced that they're entertaining even when they're resting on their laurels. Similarly Ratner's worked with cinematographer Dante Spinotti enough times to not have to concern himself with the visual aspects of filmmaking. Though the credits suggest otherwise Ratner's role is nearer to producer than director.Consequently Tower Heist feels impersonal and even a bit disingenuous. After all what could Brett Ratner the privileged son of a Miami socialite turned blockbuster director have in common with the working stiffs he portrays? It's easy to hate Ratner but unfair to channel that negative energy at his work. With a good cast and decent material Tower Heist is an amusing inconsequential diversion that entertains and evaporates in the span of 100 minutes. And with a family friendly PG13 rating this cookiecutter actioncomedy is poised to make loads of dough.".

Immediately I was hooked like fish to the deep wreck of the titanic so it was a very interesting and inventive start to the picture.The rest of the film however did not have quite the same effect. Eddie Murphy played his role well and rather convincingly as the thief and the main actor from Feris Buller was also very good adding to the well roundedness of the film.The only downside to the film I felt was the unrealistic scenes involving the car 'made of gold'. Many different things happened in the film involving moving the car such as balancing it on top of a lift clearly in real life no metalplastic roof of a lift could hold over a ton of metal and gold  well certainly not on this planet.Overall it was a fairly decent film not one to last in your memory and quote with your friends but more of a middle of the road picture that occasional brings a smile to your face when viewing  for this reason I am scoring the film a modest 710.".

However something went wrong. That's not to say this film isn't good it is but it isn't close to what it could have been.The film is about a robbery in a very secure building with the latest security and the best staff that money can buy. The staff have invested their own personal savings and their pension fund with one of the tenants a financier Arthur Shaw Alan Alda. However he is arrested for fraud and they find out that he has lost all their money.The cast including Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Matthew Broderick Casey Affleck Ta Leoni and Juan Carlos Hernndez is good. They work well together and they all have great moments. Gabourey Sidibe steals every moment she is on screen and she could have a great future in comedy.This film should have been great. It was originally going to be in the style of Ocean's 11 but somewhere along the way it changed into this. You have comedy greats Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller and Ferris Buller. I say Ferris Buller because it feels like Matthew Broderick is playing that character after he has lost everything. The film felt like it should have been full of big comedy moments but I couldn't find them. There are some very funny scenes but not many. As for the hitech building security mentioned a few times in the film it doesn't materialise all you are shown are a few cameras that are quickly disabled with a smiley face sticker! I was really looking forward to this mainly in the hope that Eddie Murphy would give a performance worthy of his comedy legacy. I loved his films from the 80's. His films of the 90's were hit or miss until his performance in Bowfinger one of his best performances. Apart from his role in the Shrek films there was nothing great about any of his roles since then. So what would he be like in this? Fortunately he is good. Not as great as the Eddie Murphy back in his reckless care free roles but better than 90 of the last two decades of his films. The reason he is so good in Bowfinger is what makes this role work. It is because he isn't in the lead role. Take the pressure away from having to carry the whole film and he shines.I was disappointed with the lack of great comedy moments and the lack of risk for the characters but it is a good film just don't watch this expecting a comedy classic as you will be disappointed.".

Shindo has a theme to his movie and this one is no exception.A family consisting of mother father and two boys makes a daily ferrying of water from the mainland to an island to water their farm. There are no machinery to help with their farming and the farm is situated on a steep slope. Every day the family struggles to care for their farm except for few days out of the year they take a break for a time out in town.The movie having no dialog was highly experimental and no movie studio was willing to take on this project so Shindo self financed the five million yen project out of his own pocket. There're not many actors in this movie except for the four people in the family and the movie was made by a staff of 13 people. The project no movie studio wanted to touch won the grand prize at the Moscow movie festival that year and was shown in 66 countries around the world. Author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn quoted that this is the most moving movie he's ever seen.The movie is a reminder of how harsh a life can be if there is no enterprising society to forward the standards of living. The premise of the movie is little unrealistic because I don't think you can actually shuttle enough water by foot and a row boat to cultivate a farm. If I were them I'd look around to see if there's a place suitable for perma culture.Shot in the back drop of Seto inland ocean in Japan the scenery of this movie is stunningly beautiful. Music by Mitsuru Hayashi is also beautiful. I wish I had access to the DVD released in Japan where the director's commentary is available on the bonus track  it is available from Amazon.co.jp .Nobuko Otowa who played the mother in this movie went on to make many other movie and TV drama including the now famous Oshin series. Otowa later marries the director of this movie Kaneto Shindo in 1978 after Shindo's first wife passed away. Otowa and Shindo were a team since she made her film debut in 1951 and they had a long relationship until her death in 1994.".

This is pure cinema with no frills worthy of comparison with Dreyer Bresson and O'Flaherty and a lovely companion piece to Shindo's ONIBABA. That onibaba grass stayed with us over the years as did that naked island. Talking of films lost but not forgotten I can draw a comparison with MERE JEANNE DES ANGES same subject matter as Ken Russell's THE DEVILSwhich I saw in Leipzig in about 1962 and which I have never seen since. What a coincidence! That Polish film MOTHER JOAN OF THE ANGELSis also coming out on DVD. Real poetic cinema is trickling through the mishmash.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay we have a loving tribute here personal for director Kaneto Shindo as portraying the life of his parents. We have the rural hardship and dogged persistence for live in a place where water is painfully hauled over a steep cliff and we have the quiet cinematic language that describes it. But also describes a life of simple pleasures. Shindo observes both closely with sympathy.The narrative thread of The Naked Island flows with the slow and dull repetition of life itself  if the movie is dull and monotonous it is because life is dull and monotonous and with a handful of fleeting moments of pleasure and joy scattered among the daily routine of making ends meet. In that sense the artificiality that some reviewers have spoken of certainly Shindo's decision to include no dialogues and the film almost silent save for a few natural sounds and voices touches upon the heart of the thing.The film follows the cycle of the seasons as the family tries to survive in the small island and it is by using the renewal of nature as a backdrop that Shindo draws emphasis on the periodic nature of life and time  the snake that eats its tail. The theme of renewal and the cycle of life and death is further symbolized through long repetitious sequences of the man and wife transporting irrigation water in large buckets through the steep steps of a hillside and even further as Shindo ends the film cyclically with the same aerial shot that opened it.The other major triumph for the great Japanese director is the visual language he employs to tell the simple and languidly paced story. This is probably a point that will only interest the avid film buff but I'm fairly sure it's that kind of person only that will seek out such a film anyway. The cinematography consists of full images superb staging and framing of the little is the truth action images as much beautiful in the subject they present as in the presentation of the subject itself and vibrating with honesty and clarity of vision. As with Kurosawa in DERSU UZALA The Naked Island captures the essence of 'life as lived in'  the texture the mood the smell.Combined with the symbolism he has carefully planted within the film The Naked Island is a complete depiction of life on both macrocosmic and microcosmic levels. Of a very specific kind of life the truth is rural life in a Japanese island in the 30's but in the larger scheme of things and in the things that actually matter what is true of one man is true of many.In an age where directors are content to just wink at their audiences with a sense of smug satisfaction presenting us with cynic and gimmicky films swapping emotional catharsis for surprise 'twists' doing away with honest character portrayals in favour of decorating characters with random quirks having forgotten visual storytelling in favour of redundant voiceovers shaky cams or selfconsciously witty dialogue in an age like this The Naked Island seems to come from another planet alien to the mentality and ethics of modern cinema as much as its bucolic subject matter is to modern city life. It's definitely not something that will appeal to most but those that will set out looking for it will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you drive a car you may have experienced a common phenomenon. Spend hours driving at superhighway speed then when you exit onto a road where the speed limit is 45 MPH you will feel as though you are going very very slowly. This phenomenon has a parallel in the world of movie viewing. With the pervasive acceleration of film pacing that is evident in today's actionthriller films audiences have become conditioned to expect and even demand fast moving storytelling on their cineplex screens. In 1959 when the curtains closed and the lights came up for the intermission in William Wyler's Ben Hur people in the theaters expressed surprise that so much time had elapsed. In its day that film particularly the first half seemed to fly by so quickly that people could scarcely believe its actual running time was as great as it was. Nowadays we have grown so accustomed to fastermoving fare that many find Ben Hur to be rather slow.Consider then the extraordinary production that Kaneto Shindo brought to the screen in 1960. It was a daringly slowpaced film even then! If you were the sort of filmgoer who was forever impatient to see the action unfold swiftly and there were many such people then as now this was hardly going to be your kind of movie. The Island as it was titled in its original U.S. release asked the viewer to enter into the grinding arduous existence of a little family monotonously toiling to eke out a meager existence on a remote and rugged little island. It continually invites deep contemplation of the minute details of this struggle and the environment in which it occurs. If you are attuned to the style and purpose of the director you will respond deeply to his visual poetry. You will gain an appreciation of the extraordinary lives and labors of the characters in his story. When the film's intense climax arrives it will have all the more impact on you because of the way that you have been drawn into an atmosphere of numbingly repetitious daily struggles. What happens to this family will come closer to feeling like it is happening to you. I can not imagine any way this might have been accomplished with greater effectiveness.Having said all of this I am not deluded into imagining that this is a film for everyone. Impatient viewers who will never be drawn to contemplative filmmaking which aims primarily to immerse the viewer in the world of its characters rather than to hurtle the audience along through a cinematic thrillride had best ignore this picture. For the rest of us I believe it to be a oneofakind treasure.".

As it stands probably more than half its runningtime consists of the woman crossing back and forth to the mainland by boat in order to provide irrigation water for their crops actually the film was criticized at the time by fellow Japanese filmmakers  particularly Nagisa Oshima  because Shindo opted to adhere to the general view held by foreigners of the Japanese people as stereotypically quaint and passive! Besides the concept of making it almost completely silent apart from sound effects the singing of schoolchildren and the musical score that is present virtually all the way through is an artificial one to begin with at the very least one would have appreciated some sort of narration to fill us in on what the characters might be thinking at any particular moment considering how they do not even feel the need to make conversation. In fact the only emotion that ever seeps through their stoic faade to break the unmitigated monotony of their simple humble lifestyle is a when the husband unaccountably slaps the wife for spilling the water  which she has to carry uphill on her shoulders in buckets filled practically to the brim on either side of a pole! b the mother crying over the death of their elder boy the father had to go to the mainland to get a doctor and since the latter is not at home goes to look for him all over the place on foot! and c towards the end following the boy's funeral as the mother breaks down  sobbing in desperation at their futile existence  and vents her anger on the crops they work so hard all year long to grow.Ultimately after my initial disappointment considering the passion and energy at the centre of the only other two films I've watched from this director ONIBABA 1964 and KURONEKO 1968 the twin virtues of its hypnotically beautiful images and the sublime music by Hikaru Hayashi  surely one of the most beautiful scores I've ever heard  are more than enough to make THE NAKED ISLAND a quietly impressive achievement in its own right.".

In fact the only emotion that ever seeps through their stoic faade to break the unmitigated monotony of their simple humble lifestyle is a when the husband unaccountably slaps the wife for spilling the water  which she has to carry uphill on her shoulders in buckets filled practically to the brim on either side of a pole! b the mother crying over the death of their elder boy the father had to go to the mainland to get a doctor and since the latter is not at home goes to look for him all over the place on foot! and c towards the end following the boy's funeral as the mother breaks down  sobbing in desperation at their futile existence  and vents her anger on the crops they work so hard all year long to grow.Ultimately after my initial disappointment considering the passion and energy at the centre of the only other two films I've watched from this director ONIBABA 1964 and KURONEKO 1968 the twin virtues of its hypnotically beautiful images and the sublime music by Hikaru Hayashi  surely one of the most beautiful scores I've ever heard  are more than enough to make THE NAKED ISLAND a quietly impressive achievement in its own right.";

	schema:reviewBody "On a tiny island in the Seto Inland Sea a small family consisting of husband wife and two sons struggle to get by. They are the island's sole inhabitants and spend their days fetching water from the mainland and carrying up the steep hill in order to water their crops. One day when the mother and father are away from the island one of the sons falls ill and the father races to get help. Their lives are all portrayed in painstaking detail and the film contains no dialogue whatsoever. The film is directed by Kaneto Shindo who directed the two brilliant Japanese New Wave horror films Kuraneko and Onibaba the only two other films of his I've seen.This is a break in style and subject for Shindo. The two aforementioned horror films were similarly slow and detailed but The Naked Island contains no action or atmosphere but certainly shares their beauty. This is a film that shows how far humanity can be pushed in order to merely get by. The climax of the film and I don't feel I'm ruining anything by revealing it the story is not important has their ill son dying as his father and the doctor arrive too late. After the funeral they are forced back to work. The mother needing to grieve throws down the water and screams into the ground as the father watches helpless. Afterwards she gets up and methodically resumes watering.Shindo tackles a universal subject with the neglect of the working class. Filmed with no dialogue it emphasises their facial expressions and body movements in a way the silent era did and forces the audience to live through the work they do every step at a time. The director said he wanted to capture the life of human beings struggling like ants against the forces of nature and he certainly does that. The film is slow and focuses a lot of time on the struggle of carrying the water up the hillside. Yet it's filmed with such elegance it only hammers their struggle home. This is a beautiful and moving film that is almost brutal in its relentlessness.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Since cinema is primarily a visual media in a way silent films can be called the purest type of films. Still sound is also an essential part of human perception so the real challenge may lie in finding the best possible combination of showing things through the visuals and telling them via dialogue or narration. In The Naked Island director Kaneto Shind has chosen a very quiet approach to his subject a poor peasant family of four living on an isolated rocky island. The father and the mother Taiji Tonoyama and Nobuko Otowa spend practically all of their time fetching water from another island by a rowboat for their meager crops that require constant nurture to survive on the harsh island. Their two sons Shinji Tanaka and Masanori Horimoto sometimes help their parents in their work but also have time to play and go to school on the other island where they have to be taken to and from by rowboat.The presentation is very documentarylike the plot is borderline nonexistent and the focus is mostly on the mundane tasks the family completes. The notable thing about the style is the complete lack of dialogue nobody ever utters a word and intertitles are used minimally. While the obmutescence could have come across as awkward and artificial in less skilled hands Shind maintains a perfect understanding of how to use visual means to tell his story. The expressive faces of the family members and the stark scenery of the island lend themselves for the black and white cinematography and the beautifully composed shots so magnificently that conversations or verbal explanations never feel necessary. In spite of the nearly mute characters the film doesn't neglect sound design either the calm nondiegetic score and occasional chanting and other human sounds by the locals support the style seamlessly.Shind's view of life in poverty is surely highly romanticized but the film probably works best as an inspirational cinematic poem as opposed to a sharply realistic piece of cinema vrit anyway. However hard the family's life may seem at first it is never devoid of emotion there is joy disappointment frustration and sorrow not forgetting a beautiful sense of community that is not hindered by the physical remoteness of the island. It could be said that one of the points the film makes is about finding meaning in a seemingly empty state of mind. Earlier in the film one wonders what it is that keeps the family in their unrelenting home couldn't they just move to the mainland or the inhabited islands nearby? At the end an understanding has been formed home is where the heart is and life can be full even on the Naked Island. In brief the slowpaced film is not for everybody but those willing to allow themselves to sink into its world will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pure. Thick and heavy. It's like going through a gallery of paintings where every piece is a timeless treasure. It's as pure a movie as can be found. It's got its own style it makes its own rules. There is no dialogue no sound of human voice other than when the family goes to town. And just when you feel like you can't take anymore of this life the movie slaps you in your face and you simply understand this isn't makebelieve it's real life and if you are busy being bored you're simply wasting precious time when there's work to be done. The work for us is to enjoy all the beautiful angles the daring framing which somehow often cuts off part of the image but by virtue of that cuttingoff keeps the realness perfectly intact. The editing alone is a masterpiece cutting just as the characters and setting reach a sublime visual harmony and returning with a new set up full of many little details fluttering and seeking balance all over again. This movie defines what visual storytelling is and forever should be because it almost never gets bogged down in drama it ebbs and flows in synch with the nature around it. Plus the talent of the actors is beyond belief most definitely owing much to the direction. The problem comes in the last quarter of the movie's duration. After teaching us not to be sentimental the movie then takes us through what would be a tragedy for us in most other movies but here we don't exactly know how to feel. The movie up to this point taught us to detach from emotion so we kind of just want to get back to work and we don't see the sense in wallowing in misery. And so when one of the characters displays a desire to wallow in misery we don't have any connection. That is the downside to not getting to know any of the characters' individuality. We have never heard their voices never understood their dreams or frustrations. Because of this the movie's miraculous shots though technically good become devoid of cinematic beauty because their context is muddled. The audience slips out of the spell that for more than hour seemed impossible to break. A for Ambition though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I have to say it I am a South Park fan. I watch the show religiously and that is the reason why I watched this brilliantly entertaining film. That's probably the only reason anyone ever watches it. This film is one that you either love or hate and I can't imagine anything in between. It's wildly uneven poorly paced poorly acted and has rather bad sound quality at times. And I love it for all those reasons. It's simply a student project that Trey Parker and his buddies put together over one spring break and with such a small budget and limited filmmaking skills they created something brilliant and inspirational.Alfred Packer Trey Parker is a lonely miner who seems to be in love with his horse Leanne and has recently been put on trial for murdering his mining crew and eating them. He tells the real story to a reporter named Polly and it goes like this. One shpadoinkle morning he is chosen as a replacement guide for a gold mining expedition to Colorado though he doesn't exactly know the way. With his five crew members he sets off on the journey. Of course when his horse runs away he ends up leading his crew on an agonizing search in the wrong direction which leads them into the cold snowy mountains becoming hopelessly lost. As they fight to survive they soon realize that they may need to resort to eating each other...This movie is a hysterical comedy with many big laughs but I personally think it works better as a musical. A real challenge with this movie is to see it and then try and get the songs out of your head. The music is so catchy and if the film was really popular I wouldn't have to constantly explain to the people around me what I'm whistlinghumming. Sometimes I leave my iPod playlist of the movie's songs running all night as I sleep as they provide me comfort. Most people won't love the music that much but you can't say the music isn't wonderfully catchy. Shpadoinkle Day That's All I'm Asking For and Let's Build A Snowman are my favorites though I love them all. The first former and the latter would be considered classics if the film had a wide release.Now the main problem with the film that most people have is the pacing which is extremely slow. The thing is is that Trey Parker had little knowledge of making a film and with a tiny budget the film is of poor quality. The acting sound and agreeably the pacing are all bad. But the film's bad quality is one of it's charms. Much of the humor is unintentional due to some of the funniest and most obvious errors ever put on film. They are easy to spot if you pay attention and don't let the pacing get you down. By the way if you don't like it the first time try it again with the hilarious and helpful directors commentary on the DVD in which Trey Parker Matt Stone and the rest of the main cast get drunk and watch the film. They point out many things that you probably couldn't care less about the first time and their insight makes it really funny not to mention it helps the pace quite a bitCannibal! The Musical is one of my favorite comedies and everyone should give it a try. It gets an 810 in my book.It is rated R for Comic GoreViolence and some Language. Sex 310 Violence 910 Swearing 610 Drugs 110".

I bet that if the South Park movie didn't have songs it wouldn't make much of a difference of it's greatness despite them being classics but in Cannibal the songs make this film even funnier and turn it from being a lame film about a cannibal into a surprisingly funny if really dumb comedy.Anyway Trey Parker's first feature film is presented here and while Matt Stone isn't writing he is a coproducer along with Parker. The film focuses on the only cannibal convicted in America named Alfred Packer. It could've become an equally boring and gruesome film about the scarcely known guy but it is actually lame for the right reasons by having songs at exactly the wrong time where else are you going to see frontiersmen sing about dead animals and then argue about being in the wrong key. Not the greatest musical or comedy for that matter however it is a keen if ludicrous freshman effort by the guys who would later go on to make a masterpiece with the South Park show and movie.".

This release is adapted from a University of Colorado stage production and is ultimately very silly and cheap film camp in the Monty Python comedy vein. The subject is Alferd Paker Juan Schwartz who while searching for gold and love in the Colorado Territory he and his companions lost their way and resorted to ...unthinkable horrors including toetapping songs. Alferd Paker was convicted of cannibalism and shortly after his arrest he tells his tale. In jail with musical and gory splatter flashbacks he retells the story to a news reporter of how he came to eat his friends. The local townspeople in a big production number sing 'Hang The Brd' outside his cell window. While the film is low in entertainment the songs are very addictive and will have you singing right along. Troma Team DVD's are very enjoyable endeavors in exploitation barker showmanship and feature interactive items such as Troma Intelligence tests and tours of troma studios.".

Becoming one of the few people in America to be convicted of cannibalismbefore 1950 onwards anyway.The movie is cheap in production values and laughs. But that is why it is so funny. It's just a really stupid movie. Typical so stupid you have to laugh situations are what the 90 minute  movie is all about.It doesn't say much for me that some of the songs have actually stuck in my head. Or that I have watched it everyday for the last 3. But it must say something about the movie. Trey Parker best known for South Park managed to make a low budget film that easily stands up against multimillion dollar comedies that have good acting but tired plots. This offers bad acting bad singing the goofiest songs you'll ever hear you'll learn some history and see plenty of America.If you're tired of big Hollywood productions or remake and sequel after remake and sequel and the same old thing try this. It's goofy. It's dumb. It's something you and a group of friends could probably make yourselves on the weekend. But it did make me laugh and 3 days in a row. For that I must recommend.710".

The jokes are kinda slow and strewn in between and the whole thing just isn't as funny as South Park or Team America.Still one must not forget when this movie was made and how.

I especially liked the finale Kill the Bd with it's very theatrical dance routine! And also the song about Lianne.

The film maker was successful in keeping a substantial amount of mystery and uncertainty wrapped around things. And the story developed so slowly so gradually it was wonderful. And poor chubby lost little Senay starts as just a little lost ghost her face just a blank mask and as things progress we get to see more and more into her face and get to see her more as more as a person. It really was quite incredible for me. This movie really took me by surprise.One aspect that did seem to be a little overdone was the repeated scenes looking out into the night as Zeki and Senay travel across Europe by car or train. There's no denying the forlorn coldness and emptiness of looking out the window of a moving vehicle at the electric lights of distant streets and houses but it just begins to seem a little morbid a little maudlin after the 4th such scene.I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only regret was that I saw it as the first film in a double feature and the second feature really sucked so that kind of put a damper on what could have been a very nice evening a very nice mood.

	schema:headline " Zubeidaa the rebellious princess";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2000 Khalid Mohammed a famous film critic directed a movie called Fiza. Fiza is one of my favourite films and I particularly loved the great performance of its leading lady Karisma Kapoor. In this film Khalid Mohammed assumes a part as a writer. The one who directs this movie is none other than Shyam Benegal one of India's alltime best filmmakers and the one who plays the title role is Karisma Kapoor. This is the third movie in the unofficial trilogy of Benegal movies scripted by Mohammed all of which are partly fictionalised true stories centred around Indian Muslim women who made a lasting impact on Mohammed's life. The first movie in the trilogy is the brilliant Mammo which was based on Mohammed's beloved grandaunt and the second is Sardari Begum titled after a popular Thumari singer of his mother's era. Both characters actually appear in this movie. But here Mohammed tells the story of Zubeidaa Begum who was his real mother.Zubeidaa Begum was the daughter of a famous filmmaker and an aspiring actress. When her father who disapproved of her dreams to pursue an acting career found out she was acting secretly in films he arranged her marriage to Mehboob Alam. However right after Zubeidaa gave birth to a baby boy they divorced. Zubeidaa was a charming highspirited incredibly honest and rebellious woman who refused to live her life according to traditional mores and was constantly in search of happiness. One such opportunity presents itself in the form of Maharaja Vijayendra Singh the prince of Fatehpur who is already married to a much older Mandira Devi. Vijayendra instantly falls for Zubeidaa and she leaves everything behind her including her little son whom her father does not allow to take to enter his house as his second wife. The story relates Zubeidaa's trials and tribulations in the big house her loneliness and yearning for her son and for her husband who has very little time for her.The story of Zubeidaa is convincingly narrated and is efficiently presented through flashbacks as told to the character of Riyaz Zubeidaa's elder son who is now a journalist trying to find some documentation of who his mother was. He is surprised to hear that she was a charismatic woman who lived life to the fullest and the movie is authentic enough to make the viewer feel a connection to the story and to its main protagonist. Unsurprisingly Shyam Benegal's direction is excellent and he unusually accepts many of the ingredients of mainstream Hindi cinema which certainly sets this movie apart from his previous directorial efforts. He is aided by Mohammed's script Javed Siddiqui's fantastic dialogues the terrific sound design the wonderful cinematography and of course the art direction the sets the costumes and the props all successfully capture the atmosphere of the 1950s. One cannot go without mentioning A.R Rahman's music which gives life to the film. So Gaye Hain is the finest song in the soundtrack and its melody is really calm haunting and melancholic.The one who is most responsible for making Zubeidaa the movie that it is and the character so memorable is unquestionably Karisma Kapoor. After delivering an alltime great performance as the main protagonist in Khalid Mohammed's Fiza she is now cast in the role of his mother to deliver another performance of equally high standards. Shyam Benegal once frankly stated that he actually had not seen a single movie of hers before and therefore he directed her with utmost guidance. Kapoor's portrayal is indeed heartfelt real and powerful and she displays Zubeidaa's feisty nature determination yearning anger and frustration with energy depth and conviction that make her really easy to relate to. Manoj Bajpai is very fine as Zubeidaa's loving husband. Rekha is superb as Mandira. She is amazingly restrained and graceful and is mysterious enough to make one wonder what her real take was. The supporting cast includes Amrish Puri Surekha Sikri Rajit Kapoor and Lillete Dubey and all of them manage to leave a mark.Zubeidaa's ending is really poignant but its melancholic and bittersweet feel actually explains why Zubeidaa Begum will be remembered. It's great that Mohammed decided to immortalise his mother even though he sadly did not even know her that much in her life and her portrait existed in his mind only from stories he had heard from those who knew her. Anyway kudos to Mohammed Benegal and Karisma Kapoor for making Zubeidaa the entertaining and moving picture that it is.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 2000 Khalid Mohammed a famous film critic directed a movie called Fiza. Fiza is one of my favourite films and I particularly loved the great performance of its leading lady Karisma Kapoor. In this film Khalid Mohammed assumes a part as a writer. The one who directs this movie is none other than Shyam Benegal one of India's alltime best filmmakers and the one who plays the title role is Karisma Kapoor. This is the third movie in the unofficial trilogy of Benegal movies scripted by Mohammed all of which are partly fictionalised true stories centred around Indian Muslim women who made a lasting impact on Mohammed's life. The first movie in the trilogy is the brilliant Mammo which was based on Mohammed's beloved grandaunt and the second is Sardari Begum titled after a popular Thumari singer of his mother's era. Both characters actually appear in this movie. But here Mohammed tells the story of Zubeidaa Begum who was his real mother.Zubeidaa Begum was the daughter of a famous filmmaker and an aspiring actress. When her father who disapproved of her dreams to pursue an acting career found out she was acting secretly in films he arranged her marriage to Mehboob Alam. However right after Zubeidaa gave birth to a baby boy they divorced. Zubeidaa was a charming highspirited incredibly honest and rebellious woman who refused to live her life according to traditional mores and was constantly in search of happiness. One such opportunity presents itself in the form of Maharaja Vijayendra Singh the prince of Fatehpur who is already married to a much older Mandira Devi. Vijayendra instantly falls for Zubeidaa and she leaves everything behind her including her little son whom her father does not allow to take to enter his house as his second wife. The story relates Zubeidaa's trials and tribulations in the big house her loneliness and yearning for her son and for her husband who has very little time for her.The story of Zubeidaa is convincingly narrated and is efficiently presented through flashbacks as told to the character of Riyaz Zubeidaa's elder son who is now a journalist trying to find some documentation of who his mother was. He is surprised to hear that she was a charismatic woman who lived life to the fullest and the movie is authentic enough to make the viewer feel a connection to the story and to its main protagonist. Unsurprisingly Shyam Benegal's direction is excellent and he unusually accepts many of the ingredients of mainstream Hindi cinema which certainly sets this movie apart from his previous directorial efforts. He is aided by Mohammed's script Javed Siddiqui's fantastic dialogues the terrific sound design the wonderful cinematography and of course the art direction the sets the costumes and the props all successfully capture the atmosphere of the 1950s.

Full of characters nuances.  There are so many stories in the background partition status of Muslims in India Indian cenima fate of Indian principalties.  The dialogue is just awesome. But of course the focus and center of the movie is the story of Zubedaa.  Khaled Mohammed's script  based on the life of is mother  is simply amazing. In general I do not like Karishma Kapoor's movies  but she gives a phenomenol performance here even better than her performance in Fiza.  I hope she will continue do serious roles in the future.  In fact everyone in the movie is great.  There are no mistakes in the movie.  What starts out as very simple story builds up to something very powerful.  There is no naive sentimentality here.  This is art! High art! And no this is not one of those aesthetic pieces that are out of touch with reality.  I just cannot say enough about the movie.  Perfect perfect perfect.Of course this movie is only for serious viewers.  If you are looking for action or laughs look else where.".

	schema:headline " A Rich And Resonant Historical Romance Though It Ends Up Feeling Incomplete";
	schema:reviewBody "Shyam Benegal is an international award winning film director who made his name in the 1970's with films such as Anker 1974 that focus on controversial subjects involving the examination of fraught complex social and cultural relationships. These films tend to concentrate on the lower rungs of Indian society. Zubeidaa is a refreshing update in this mode of filmmaking as Benegal transfers his namemaking qualities to a subject at the higher end of society.It is the story of a young man Riyaz who goes on a journey to discover what has happened to his mysterious mother absent for as long as he can remember. What he discovers is reenacted in scenes set not long after independence as the nave but headstrong young Zubeidaa is scandalised by her romance and subsequent marriage to Prince Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur head of a grand Hindu ruling royal family. As a middle class Muslim divorce with a child by another man her relationship with the Prince is naturally complicated by sociopolitical and religious factors.But not only does she become entangled in the politics of the royal circle around the Prince particularly in her relationship with the Prince's first wife Mandira Devi she also gets caught up in the larger politics of India. The film is set during a time not long after Independence a time of change and uncertainty for the traditional ruling class of India which still laid claim to about a third of the country.Though it is clear that this film is much more than royal watching having such a subject naturally supports a lavish treatment which Benegal ably supplies as well as making the film's content rich in nuance and resonance handling its mature romantic storyline gracefully and skilfully embedding it into its larger historical context.The characters are generally very well developed with empathy and without judgement or clich. The acting matches this. Karisma Kapoor captures the strength and naivety of Zubeidaa with aplomb and Rekha is authoritative and understated as the enigmatic Mandira Devi.The only problem I have with the film is Zubeidaa's grown son Riyaz. Riyaz is imperative to the film since the viewer follows him on his journey of discovery. Seeing great characters through the eyes of other characters is a useful fictional device most successfully utilised in Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. Nick Carraway's character is revealed by his journey in discovering Gatsby. However in Zubeidaa Riyaz stays enigmatic while discovering his mother and even at times comes across as anodyne feeling more like a biographer looking into an interesting episode in history not a son trying to find his mother. Rajat Kapoor playing Riyaz does not manage to rise above his character's failings. And so unfortunately the film ends up feeling incomplete.".

Well here are 10 reasons1 Zubeidaa was like a breath of fresh air in 2001 when the landscape of Bollywood was pathetically repetitive. A beautiful and a poignant story with an equally brilliant screenplay is the backbone of the film.2 Shyam Benegal is able to recreate the magic of the 50s  the 60s.

His genuine concern with womens' issues is evident in movies like Mammo and Sardari Begum both scripted by Khalid Mohammad with their womenoriented themes. His latest film Zubeidaa offers perspective vignettes and explores the female psyche and interaction in different environments. Benegal has a kindly vision of female follies and characters their motivations desperation's and desires.Starring Karisma Kapur Rekha and Manoj Bajpai the film has strong a backup in Surekha Sikri and Lillette Dubey supported by his favorites Amrish Puri and Rajit Kapur Shyam Benegal calls his film a lyrical romance and it is one but that is not all that his film offers. The film a period romance set in the 1950s is the story of a young Muslim girl from an affluent family. When her father discovers that his daughter has signed a film he forces her into a marriage which ends in a divorce and a baby. Zubeidaa meets her true love a Rajasthani prince Manoj Bajpai but the trouble is that he is already married. However she consents to becoming his Chhoti Rani.Basically there are four strongly etched characters in the film. Surekha Sikri is the Muslim wife in an urban educated setting who abides by the laws set down by the husband and accepts his tyranny as a traditional male domain you know sahib always has his way. You'll have to do what he says in the end. Her contemporary is Lillette Dubey who plays Miss Rose Davenport a dancer in the moviesand she's utterly irrepressible! Out to have a good time she interacts on a superficial level with everyone connected to her. Still she has a kind heart and when she decides that Zubeidaa has had enough of moping around after her divorce she promptly introduces her to the dashing prince and shamelessly abets the romance. Her statement men and horses are more my style my dear said with a mischievous wink is completely her! The interesting thing is that the same fact when examined by her and by Sikri portrays diametrically different views of the truth making one realize that truth is never absolute! These two utterly different women belonging to the same generation remain true to type till their old age.Karisma Kapoor and Rekha in Zubeidaa Benegal is never judgmental and nor does he allow the audience to become holierthanthou. So human are both the women and so sympathetically has the director dealt with his characters that one simply accepts them and likes them.The main character that of Zubeidaa superbly portrayed by Karisma Kapur has overlapping shades to it. Zubeidaa has fiery feminist instincts and is rebellious and tempestuous until the end. At the same time she's feminine vulnerable and very young. She chooses to live her life the way she wants to. After giving into paternal authority once in her first marriage she isn't willing to throw away her chance for happiness the second time. Fully aware of the prince's previous marriage and family she's ready to accept a strange environment and a different religion for the sake of love. She makes her choices and sacrifices willingly and knowingly. Karisma has surpassed herself as the passionate defiant willful and troubled Zubeidaa the truly modern woman.In direct contrast to her is Mandira Devi the Patrani of the prince. Graceful mature and traditional she upholds the role and duties of the Rajasthani princess yet surprises Zubeidaa by saying call me Mandy. She treats Zubeidaa with resigned amused affection never losing her savorfare while she instructs Zubeidaa in her expected role.The most important facet that Benegal has been able to bring out through the film is the fact of female bonding. Whether it is Lillette with Karisma or Karisma with Surekha or Karisma with Rekha females in the film interact react exist and equate with each other despite the parameters set by males. They understand and accept each others' drives and emotions. Rekha and Karisma in fact have a frank discussion about their respective relationships with the prince. Both accept that they have a different role to play in his lifebut in the final analysis that role is assigned by the male. So if the prince says of his senior wife woh eek ache Rajput bah ha he says to Karisma sada ha seen bane Rana Ur Dill belling leaving no ambiguity in the respective role expectation.The plot of the story moves fast from scene to scenefrom the 50s to the 80s the film is in a series of flashbacks without losing track of the story. It is also not so 'period' that one cannot relate to it. There are traces of the British upper class mannersegg. The meals and decor in Karisma's house is very Anglicized people speak English comfortably on the stereo a Dean Martin song is playing in a party is a live band with the saxophone trumpet and drums playing a waltz. There are puff sleeves shingled hair and net depots there is talk of the newlyformed Pakistan the Privypurses being withdrawn is a burning issue and many details like these to make the setting completely authentic. Back home in Fatehpur too the true Rajasthani setting has been portrayed with attention to minute detail.In the final analysis Benegal has made a film which is a milestone as far as womenoriented movies are concerned. The theme characterization and issues that the film examines are fair to women and have been examined without any searing criticism to mar the tone of the picture.".

Shyam Benegal has bridged the gap between serious movies and the pot boilers produced by Bollywood. I don't expect this movie to be a hit. But here are the things I found fascination in the movie in no particular orderi The character of Zubeida as played by Karisma Kapoor was perfect! If it was the intention of the director to show her as a very happygolucky girl that does not want to be confined by anyone or anything  she has portrayed it superbly. Of course she DOES come across as being selfish as not being willing to share the limelight or her love for that matter with another. But  that is what she IS!ii The story was very melancholic. Interspersed with moments of laughter. But the melancholy prevails thru till the last frame.iii Cinematography has a dream like quality when in flashback mode along with a matter of fact presence today. I especially liked the sepia tones of yester year juxtaposed with the more real life tones of the present day.iv The direction itself is as usual flawless. I thought there was a mistake once or twice  but upon rewinding I saw to my relief that I was very much mistaken. The only part not so convincing is the plane crash itself. If only Indian movie makers would not mind doing the real thing  In particular I feel the reason Karisma seems to be so perfect in this role is the director. That is NOT to detract from her performancs! But just having Shyam Benegal as a director raises you to the next level  that you probably never knew existed.v The camera work is poetic. Whether in the past or in the present it seems to caress each of the central characters. Whether it is Amrish Puri or Rose in the past or Rajit Kapur and the palace in the present the camera seems to linger longingly on each of them. Especially in the present when the camera seems to wish the place back to life the way it was.vi Manoj Bajpai's casting Victor. This as expected is one of the most controversial castings ever done. Manoj's portrayals in movies so far have been anything BUT regal. However it is MY feeling that he did a commendable job of airing royalty. I thought he was cast perfectly. However his younger brother seems to be more regal than him. In the one scene in the present he does look like a former maharaja.vii Rekha as the Queen Mandira Devi. Now THIS was a big nono in my view. She looked so much older than him! However if history has to be portrayed correctly what other choice do we have?viii Lilette Dubey Rose. This is ONE woman you can see as having done her role complete justice. She floats thru it and you are left wondering whether you should be loving her or hating her.ix Karisma Kapoor Zubeidaa. I don't mean to belittle her by talking about her so late in the review. She was perfect for the role. She has done the role perfectly. You love to love the vivacious girl in her. You struggle along with her as she tries to adjust to being a queen  failing miserably. You want to dance with her  when she commits the crime of dancing along with the visiting commoners. You fall in love along with her. She deserves to win the Filmfare award for best actress for 2001. She has proved that she is not a mere bimbette as Dimple has ably demonstrated the transition from bikini clad gal to fine actress and is probably the only one of the current Kapoor generation worthy of her great grandfather's name.I rate this movie a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zubeidaa was a real person. Shyam Benegal has tried to portray her story through the movie. When Indian films graduated from the silent era to the talkies Zubeida starred in the first Indian talkie  Alam Ara. She was a divorcee who fell in love with the then maharaja of Jodhpur. They got married but Zubeida never earned the status of a queen. She always remained the 'other woman'. Zubaida married the late Maharaja of Jodhpur Hanwant Singh a high flier who fell for her beauty. Both the Maharaja and Zubaida were killed in an air crash near Jodhpur 48 years ago. Their son Hukum Singh popularly known as Tutu Bana was murdered fifteen years ago under mysterious circumstances at Jodhpur. Well known film journalist Khalid Mohammed Zubaida's son from her first marriage wrote a story on her late mother. Originally it is a love story but for the film version little changes have been made. Now the film  Karishma Kapoor has matured as an actress. She was known as Govinda's heroine. Now with movies like Fiza and Zubeidaa Karishma has shown that she can act. Rekha is wonderful in her short but important role as the King's elder wife Mandira Devi. The only flaw I found was casting of Manoj Bajpai as the king. The Rajput kings were really majestic looking  tall and fair and very cultured. Manoj Bajpai did not have that in his personality though he made for it by his acting talent. This is not a typical Shyam Benegal film. People expecting a serious thought provoking movie would be disappointed. This is Shyam Benegal's first attempt to bridge the gap between Commercial cinema and the 'art' cinema.The movie is a love story of a journalist talking to people trying to find out all he can about a mother he never knew. He meets people and through them Zubeidaa's story unfolds. I enjoyed the movie and give it 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie today and I really enjoyed it  which is a bit surprising because I don't usually like Bollywood movies. I thought all the actors did really well especially Karisma Kapoor who played Zubeidaa. Playing the part couldn't have been easy for her since the character is incredibly complex and she pretty much carries the entire film on her own. So Kapoor certainly deserves plenty of kudos for her performance.What I really liked about the film was that the characters had so many layers to them. For example even though Zubeidaa is a fearless romantic the filmmakers also take care to show that she can be incredibly petty and insecure  especially when it comes to Mandira Devi's relationship with Victor. I want a necklace just like that! she insists when Victor buys a strand of diamonds for the senior queen. Touches like these really help make the characters come alive for the audience. These aren't stock characters in contrast they're real human beings with their own failings and inconsistencies.The only real problem I had with the film was that we don't get enough insight into Zubeidaa's relationship with Victor. The producers hint at the fact that Victor thinks of her as a toy whose job it is to amuse him. But is this really the case? The filmmakers never make this very clear which I think is something of a pity. I feel that this relationship in particular could have been developed more.Nonetheless I do think that Zubeidaa is an excellent film  and as another reviewer here at IMDb pointed out it's an excellent step up from the masala pot boilers that the Indian film industry seems to be churning out these days. If you're looking for a Bollywood period piece set in the 1950's that has good music acting and cinematography then Zubeidaa is it.P.S. If you've got the time I would suggest watching Aamir Khan's Oscarnominated 2001 film Lagaan along with this one. Both films deal with the subject of Indian independence and play very nicely off one another.".

The principal object of the search that will reveal much to him is a missing reel of 1952 film that Zubeidaa Karisma Kapoor completed before her father refused to let her undertake a career in the movies physically removing her from the set. Her father has other ideas for his daughter arranging a marriage to the son of a Pakistani businessman in order to form a closer alliance between the two families.When the marriage eventually fails despite the birth of a son Zubeidaa's rather more free and outgoing friend Rose introduces Zubeidaa to a wealthy Raja Vijendra Singh known as Victor who falls madly in love with her beauty. Despite already being married to the more exotic and refined Mandira Devi Rekha and despite being a Muslim while Victor is a Hindu Zubeidaa agrees to become the Maharaja's Junior Wife. The arrangement is inevitably not without difficulties Zubeidaa feeling threatened by Victor's brother and increasingly marginalised as Victor embarks upon an election campaign to retain authority and represent the best interests of the people of his region taking Mandy Didi as she is known to Zubeidaa along with him the whole affair ultimately resulting in tragedy.Zubeidaa is a vast and epic movie colourfully filmed in widescreen with an eye for the opulence of the period appropriately almost taking on the appearance of a nearfairytale for Zubeidaa's marriage to a wealthy Maharaja breaking into lively song and dance arrangements with an impressive score by A.R. Rahman Slumdog Millionaire. There is much more to the film however than it being a beautifully photographed fantasy the story dealing with Benegal's characteristic treatment of the diversity of Indian culture politics religion and tradition showing where it clashes and complements in all its infinite variety and beauty.".

This movie reminds me of MerchantIvory production with all blossoming English Countryside. Shyam Benegal is an ace director who has produced some classic ArtHouse films and Zubeida is one of them. Amrish Puri is his usual talented self. Karisma Kapoor has given her trademark acting but she will never reach the intensity of acting as in Rishtey. Manoj Bajpai is a good actor who does justice to any character he plays. This is a movie that leaves you the feeling that you have just read beautiful poetry and you want to read it over and over again.".

Its either Zubeidaa was one hell of a immature person or Karishma did a disastrous job. Karishma Kapoor has either given us Flops or has acted Immature in at least one scene in all her films in her entire career. This is more of an art movie that many people hardly like watching.

In fact this yarn reworks Sunset Boulevard into a fullbodied Italian comedy about how the tyrannical rich use their money to string along the poor and humble.Remember there was a card game in Wilder's film too! Here Bette Davis as poised professional and grandly selfassured as ever is the Norma Desmond character. She's shrewd not crazy but she's got everyone twisting their lives out of shape to humor her in much the same way. Joseph Cotten is the Max von Mayerling character  the artist who threw away a brilliant career to serve this imperious creature. The twist is that Commencini replaces William Holden's wry screenwriter Joe Gillis with Alberto Sordi and Silvana Mangano as the poor couple who've unwittingly staked their lives on whatever they can get from the old lady. Ultimately of course it's not just them but their entire neighborhood who Davis is leading on her merry chase strictly for her own amusement. The twist at the end is just as perfect in its own thoroughly Italian way as the finale of Wilder's film.Absolutely delightful  especially the wonderful body and facial language of all four principals at the cardtable. They could have kept it up twice as long and it would have been just as amusing. Four expert screen actors directed to perfection.Can the bizzersincharge PLEASE find a decent print of this and DVD it right away?".

The children themselves are both brilliantly cast and wonderfully realistic by which I mean that their behaviour is easily recognisable as the normal behaviour of manipulative and moody kids until it spills over to the purely demonic.The rest of the cast who apart from Stephen Campbell Moore I didn't recognise all portrayed characters who were very believable even if not entirely sympathetic. After all how can you sympathise with smug middle class parents discussing homeschooling now that they've sold the business? The adults were in fact wonderfully flawed matched in spades by Casey who enters the movie as the least sympathetic character selfish self absorbed and distant in the way that only a sixteen year old can be. However Casey is arguably the real hero.The script skillfully presents the tip of the iceberg suggesting and hinting at the unseen part of the characters' lives never spelling everything out but crediting the audience with the wit to work some things out for themselves. The horror clich of characters doing stupid or unrealistic things that annoy the audience was always avoided as was the use of the dark. Instead the action takes place against a white Christmas backdrop which sadly reminded me a little of Reny Harlin's 'snow' bound Die Hard 2 but even so the blood on snow motif was very effective.Tom Shankland's script and in particular the dialogue was very convincing but he is also a highly visual director. According to my girlfriend the Miss Marple he helmed is quite beautifully photographed and I really liked the atmosphere and visuals in WAZ. The Children also has the same stunning images which along with the very powerful soundtrack conjure a mood of foreboding and dread. If you appreciate horror movies with tension and beauty as well as a succession of wince inducing set pieces then this is a film for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two families gather at a remote house for a Christmas and new year holiday. However the young children affected by something in the woods begin to turn on the adults.I have to say this movie was a welcome surprise. Written and directed by Tom Shankland who made WAZ and based on a story from Paul Andrew Williams who made the recent horror The Cottage The Children is a very well made movie.One of the main reasons I enjoyed it was that it never explains why the children are doing what they are doing. It's suggested there is something in the woods to blame but it is never fully explained. In a way this is similar to The Ruins or even Rec and I liked that. Too many movies try to explain what is going on but the better horror movies leave it open and I think this approach works better as it does here.The cast are all pretty good with special mention given to Eva Sayer as one of the children and Hannah Tointon as Casey the only teen in the group.One of the clever things about this movie and there are many things to like about itis how the adults react as events get out of control. To begin with they are nice and friendly couples the two women being sisters but as the movie progresses they turn on themselves as they refuse to accept what is happening. Of course by the time they do realise what is going on it's much too late! The movie is rated 15 in the UK and does keep most of the violence offscreen but it is creepy throughout and Shankland keeps the tension and unease high even when nothing has happened yet. And he stages some some impressive scenes especially the first adult attack involving a sledge a trolley with sharp items on it. It could almost come from a Final Destination movie!And to top of everything there is the ending. While not a truly bleak ending although some may see it that way it's a very very creepy ending and one I really didn't expect.As horror movies go for this year this is one of the best I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The premise of this movie is indeed real primal horror. During the holidays a family reunion turns into a madness when children become increasingly disturbed due to what looks like a mysterious illness.Creepy kids have been done a number of times in cinema but what separates this latest entry from many that came before it is the feeling that these kids are still kids. Certainly disturbed and not totally themselves but not entirely evil. Cruel but not zombies mind controlled or aliens. There is still fear and fragility which makes them a lot scarier for viewers especially parents.Adding to the horror is that when the parents stand up for themselves against the kids these acts of resistance are unsatisfying to us unlike other movies of the genre. That is you do remain conflicted as a viewer instead of the typical Hollywood trash. And that is what horror is about.The story is good wellpaced with a suitably tensed escalation of the menace the children represent. The characters coping with this threat a group of adults and a teenager are believable instead of walking clichs.On the downside the movie has a definite lowbudget feel to it. I was surprised that Tom Shankland would direct something like this after his previous work the polished horrorthriller Waz. A low budget plus a lot of kid actors mean that corners were cut. The film would certainly have benefited from more takes. A lot more takes in fact. The adult actors are underwhelming and the script could have used another pass or two to make it more compelling from start to end. There are still two or three very memorable sequences in the movie such as the one following the first body's disappearance. But overall I think Shankland will cringe at a lot of scenes here. For instance one character spends some great deal of time with a serious injury but the result on camera is completely unbelievable.So what we are left with is an indie movie with a lot of heart and that does a lot of things well. It is extremely courageous in its treatment. It offers something good and refreshing. And it could have been a masterpiece with slightly more budget. I'm giving this a welldeserved 6.As a complement to this film and to see the other side of the coin I strongly suggest watching Lars E. Jacobson's Baby Blues immediately before or after The Children.".

The rustling trees and undergrowth are very reminiscent of the Happening. The malevolent children reprising themes from The Omen The Brood and Village of the Damned. Shankland creates some genuinely scary scenes as the children turn on their bewildered parents. But insufficient prior characterisation means that the viewer tends to be more irritated by the adults poor decision making than be sympathetic to their plight. The gratuitous blonde in underwear shot shows that Shankland understands the demands of the genre well! A generally pacey 84 minute story has expired as the film draws to its close but the final shot is still pretty chilling is a fitting coda and offers the opportunity of a sequel. The fact that what has happened is not explained is a bonus rather than a source of frustration and the blood and gore particularly as it is delivered by children stretches the 15 certification to its limits.Sufficiently off beat both in terms of location and content to satisfy the Horror crowd and potentially a minor Cult classic.".

Robbie brings the other children to play in the snow and while riding in a sledge Nicky puts some tools in the way and Robbie dies with the impact on his head. Soon the children attack the adults and Casey and her mother seeks shelter. Will someone survive?The Children is a gore horror film with a story that does not explain why only the children are affected by some mysterious virus that make them violent against adults. The plot is tense but gives the sensation that something is missing to make The Children a great horror movie. The open conclusion makes the viewer wondering whether Casey is also infected or not.

	schema:reviewBody "Saw a preview of this. Was worried that it would be a bit cheesy but it had me and my girlfriend on the edge of our seats. Really gripping and uses psychological rather than gore to scare. Very good for a British horror and has a kind of style and gloss that you usually associate with American films. Lead girl the one from Hollyoaks is fantastic and very cute and there are good turns from some excellent upcoming British actors. Jeremy Sheffield the handsome one from Holby City is excellent I'm surprised he has not been a leading man before. Story pitch is about a couple of middle class families with issues who meet up for Chistmas together. One of the kids seems to have a virus and over the holiday gradually the behaviour of the children starts to change as they become wild and feral and turn on their over anxious parents. For people with kids it's pretty uncomfortable and creepy but if you've ever got fed up of those overly protective middle class parents who let their kids do whatever they want and can't control them then this is good fun. I notice it's from the same director as WAZ which was also a good film so it seems like he knows what he is doing and is one to watch in future.".

Lots of dead staring and vomiting my guess to show that the kids have some sort of virus I believe  although this is never explained in any way or form in the film. But the clue would be in the amount of vomit left by each child missed by all parents throughout the film which has its affect one by one as the brats turn into Mac wearing make up freaks.The clue here is... when you see miniature people running around in shiny plastic jackets Don't Look Now you run for your life. You do not hang around screaming and ignoring vomit and nearly dead people with brains oozing. You take the nearest car and you run. I can of course only speak for myself when I say I hated the parents and I hated the kids so no real loss there then. I didn't like any of the characters so I became a cheerleader for the kids to 'go get 'em'.All in all if you're looking for a Chucky 1234567 come baby Blair Witch Project with mini Gordon Ramsay people running around with knives screaming 'Mummy' then this is the film for you!".

And then we pressed PLAY...5 minutes into the film I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for being the one responsible for hiring this DVD The sound was so bad that none of us could make out what they were saying. Okay so it's a lowbudget production. So we put the volume on 100 and we soldiered on holding thumbs that it would get better. But it didn't. It just got worse and worse No storyline no plot no intention whatsoever. Just loads of inadequate and badly acted crying and moaning. SO IRRITATING!!! It was really just a looped replay of Where's the child? Lets go find the child OK found the child! Somebody dies. Nobody cares. Evil child disappears. Ok Where's the child?.... and SO IT WENT ON AND ON AND ON IN CIRCLES. With some horrifying pffft!! closeups of a germvirus on a pillow WTF?. No seriously guys! What a LOAD OF RUBBISH.So I made it my mission to be kind and to make sure that I posted a review of this movie to save any curious body the agony of sitting through it... just for in case YOU might think it would be an evening of good entertainment.

The only one not sick is the teenager who at one point in the movie gets blamed for what is happening with the kids. The ending is confusing as hell. Not only was the plot poor but so was the writing. The only reason I watched this was because I read an article online stating it was one of the most disturbing movies.

The adults in the film do their best to convince us otherwise looking absolutely terrified when confronted by a three foot tall moppet and screaming their lungs out at every available opportunity but all the histrionics in the world ain't going to turn these tiny tykes into the bogeyman.Furthermore the film suffers from editing that is more far more diabolical than any of its murderous children making certain scenes virtually impossible to follow and the script is hampered by both contrivance and ambiguity I'm not one of those people that needs everything spelt out for me to enjoy a movie but The Children's lack of exposition feels suspiciously like a copoutas though the writers just couldn't be bothered to come up with a convincing reason for the kids' startling behaviour.I appreciate the fact that director Tom Shankland who was also responsible for the disappointing WAZ doesn't shy away from depicting the violence in graphic detail particularly when the grownups start to fight back showing a kiddy meeting a grisly fate is still considered a step too far by many and I appreciate even more that hot Hollyoaks babe Hannah Tointon gets to prance around for the whole film in an insanely short miniskirt and overtheknee stockings and her mum ain't bad either but even those elements do not come close to compensating for the film's crappier qualities.Quite how The Children has garnered so many positive comments and an average rating of 6.4 here on IMDb is beyond me but I'm giving it a scathing review and a score of 210 in order to try and redress the balance.".

LoL  But with The Children you actually feel the fear because you 100 totally understand why its hard for the parents to injure or kill their kids... or even simply be able to comprehend WTF IS HAPPENING around them  Love the use of sound and was very impressed by quite a few of the nice camera angles used to enhance the suspense.

	schema:reviewBody "Two middle class families enjoy a Christmas getaway deep in the rural English countryside . One morning the children become truculent then visibly hostile and very soon the adults find themselves fighting for their lives against their own children This is a low budget British horror film that seems to owe a bit to THE HAPPENING but in many ways is much more superior to the aforementioned film . Where THE CHILDREN works superbly is building up an ever escalating sense of tension as young cherubic children become more and more psychotic leaving the parents with the uncommon dilemma of wanting to live in which case they'll need to violently defend themselves against their offspring or having to politely remonstrate with them in which case the adults will almost certainly get murdered to death The screenplay doesn't really itself with an explanation on what has made the children turn homicidal and this makes the film much more enigmatic and menacing as we see the story unfold through the eyes of the adults and somewhat typically the BBC decided to show this right bang in the middle of Summer during one of the very rare heatwaves we get in this country and one thinks this is certainly a film that would be very hard hitting it it's viewed in the bleak cold winter with snow on the ground As good as THE CHILDREN is it's not flawless . Director Tom Shankland does use the stale format of loud noise to constantly scare the audience and has a technical feel of a debut feature . It's also a film you think is produced as a calling card where the production team get a massive budget for a sequel and you can see the ambiguous and gloomy ending a mile away . But that said as a disconcerting horror movie that didn't cost much it's very good at what it does".

Where THE CHILDREN works superbly is building up an ever escalating sense of tension as young cherubic children become more and more psychotic leaving the parents with the uncommon dilemma of wanting to live in which case they'll need to violently defend themselves against their offspring or having to politely remonstrate with them in which case the adults will almost certainly get murdered to death The screenplay doesn't really itself with an explanation on what has made the children turn homicidal and this makes the film much more enigmatic and menacing as we see the story unfold through the eyes of the adults and somewhat typically the BBC decided to show this right bang in the middle of Summer during one of the very rare heatwaves we get in this country and one thinks this is certainly a film that would be very hard hitting it it's viewed in the bleak cold winter with snow on the ground As good as THE CHILDREN is it's not flawless . Director Tom Shankland does use the stale format of loud noise to constantly scare the audience and has a technical feel of a debut feature . It's also a film you think is produced as a calling card where the production team get a massive budget for a sequel and you can see the ambiguous and gloomy ending a mile away . But that said as a disconcerting horror movie that didn't cost much it's very good at what it does";

The children appear to catch some sort of viral infection. The parents don't really take it very seriously at first. But as each child succumbs they turn into mini serial killers. The surviving adults have a hard time defending themselves as they slowly realize there is only one way to deal with the children.I liked the actors and they felt very natural.Complaints well it was very slow moving at first. And we never got an explanation of what the disease was or where it came from. So there really wasn't much to the plot. And there weren't enough adults so we didn't get a whole lot of killings.The ending is open for a sequel.I would recommend the movie but I think it's more for those of us who prefer older 70's horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "The horror movie usually comes in one of two possible and likely forms. The first blend is the thrillerorientated horror splashed with lots of loud noises running around and screaming teenagers. The second and much more welcome to anyone with half a brain of the two is the more dramatic kind. This variant is ironically the less frequent but it too often shows audiences what a real scary movie can do. The Children then is surprisingly something of an oddity in its design and structure in regards to these two common styles. Sandwiched between two very strong acts of characterisation and tense atmospherics the movie takes a massive dive during its middle act which resorts to the same old clichs that make the genre so unbearable to most. It's also the classic example of a director's talent being wasted on a script that is far below his capabilities and yet without such an important figure the movie would have fell flat on its face. So while it staggers through the finish line with a limp The Children is nevertheless a good example of horror done adequately but nowhere near perfectly.Telling the story of a New Years family get together out in a secluded part of the wilderness The Children is a foreboding change of focus for the genre in that the movie's antagonists are around three foot tall and cry for their mommy. Of course the premise is undoubtedly hammy on paper the idea of these children turning sour and attempting to kill their parents is something easily brushed off the shoulder yet director Tom Shankland does well in convincing us otherwise. Opening the feature with a perfectly paced piece of family drama and characterisation Shankland introduces us to our characters that we instinctively know at least one of is going to get whacked off. This in turn makes the movie's rather predictable middle act a little more sustainable thanks to the domestic overtone to all the violence and horror and the result is more likely to have you wince rather than groan. Yet lumbered with such a plodding and tiresome body The Children too often focuses away from the elements that make it engaging in the first place neglected to having characters run around alone looking for things ideas wear thin and the plot disintegrates along with the numerous corpses replacing such characters.One thing that really is quite astounding about the movie however lies in the performances not just in the adults but of the children themselves. Very rarely is it the case and primarily so in this genre that children performers are able to fill their roles without a sense of awkwardness to their presence that too often draws attention to the director's commands. Shankland here makes himself invisible and manages to get some convincing work out of his young thespians as a result. Sure enough the script makes sure that this isn't anything new for anyone involved characters are rudimentary but the performers do well with what they are given under the direction of Shankland to the point where the movie's horror is accentuated through the character rather than their grief. Combined with the erratic and often disorientating score penned by Stephen Hilton and the derivative but effective photography of Nanu Segal The Children makes for a convincingly tense movie that makes up for its lacking script with fine aesthetics and implementation.As a horror movie The Children does well specifically during its opening and closing acts establishing characters that feel like more than maniac fodder whilst avoiding bringing too much focus on the somewhat shaky premise and instead shifting towards the atmosphere involved and the character's reactions to this. As a result Shankland's movie definitely feels more like a mature and intelligent example of the genre but is too often undermined by the formulated and mundane middle act that wields a bloodied knife. So while there is something to be appreciated by most audiences who may or may not be attracted to the genre the restrictive and polarising nature of the clashing styles hurts the movie's integrity and ability to fully satisfy either crowd. Some will find things to enjoy within the excessive violence and cheesy plot whilst others will gravitate more towards the movie's thick atmosphere but it's hard to see anyone loving the whole rather than its greater parts. A fair effort from Shankland but as much good as he does with his cumbersome script it is that which is his ultimate undoing here.610  A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

'The Children' is a horror movie about a couple of yuppie families coming together to celebrate new year's eve in a nice outoftheway mansion one of those with no mobile phone signal just when you need them. After discussing the benefits of homeschooling their offspring and Chinese herbal medicine the children of both families go nuts and start murdering their parents indiscriminately. Why? Um we don't know. They just do.It's actually quite good too. There is gore but it's done well and not overused. The adults are pretty smug and it's quite fun when they get the smile wiped off their faces using a sledge and a climbing frame you'll have to watch it to understand.The first half of the film sets the second more gruesome half up quite nicely. The best part of The Children is the children. It was obviously difficult persuading a bunch of under ten year olds to act like Jason Voorhees but they've managed it here presumably without ending up psychologically damaging the poor kids for life. The kids are pretty damn creepy.Some reviewers have pointed out that one of the film's flaws is that the baddies are kids. Just kids. No superpowers or anything just kids. Therefore it shouldn't be that hard to subdue them. However bear in mind that those being hunted are the children's parents therefore they may find it hard to defend themselves against a little person they've spent their life bringing up.The Children isn't a perfect movie but if you like horror you should find it fun.Of course if the parents had done what the rest of us adults do when our kids get out of hand i.e. put on Cbeebies at the first sign of unrest then none of the bad stuff in the film would have happened. All hail Peppa Pig. This film is the best advert for birth control you'll ever see.httpthewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk".

I NEVER curse. Actually I rarely curse. I've only cursed about five times in my whole short life. To see that I cursed out about ten words under my breath through the film is just AMAZING! This is not because characters are stupid although some of them are. It's because the movie is basically a taboo. You see kids holding knives kids killing people parents killing kids etc! It's a movie filled with what society taught us not to do!And don't get me started on the tension. The film has some of the best buildups in a WHILE. In fact the very first attack we'll call it is edited so well your heart gets racing a minute before the attacking starts! I must say that's an incredible feat! And who would've thought kids are creepy? The amount of violence in here is also surprisingly high and I say that as a complement.For a movie based around killer kids you must have good no great young actors to take these parts. You shan't be afraid. The kids in here are fantastic. The one that stuck out the most was Raffiella Brooks an Amy Smart lookalike and probably the best acted kid in the group. The older people are also very good here.Overall it's a big surprise of course. Just when you think your expectations are right they get punched down one by one every minute that you watch this film. The film is genuinely creepy and has some great nailbiting tension. However it's ultimately forgettable the second the credits role. Still it's a nice way to spend 80 minutes of your life.".

I would never have expected such a positive surprise. If you know the directors previous movie WAZ you know what kind of cold bleakness to expect also in this one. What makes this movie refreshing is that it doesn't go for creepy children with forks chasing people but rather for an eerie kind of realism. The whole thing starts out slow and cynically set around the Christmas holidays where some families meet for a festive season. Soon one kid starts to act strange and the only explanation given for the kids acting weirder and weirder is some kind of infection. What really works great is the paranoia of the parents not expecting that the bad things happening are connected to their children and of course not being able to hurt them remember that Spanish movie with the island of children... pretty similar premise. Accidents start to happen the children are getting aggressive but are not blindly going for their parents but plotting some pretty devious traps. There is no positive outcome here and the finale could be interpreted in several ways but none positive. Its strange that many European movies go for this realistic bleakness lately. The incredible Eden lake comes to mind and shares some similarities. Go watch this movie if you are into movies creeping you out rather on a psychological but on a visual level. Don't fall for the title... it made me expect a rather typical horror movie but this one sure isn't although the basic premise is well known.".

There is no positive outcome here and the finale could be interpreted in several ways but none positive. Its strange that many European movies go for this realistic bleakness lately. The incredible Eden lake comes to mind and shares some similarities. Go watch this movie if you are into movies creeping you out rather on a psychological but on a visual level. Don't fall for the title... it made me expect a rather typical horror movie but this one sure isn't although the basic premise is well known.";

What I suppose was intended to be suspenseful build up was simply 30 minutes of directionless boredom waiting for a plot to become apparent. Then even once the action got started there was still parts that simply seemed to be time filler.Several of the violence scenes are pure chaos. Essentially just wild shaking camera movement with some flashes of objects being knocked over a few flash frame closeups of someone's eyeball or a twirling lawn ornament and then when the camera shaking stops....someone is hurt or dead. Hmmm okay.But the most irritating aspect throughout the entire movie was that the parent's actions and reactions rarely make much sense at all. Like your daughter just clawed someone's face bloody at the dinner table  so then the mothers sit having some calm discussion while the little girl is heard upstairs screaming? Or your 5yo daughter is in a tent with a huge trail of blood leading up to it  so you stop and think a while then sloooowly tip toe up to the tent and pause and look around before bothering to look in at your daughter? This movie is filled with utterly implausible character reactions to the violence going on around them.".

Going in I wasn't entirely sure what to expectdefinitely some nudity probably some posing in long strings of pearls and funny hats some dancing around maybe a bit of simulated sex. But no this was fullon hardcore pornography with closeups and money shots and everything.  I wouldn't say it was all overly arousing.  But it was fascinating and somewhat informative.The women were mostly goodlooking but not in that sleek modern way. They had bulges where modern porn stars don't they had hair growing in places and in amounts that wouldn't be fashionable today.  Although I have to say I'm getting a bit weary of the modern nohair look.But what was cool about most of these films was that the people involved seemed to be having such a good time.  There was a weird sort of innocent charm about the films.  They didn't feel dirty so much even though there was lots of perverse goings onlots of nuns a bit of bestiality involving nuns prostitution some peeing etcetera.  But there was nothing cynical or ironical about them and I appreciated that.  It was all in good fun. It was almost like watching some of the really early Chaplin films except with penetration.I was highly surprised at and happy about the amount of lesbianism. Almost every one of these films contained some lesbianism often involving lesbian nuns.  I was surprised because I sorta thought lesbianism was more of a modern fixation.  But I guess some things are timeless.  There was also a brief small snippet of male oral homosexuality and the one dude looked really uncomfortable and unhappy about it and he practically leaped up and back over to the woman when the gay part of his scene was over.The highlight of the program the one that got the crowd screaming and clapping was a sick and twisted and hilarious animated film about a little man with a giant detachable penis running around and sticking it into things cows donkeys etcetera and swordfighting.  It was way better than the Disney stuff from the 20s.The films were edited together in a clever way to keep it all from getting repetitive and uninteresting. Definitely worth my 8.50.810".

Although events played out differently so many elements in the film are nearmirror reflections of the reality.

Roger Deacons adds his wonderful cinematography and Bruce Willis turns in a fine performance as an overzealous army general.The film delivers a cautionary tale about extreme reactions to terror and the loss of freedoms that can result from acting in anger rather than with reason and law.  The rounding up of citizens as depicted in the film and the declarations of martial law are not that far away from the provisions of the Patriot Act which violates First Amendment rights the right to privacy and the right to due process.  The film suggests that by giving up these rights or stripping them away we become the very thing that our enemies claim we are. It suggests that that may be the terrorists true aim.This is not a crystal ball prediction of 911 but it is a fine thriller. The filmmakers did their homework and got quite a bit right.  They also extrapolated things to an extreme but not an implausible one.  However they delivered an excellent film and one that should be seen and studied.".

Even at that time I knew that the protests against this film were nothing more than politically correct nonsense as even then the only transoceanic terrorists that existed were of the fakeMuslim variety that today we hear about every hour.When I saw the film I was impressed by the fair nature of the film in that it portrayed the truth  these extremists exist in the overwhelming minority of Muslims and that it is unwise and unfair to paint them all with the same brush.  With a very good script excellent performances and exciting action pieces I was impressed.Jump ahead a few years and we see what we have learned.  This film was not just an intelligent story.  It was a warning sign.  It examined things that people did not want to talk about.  It examined things that people thought it more politically correct to ignore.  It portrayed events realistically and in fact far less devastating than what was possible.  If there is one thing that can be learned by examining a film such as this in retrospective of recent events it is that our species chooses to ignore that which it does not want to accept.Those who do not learn from their history are doomed to repeat it. Perhaps there are other subjects we should stop being so PC about and actually talk about instead of worrying about how it will look.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first glance The Siege looks to be a jingoistic typically heroic American patriot film. But upon further review and if you honestly give this movie a chance and listen to what it has to say you'll see that it wants us to listen it wants us to learn and it wants us to just look at the possibilities of  what if? .This is one of the best movies that I have seen in recent years and what kind of stumps me is the negative criticism surrounding the film not just the complaint of racism  I'll get into that later  but about the film in general. And I have come to a conclusion that not everybody will agree with and certainly many will dislike.The positive reviews that have been in the IMDb have been at least a great many of them from people that are nationalities other than American. And perhaps the reason for that is that we can sit back and look at the U.S. from afar and it may be easier for us  as non Americans  to understand more clearly what this movie is trying to say. And it may be easier for us  whatever nationality we happen to be  to understand what is wrong with America and why a film like this is just trying to give one possible reason for the decay of American society. That is not to say that our own countries don't have problems because they do but we can just see what is wrong with America a little easier we are not blinded by our own patriotism. It may be easier still for perhaps Europeans to appreciate the movie even more than others because maybe their own countries have been under siege at one point or another. And maybe the relevance is that much more prevalent when you have been that close to something.And what this movie has to say perhaps should not be taken lightly.Steve Martin's character in  The Grand Canyon  uttered the line  watch the movies they have all of life's answers.  Perhaps that has never been more true than what this film's message is. And I believe that message is that sooner or later if there is always going to be that one watch dog that one Big Brother that is known as the United States then something like this may happen. What if....I truly believe this movie has been unfairly criticized about it's apparent racist tones. Every time there is a bombing by terrorists that are Arab in heritage there is always a scene that follows where the Arab leagues lend their support and let the FBI know that they want these criminals brought to justice just as much as anyone does.  They love this country just as much as we do.  Denzel says in one of his speeches to the people in charge. Is it really racism when a movie tries to explore what could happen when one body of government takes matters in their own hands and breaks international law? To me every effort was made to show Arabs as normal family loving law abiding peaceful citizens that they are. A bunch of Arab terrorists does not mean that all Arabs are fanatics that are bent on destroying America. That perception is like believing that all we as Canadians do is play hockey drink beer and play in the snow.The movie itself is so well acted and it is so well written that I really can't understand why Washington did not get a nod for best actor. He is mesmerizing. And I think his final confrontation with the general is tense and brilliant.Washington plays Hub a very patriotic by the book FBI agent that is personally affected by all the chaos that has ensued in his city and he plays him brilliantly. Bening and Shaloub are also wonderful in their roles and the music in the film is haunting. Willis is a little weak in the film but that is minor in comparison to the rest of the movie.If you haven't seen this film because of what you have heard give it a chance it is well worth it. And try to watch it and listen to what it has to say. You may be surprised. I'm not sure if something like this could ever happen to the US but it is not out of the realm of possibility.".

And after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism' we continue to lose. Movies that make people think and talk are valuable and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered.Yes there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as Denzel Washington Annette Bening Tony Shalhoub Bruce Willis Sami Bouajila Ahmed Ben Larby Aasif Mandvi among others. And then there are the panoramas of New York City under siege with the Twin Towers standing mightily in the cityscape... It begs the question if scriptwriter Lawrence Wright and director Edward Zwick Blood Diamond The Last Samurai Courage Under Fire Glory Leaving Normal Legends of the Fall etc were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces why weren't the leaders in Washington DC in tune with 'absurd possibilities'?

What is confounding here is how much of this originally semicorny movie got right. Washington Benning Shaloub and Willis all deliver in a big fashion with some pertinent warnings. The road not taken was the moral. How scary that in the long run when presented by a much larger threat we oneupped this movie's punch line in reality. How much stranger can you get than that?

	schema:headline " The war in the streets of Brooklyn";
	schema:reviewBody "What if the events in the news about the Middle East were to happen in the crowded streets of Brooklyn? Buses being blown by terrorists or a bombing at the FBI headquarters downtown Manhattan or even a Broadway theater? No one is spared in this war being waged by terrorists that have infiltrated the country. In view of how the world has changed in the post September 11th era it is not a far fetched idea because it could happen at any given moment.The Siege directed by Edward Zwick who also collaborated on the screen play in retrospect can be seen as precautionary warning of how things could degenerate when a group of Middle Eastern extremists start setting up a number of deathly attacks on institutions one holds dear. After all wasn't the purpose of most of the wars to be fought overseas in order to keep America safe? Anthony Hubbard the level headed FBI agent in charge of investigating the terrorists' activities must face deadly enemies. In doing so he also has to deal with the bigotry as the press and the government decide to round up innocent law abiding people whose only fault is to be of the same race as the few people that are creating panic in the city with their agenda. Of course all this came out in a 1998 movie which proves to be almost prophetic in heralding the attacks on the Twin Towers.The Siege in a way points out to the present Guantanamo. When hundreds of ArabAmericans are detained they are sent into holding places where there is no hope of having justice done. Things go from bad to worse when Frank Haddad Hubbard's own partner learns his own teen aged son is taken to one of those places. A father's despair is real since he works trying to preserve law and order but suddenly he realizes that bigotry has won the battle.The other aspect of the story involves a sort of Mata Hari an American born in Lebanon whose loyalties are always questioned. We don't know whether to believe Elisa Kraft and yet she is always at the right place at the right moment sometimes fighting Hubbard who is skeptical of her methods.When all hell lets loose a misguided Army general William Devereaux is made to be in charge of the forces protecting New York City. Martial Law is declared and the city is living its worse moment until Hubbard rises to challenge Devereaux and his men.As thrillers go The Siege is packed with action. Denzel Washington is perfect as the decent FBI agent in charge. Annette Benning brings an aura of mystery to her CIA operative who could be also a double spy. Tony Shalhoub appears as Hubbard's partner. Bruce Willis is the uptight Gen. Devereaux.Edward Zwick directed with his usual style making this a satisfactory tale that can well happen although one can only hope it never does. Steven Rosemblum's editing works well with the action in the film. The cinematography of Roger Deakins captures a Brooklyn that is seldom seen in pictures. The music score by Grame Revill adds to the texture of the film.".

Buses being blown by terrorists or a bombing at the FBI headquarters downtown Manhattan or even a Broadway theater? No one is spared in this war being waged by terrorists that have infiltrated the country. In view of how the world has changed in the post September 11th era it is not a far fetched idea because it could happen at any given moment.The Siege directed by Edward Zwick who also collaborated on the screen play in retrospect can be seen as precautionary warning of how things could degenerate when a group of Middle Eastern extremists start setting up a number of deathly attacks on institutions one holds dear. After all wasn't the purpose of most of the wars to be fought overseas in order to keep America safe? Anthony Hubbard the level headed FBI agent in charge of investigating the terrorists' activities must face deadly enemies. In doing so he also has to deal with the bigotry as the press and the government decide to round up innocent law abiding people whose only fault is to be of the same race as the few people that are creating panic in the city with their agenda. Of course all this came out in a 1998 movie which proves to be almost prophetic in heralding the attacks on the Twin Towers.The Siege in a way points out to the present Guantanamo. When hundreds of ArabAmericans are detained they are sent into holding places where there is no hope of having justice done. Things go from bad to worse when Frank Haddad Hubbard's own partner learns his own teen aged son is taken to one of those places. A father's despair is real since he works trying to preserve law and order but suddenly he realizes that bigotry has won the battle.The other aspect of the story involves a sort of Mata Hari an American born in Lebanon whose loyalties are always questioned. We don't know whether to believe Elisa Kraft and yet she is always at the right place at the right moment sometimes fighting Hubbard who is skeptical of her methods.When all hell lets loose a misguided Army general William Devereaux is made to be in charge of the forces protecting New York City. Martial Law is declared and the city is living its worse moment until Hubbard rises to challenge Devereaux and his men.As thrillers go The Siege is packed with action. Denzel Washington is perfect as the decent FBI agent in charge. Annette Benning brings an aura of mystery to her CIA operative who could be also a double spy. Tony Shalhoub appears as Hubbard's partner. Bruce Willis is the uptight Gen. Devereaux.Edward Zwick directed with his usual style making this a satisfactory tale that can well happen although one can only hope it never does. Steven Rosemblum's editing works well with the action in the film. The cinematography of Roger Deakins captures a Brooklyn that is seldom seen in pictures. The music score by Grame Revill adds to the texture of the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1998 The Siege chronicles events as New York City becomes the target of escalating terrorist attacks after the abduction of an Islamic leader by the US military. The head of the FBI's CounterTerrorism Task Force Denzel Washington teams up with a CIA operative Annette Benning to hunt down the terrorist cells responsible for the attacks. Ultimately the US government declares martial law and sends in the troops led by General Devereaux Bruce Willis. Tony Shalhoub plays the FBI agent's ArabAmerican partner while Sami Bouajila plays a seemingly suspicious ArabAmerican.While clueless PC morons have criticized this movie as racist propaganda it dared to show the awful truth in the late 90s and was nigh prophetic in light of 911 occurring less than three years later. There are numerous noble ArabAmericans and the movie emphasizes this but  let's be honest  there are also Islamic whackjobs in our midst who enjoy blowing themselves up with as many innocents as possible so they can go home to Allah and 72 virgins or whatever.I like the fact that General Devereaux Willis isn't a black or white character and viewers can have completely different views about whether or not he's actually a villain. The movie shows that he's a professional soldier who warns the governmental leaders exactly what would happen under martial Law a suspension of all civilian rights guaranteed under the constitution clearly cautioning them that they might not like the form of medicine martial law dishes out. But it's a desperate situation and they give him the goahead so he offers up exactly what he said he would give. He has his methods to protect his country and performs them with conviction. The terrorists were killing masses of innocents and he's commissioned to stop it which is what he does PC or not. Does this make him evil? These are questions the movie provokes and you'll have to answer them for yourself.This is a quality movie that frankly addresses relevant topics and tries to be fair and balanced but it sorta shoots itself in the foot at the end. Read the spoiler commentary below for details.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in New York City with a couple scenes in California.GRADE B SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM One of the main points of the movie is that it's wrong to mistreat MuslimAmericans by profiling them rounding them up and subjecting them to investigation outside normal procedures because it's equivalent to the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2. There are two problems with this 1. It isn't the same issue. Interning the Japanese was wrong because the government was rounding them up based on their ETHNIC HERITAGE. The Feds would've interned GermanAmericans if they used the same logic. The issue with Muslim terrorism isn't ethnicity but rather religion. Statistically most terrorists against the US are Muslims of Middle Eastern descent. Therefore profiling them is simply acting in accord with statistics. That's just cold hard logic not racism. By contrast interning JapaneseAmericans during WW2 wasn't logical.2. More importantly the movie undermines itself by having Samir turn out to be a radical suicide bomber. This revelation demonstrates that peaceful Muslims can't be trusted just as the Army and their supporters believed in the movie. There's no reason to assume that any of the rankandfile Muslims depicted couldn't have turned out to be terrorists just like Samir. This being the case the army was right to intern and interrogate them. As you can see the movie takes a noble position and then inexplicably contradicts it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning Contains minor plot spoilage When I first watched the movie a year or so ago the first thing that really caught my attention in the beginning of the movie was the first explosion. There was no ludicrous running from the explosion like you see in most action movies. Washington's character blinked because of the explosion flash and then was thrown on his tail by the force of the detonation. Because he was facing the explosion he received a bloody noise from the air concussion before even hitting the ground and he couldn't hear after the explosion. They also showed him in  shock right after the explosion.  The impact of the explosion  on inanimate objects was also more accurate. You could clearly see the inverse falling off effect of distance from the explosion.Glass shattering was shown in slow motion at the same slow mention speed as the fireball moving in the background. These are details of things that happen in real life that I haven't seen in any other movie action or otherwise. And that was a very small thing about the movie that impressed me. I think the story line is extremely plausible and appropriately complex which I thought before 911. The analysis of the culture of the terrorists was very accurate compared to most  movies dealing with the topic. The terrorists weren't demonized and their motives were examined and explained in a well balanced way. I think Bruce Willis does the movie a disservice although it is  his history of action and mediocre characters that hurts the movie not his actual acting in the movie. The complexity of his character is interesting. The movie leaves it up to interpretation whether General Devereaux is really reluctant to impose martial law on New York or whether he just tells the congressional committee what they want to hear in order to get himself in. Devereaux is definitely the bad guy in the movie but not because he is portrayed as the nexus of evil but because his worldview allows him to rationalize actions that are unAmerican. One of the biggest criticisms that I have seen of the movie is that the end of the movie is not believable because of the martial law that is imposed on New York City. But if two or three more significant attacks happen to New York City I won't be surprised at all if martial law is declared there. I always thought the movie was excellent but with the events in recent days the impact of the movie has definitely ratcheted up a few notches.".

The first time I saw this movie I really got immersed into the plot it was a great drama displaying the deployment of Army forces to protect the US integrity versus the struggle of the reason and the law to protect it's citizens rights... evidently the ArabAmericans would be angry about the stereotypes displayed but also the Hispanic have been portrayed at Hollywood with the same old stereotypes thousands of times which BTW it's boring anyway at the end it's all for the show and to make the movie believable... however it was ALL fiction. But in the morning of Sept 11 2001. The first thought that came to my mind yet in disbelief as I saw on CNN planes falling all over NYC and in DC was.. 'that' movie! Days after the WTC Attack I saw this movie again and obviously to my regret I found many new things to meditate about this movie makes an interesting remark about what almost every US government have done at least one time the so called 'shift of policy' and this is the key to the whole mess in the movie and in real life US government can't pretend to look after some 'groups organizations or people' when they are useful to their interest and when they no longer need them just dispose then like trash remember 'what goes around comes around...' sure I totally condemn terrorism but as we can learn from the movie this kind of behavior gives birth to extreme hate and enemies and this is or was NO fiction. You can't develop relations on a double moral standard like the character played by Bening sooner or later the price has to be paid so it's better to stand beside those who help you always not only for pure convenience because no one wants a 'friend' like that right? This can be the great moral of the movie. Be honest construct relations on loyalty learn to be tolerant please stop thinking that US is the world and tear down to the stereotypes but mainly be humble! Personally I think it's a great movie that sadly portrays some similar events that a few years later 2001 became real one can't be blame if at one point it's mistakenly thinking that this movie was an inspiration to the WTC Attacks. Mr. Denzel Washington's FBI Agent Anthony 'Hub' Hubbard performance is powerful as usual the rest of the supporting cast did a good job too Annette Bening's Elise KraftSharon Bridger seems a little 'old' for the role but does an excellent job though.".

All the same cliches are usedterrorist killers our way of life is threatened make no mistakewe will hunt them down. Even people's patriotism is questioned.However being prophetic does not make it a good movie. It would have been more interesting to have had the main character be Tony Shalhoub's character an Arab who has to deal with his son's incarceration.

Even people's patriotism is questioned.However being prophetic does not make it a good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I rarely go into theatres with any sense of expectation. I tend not to let reviews affect my judgment. I do prefer thoughtful films I'm more of a drama fan than an action fan. So when I went to see The Siege I wasn't set for a great action film or lots of explosions. I had not read any reviews so I didn't know much about the film.I loathed it. Intensely. I hated it so much that I actually threw popcorn at the screen which I had never done before. I'm not kidding. The response from the people being attacked with me was enthusiastic so that gives you some indication of what the film is like if you haven't yet been subjected to it.My reaction had nothing to do with racism or lack of action which nonAmericans seem to assume is the only thing keeping the Yankees spending money on cinema. The Siege is one of the better examples of how film makers today feel it necessary to subject you to Clockwork Orange type treatment in order to make a moral intellectual or political point. I felt like the old man in Kurosawa's Ran sitting in the castle looking haggard and horrified my mind under siege.I don't mind unlikely inventive plots. But please let them be intelligent and show some respect for the viewer. I'm tired of being condescended to whenever I go to a movie so much so that I decided since I was being taken for granted I'd stop going. I haven't gone to any this year. The Siege played a part in that I'm watching foreign videos instead.The acting was bad. Why is Denzel Washington a star? He hasn't been in a decent movie in six or seven years. Willis' character was abominably written. The screenplay was vile particularly the ending and the confrontation between Washington and Willis which was insulting.If this is what the studios consider a thoughtful script maybe we should petition the government to declare martial law in Hollywood. We could put all the screenwriters in cages and sell tickets. I'd pay 7.50 for that. I'd even give it two thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Islamofascists or simply terrorists have taken their game to a whole new level striking schools and even the FBI office. This film shows a fictional version of what happens when America meddles in foreign affairs when the foreigners push back and how we would have to give up civil liberties to protect our freedoms. Or more properly why we shouldn't have to. Denzel Washington is Anthony 'Hub' Hubbard and like all his action roles he is a strong and sturdy leader. I love Washington so much. I warmed up to him after seeing Man on Fire and this goes above and beyond that as the best role I've seen him in. Annette Bening is a CIA operative and she continues her streak of starring in roles that annoy me such as the one in American President. Other than American Beauty I can do without her...Bruce Willis is Major General William Devereaux and is quite good at being both pragmatic and tyrannical as he needs to be  in the same role. We see his Die Hard persona more refined into a leadership spot  commanding others to do what McClane's commanders would have him do. It's like a promotion. Tony Shalhoub is Agent Frank Haddad and this is his best role and when does he ever disappoint?. Aasif Mandvi The Daily Show also appears as Khalil Saleh.This film works as an actiondrama. Plenty of frustrated romance and explosions as well as gunfights and tense situations where a bus might explode where is Keanu Reeves when you need him. So even if you have no interest in American history or politics you're probably going to appreciate the running and jumping and shooting.History and politics buffs will enjoy it even more. We have the history of what America did in Iraq after the Gulf War hint we let Saddam slaughter his own people. And we have a sneakpeak of what would happen if a major terrorist attack hit New York. Muslims and Arabs are rounded up and all seen as suspects liberties are brought to a minimum and there is a debate between waging a war and a police action  with war winning the debate. I think if anything this film gave America too much credit for being sympathetic to Muslims. But at least we don't have concentration camps where we store innocent Arabs unless you count Guantanamo Bay.This film flew under my radar and I had not been aware of it until some friends pointed me in the right direction. With 911 and Iraq now having happened this film gives a great overview. Along with Syriana Jarhead and Three Kings this will give a good starting point of how to view the world and America's role in it at least from a fictional point of view.".

It had a very good performance by the always dependable Denzel Washington an underrated performance by Bruce Willis and a somewhat disappointing performance perhaps because the role was underwritten by a slightly miscast Annette Bening. Who would've known that something tragic like the attacks in New York City the Pentagon and the plane crash in western Pennsylvania. Some reviewers dismissing the film thought the film's good ideas became muddled and confused in the end. Seeing what's happening in the world right now I don't think the confusion was way off. I felt before the tragedy and afterward that it was pretty accurate. The one performance that really impressed me was Tony Shalhoub as Frank Haddad the ArabAmerican police detective who's partnered with Washington's character. I hope screenwriter Lawrence Wright with Menno Meyjes and cowriterdirector Edward Zwick didn't create Haddad as an afterthought. There was some major controversy on how Arabs were portrayed in the film. Note the U.S. running time compared to some other countries. What stood out for me when I first saw the movie and still lingers is Shalhoub's character. His character seemed human. We see him at work and at home with his wife and children. We see him and his family practicing the Muslim faith. There's a pivotal moment when Haddad is trying to find his son in an internment camp. He's angry and confused and frustrated. I really felt sympathy and empathy toward his character. With all of the explosions I still feel that Shalhoub despite being what is essentially a supporting character was the truly human aspect The Siege.".

The FBI agents in New York have just thwarted an Arab terrorist bombing and they're celebrating in an uptown nightclub getting smashed and dancing. Denzel Washington FBI and Annette Bening CIA are slow dancing and a tender moment of accommodation is coming up when we hear a rumble on the sound track. The music stops. The rumble grows louder and the room begins to shiver physically. A few glasses shatter. The hanging decorations sway. But it isn't an earthquake at all. It's another terrorist bombing that has just obliterated a soiree involving New York's Who's Who.That's a pretty good directorial decision. And it's not the only one although there are no selfindulgent displays of directorial pryotechnics either.The story is straightforward. There are a couple of cells of Islamic terrorists operating out of Brooklyn. Atlantic Avenue has to be seen to be believed. A couple of increasingly disastrous bombings prompts the president to impose martial law under the war powers act ?. The general in charge of the army is an unyielding but not insensible Bruce Willis. For most of the film he stands at parade rest squints and snaps out orders. But he's not a military robot. He's wise. When he is asked at a conference if the army can be mobilized to occupy the city he points out that the army is a broad sword not a scalpel. Yes he can impose order on the streets but only at great cost. He begs he implores the committee to reconsider using the military in a role for which they were never trained.There's a lesson in the film too though I'm not sure it's the one the producers were aiming at. Most of the Moslems we see are peaceful and law abiding but they're increasingly angry at their treatment by the police and by Christians as they become victims of hate crimes. We can be thankful that the movie was mostly wrong on that point. But there are a handful of fanatics who manage to find passages in the Koran to justify their bloodshed.The point is that every charter document  the Koran the Bible the Constitution  must by its nature be vague and ambiguous enough to be interpreted differently under different circumstances. That's why they last so long. If they weren't subject to contradictory interpretations they'd go out of date pronto. Imagine if one of the Ten Commandments read The Fed Will Never Raise Interest Rates Above Six Percent. Or the Constitution simply said No private ownership of guns  period. The Koran has the same ambiguity built into it. I know Moslems who are devout who pray and read the Koran regularly who find nothing but joy and comfort in it and who hate sectarian conflict as they hate all violence. It's unjustified to think of the Koran as only sanctioning warfare against infidels. Like most charter documents it sanctions pretty much whatever you want it to.What an interesting movie. Denzel Washington no bleeding heart hears Willis discuss varying ways of extracting information from a suspected terrorist who is sitting naked in the torture room. There's beating of course and there's electric shock and sleep deprivation and then of course there's cutting but that can get messy. Washington is horrified and shouts at the General that if they use torture on their helpless prisoner they're throwing away the Constitution and the terrorists win. Interesting point. Arguable but interesting.Worth seeing. It's heartbreaking to notice the twin towers in the background of some shots. This was 1998.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody who was at Ground Zero in Manhattan or saw the horror unfolding on live television can ever forget what happened on September 11 2001. And in 2015 we saw sizable terror attacks of a decidedly different nature take place some ten thousand miles apart first in three simultaneous attacks in Paris and then on a rehabilitation center in San Bernardino California just sixty miles east of Los Angeles.But a film released slightly less than three years before the horror of 911 may have foreseen the problems we have had to face since then in dealing with terrorism both militarily and morally.

	schema:reviewBody "Where Eskimos Live caught my heart. It made me laugh and cry. It is a stunning accomplishment showing the cruelties of war bluntly and without glossing over the facts of inhumanity and destruction. It is a simple but very convincing movie centering around two very different characters and how they learn to trust and love each other in the sinister world of death child trade and deceit.Sharkey Bob Hoskins is an obscure man who travels around wartorn Bosnia in 1995. He claims to be a caseworker for UNICEF a camouflage he makes use of to get orphaned boys for a Russian mafia syndicate in Poland. He is in his fifties apparently rough and callous a loner always chasing an opportunity to make as much money as possible. Vlado Sergiusz Zymelka is a nineyearold boy orphaned by the war and now a member of a gang of preteen hoodlums who fool the military and steal food whenever they get a chance.After Sharkey's unlucky encounter with a colonel who now claims him responsible for the death of his daughter and is hard on his heels he meets Vlado's gang. Eventually the young boy follows him as Sharkey pretends coming from Norway  that is where Eskimos live and Vlado always wanted to go there. So the two of them walk off heading for the border. Of course their journey is not as smoothly as Sharkey would have preferred it to be they have to survive various dangerous adventures in the course of which they gradually grow quite close. Having dealt with the colonel and managed to leave Bosnia Sharkey and Vlado arrive in Poland. Now they have to face the Russians which means new challenges. Sharkey's cunning deceit almost proves too daring but again they manage to survive.The movie is set and shot entirely on locations in Bosnia and Poland. The setting  both time and place  is the story's backbone. Thus it is a movie dealing with two characters and how they manage to survive amidst death and havoc in a wartorn country. The cruelties of war are shown in appalling images visualized in all their crushing brutality and atrocity. Sharky and Vlado are surrounded by these images by death and despair. They encounter deserters who are shot to death at a checkpoint on the street they have to run for their lives when shells explode in their vicinity they find piles of dead corpses shot to death and terribly deformed. They are surrounded by these images and emotionally affected in a subtle but pervasive way which leads to the establishment of an emotional bond between them that would have never attained its honesty and depth if it had not been for the hostile environment that makes them rely on each other.The acting performances of the two protagonists are outstanding. Sergiusz Zymelka in particular delivers so genuine scenes that I was moved to tears occasionally. His handsome appearance his vivid and bright eyes his cleverness and his disarming charm make him shine. The scene when Sharky attempts to make a photograph of the boy for a new passport features an hilarious Vlado who makes faces and displays his childish gaiety. Apart from that I deeply appreciate his knowledge of English which is remarkably welldeveloped for a boy his age.Where Eskimos Live is a road movie it lives by individual sequences that define its quality. The scene after the shooting of the two deserters is just awesome so natural and authentic that I could almost feel the emotional scars inflicted in Sharky and Vlado. They lie down in the grass and scream  they have just escaped death and it is moving how Vlado makes Sharkey release his pentup emotions.This movie is never stereotypical or corny. It tells the story of one man who was looking for money but rather found something that was worth much more  a boy who pins all his hopes on him a boy who makes him a better person and above all a boy who loves him. The movie won various awards giving ample evidence for its essential quality. It is brutal sometimes vulgar and thus hard to digest for young children but flawless and never awkward. Honest authenticity and a wonderful fatherson relationship make this low budget production a more than worthwhile experience that shows how two characters undergo challenges and changes which strengthens their bond and deepens their love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a movie comes along that you'll just fall in love with despite having never heard of it previously. I discovered this gem of a movie when I was looking for items to add to my online DVD rental list. One viewing later and I loved it in fact for the whole time I had this DVD about ten days IIRC I think I watched it at least half a dozen times.Set in 1995 in wartorn Bosnia a man called Sharkey sets out to find a small boy to take out of the country for child trade purposes. This small boy turns out to be Vlado Petric an orphan of the conflict and with hardened survival instincts. Vlado has a heart of gold being overly protective towards a member of his gang who is regularly pushed around by the others but this kid isn't totally selfless and puts himself forward to go with Sharkey to leave Bosnia but Vlado really wants to go to Norway where the Eskimos live.The outbound trip is one fraught with peril realisation and hope. Sharkey is a man on a mission just doing his job. Vlado is just a boy and his being a boy by his actions initially irritates Sharkey but there is a bond forming between the pair. This doesn't stop them having a huge argument though. The scene where Vlado single handily saves Sharkey from being shot dead cements their bond and is one of the highlights of the movie.Bob Hoskins stars in this movie although it's always been kind of hard to take him seriously in any acting role ever after you've seen him in Super Mario Brothers in a plumber's outfit. Don't even go there. Hoskins acts very well here a good solid performance.Sergiusz Zymelka steals the entire show for me. A great little Polish child actor who's capable of handling anything that this movie can throw at him and a lot more to boot. The performance is virtually flawless from Sergiusz but then the role demands it really. Nevertheless he can act Bob Hoskins off the screen any day a feat which isn't really all that difficult IMO.In short  great movie worth watching great acting good solid drama with a spot of action and a sense of all will be right with the world one day about it.".

I discovered this gem of a movie when I was looking for items to add to my online DVD rental list. One viewing later and I loved it in fact for the whole time I had this DVD about ten days IIRC I think I watched it at least half a dozen times.Set in 1995 in wartorn Bosnia a man called Sharkey sets out to find a small boy to take out of the country for child trade purposes. This small boy turns out to be Vlado Petric an orphan of the conflict and with hardened survival instincts. Vlado has a heart of gold being overly protective towards a member of his gang who is regularly pushed around by the others but this kid isn't totally selfless and puts himself forward to go with Sharkey to leave Bosnia but Vlado really wants to go to Norway where the Eskimos live.The outbound trip is one fraught with peril realisation and hope. Sharkey is a man on a mission just doing his job. Vlado is just a boy and his being a boy by his actions initially irritates Sharkey but there is a bond forming between the pair. This doesn't stop them having a huge argument though. The scene where Vlado single handily saves Sharkey from being shot dead cements their bond and is one of the highlights of the movie.Bob Hoskins stars in this movie although it's always been kind of hard to take him seriously in any acting role ever after you've seen him in Super Mario Brothers in a plumber's outfit.

So I was pleasantly surprised watching this touching and realistic drama about recent Balkan war. Well it can be any of modern war  war it's a horrible thing wherever it happens.I don't like tell many words about the plot but because this film isn't famous it worth several lines. It's a 1995 in former Yugoslavia at the height of the war. Bob Hoskins only one AnonPolish actor in the movie played Sharkey who wants for some reason get a kid perfectly played by young polish talent Sergiusz Zymelka out of a war torn country. Everywhere is anarchy brigandage and marauding. Man's life worth simply nothing. For young orphan Vlado Sharkey it's the only chance for escaping from this nightmare. But for this they must travel hundreds miles through many obstacles. At the time of this journey we learn more about two main characters. All scenes through the agonizing country were perfectly shot and looked incredibly powerful and realistic. Also I found story didn't so forced like in some others modern war films though it also wasn't flawless here. Cinematography was almost perfect also worth to mention the very good soundtrack.Overall I found Where Eskimos Live very good for such smallbudgeted production. So if you get a chance I recommend to all people check it out.My grade 86 or A. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.".

	schema:reviewBody "WHERE ESKIMOS LIVE is one of those surprise films that appears out of nowhere without ballyhoo not apparently having been on the theatrical release circuit yet once discovered serendipitously in the video store and watched makes such an impact that its anonymity is a puzzle. Writerdirector Tomasz Wiszniewski with Robert Brutter sharing the writing credits has created a unique and brave little film that takes advantage of some unknown terrain and retains the flavor of a country in all manner of representation.The place is Bosnia during the war when entire cities were being destroyed leaving the children homeless without parents fending for themselves in any way possible. They live in squalor in famine stealing what they can to survive yet holding together as a group with some sense of hopeless dignity. Among these boys is Vlado Sergiusz Zymelka a streetsmart kid always on the lookout for his Down's Syndrome friend while seeking any way possible to escape his fate. Enter Sharkey Bob Hoskins brandishing a UNICEF passport and badge he is from Norway where Eskimos live...! trying to 'save' one small boy from the war to freedom and protection across the border. He meets all manner of opposition especially from the military Colonel Vuko Krzysztof Majchrzak who decides to let Sharkey pass on the condition that Sharkey take his sole young daughter to safety. Fate strikes the jeep with the Colonel's daughter explodes and Sharkey narrowly escapes with the Colonel in hot pursuit mistakenly thinking the landmine that destroyed the jeep was engineered by Sharkey. Sharkey encounter's Vlado's gang and eventually Vlado talks Sharkey into taking him as the 'saved' boy fully realizing that Sharkey's Unicef badge is a cover for his unlawful child marketing. The two bond slowly and in time each uses the other for their private goals and gradually they grow to need each other to survive. Their relationship is radiant and inspiring and leads them to surprising changes in their lives.The cast is extraordinary Hoskins knows how to make an evil con man grow on his viewer and Sergiusz Zymelka is a gifted young actor. The film is difficult to watch at times because the camera does not shy away from the heinous crimes and gore of war but that fact only serves to make the story more credible. The dialogue is a bit shallow and awkward at times but the message is obviously from the heart. This is a fine low budget film from a Polish director and cast that makes us take notice of unknown talents. It is a fine little film! Grady Harp".

It has the muscular hero whose hairless chest is almost constantly on display and whose favorite wardrobe items are miniminiskirts and laceup boots. The hero fights a few real beasts  a lion and a bear  as well as a mythical one a dragon. He acquires a chubby timorous sidekick who provides comic relief.

The dragonfight is taken as footage from the movie Le fatiche d'Ercole and the dancing scenes are also obviously stolen from another Italian masterpiece. You see Vadis running around in the caves of the cruel subterranean people who love to sacrifice kids in order to gain their youth and women for their beauty and beating up their soldiers a cowardly comic relief character at his side who presents a contrast to Herc's unfailing braveness. The complete second half of the movie plays in the caves and becomes a little tiresome after a while. The opening sequence of the film is perfect though...in its own way.".

The casting of Babar John Simons seems to beg the question 'What were they thinking?'I'm always intrigued when I see Hercules or one of his stand ins use the old speed dial to reach one of the Olympian gods. In this flick Argolese is about to be pulled apart by elephants when he summons the heavens for help and wouldn't you know it the chains simply break apart. I mean there wasn't even a pause to reflect on the request and build suspense.I'm sure there are better prints of the film than the one I viewed. It had some jarring jump cuts and a decidedly red hue in many scenes. It started out with a Part 1 signaling to me that perhaps it was made in a serial style format. There were even scenes of coming attractions for Part 2 however the film was spliced together in such a way that the action just continues only to show those highlight scenes once again in due course. It all seemed quite annoying.There's really no reason to see this flick and recommending it would be a disservice. My motivation rested simply in the fact that it was one of fifty movies packaged together under the 'SciFi' collection put out by Mill Creek EntertainmentTreeline Films. The only positive worth noting is the catchy little theme song  'There Be Sons of Hercules'.Hey was that a real bear or a man in a bear suit?".

The dialog follows suit although how much is this is the fault of the dubbing is hard to say. The stunts and fight scenes are staged fairly well and are the real reason to watch the film.Assuming you want to watch it at all The acting is...serviceable. No one stinks on ice or anything or looks as if they are reading from a teleprompter or cue cards. And the blocking and stage business works as well as you might expect.I assume the actor playing the comic relief has built a career doing this kind of thing. He's not funny at all at least not that way he's dubbed but he's mildly likable at least. There's no way a movie like this could go without comic relief so they might as well use this guy. Doesn't mean I have to like it or him. In short this is another Hercules or Argoles movie. If that's how you want to fill your leisure viewing well here ya go. For what it's worth it's not the worst one in the genre that would be The Loves Of Hercules with a wildly miscast Mickey Hargetay but not even as good as Hercules vs the Moon Men..".

The film was dubbed and reedited before release in the States as THE SONS OF HERCULES IN THE LAND OF DARKNESS. A strongman goes on a perilous quest when an evil queen takes over the kingdom. There are fights with lions bears and dragons alongside battles with mounted soldiers. Expect rivers of lava collapsing kingdoms falling bridges and the usual barbending.

But for its U.S. release it went straight to TV as a twoparter renamed The Sons of Hercules The Land of Darkness. It even has an opening theme sung in English which leads me to believe it was packaged as a weekly series with this one comprising two episodes.So our welloiled beloinclothed muscleman is not Hercules but his son Argolese Dan Vadis perhaps a distant relative of Quo. He's a chip off the old block when it comes to being superstrong and kicking some ass though I have to wonder where his blond hair and beard came from. Hercules himself was a brunette. The film begins with Argolese fighting a lion who attacks Princess Telca daughter of King Tedaeo. His Majesty is so grateful that he offers Telca's hand in marriage but only if Argolese completes one more task slaying the dragon that terrorizes his kingdom. With the help of a magic spear from the local sorceress Argolese kills the dragon in a surprisingly brief scene. He returns to the village to find that it was raided and its people taken as slaves. Argolese sets off on a rescue mission that sees him fighting a bear looking way too much like a skinny guy in a motheaten costume chained to two elephants in an ordeal designed to tear his arms off and finally immersing the Land of Darkness a city inside a mountain in molten lava after he frees the prisoners and whisks them off to safety.I'd like to see the Italian print as the U.S. version is chopped all to hell. Certain scenes felt like they should have gone on longer and they very well might have in the theatrical release. Guess I'll never know.Far too many of these swordandsandal films bore me but this one held my attention for its full 80 minutes. LAND OF DARKNESS is on the low end of the Hercules spectrum which was low to begin with but it has a rudimentary interest factor working in its favor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since there were more Peplum extravaganzas than the U.S. market could absorb television got into the act with a syndicated series called The Sons of Hercules which were 14 Italian Peplum not released theatrically in the U.S. that were redubbed as a loose series of 28 episodes with a catchy theme. Hercules the Invincible Italian title Ercole l'invincibile became Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness starring big Dan Vadis as the hero renamed Argoles who was supposed to be one of the sons of Hercules. This is the only version I've seen so I can't really comment on the Italian original but based on the material as presented I can't imagine it was any good. This is one of the worst in the Hercules series even though it packs in plenty of action. Unfortunately it is almost all uninspired unimaginative and very cheaplooking with lots of running about and lots of dead spots. This has one of the worst fights with a lion in any Peplum film  director Alvaro Manori either didn't know how it was done or didn't care to make it look vaguely realistic or threatening. None of the considerable number of action sequences build any suspense nor are they staged and filmed in a way that offers any tension or excitement. Even the obligatory dance number is anemic consisting mostly of women rolling around on the floor. The look of the film and the set designs are equally as unimpressive.The one thing this has going for it is large number of featsof strength opportunities for our hero whatever you want to call him and Vadis makes the most them with the camera ogling and caressing his muscles. The biggest problem for Vadis is that he's sporting an extremely unflattering beard. This was his first of two times as Hercules. Perhaps someone thought that the best Hercules's  Steve Reeves and Reg Park  have beards so Vadis should too. It was a colossal mistake in judgment. Despite the scruffy rug on his face Vadis cuts an imposing figure as the legendary strongman. There's only one other moderately intriguing character in the whole movie Maria Fiore as a conniving courtesan so desperate to become queen of the land Hercules invades that once she achieves her goal she barely notices her kingdom falling down around her. But that's not enough to save this belowpar entry in a genre that was rapidly becoming played out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea of the film seems to be inspired in Max Ophuls' La Ronde that classic French film that showed how much life is inter connected which in itself was based on Arthur Schnitzler's play. The theme has been explored in other films and it probably was what the director of Sexual Life Ken Kwapis wanted to explore.Each person we watch from the beginning has something to do with someone else and so on. Sex is what seems to hold these people together. We start with the high priced prostitute and end up with her. In between we get to see how a group of young Los Angeles residents having sexual encounters that are the basis of their coming into each other's orbits. Sex seems to be not a big deal with them and nothing is forever as we watch them going in their own ways to a new relationship without any guilt at all.The cast assembled do a pretty good job in their different portrayals. Azira Skye as the prostitute has some good moments. Kevin Corrigan Anne Heche Shirley Knight Fionnula Flanagan Kerry Washington Tom Everett Scott James Legros and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks do excellent work under the guidance of Mr. Kwapis.Sexual Life has a great contemporary look. While sex seems to be what consumes all the parties in the movie it makes for a good excuse to watch some of the best young actors working in movies today having fun.".

At times the links loop around to reveal connection even the character are unaware of.It reminded me of the STD warnings that when you have sex with a person you are also having sex with every one of THEIR partners.With any ensemble caste movie the acting isn't equal but there really is no bad acting in this film. I thought Anne Heche really stood out and her performance makes this a must see for Heche fans like me.If I was a TV director I'd take this idea and turn it into a miniseries. Each one of the subplots could have been given given its own 73minute treatment and explored a few of the loose ends that could not be developed in 96 minutes.".

Like Closer the characters flirt dally and feel the sting of regret as they explore the edges of their sexual confines. Throughout the film characters step outside the roles to which their lives confine them. Highclass prostitute Azura Skye abruptly quits the job in search of a new life. The vice mayor's son Jerry Dule Hill expresses his frustration at always being the good son. The wedding photographer Tom Scott wants to quit paying for sex and find a permanent real relationship. They are lives of longing broken by moments of intense heat. The characters are welldrawn. But like Closer the view ultimately finds it hard to empathize with them. Like the aftermath of sex without live the movie leaves an empty feeling.".

SEXUAL LIFE explores several couples whose married or about to be married status receives the testing of infidelity.A wedding photographer is frustrated with his executive girlfriend's lack of intimacy and seeks physical satisfaction through an upscale prostitute who has her own rather solid ground views of her business. The photographer's girlfriend is finding physical satisfaction with her married architect boss who in turn is trying to hide his infidelity from his wife who in turn feels she must seek outside satisfaction with an old college flame who happens to be gay and she turns to a hotel clerk at the point of a fantasy liaison for gratification. The hotel clerk happens to be having an affair with an engaged African American girl and is frustrated about her impending marriage to a frustratedly 'correct' African American male who feels he is following a proscribed duty and seeks attention from the prostitute who opens the whole story. How these intersecting couples work out their dilemmas and resolve their individual needs for expanded physical needs in the presence of the safety of relationships is the clever puzzle Kwapis presents  with the conclusions primarily left up to us the viewers.The cast is homogeneously fine and attractive  Eion Bailey Elizabeth Banks Fionnula Flanagan Anne Heche Dule Hill Sam Jaeger Kerry Washington Steven Weber Steven Williams Shirley Knight James LeGros Tom Everett Scott and Azura Skye along with the minor characters. Kwapis keeps the flow integrated so that the story does indeed seem like a series of coincidences. The sexual scenes are more suggested than graphic and should not offend even the most skeptical viewer. This was after all a movie made for Showtime TV but it stands very well as a tightly conceived and acted lesson about relationships. Well worth watching. Grady Harp".

The couples range from a call girl and her client to a married couple to a betrothed couple etc. all obviously carefully planned to provide a range of possibilities for both auteur and audience.

The film was definitely overedited.With 9 characters one would hope that a film entitled Sexual Life might explore something more than boyongirl sexual relationships. Yawn! There is one gay character but he is on screen for 3 minutes sharing a dinner with Anne Heche's character.Azura Skye shows promise here. She should have received top billing.".

Sexual Life certainly has ambition but the ambition never gets out of the gate. The narratives remain superficial the acting is not of a high caliber. The film was definitely overedited.With 9 characters one would hope that a film entitled Sexual Life might explore something more than boyongirl sexual relationships. Yawn! There is one gay character but he is on screen for 3 minutes sharing a dinner with Anne Heche's character.Azura Skye shows promise here. She should have received top billing.";

The lavish praises that it sometimes receives have perhaps created unrealistic expectations which is unfortunate because it is a fine though understated classic.Jean and Juliette the two main characters both have strengths and weaknesses that make them believable. Jean is responsible and disciplined while Juliette is easygoing and gregarious which makes her the easiest of the two to appreciate and to sympathize with. But Jean's rigidity and his occasional impatience in combination with Juliette's naivet and her occasional impulsiveness make for difficulties in their relationship.If they seem boring when compared to the couples in many other movie romances it is precisely this that makes the film worthwhile. It focuses closely on two ordinary people without distracting frills or forced social commentary. Most of us are not all that interesting to others and our lives and problems are usually important only to us. It is part of Jean Vigo's achievement that he takes two such commonplace characters and makes them worth caring about and by implication he tells us that we are all worth caring about even if we and our lives may not matter much to others.By keeping most of the action on board the boat Vigo not only creates an atmosphere but also forces the attention onto the characters. Simon's rather exaggerated character is used both to vary the pacing when appropriate and to respond to the traits and actions of Jean and Juliette. The photography and the score are also used to round out the picture.It may be true that the film is sometimes overpraised but in large part that is simply an overreaction to the unfortunate lack of attention that this kind of classic must so often endure. In an era when so many very weak recent movies have received regular television airings special edition DVD's with all kinds of pointless extras and undeserved critical acclaim it's all too obvious that movies requiring more effort to appreciate are too often ignored entirely.Many recent romance movies have tried to use lavish production values disaster or crisis settings trendy techniques such as nonlinear storytelling and other such devices to cover up a lack of substance. Movies as different as Titanic and The English Patient just to name two of many possible examples use such methods in an attempt to pass off a romantic couple as heroic or admirable when the characters in actuality are usually selfabsorbed vapid and truly less worth caring about than Vigo's Jean and Juliette are.Jean and Juliette like most of us know that they are not important in the grand scheme of things and they are probably rather well aware of their own weaknesses. They are neither saints nor sinners neither victims nor heroes they are just human and therefore worth caring about.

	schema:reviewBody "'L'Atalante' is such a lovely film from director Jean Vigo a man whose career would have been marvelous to behold had he not died so young.  This was his last film and there are stories that he directed many of the scenes while deathly ill.  This movie is a genuine masterpiece and is a mustsee for anyone who truly loves the art of film.  'L'Atalante' is one of the pioneering gems of cinema.It is a simple story about the first few days of marriage aboard a barge traveling the canals of France.  Dita Parlo plays Juliette a haunting beauty and a dreamer who longs for adventure and excitement.  Her husband Jean is a realist who doesn't mind the rugged life aboard his ship.  She tries to domesticate her husband showing him the wonders of laundry and neatness.  He is so used to the bachelor life that he doesn't even see the need to change the sheets when one of the many cats on board has kittens in their bed.Juliette struggles with her new life and longs to visit Paris so she can explore and shop and dance and eat.  She wants a more elegant and romantic life.  Barge life gets more complicated due to the oafish first mate Jules who lurches around in a perpetual stupor and acts obnoxiously at the drop of a hat all the while being rather charming and interesting.When the barge finally reaches Paris the couple plans a trip to shore.  But the plan gets waylaid by Jules who isn't around to guard the boat during their absence.  After a confrontation Juliette leaves to explore her Parisian dream without Jean.  And when Jules finally returns Jean decides to abandon his wife and sets a course down the river.A plot summary doesn't really do the film justice.  Vigo employs gorgeously original camera angles and a poetic method of storytelling that makes this film impossible to forget.  It has racy and subtle humor.  It deals with sexuality unlike any other film of the era.  It has a fantasy sequence whose power has rarely been rivaled even in today's special effects bonanza. 'L'Atalante' is way ahead of its time.  Watching this film is like peering through a time portal to the beginning of modern filmmaking.  'Citizen Kane' is often cited as the most influential film ever made... but 'L'Atalante' was 'Citizen Kane' before 'Citizen Kane'.  It is no wonder that it still appears on many lists of the greatest of all time.I find it amazing that the film shot 70 years ago in soft light and occasionally blurred focus still manages to evoke truly powerful emotions and tangible sensations.  Vigo's shots are cold foggy cramped dirty awkward and hard.  But he slips a few truly sublime poetic moments in there to lift our hearts.  When Jean regrets his decision to abandon Juliette he jumps into the river.  The underwater sequence is an ethereal and magical moment in cinema.  Their resulting journeys back to one another is romantic and altogether truthful.  The film encapsulates the awkward and difficult early days of marriage and the journey to the days beyond where 'real' love starts to grow.".

	schema:reviewBody "L'Atalante is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made. This judgement clearly baffles many people. Having just viewed the fullyrestored 1991 version on DVD I confess to being one of them.The print now looks great with good detail and only the occasional scratch so we can finally appreciate the exquisite cinematography. Scenes that were trimmed or deleted by distributors and censors have now been restored along with the original music track. Apparently this version is as close to Vigo's original cut as will ever be possible.This statement needs qualification. Vigo fell ill shortly after shooting and L'Atalante was cut by an editor with only minimal involvement by him. Moreover it is still only a rough cut. It was originally planned to do some further tightening.L'Atalante undoubtedly has its merits. Vigo used the trite story as a framework from which to hang a number of notably good scenes which often veer off in unexpected directions. It has a loose lyrical quality that evokes poetry rather than prose.Unusually for early Sound movies much of it was shot on location but I am not sure how much. The interiors look cramped enough to have been shot on an actual barge and this would account for the tight closeups awkward camera angles and strange compositions in one scene both protagonists go briefly out of shot leaving an empty screen but there are also indications that these scenes were shot on studio sets e.g. the shot from inside Jules's cupboard.In both subject and treatment L'Atalante looks and feels quite different to other films of its time and its quirkiness can be a refreshing change from the predictability of most other movies. However much of that quirkiness is simply incompetence. Vigo had a great visual sense and the movie often looks ravishing but in most other respects his grasp of movie technique was still somewhat weak.Cinematically he was still rooted in the Silent era. Dialogue is little more than background sound and rarely adds much to the visuals. Most of it was improvised by the actors never a good idea. The soporific pacing that alienates many modern viewers was simply the characteristic pacing of Silent films.At the micro level the cutting is often very amateurish. Vigo doesn't know when to enter or leave scenes. Shots are assembled out of sequence so that visual information is only given after it is needed. Sometimes it is not given at all for example we only know about the nearcollision with another barge through the dialogue not the visuals. Individual shots don't cut together properly e.g. the sequence of Juliette discovering that the barge has gone. Often we simply don't know where we are until halfway through a scene. We cut to Juliette in Jules's Aladdin's cave of a cabin without any preparation she has shown no curiosity about how he lives and don't even know where we are until he turns up to tell us.Individually these examples could be dismissed as mere quibbles but they occur in almost every scene.At a macro level the movie has a weak dramatic structure it alternately gallops and crawls.

The evolving relationship between Jean and Juliette and her growing frustration with life on the barge is actually quite poorly documented. Jean's decision to abandon Juliette in Paris is undermotivated. We see almost nothing of how she survives there. We see Jean's distracted manner after her loss but not the neglect of duty that alarms the barge owners and puts the crew's livelihood at risk. The recovery of Juliette is simply miraculous. One second Jules is in Le Havre the next he wandering aimlessly around Paris. He hears music coming from a record shop and  Hey Presto!At the end the characters are nearly as opaque as at the beginning.For all the excellence of the cinematography and the originality of individual scenes Vigo's 'let's make it up as we go' approach means that L'Atalante is little more than a glorified home movie. It is so choppy that it feels like he shot a threehour movie and lost half the reels so he had to do the best he could with what was left.In the Thirties L'Atalante sank without trace but it was rediscovered after the War by the French directors of the 'New Wave'. They were becoming increasingly frustrated with the stodgy movies of their time and soon found ways to slash through the plodding storytelling conventions of established moviemakers. I can understand why they saw Vigo as a pioneer and came to laud L'Atalante as a precursor of everything they were trying to do.Nonetheless you have to master the rules before you can throw away the rule book. In 1933 Vigo was still learning how to make movies. If he had been able to supervise the editing of L'Atalante it might have been a somewhat more accomplished picture but then again it might not. Zero de Conduite suggests he was still on a steep learning curve.Vigo had a unique sensibility and was a singular voice in the cinema. If he had lived long enough to make a few more pictures he might well have given us a really good movie. Then even his most delirious advocates might see L'Atalante for what I believe it to be not a fullyachieved work in its own right but a fascinating still very flawed practice piece.".

	onyx:emotionText "L'Atalante is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made. This judgement clearly baffles many people. Having just viewed the fullyrestored 1991 version on DVD I confess to being one of them.The print now looks great with good detail and only the occasional scratch so we can finally appreciate the exquisite cinematography. Scenes that were trimmed or deleted by distributors and censors have now been restored along with the original music track. Apparently this version is as close to Vigo's original cut as will ever be possible.This statement needs qualification. Vigo fell ill shortly after shooting and L'Atalante was cut by an editor with only minimal involvement by him. Moreover it is still only a rough cut. It was originally planned to do some further tightening.L'Atalante undoubtedly has its merits. Vigo used the trite story as a framework from which to hang a number of notably good scenes which often veer off in unexpected directions. It has a loose lyrical quality that evokes poetry rather than prose.Unusually for early Sound movies much of it was shot on location but I am not sure how much. The interiors look cramped enough to have been shot on an actual barge and this would account for the tight closeups awkward camera angles and strange compositions in one scene both protagonists go briefly out of shot leaving an empty screen but there are also indications that these scenes were shot on studio sets e.g. the shot from inside Jules's cupboard.In both subject and treatment L'Atalante looks and feels quite different to other films of its time and its quirkiness can be a refreshing change from the predictability of most other movies. However much of that quirkiness is simply incompetence. Vigo had a great visual sense and the movie often looks ravishing but in most other respects his grasp of movie technique was still somewhat weak.Cinematically he was still rooted in the Silent era. Dialogue is little more than background sound and rarely adds much to the visuals. Most of it was improvised by the actors never a good idea. The soporific pacing that alienates many modern viewers was simply the characteristic pacing of Silent films.At the micro level the cutting is often very amateurish. Vigo doesn't know when to enter or leave scenes. Shots are assembled out of sequence so that visual information is only given after it is needed. Sometimes it is not given at all for example we only know about the nearcollision with another barge through the dialogue not the visuals. Individual shots don't cut together properly e.g. the sequence of Juliette discovering that the barge has gone. Often we simply don't know where we are until halfway through a scene.

L'Atalante is simply a beautiful film to look at. It has so many beautifully filmed sequences and images some favourites the grammophone music scene the street seller's scene the swimming underwater scene the drunk scene.

	schema:headline " the most sublime triumph of French cinema I've seen yet pre NewWave";
	schema:reviewBody "Not to discount the many great French filmmakers that were already around and thriving long before Cashiers du Cinema took over and turned moviemaking on its head but even with the great works of Renoir Melville or Cocteau Jean Vigo's only theatrical film L'Atalante struck me immensely for being such a luminous constantly humorous everlasting tale of finding the right kind of connection. There's all those details that end up building up in much of the early part of the picture and it's all practically all predicated on behavior and how the warm company of others can sometimes also have the flipside of the cold shoulder. But is it really a sudden turn of distaste for someone or just insecurity at not being good enough? The relationship between Juliette and Jean is one of the most moving of all screen romances because it keeps everything on a level anyone can cling to or recognize at the least. Vigo understands not just what beauty can come out of seeing two people who suddenly really find themselves what they mean for each other against the most minute moments that add up but how there's so much life and passion for life around them it's hard to resist the basic impulses. It's a very mature film about the childish impulses in men and women.Yet seeing the genre classified as dramaromance is not really correct it's not one of those easy films to classify anyway. For a film that is touted as a masterpiece of a simple romantic entanglement on first glance it could seem to be more serious than it really is. If anything Vigo achieves a sublime level of comedy here and true 'human' comedy and touches of the absurd in hopelessness balancing the dramatic parts. Take when Jean in the midst of his 'what have I done' frame of mind after he abandons Juliette in Paris when she decides to go off on her own for a night of fun when Jean refuses tempted by a clownish peddler takes a leap into the river and swims around himself submerged as thoughts fly by with Juliette at one point superimposed to his left. Part of this of course is perfectly poetic illustrating without words and not needing to what a mistake can do to a man's psyche not ready to take things on properly. But it's also sort of funny seeing him swimming down there not feeling a need to come up even if it's questionable whether he'd really kill himself. It's one of the great lovesick scenes ever.But by then L'Atalante has kicked into something exactly 'happening' and there's no need for suspense because we'll know what will happen at the end. That's not important part anyway here it's to see how how one scene will go into another or how one shot will suddenly transition into something else character. In fact for the first part of the picture we're given just the simplicity life on the L'Atalante ship where we start to see the tension between husband and wife due partly to Jules a scraggly old man who is sloppy and a little degenerate but also loves his many many cats and cute kittens and just wants some good music to listen to and how she sort of wastes her time there from time to time. There's a great feeling that comes out too in seeing how both old man and young wife are sort of similar in their moments of escapism except that Jules has more of a longlived and much traveled spirit too while Juliette is like a wideeyed kid in a candystore who can't do too much on such a small ship and certainly not with the not unemotional but somewhat estranged husband Jean. I loved the bits between the two of them as well where there's a moment of peace and happiness like when Jean finally takes Juliette out to see a song  dance number at the hall but also the contrasted tension. And when the peddlersinger does tempt Juliette with the ideas of Paris and dances with her just the look on Jean's face is priceless.So in the meantime that Vigo gets such rich daringly but incredibly captivating moments of the light and mundane on the ship radio channel change fun on top deck the accordion to the record not playing the drunk Jules the flowers meant for the newlyweds that go overboard he matches up this to his cast with his style. Michel Simon already exceptional in Boudu Saves From Drowning is just a pure delight as Jules a fool's fool but not an idiot by any means a performance that is layered even in the broadest strokes.

	onyx:emotionText "Not to discount the many great French filmmakers that were already around and thriving long before Cashiers du Cinema took over and turned moviemaking on its head but even with the great works of Renoir Melville or Cocteau Jean Vigo's only theatrical film L'Atalante struck me immensely for being such a luminous constantly humorous everlasting tale of finding the right kind of connection. There's all those details that end up building up in much of the early part of the picture and it's all practically all predicated on behavior and how the warm company of others can sometimes also have the flipside of the cold shoulder. But is it really a sudden turn of distaste for someone or just insecurity at not being good enough? The relationship between Juliette and Jean is one of the most moving of all screen romances because it keeps everything on a level anyone can cling to or recognize at the least. Vigo understands not just what beauty can come out of seeing two people who suddenly really find themselves what they mean for each other against the most minute moments that add up but how there's so much life and passion for life around them it's hard to resist the basic impulses. It's a very mature film about the childish impulses in men and women.Yet seeing the genre classified as dramaromance is not really correct it's not one of those easy films to classify anyway. For a film that is touted as a masterpiece of a simple romantic entanglement on first glance it could seem to be more serious than it really is. If anything Vigo achieves a sublime level of comedy here and true 'human' comedy and touches of the absurd in hopelessness balancing the dramatic parts. Take when Jean in the midst of his 'what have I done' frame of mind after he abandons Juliette in Paris when she decides to go off on her own for a night of fun when Jean refuses tempted by a clownish peddler takes a leap into the river and swims around himself submerged as thoughts fly by with Juliette at one point superimposed to his left. Part of this of course is perfectly poetic illustrating without words and not needing to what a mistake can do to a man's psyche not ready to take things on properly. But it's also sort of funny seeing him swimming down there not feeling a need to come up even if it's questionable whether he'd really kill himself. It's one of the great lovesick scenes ever.But by then L'Atalante has kicked into something exactly 'happening' and there's no need for suspense because we'll know what will happen at the end. That's not important part anyway here it's to see how how one scene will go into another or how one shot will suddenly transition into something else character. In fact for the first part of the picture we're given just the simplicity life on the L'Atalante ship where we start to see the tension between husband and wife due partly to Jules a scraggly old man who is sloppy and a little degenerate but also loves his many many cats and cute kittens and just wants some good music to listen to and how she sort of wastes her time there from time to time. There's a great feeling that comes out too in seeing how both old man and young wife are sort of similar in their moments of escapism except that Jules has more of a longlived and much traveled spirit too while Juliette is like a wideeyed kid in a candystore who can't do too much on such a small ship and certainly not with the not unemotional but somewhat estranged husband Jean. I loved the bits between the two of them as well where there's a moment of peace and happiness like when Jean finally takes Juliette out to see a song  dance number at the hall but also the contrasted tension. And when the peddlersinger does tempt Juliette with the ideas of Paris and dances with her just the look on Jean's face is priceless.So in the meantime that Vigo gets such rich daringly but incredibly captivating moments of the light and mundane on the ship radio channel change fun on top deck the accordion to the record not playing the drunk Jules the flowers meant for the newlyweds that go overboard he matches up this to his cast with his style. Michel Simon already exceptional in Boudu Saves From Drowning is just a pure delight as Jules a fool's fool but not an idiot by any means a performance that is layered even in the broadest strokes. The couple played by Daste and Parlo are also really well cast as Daste is believable as the professional skipper but even more so at being completely frustrated then dazed as hell at his lack of attention to his wife Parlo is understandably the honey of seemingly every man's eye in Paris and she too walks a fine line of believable malcontent and happiness.

	schema:reviewBody "What a legacy!There's a very fine recent film named Young Adam. Its extremely well done and it matters. Few people saw it I think. Its very much like this indeed has some of the very shots. Its set on a barge and concerns the emotional wondering of a couple and their first mate. But it is unlike this in that it not only has a story that story is rich. The narrative is deep and you grab onto it and cannot let go. There is a mystery the floating flowers in this film are translated to the floating body of a nearperfect woman in Adam.If you see that first you'll be doubly struck by this. Its similarly perfect. But there is no story whatever. People just are. Instead of relying on narrative it relies on the absence of narrative to communicate that this is not a fabrication but real life. It isn't of course but it seems more real more discovered because there is no show no apparent reason for us to intrude.A new bride joins her husband on board. He's controlling and easily made jealous. Also on board is a crufty old character and his teen son. The son doesn't matter. But the old guy is quite a character possessing a simple wisdom many memories and tokens of adventures and a sort of wild abandon that has him perform crazily when given a chance. He seems to do all the work. Oh he's ugly.We keep waiting for there to be a relationship between the two and one does develop but as far from sexual as possible. Instead what happens is that she has some adventures herself. The amazing thing is that we do not know what they are. An ordinary film would give us details and then punishment or the French equivalent. But here essentially nothing. Excepting the screwy last few seconds I believe this to be so perfect I am putting it down as my entry of the best film of 1934. The phrasing of the camera movement that's what to look for.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I am writing this review in 2014 this movie celebrates its 80th anniversary. Some years ago it was considered the greatest movie ever. It's a pretty good movie indeed but claiming it as the best ever is a perfect nonsense. As the movie is celebrating its 80th anniversary the critics seem to be a little more reasonable considering it now the 12th greatest movie ever. Claiming it as the 12th greatest ever is a nonsense too but better that than claiming it as the greatest of all.That said this is a movie with significant historical and sentimental value. It was the first and last fulllength film directed by the promising young director Jean Vigo who was taken away from us too soon. Jean Vigo only directed two documentary movies  propos de Nice and Taris roi de l'eau and one controversial featurette Zro de conduite. L'Atalante would be his first and only fulllength motion picture. He always had a fragile health but his illness worsened considerably when he directed L'Atalante and that finished him off. Although he knew he was going to die soon he still wanted to make the movie until the end. You can say that he gave his life to make this movie. Despite his short movie career he left his mark and later influenced french directors such as Franois Truffaut and the French New Wave.L'Atalante was also released under the interesting alternative title Le chaland qui passe. It's as simple and basic as a movie can be. Even though it takes place mostly inside a crude river barge it also has nice sights of some french village in the beginning and later some lovely sights of the gorgeous city of Paris. And a good thing they did that because if the whole thing was inside an ugly cargo ship it would have been boring.Generally speaking the characters are nothing too special despite the good performances by the respective actors.Jean Dast is Jean whom I have a divisive opinion about. On one hand he is quite funny at times but on the other hand he shows he is impulsive and bossy. To be honest sometimes he really is a douche especially towards the cats and his wife.Dita Parlo is Juliette Jean's wife. She isn't particularly charming and not really hot in nature but she is usually a decent woman and finelooking rather than a fatal attraction.Michel Simon is Pre Jules an eccentric old sailorman. While his moral nature is questionable well you wouldn't expect anything but lack of politeness from a sailorman he is a fun and entertaining character. Louis Lefebvre is the cabin boy with a bizarre voice. Not much of a character although there are some funny scenes with him.Gilles Margaritis is the street peddler. He is the funniest character of the film. I know that he wasn't supposed to have much of a role but still it's a shame that his role wasn't bigger. Plus in a way I think that Juliette should have ended up with him instead of going back to Jean.The soundtrack is nice especially the Main Theme and the music that is played in the nightclub where Jean and Juliette meet the street peddler.The french of this movie can be really difficult to understand. Extraattention is required to understand it as much as possible because the language is often spoken very quickly. That characteristic is particularly notorious on Michel Simon although part of the reason could be his nationality he was swiss and the swiss french has its peculiarities.In theory that is not so bad if you've got subtitles but if you don't... on the other hand even with subtitles for people who want to understand feel and learn the french it can be quite hard to understand the thunderpaced french in this movie.Title in Portugal 'O Atalante'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Captain of a barge with the titled name marries a young provincial girl and travels the waterways of France. Times are rough and life is not what she expected and after a rough patch she runs off. Eventually the pair are reunited to presumably live happily ever after.First feature and final film by Jean Vigo who died not long after the films release. Its hailed as one of the great films of all time in various polls and I for one am left to ponder why. Certainly I have my beef with any number of the classics of cinema but more times than not I can walk away from the film and at least understand why someone would argue that say Citizen Kane is great film even if I don't feel that way. Here I'm completely at a loss to explain why it's a great film. I suppose its all due to how someone connects or doesn't connect with the romance. I never really connected since I never saw what either person saw in the other. Okay yes I'm coming from a different time and place and how I look at romance and even relationships that become marriage is different but beyond that I saw nothing. For me there was too much to take on faith.This isn't to say that L'atalante is a bad film it's not actually it's a good one its just not a great one. If there is anything that is great about the film it's the photography. Shot on location on the barrage and the environs around it this film shows beautifully a time and a place. I love how the film looks and how it makes you feel how that you are there.Is this worth seeing? Yes. I don't think it's a bad film and if you strip away the useless and uncalled for baggage of this being one of the greatest films of all time its an enjoyable one. See it for itself and you'll have a good time bringing anything else to the table will only serve to disappoint you.".

	onyx:emotionText "Captain of a barge with the titled name marries a young provincial girl and travels the waterways of France. Times are rough and life is not what she expected and after a rough patch she runs off. Eventually the pair are reunited to presumably live happily ever after.First feature and final film by Jean Vigo who died not long after the films release. Its hailed as one of the great films of all time in various polls and I for one am left to ponder why. Certainly I have my beef with any number of the classics of cinema but more times than not I can walk away from the film and at least understand why someone would argue that say Citizen Kane is great film even if I don't feel that way. Here I'm completely at a loss to explain why it's a great film. I suppose its all due to how someone connects or doesn't connect with the romance. I never really connected since I never saw what either person saw in the other. Okay yes I'm coming from a different time and place and how I look at romance and even relationships that become marriage is different but beyond that I saw nothing.

I stayed until the bitter end feeling sure that it had to get better. It didn't. This is the most disappointing film I've ever seen with its murky photography unlikable characters and excruciatingly slow pace. The moral seems to be that women should stay with their husbands no matter how they are treated because it's a big scary world out there. Did that advice make sense in the 30s? I hope not. It certainly makes no sense now.For a wonderful film with a similar theme see Sunrise 1927. That film is truly perfect.".

At the beginning we see that a young woman from a small town somewhere along the Seine River has married a barge captain. We have no idea why and the commentary suggests that she does not know him well.Once aboard his barge she dreams of seeing Paris. When they get there she meets a shoddy salesman who tells her of Paris and invites her to join him. That night she leaves the barge in search of him. She doesn't find him and ends up wandering the poor sections of the city.Meanwhile back at the barge her husband becomes almost catatonic so much does he miss her. His first mate a drunkard played by the great French actor Michel Simon goes in search of her and finds her. He brings her back to the barge and the last thing we see is the young couple in an embrace.A simple story. For me in fact too simple for a talkie.Michel Simon who is one of my favorite actors creates a very aggravating character here Jules an obnoxious drunk. The young male and female leads have no chemistry or appeal no development or interest. The scenes of Paris and the Seine did nothing for me.I was happy when the movie was over.If you are a silent movie aficionado you might enjoy this especially with the sound turned off.

Despite its age this is one of the prettiest looking black and white filmswith creative use of gauze lenses excellent scenic view and a real light touch throughout. However while looking VERY advanced for its time the sound was a serious problem in the restored version I recently saw on DVD. Many times throughout the film the movie looks like a silent movie with sounds hastily tacked on later. This may be due to the director's untimely death as this film was apparently viciously hacked to pieces and reedited without much flair or care. I just assume that the director must be turning in his grave at the lousy sound quality. As far as the story goes there are many magical moments BUT also quite a few flat moments. Although many consider this a real treasure I just wasn't impressed by the overall package enough to give it a higher rating.My less than enthusiastic review is NOT related to any dislike of old films on my part as I love cinema of the 1920s 30s and 40s. In addition I love older French filmsespecially those of Marcel Pagnol as well as several of Michel Simon's films he was the star of this movie. So my less than stellar review isn't due to some bias against the genre.".

Basically the L'Atalante is a canal barge and the captain Jean Jean Dast has married Juliette Dita Parlo despite not meeting much and after a march they start their trip together. They are travelling between Le Havre and Paris on the barge with a cargo delivery while on honeymoon and there are tensions between the hardly used crew members. But the bigger conflict with tempers flaring and things smashed comes when Jean is jealous of Juliette having an affair with first mate and obsessive cat lover Pre Jules Michel Simon. Another argument and scuffle comes while in Paris and a Peddler Gilles Margaritis who wants to run off with Jean's wife but having become tired of barge life she runs off anyway. Jean starts suffering nearcatatonic depression having furiously left Juliette behind after casting off and he tries a few things to try and get over it but they do not work. Juliette meanwhile has found nothing but despair and crime since going onto the mainland and it is only after Jean tries to kill himself jumping into the river that they are both reunited and in the end they are happy once again together. I will be absolutely honest and say that this explanation for what happens in the film is not something I would have recalled myself. Also starring Louis Lefebvre as Cabin Boy Fanny Clar as Juliette's Mother Raphal Diligent as Raspoutine Juliette's Father and Ren Blech as Best Man. I did not understand everything that was going on to be honest but the relationship between the main characters was good the realistic documentary style material for life on the barge is alright and I can see that it did start influence the French New Wave of cinema from what I did understand it is a most watchable romantic drama.

I'd rather watch Christopher Columbus The Discovery over The Conquest of Paradise any time. It's a swashbuckling highadventure movie with plenty of panache. Perhaps that wasn't what many expected from a Columbus movie but it works for me. One previous reviewer said it seemed like something Erol Flynn would have starred in. I agree. I first approached this flick as an entertaining talltale in the tradition of classic adventurepirate films and greatly enjoyed The Discovery.".

And the cast! It's so cool to see the great Brando pass the proverbial torch to next generation actors Benecio Del Toro and Catherine ZetaJones. Rachel Ward is excellent as Queen Isabella and Robert Davi is superb. People expected to get a serious drama about Columbus but what they got was much more fun and for this people complain? The shots are beautiful filmed on the open seas and the adventure is nonstop. I watched it again this this Columbus Day what a treat!".

That's the way Georges Corraface plays it and it's okay. Not great but okay. Marlon Brando totally mailed it in as he was wont to do in his later years. Tom Selleck is a wonderful actor but he really couldn't pull it off in this one. Rachel Ward was much more believable as Queen Isabella regal with more than a little bit of religious fanaticism. She also played it with minimal makeup looking very fortyish something many actresses of her stature and beauty would have refused. Catherine ZetaJones and Benicio del Toro put in decent showings given the limitations of the material. The scriptwriters were probably in a bit of a quandary since the occasion 500th anniversary called for a hagiography but on the other hand political correctness makes Colon out to be a villain. They tried to split the difference and it didn't work. But overall this film is not as bad as some make it out to be. Oh and mention must be made of the beauty of Tailinh Forest Flower as the Indian chieftain's daughter. Wow!".

This flick is simply put one of the best arguments for why you should not base viewing choices upon the cast alone. There are amazing actors in this and they are utterly wasted. And several performances in this are unforgivably hammy. The special effects are painfully unconvincing. I wish I was kidding when I say that there is amateur theater with less obvious FX. Did I miss something? This was made in 1992! Did they misplace the budget? For that matter how did the scenery get to look so bad? This is an adventure film and that at least in this case means fight sequences. They're decent but if you're looking for that you can find far superior ones easily. There is some female nudity in this for anyone that attracts or repels. I recommend this solely to history teachers who have a severe grudge against their students. 510".

I understand that the Indians were initially planning to protest Christopher Columbus The Discovery but when they saw how moronic it was they realized that there was no need to protest it! The real irony is seeing Marlon Brando in the movie. He had come out in support of the American Indian Movement and famously sent a woman dressed in tribal regalia to accept his Oscar for The Godfather. So why did he star in this? Basically you'll feel tempted to make the sorts of comments that Mike Servo and Crow hurl at the crummy movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the characters were walking through what appeared to be a torture chamber I said No one expects the Spanish Inquisition! If you ask me something that should get emphasized is the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims from Spain and how the confiscation of their property financed the expeditions to the Americas. To say nothing of the Inquisition itself.If the movie has any points of interest it's the early appearances of Catherine ZetaJones and Benicio Del Toro. Everyone had to start somewhere. Nonetheless the best movie dealing with Columbus's landing on Hispaniola NOT discovery is Even the Rain.

Production quality is poor the ships look like they were made from cardboard but that nothing compared to the terrible acting. Selleck and Ward as Ferdinand and Isabella are terrible as is Corraface as Columbus and the only pain Brando is giving out as Torqumada is by his mumbling performance. The script is based entirely in clich terms and ideas are half hatched. It also bares a worrying resemblance to Carry on Columbus. The editing is some of the worst ever done for a film with scenes put together in slapdash fashion with no sense of time or coherence. An object lesson in how NOT to make a film on every level. It even fails on its simplest level to portray the courage and vision that these men had to cross the ocean of darkness.

That's pure crap. The acting is good.The way the film depicts the bad parts of the conquering is simply great. It goes down through the bone marrow. Sometimes critics just follow each other like a flock of seagulls. And all around the world they copy what's been said over there. This premiered in USA and Germany 14 days before the rest of the world which just followed up the bad critics. This was before the world had seen much of Internet. It shows Columbus as a kind but also hard man. He is not shown as a pure hero. He steal the gold and silver from the Indians and he lets crime happen. He also took slaves back and forced the Christian religion upon them to show how good the Indians were when brought back to Spain. It was purely awful. It's grim in many ways. No wonder it was seen upon as a travesty back at the 500 years anniversary.See it. See a much more true story than the other films though it has no happy ending! Just as it was.

Try and hear him say Portoogahl without busting out laughing.Or Rachel Ward playing Queen Isabela as a shallow minded slut who gives Columbus money because she was horny for him. Seriously this film claims that! Try and reconcile that with the real life history Isabella was a sharp powerful queen who presided over the uniting of her nation and one of the most devout Catholics to ever be on the throne. There's good reason she's called Isabela La Catolica and the Defender of the Faith.And Columbus as a supposed charming rake? Actually this actor comes across as a conceited ass in love with his own reflection.Oh yeah and showing his wife as a hot young thing...Columbus married a widow older than him for her money.Please! Columbus was a driven obsessed religious fanatic who thought the world was coming to an end in hislifetime a believer in The End Times who thought he would play a role in Arrmageddon.Which of course is the worst thing the film does. It whitewashes genocide doesn't show Columbus as the man who killed at least 800000 Taino Indians chopping off hand if they didn't give him enough gold handing over Indian girls for his soldiers to rape as rewards for jobs well done feeding Indian bodies to his dogs and personally raping Indian women and enslaving both Indians and Africans. And he went to prison in Spain for falsely imprisoning and torturing Spaniards.Skip this travesty and see the far better films Surviving Columbus or Columbus Didn't Discover Us. And unlike this sanitized fiction these two films are the truth. And you can find them for free on Youtube.".

The movie also has a poor sense of time with periods that took a long time in real life condensed in what seems like a couple of weeks. And despite the fairly lavish budget a lot of the movie looks surprisingly cheap and slapdash. For example a lot of the time when the ships are at sea it's clear the boats are floating just a few feet from land. As for the character of Christopher Columbus you never get a feel of a real character or feel what drives him or what he really feels.

The title role belongs not to an Italian but to a French actor named George Corraface who is a good looking guy who has his eyes more on women then on his journey.The rest of the cast is and exercise in miscasting. Get this Tom Selleck plays King Ferdenand Rachel Ward plays Queen Isabella and Marlon Brando plays Torqaumada with so little energy that I expected him to doze off in the middle of his big scene. These are good actors but seeing them in these costumes and in these roles is just baffling. Christopher Columbus is a role that requires a very introspective actor one who could act with his face and portray the frustration and anguish that probably haunted Columbus for most of his life both in America and back in Europe.Then there is the ending in which the movie ends after a short stay in The New World and its back to Europe.

	schema:headline " Nothing new in Ken Ghosh's much awaited musical.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's obvious to have huge expectations from a musical movie directed by Ken Ghosh who is known as one of the pioneer directors of music videos in India. And the hopes even rise further if the project has the youthful Shahid Kapoor post 'Kaminey' and the energetic Genelia D'Souza after 'Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na' as its lead couple. Hence everyone was eager to see a spectacular show with probably a novel storyline accompanied by some brilliant dance sequences melodious songs amazing picturisations and tender love moments between the young couple on the screen. But surprisingly Ken comes up with a very poorly written confused and uninspiring movie as his third directorial venture after Fida  Ishq Vishq.Right from the start Chance Pe Dance fails to grab your attention as it straight away opens with a song coming from nowhere. Even the titles begin after the song gets over so there is no explanation why the song was there in the first place. Secondly just after 15 minutes into the movie a normal movielover can easily guess its complete storyline till the end and that's where the movie loses its main ground of the expected box office success. Based on a routine plot of a struggler coming to Mumbai with hopes of making it big Chance Pe Dance has got nothing to stand out as its merit apart from the spirited performance of Shahid Kapoor.In other words Shahid is the only Chance for the movie to impress its viewers and I sincerely doubt he alone would be able to save it. The flick has several serious issues in its execution which forcibly restrict it to be called as a below average project. Here they are for your consideration1. The moment a song starts in the movie it shifts to a music video mold which is no doubt the forte of its director Ken Ghosh. Though the songs are indeed a treat to watch but it seems Ken worked more hard on the songs and less on his story.2. The movie has a completely avoidable track of a school and its students winning a dance competition due to their dance teacher Shahid. The sequence which is highly inspired from The School of Rock 2003 is not scripted well gets hurriedly finished and looks like a misfit in the movie.3. A director who can be called as the Master of Music Videos ideally must have a good ear and incredible music sense. But Ken simply disappoints in this department as he is not able to get any good songs from the otherwise talented singer Adnan Sami. The music of Chance Pe Dance is a big letdown especially with a weak finale song at the reality show in the climax.4. It seems that both the writer and director are pretty confused regarding what their lead characters have to do on the screen. Shahid who is supposed to be an aspiring talented actor is more interested in showing his dancing skills than the acting. On the other hand Genelia who plays a choreographer in the movie is given no detailed sequence of teaching the dancing steps to anyone. In fact she seems to be more interested in acting with all her cute mannerisms and doesn't even talk about dance in the movie. Mohnish Behl is the most confused one who at first selects Shahid for his movie and then suddenly rejects him without any reason.5. The most irritating one comes towards the climax when Shahid is participating in a big channel' reality show in which we are simply not shown any of his competitors. The viewers only get to see Shahid's performance on the stage that's too a dancing one and he easily goes on to win the acting contest and becomes a star.In the acting department Shahid is the only savior in the movie who gives a sincere and spirited performance which shows more of his sensitive and emotional persona. He might be counting a lot on this movie but may not get the desired results at the box office. Genelia as his lover performs much better than her previous movies. But the cool and pretty girl doesn't get a well written role and thus cannot be blamed for anything. Parikshit Sahni repeats his fatherly act of 3 Idiots but still manages to impress  Vikas Bhalla is a bit loud in his few scenes.In the end looking at the track record of the talented director Ken Ghosh one wonders why he chose this kind of completely predictable subject for his third important movie which also had the most sellable stars at his disposal. Was this the story he was working on in this long gap of almost 5 years? Or the movie was a victim of an uncontrolled delay without his fault.To sum up Chance Pe Dance which was more publicized as a dancing musical has only few dancing sequences to watch out and no particular song to rave about. The choreography and song picturisation does entertain you at times but in the absence of some equally good tracks and a novel script they fail to create a lasting impact.".

Loads of struggler movies have been made and you have heard the same story over and over again but where lies the difference?? The answer is the moments!! Yes watch for its moments and the passion which Shahid injects into the role...Ken Ghosh who set the box office on fire with his Ishq Vishq this time slips due to his notsonew script.. The only thing which earned the movie some respect was Shahid's unmatched performance! His dance sequences are superb and choreographed by Marty Kudelka who has choreographed stars like Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.. The irony is that despite having four music directors in the movie the music is not so great and you don't even remember the count of the songs after you watch the movie!! Genelia as usual is OK! Parikshat Sahni is the new Dad of Bollywood and Mohnish Behl was satisfactory and the children of his dance class were surprisingly charming!! But the standout performance was from Shahid whose struggling act and honest expressions make you smile!! If you wondering what to extract from this review then watch the movie for its fun moments and of course Shahid and his dance.. It will make you smile!!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Chance Pe Dance";
	schema:reviewBody "Well it seems like Dance movies are the rage these days and this week alone we have two films that seemingly centers on dance with Jump coming from ChinaHong Kong and Chance Pe Dance from Bollywood both being romantic comedies appealing to their respective distinct demographics. And it's not too surprising that unlike dance films of old where there's a malefemale pair who would exhibit some signature moves on the dance floor the contemporary films this week have absolutely none of that which in some ways is a pity.Chance Pe Dance follows recent Bollywood films such as Luck Pe Chance in having their characters lament about the open secret of their film industry where one has to be well connected or come from an influential family in the industry in order to have one's big break served on a silver platter. For the rest of the mortals aspiring for that opportunity it's more hard work toil and sweat in order to get noticed otherwise it's an endless cycle of mundane work to pay the bills and juggling auditions in between.Shahid Kapur plays one such struggler from Delhi Sameer Behl who has spent the last 3 plus years trawling the audition houses of Mumbai in order to find work in the film industry. Living under meagre terms he gets disappointed time and again which is pretty much against the way he was brought up to believe that his good looks and charisma automatically meant he'd be the hero in his life all the time. The narrative takes a very whirlwind snapshot of Sameer's life highlighting his debts and being played out by both his best friend as well as filmmakers who promise him the sky but never hesitant to pull the rug from under his feet.The story tries to jam pack too many subplots into the film which makes you wonder whether this is a dance film if at all. First of all there's the school days arc where in order to sustain his city living Sameer takes up a teaching job imparting his dance skills to pesky children he's never good with them in order to help them win their dance competition. The key message here is of course if one couldn't do anything with one's current lifetime there's always the imparting of skills to the next generation for them to live the dream that we have missed out on. This story arc could have been better fleshed out other than to be squeezed into the film just before the intermission and then resolved right after the film resumes.Then there's the continuation of Sameer's own struggle where he has to learn never to give up because a lifechanging opportunity may just be around the corner. In what would be like an American Idol clone of a danceidol contest this story too wasn't fleshed out properly and we're taken in for quite the fast tracking from the competition's start right to the finale with nary any tension due to the lack of competitive characters and the larger culprit being the lack of dance it's chance pe dance after all right?But the largest waste here was the under utilization of the character Tina played by Genelia D'Souza a choreographer whom Sameer serendipitously meets and falls in love with. The character reminded me of Asin's Kalpana from Ghajini the freespirited strong girl who teaches a thing or two to her guy about what it means by being resilient. I thought Genelia looked like Asin too from certain angles and possessed the same vivacity here as well together with some really stunning dance moves that we would see at the start of the film with so much promise that when the lead duo gets paired together sparks will fly and magic will happen. But it didn't! If there's anything to rue about it's precisely this missed opportunity to have the duo perform a lot more dance numbers than one which quite sedately celebrates their love for each other by mucking around exotic locales.For a dance movie I wouldn't doubt that Bollywood cannot pull one off given the musical like quality in almost all of the films but it's a real pity that Chance Pe Dance is not that film. Thankfully the leads have charisma and share pitch perfect chemistry together which managed to carry the film through from start to end limited dance moves notwithstanding.".

This movie did have a bit of everything including the kitchen sink thrown in the plot but it all works together nicely to produce classic findingone'sdestiny true love redemption through the love of children and being true to yourself kind of story.

The movie depicts the struggle of the current generation whose talents are suppressed by the influential personalities.We all being a part of this system can feel it ourselves. The movie is a familyentertainer and has hilarious comedy sequences.Ken Ghosh has done a great job on his part. This movie is certainly better than his Directorial debut and creates a milestone in his Career. Acting by Shahid Genelia and Mohnish Behldespite his short appearancewere great. Dancing talent of Shahid is an eyecandy to the viewers. Pal mein hi song enraptures the audience. To sum up this movie is a great entertainer and also gives a great social message. Finallly this movie is a worth watching with numerous memorable momentsespecially the South Indian ad by Shahidso go watch the movie with your family!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got round to make the attempt to watch this movie after a long wait. A movie coming from Ken Ghosh I was not expecting anything exciting. For me it was just another movie that had to be watched. His previous venture 'Fida' was enjoyable. This is his third movie with Shahid Kapoor so I'm sure that he was hoping that it would work wonders like his previous two movies. Unfortunately due to a weak and routine plot the movie fails to leave an impression. The theme has been repeated in countless movies in the past. This movie had nothing fresh to add to that so the outcome was disatisfying. Yes Ghosh has directing ability. But if he wrote a better script maybe the movie would have turned out worthwhile. Despite a duration of just 2 hours the movie seemed to have a slow pace.The attempt to show a guy struggling to become a actor was not convincing. I had seen it all before so it was nothing new. There was also a side plot involving helping some school kids to improve at what they are learning. However that was not integrated well in to the main story. Genelia D Souza is a good actress with a cute face. Though with limited scope she was wasted. I hope that she will be part of better movies in the future. Shahid Kapoor is given another opportunity to display his noddy work and dancing skills. I feel that he is a better dancer than a actor. Lately his acting has become very similar in all his movies. I quiet enjoyed the 'rishta hai mera' picturistaion and the scene when Shahid was crying. Other than that there was nothing much commendable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chance Pe Dance is a hackneyed story based on reality shows the 'happening' stuff these days. Following the moderately successful Ishq Vishq and box office failure fida this is the third of Ken Ghosh  Shahid Kapoor combos. While its budget permitted it to hire stars it sorely loses out on juvenile script and shabby execution.The story is about Sameer a Michael Jackson devotee and a starry eyed struggler who fights his budgets by toasting bread with an iron and has a broken fridge for a cupboard. Then there are failed auditions and dodging the landlord for rent. He nearly lands up with a music video but is displaced by a starson. In the process though he gains the smiley Tina Genelia a choreographer as his friend.While the movie is themed on Dance and occasionally demonstrates its stuff lame songs and an underused Shahid make a dumb movie dumber. Impracticality continues and a director who just saw Sameer dance casts him 'hero' in his next flick. But wait the movie has just started and how can it be so goodygoody already? Then the predictable happens. His production knocks him off for a talent hunt instead.Till now you just had fun and drama is due to kickin. A now jobless and homeless Sameer now decides to live in his car. Wait did I say 'car'? A guy juggling borderline poverty drives around his four wheels! The only silly reason for the car was that the script wanted to have its 'hero' living in a car! It doesnt end here. He takes up a job teaching school kids to dance while using their bathrooms for ablutions.Trying to reach out to teens they had to show have some child drama like the kids wining the interschool dance competition all due to Shahid. Though clichd the scene where his pupils part with their lunch boxes to feed their hungry and penniless teacher is touching. These lows also give an opportunity to the lead couple to show some chemistry with a little help from Tinas brother played neatly by Zain Khan.It attempts to include humor but this Augean mess of a movie leaves you curse your choice of movie. As you endure its painful length and poor editing you turn into a hapless victim of reality TV drama transferred to a larger screen. Substantiating the accusations of imitating King Khan Shahid does a 'my moms dream speech that even touches his rigid father. No prizes for guessing the obvious ending.So is there anything at all that is worthwhile in this? Barring Genelias freshness and some teen stuff there is nothing. The dances are boring Shahid retains his Kaminay hairdo and sixpack abs are now pass. Shahids forte is about cute looks and dance moves both of which are untapped fully. So take my advice save your time and money forget that this movie ever released applies to die hard Shahid fans too!".

The struggle for stardom is done on such a glamorized level of selfactualization so that the audience accepts these liberties for the pleasure of watching goodlooking people look presentable in situations where they would otherwise appear unbecoming. On the credit titles we see our strugglerhero prepare for another day of self selling to an unthinking entertainment industry when one sees a slightly seamless splendour lurking at the heart of this film about a Dilliwallah's struggle to become a star in the Big Bad Bollywood. Clichd theme? Yup! But sometime some of the most endearing truths of life emerge from situations that work in a direction opposite to the originality. The fact that Shahid plays the struggler helps. It really helps. Here's an enormously watchable actor who can take away the 'acting' from a character and just make you look at what is being said and done on screen without the baggage of his personal life being carried forward. Shahid's character Samir in the film is a struggler in all its shades. Samir has defiantly left for Bollywood while his dad Parikshat Sahni endearing is left wondering why his son needs to be a film hero in the first place Bollywood. Shahid goes through the predictable grind but with such extraordinary sincerity and involvement you suddenly realize the one truth about life's vagaries. Every struggle no matter how similar on the surface is different underneath. Shahid brings out all the shades nuances and layers in the struggler's inner world without bending the rules of commercial herogiri. This is a far better performance than it outwardly seems. Whether romancing the funny girlnextdoor okay a few block awaymanifesting the disappointments of a struggler who's getting emotionally wornout waiting for the big moment or interacting with the kids in schoolthe director is almost as good with these angels from hell as Shekhar Kapoor in Mr IndiaShahid just goes with the flow with a fluidity that goes beyond the dancefloor. Oh about Shahid's dancing is there a better dancer in the film industry today? he slim but confident plot moves smoothly on the surface. This one is a romcom with a pleasing pungent flavour of Mumbai's sorrowful underbelly hidden but palpable. While Shahid struggles for stardom the narrative glides along at its own even pace seeking out the wannabe star's life as homeless roaddweller who sleeps in his car and smirks at life's cruelties. There are very few characters in the plot. Satish Shah Mohnish Behl and Vikas Bhalla who come and go like images seen from a moving train. Director Ken Ghosh keeps the narrative free of complexities beyond the struggler's immediate preoccupations. And that suits the film's moderate temperature just fine. Some moments especially with the kids exude the warmth like rays of sunshine peeping through a partially open door. Watch the sequence where the kids share their lunch with their famished teacher. Awwwww! Though the choreography is uneven and the climactic dance a bit of a disappointment Shahid comfortably keeps us watching the predictable but perky progression of this penniless pilgrim from the backseat of a car to the redcarpet. While giving groovy gurugyan to his students our dance teacher Shahid mentions Michael Jackson  Govinda Prabhu Deva  Hrithik Roshan and Shiamak Davar among the best dancers. We can easily add Shahid's name to the list.".

He didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't really blame him for this. He was NOT used to his fullest. Genelia was great. I liked her acting and her character. The school part was totally unnecessary. Probably used just to fill some gap or spark a chemistry between Shahid and Genelia.In short please don't waste your time on this flick. I gave it two stars just because I am a fan of Shahid and I liked Genelia's role. Otherwise it probably doesn't even deserve one.".

The dance portions here are impressively performed by Shahid Kapoor but you could interchange each of the sequences and it would make no difference to the final film. Much of the blame for that must by shared by composer Adnan Sami who delivers an uninspired soundtrack of indifferent tunes.Chance Pe Dance doesn't work because you feel no empathy for its protagonist. The film's writers  if you can call them that considering there is no script to speak of  fail to invest even a hint of vulnerability in Sameer. More so Shahid Kapoor's surfacelevel performance doesn't help convey the desperation his character's supposedly feeling.The obligatory romantic track between Sameer and an upcoming choreographer played by Genelia D'souza is so random it adds no dimension to the central plot. This is a film without any character arcs or plot progression. To be honest Chance Pe Dance is a film that probably started shooting before a script was ever written a oneline idea that never developed into a complete story.".

His expressed dissatisfaction with the response of the President Diaz puts him in danger and when he rashly rescues a prisoner from the local militia he becomes an outlaw. Urged on by a strolling intellectual Fernando he supports the exiled Don Francisco Madero against Diaz and becomes the leader of his forces in the South as Francisco 'Pancho' Villa is in the North. Diaz flees and Madero takes his place but he is a puppet president in the hands of the leader of the army Huerta who has him assassinated when he tries to express solidarity for the men who fought for him. Zapata and Villa return to arms and successful in victory seek to find a leader for the country. Unwillingly Zapata takes the job but a while later he responds to some petitioners from his ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Although in fact Emiliano Zapata never became president of Mexico for the most part this is a pretty good account of the illiterate peasant who became a romantic revolutionary. For this portrayal in his third film Marlon Brando got a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor but lost to Gary Cooper for High Noon.And as a film concerning the turmoil in Mexico during the teen and twenty years of the last century Viva Zapata! is far better than MGM's Viva Villa that starred Wallace Beery. Then again Marlon Brando is a much better actor.One critical thing that was left out of the story is how much land the Roman Catholic Church held in Mexico. It was not just the rich Estancias that kept the masses in Mexico in peonage the Church had a really big share of the real estate there. If the story were written today the Church's involvement would be shown. My guess is in the years of the Cold War and the height of Joe McCarthy no one in Hollywood wanted to make a film that criticized the church in any way. But even a few years earlier the overreaction against the church was done in the John Ford film The Fugitive which takes place within 10 to 20 years after Zapata died.Zapata as played by Brando may be illiterate but he is possessed of a simple eloquence and a charisma that made him a revolutionary figure in the same manner Che Guevara became forty years later. He tries hard to hold to the ideals of the revolution but finds as most do that tearing down a government is relatively easy building one from scratch is a task that has defeated many.Anthony Quinn plays Emiliano's swaggering brother Eufemio who's not quite as idealistic as Brando. Quinn received first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the part. Quinn fills the screen with his bluster when he's on it provides a perfect counterpoint to Brando's more idealistic role.The guy who never gets praise for his performance is Joseph Wiseman. Wiseman a product of the Actor's Studio in New York like Marlon Brando. This is a man whose type I've come across in numerous endeavors in my life a professional stirrer of resentments. He's not happy unless there's some kind of battle going on. A type mind you that is ultimately dangerous for any movement. He intrigues for the sake of intrigue but never accomplishes anything. It's a very good job by Wiseman not often talked about for some reason.Besides Quinn's Oscar and Brando's nomination Viva Zapata! got Oscar nominations for Best ArtSet Direction for black and white film Best music and Best Screenplay. The last would have been a great honor for John Steinbeck I'm not sure how many if any writers won a Pulitzer Prize a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. That's three horse parlay that can't be beat.For some reason Elia Kazan was overlooked for Best Director possibly because he had won the year before for A Streetcar Named Desire.Still Viva Zapata! is a work that stands up very well even with the historical inaccuracies.".

In 'Viva Zapata' Kazan's 'Method' style of acting is applied to John Steinbeck's screenplay that power inevitably corrupts with Brando again charismatic as the doomed Mexican revolutionary...Kazan not only shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty where life is hard short and brutish but also the story of the agrarian rebel who was Pancho Villa's first revolutionary ally...Kazan paints a convincing emotional portrait of a mythical figure who is considered as the 'Wind that swept Mexico.' Kazan explores a facet of the Mexican history describing the reasons for the revolution fought by Zapata and works on basic emotions as passion anger fear aggression ignorance and wisdom...Brando projects the dedication and the anguish of an inspiring rebel... He portrays the illiterate Mexican peasant revolutionary who for ten years led Guerilla uprisings against dictators and presidents... Brando plays the part with fervor and passion even transforming his features with special makeup and fake mustache to look amazingly like the Guerilla leader... For his performance he was nominated for his third consecutive Oscar but Gary Cooper won for 'High Noon'.Anthony Quinn gives an effective portrayal of Eufemio Zapata  the swaggering lecherous bullying brother and wins his first Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor... Through his consummate acting skills Quinn creates in Eufemio a strongly characterization which despite its brevity was not overshadowed by Brando's Zapata...Jean Peters portrays the typical educated girl of the village who falls in love with the wild man of the hills and marries him... The film begins near the close of the 34th year reign of President Porfirio Diaz Fay Roope where a delegation of Indians from the State of Morelos have come to the capital for an audience with the great dictator... There they make known their strong objections over the stealing of their lands by the wealthy powerful estate barons... Diaz addresses them paternally and instructs them they must examine their boundaries before they bring legal action something he knows they are incapable of doing... Burning with a sense of injustice the simple Emiliano Zapata directs the president's attention to this point requesting his consent to cross the railing of wires...President Diaz was disturbed by the persistent Zapata and on the sheet of paper listing his visitors he unpleasantly circles the name of this one humble man who has really came for 'something.'Some time later Emiliano and his brother lead the farmers in a general inspection through their expropriated fields and as they do so a squad of Diaz militia attack them shooting and cutting down men women and children indiscriminately...Zapata and some of his followers fight back and retreat to a mountain hideout... There they are located by a sly political agitator a newspaperman named Fernando Aguirre Joseph Wiseman who brings news of Francisco Madero Harold Gordon exiled in Texas...Zapata sends his friend Pablo Lou Gilbert to interview Madero and find out if he is worth following...One day and in a church Zapata risks his life to speak of truth and of love... But the pretty brunette Josefa Jean Peters rejects him even though she admits to being attracted to him and tells him he must improve his social position before she might think out his proposal...When Espejo Florenz Ameo refuses to consider him as a suitor to his daughter Zapata angrily leaves his house... He is immediately arrested by policemen and led away with a rope around his neck... As the mounted police walk him behind their horses through the countryside they are gradually joined by peasants who silently march along... The group increases into a huge number of farmers... Zapata comes to a realization that the peasants have chosen him as their leader and that he has no course but to accept... Destiny has singled him out...'Viva Zapata!' received 5 Academy Award Nominations...It is a greatly entertaining film excitingly directed by Kazan who made its action sequences so intense and who permitted his actors full scope in developing their characters...".

	schema:headline " America's Favorite Foreign Revolution?";
	schema:reviewBody "The history of Mexico our southern neighbor and sometimes victim is better known to American movie goers than the history of most countries. You begin with the Maya KINGS OF THE SUN the conquest of Mexico THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE then to the founding of Father Serra's missions in California SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD and then the Spanish in the southwest and California THE MARK OF ZORRO. Mexican  American history begins with the Texas War for Independence THE ALAMO THE LAST TEXAN etc.. We skip to the French intervention JUAREZ and VERA CRUZ. Then we tend to skip the long reign of Porfirio Diaz. Then comes the Mexican Revolution. The number of films that deal with the revolution is vast. But here are just a few titles VIVA ZAPATA VIVA VILLA VILLA RIDES THE OLD GRINGO about Ambrose Bierce's probable death in Mexico's revolution VIVA MARIA a spoof but it touches on some issues THE THREE AMIGOS THEY CAME TO CORDURA regarding the American Intervention under General Pershing in 1916 THE FUGITIVE dealing with the antiCatholic policies of the 1920s and 1930s and even THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES when you see the business with Alfonso Badoya's bandit gang against the Federales.The Mexican Revolution had many heroes. Many were heroes for one group but devils to another. Madero and Carranza stressed the need to have a nation that was loyal to a written constitution. Zapata would be one of the leaders of the land reform movement. Starting with Francisco Madero going through Pancho Villa and Eufremio Zapata going to their enemy Venusiano Carranza to Obregon Calles and the great land reformer Lazaro Cardenas  the leadership was varied. The largest concentration of films is on the colorful and murderous Villa a recent cable television movie was about Villa and his contract with D. W. Griffith to shoot a movie AND STARRING PANCHO VILLA. But historians usually feel that while Villa tended to be on the side of the peasants he had too much of the bandit in him to be a leader of the revolution's reforms. Zapata on the other hand actually tried to reform the division of land. His work never got as far as he wanted before he was assassinated but it was burned into the souls of the people from his region of Mexico who still call themselves Zapatistas when involved in political protests to this day and it did help set the stage for Cardenas' reforms in the late 1930s.With direction by Elia Kazan and screenplay by John Steinbeck VIVA ZAPATA is a wonderful if simplistic view of the Revolution for American audiences. Brando underplays the lead for the most part  Zapata was not an explosive personality like Villa. Anthony Quinn is the explosive brother whose more selfish attitudes leads to his own disaster.

	onyx:emotionText "The history of Mexico our southern neighbor and sometimes victim is better known to American movie goers than the history of most countries. You begin with the Maya KINGS OF THE SUN the conquest of Mexico THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE then to the founding of Father Serra's missions in California SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD and then the Spanish in the southwest and California THE MARK OF ZORRO. Mexican  American history begins with the Texas War for Independence THE ALAMO THE LAST TEXAN etc.. We skip to the French intervention JUAREZ and VERA CRUZ. Then we tend to skip the long reign of Porfirio Diaz. Then comes the Mexican Revolution. The number of films that deal with the revolution is vast. But here are just a few titles VIVA ZAPATA VIVA VILLA VILLA RIDES THE OLD GRINGO about Ambrose Bierce's probable death in Mexico's revolution VIVA MARIA a spoof but it touches on some issues THE THREE AMIGOS THEY CAME TO CORDURA regarding the American Intervention under General Pershing in 1916 THE FUGITIVE dealing with the antiCatholic policies of the 1920s and 1930s and even THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES when you see the business with Alfonso Badoya's bandit gang against the Federales.The Mexican Revolution had many heroes. Many were heroes for one group but devils to another. Madero and Carranza stressed the need to have a nation that was loyal to a written constitution. Zapata would be one of the leaders of the land reform movement. Starting with Francisco Madero going through Pancho Villa and Eufremio Zapata going to their enemy Venusiano Carranza to Obregon Calles and the great land reformer Lazaro Cardenas  the leadership was varied. The largest concentration of films is on the colorful and murderous Villa a recent cable television movie was about Villa and his contract with D. W. Griffith to shoot a movie AND STARRING PANCHO VILLA. But historians usually feel that while Villa tended to be on the side of the peasants he had too much of the bandit in him to be a leader of the revolution's reforms. Zapata on the other hand actually tried to reform the division of land. His work never got as far as he wanted before he was assassinated but it was burned into the souls of the people from his region of Mexico who still call themselves Zapatistas when involved in political protests to this day and it did help set the stage for Cardenas' reforms in the late 1930s.With direction by Elia Kazan and screenplay by John Steinbeck VIVA ZAPATA is a wonderful if simplistic view of the Revolution for American audiences. Brando underplays the lead for the most part  Zapata was not an explosive personality like Villa. Anthony Quinn is the explosive brother whose more selfish attitudes leads to his own disaster. Of the supporting players Alan Reed is good in his scene as Villa where he discusses the future of Mexico with Zapata. Joseph Wiseman is properly sinister as an constant malcontent agent provocateur insinuating each leader is too weak or unreliable to lead.There are great set pieces  like Kazan's symbolic assassination of Madero by General Huerta's goons who drown out the little reformerorator's voice as he tries to scream with a siren but it makes the screams of the unheard martyr like a clarion call to Mexico.

It's still wonderful...but then why shouldn't it be?  The performances of Brando Peters Quinn Wiseman and others is still breathtaking but Quinn and Brando steal the show from the getgo.  This is one of Brando's finest roles and while Quinn always outdoes himself even in that godawful Walk in the Clouds he IS Eufemio Zapata.  There are few reviews here of this film and one reviewer has completely missed the point but no matter.  The film stands on its own and there's always someone to complain at excellence.  This script came from none other than Steinbeck and the photography and background is likewise excellent.  Is it accurate historically?  Well there are a few embellishments but the thrust of the film is not marred by any deviations from recorded history.  This is portrayal of a people's struggle one which continues today and doesn't pretend to be a chronicle of the actual events that took place in Mexico. As a film this stands on its merit as a superb work of art.  The acting is wonderful.  While one reviewer found the music to be like the kind you hear while eating a combination plate on Olvera Street in LA I might point out that's what Mexican music is.  Rent this film.  While it is listed as not being available I rented it recently and watched it again for the nth time as indeed I plan to watch n times again.".

It's almost like a Western except the setting is the second decade of the 20th century between the years of 19101919. Marlon Brando is Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata in a role that earned him an Academy Award nomination. Brando is paired once again with Kazan who directed him the year before in A Streetcar Named Desire and would pair with him a couple of years later in Brando's Oscar winning performance in On the Waterfront. This film is well photographed by Mexican born cinematographer Joe Macdonald who should have been nominated for an Oscar but wasn't. In a rare role for Mexican born Anthony Quinn to be actually playing a Mexican as Eufernio Zapata for which he won the Academy Award for Best supporting Actor for 1952. Quinn's first nomination of four in his career and his first win of two. The film received three other nominations for Art Direction Music and for it's John Steinbeck written Screenplay. This film is pure Hollywood however and is largely a fictional portrayal of actual events in it's romanticizing tale of one of Mexico's most beloved heroes Zapata. Despite the story by Steinbeck the dialog is weak. It's a good movie but Kazan is out of his element here Brando is miscast and Steinbeck is lazy. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I am not entirely going to pan this movie in the way it would certainly be universally panned today to start with you have to look real hard to find any actual Mexicans in the cast  the only one I found in the named cast was Margo playing an unnamed soldadera though there are some others in the uncredited list.Furthermore I think it's worth seeing for some of the theatrical bits that have entered the collective consciousness like where Zapata demonstrates to Madero that political power really does grow out of the barrel of a gun as Mao would later point out. And you can look at it as a sort of useful AngloAmerican children's intro to the fact that yes there has been revolutionary history in Mexico that is worth knowing about.But still. Okay you can look at this movie one of two ways. First it is it really a biopic? No it's nothing like that. MovieZapata is this naive illiterate pure son of the soil too trusting too honest who shuns the corruption of real power sort of like a movie version of Joan of Arc. The real Zapata had a merchant's education composed the Plan of Ayala and was an important military and political figure. Everyone else in the movie is a caricature of one kind or another also.Another way to look at this movie is that it's a romantic portrayal a movie version of a myth. Okay that would be all right. But then you are responsible for the kind of myth you are propagating. If you are going to falsify history in the name of didactic storytelling let's talk about the story and about who is telling it.This is a myth about Mexican history told by AngloCalifornians Edgecumb Pinchon and John Steinbeck. I suggest that a lot of the magicpeasantsaint feel of the film is precisely due to that.It came to the screen at a time when Steinbeck Elia Kazan and all of Hollywood were under great pressure from the government and the film biz to disassociate themselves from communism. And it's left its mark on the film notably in the character of Fernando Wiseman who is supposed to be some kind of international communist agitator always preaching violence and ending up in the camp of the murderous generals because as movieZapata says Your kind always does. Also the United States is a land of freedom and democracy and you never hear about the occupation of Veracruz for example. And it also bears on the whole tenor of the film which is all for peasants rising up against injustice but which is very ambivalent on the issue of what the state should do and whether or how anyone should actually be in it.Also I can't help noting that movieZapata never pays any attention to anything women have to say about anything which may or may not be historically based but a movie which is telling a myth not history has to be judged for it. Furthermore movieZapata is offended that anyone would consider him an Indian and one never hears about Indians in the movie whereas realZapata was reportedly fluent in Nahuatl and the actual revolt in Morelos then as now had serious indigenist elements.There is a scene in the movie which is on the one hand really good and on the other hand really exasperating which illustrates some of these issues. Zapata has been taken prisoner and is being led from his village with a rope around his neck by mounted police who intend to either jail him or shoot him. But as they travel along the people who have arranged themselves all along the road and through the hills in advance get up from the ground or come down from the heights and wordlessly join the party in groups of two or six or ten. Eventually the police catch on to the fact that they are traveling in the midst of a throng that completely outnumbers them. Finally their path is blocked by Zapata's mounted riders and they release Zapata without a struggle.On the one hand who can be insensible to this picture of the power of the people? On the other hand the aggravating part is the pure and mystical way this supposedly all happens as if because of being in tune with the soil itself these people all arranged themselves in the right places without any actual discussion. Not even in Morelos does it go like this. If one wants a better and more informed picture of how struggle actually takes place Steinbeck's In Dubious Battle is a decent candidate.Anyway I ultimately feel that the real Zapata deserves a better movie. Maybe the 1970 version is that movie  I intend to give it a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of allyou can get a copy of it from Corinth Video New York City. When I saw that Tyrone Power was originally picked to play Zapata I almost fell out of my chair. An inch deep Hollywood pretty boy playing this role? It would have been ghastly. He could never have carried it off with Kazan directing and against the great other actors. Maybe he could have strutted around with a knife in his teeth and brandishing two pistols. It took a dramatic actor like Brando to probe the range of feelings conflicts various personalities from bumpkin to leader from uncertainty to decisiveness from vulnerability to strength the growth from peasant to leader. Brando was a tour De force. I have seen this movie 100 times. It never stops evoking new elements and dimensions. It still hasn't gone stale in spite of some melodrama here and there. I began to see a sea change somewhere in the middle maybe when he had to do politics  maybe the scene in President Madero's office when he was offered the ranch or Eufemio's going bad from upbeat anthem to a steady decline to tragic destruction and that causes me sadness. I was a kid when I saw it first and it transformed my life. An exposition of what it is to be a decent man trying to do the right thing thinking of his people in a world of cynicism and greed. One interesting thing for me was how the two people closest to Zapata acted out as his alter egos Pablo the conciliator and peace lover and Eufemio as the angry shoot first and ask questions later guy. Unfortunately I identified too much with Fernando the soulless operator dedicated to nothing but logic. He is so necessary as the observer namely us  the cold modern man in contrast to all that humanness and passion. That this movie is not a docudrama about events or a man's life is irrelevant it is an allegory. One of Hollywood's greatest but lost in the dust. Maybe it was too close to the human heart for Hollywood. It could never be made today.".

All he wants is justice and fairness for his people but as things progress he is drawn deeper into a civil war where allies and enemies are often difficult to tell apart.Written by John Steinbeck directed by Elia Kazan starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn and based on a true story on paper this has all the makings of a classic. The end result however is far from satisfactory.The intention was good show the life of a man of integrity and honour and the lengths he is willing to go to for the rights of his people throw in a theme of how power corrupts plus another theme of how a name can sustain a revolution. Can't fault the performances either. Brando in his third movie puts in a strong performance as Zapata. The movie provided him with his second Oscar nomination after only three movies his first was in A Streetcar Named Desire his second movie. Anthony Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1953 for his portrayal of Eufemio Zapata's brother.No it is in the execution especially direction and editing that things fall a bit short of their potential. The story is clumsily told by Elia Kazan. Scenes don't link well some scenes seem entirely unnecessary and it is difficult to follow the history behind the sequence of events. No explanation is given for the seeming lack of continuity eg Zapata is President all seems well then next we know it is back to civil war with Zapata a revolutionary. No detail for the change provided.This sudden change of direction without the events that changed the direction is incredibly jarring and disconcerting.So in the end you have a historic story with many of the historic details left out. Not ideal.Overall okay but not great. While Elia Kazan was a great director I can't help but think this movie would have been a masterpiece if someone like John Huston or maybe John Ford had directed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some good things about this movie. There's a reflection on what can so easily happen to a revolutionary movement when it takes power as Madero Harold Gordon betrays the people he supposedly fought for by not pursuing land reform after he becomes president of Mexico there's a very moving and eloquent speech by Zapata Marlon Brando if they take your corn grow more if they kill your children breed more etc. etc. there's the reflection contained at the end of the movie when it becomes clear that to kill a man does not kill the ideas the man represented. So in terms of political commentary there's a lot of good stuff here. There was also a pretty good performance from Brando who portrays Zapata as brooding and sombre throughout  a man who finds little time to enjoy the pleasures of life even his beautiful bride because he spends so much time fighting for the people. It was a good portrayal.Unfortunately that powerful content is submerged in a movie that is often to be blunt quite dull and actionless with a number of scenes throughout in which very little happens. Twice I sat down to watch it both times I missed part of it because it put me out. Through both watchings I think I've seen the whole thing but that says something to me. In all honesty the movie lost me somewhat right off the top when my initial impression of what I was seeing was that it was a bunch of American actors running around in sombreros pretending to be Mexican. It lacked authenticity to me. Fay Roope as Porforio Diaz was especially unconvincing. That made it hard for the movie to maintain my attention even given the strong parts that I've mentioned. I end up rating this as a 310 still noting that the strong content is diluted by what I found to be an overall unengaging story.".

His name is circled on the President's desk not a good sign and from here on in Zapata is fighting and fighting what one character says is as simple as it is  it's all he knows so that the farmers can have their land as opposed to time and patience to grow their corn with.When Brando first appears as this revolutionary figure he doesn't quite look like himself and at the same time does very much and it's disarming. I didn't buy it entirely in the first scene... and then the scenes kept coming and Brando playing Zapata as stubborn and headstrong and without much in way of a sense of humor as a leader as a General and rightfully so as revolutionary figures tend to be see Che for more details is spot on. It's worthy of the rest of his oeuvre at the time if not quite up to the monolithic status of Streetcar and Waterfront then at least as good if not better than the underrated The Wild One. This is vintage Brando every step of the way absorbing us in this figure who reminds us all why it's necessary to have such heroes  but also the lacerating side of the doubleedged sword wherein those in power will do all they can to destroy the hero. That and well revolutions and movements of ideas amongst people end up turning things pretty damn bittersweet just look at the very end for that as four peasants talk of Zapata's status as an idea as well as a man.Viva Zapata! presents Mexico in some fresh and amazing cinematography sturdy and sometimes clever and heartfelt direction from Elia Kazan always best with his actors even Anthony Quinn who again proves why he was best as taking on an ethnicity and making it believable if only up to a point as his powerhouse turn shows here and some very interesting writing from John Steinbeck. The script sometimes takes its turns and movements that don't make it quite flow as well as it would in a book individual scenes are knockouts minimasterpieces of words exchanged with underlying meaning or trying to find the meaning in how people can persevere or not as it turns out one such scene I loved is when Zapata has been installed as the President as Pancho Villa says there's no one else and the farmers he says he knows comes and demands the same things he did once before but at a personal price.There's lots of great things like that or just the uncomfortable but true rapore between Zapata and his futurewife's family when they talk in metaphors. If only Steinbeck didn't sometimes jerk the story ahead without some warning it will be hard to explain you just have to see it to understand though this may have more to do with the direction than writing more research is needed for this assumption it would be unstoppable as a classic. As it stands though Viva Zapata! is an essential chronicle of a rebel with a cause an honest man of principles who tried to do too much good in a country where it just wasn't possible. Or perhaps things like this just aren't possible one can see the parallels and maybe even find this to be like a condensed version of Soderbergh's Che in taking a sobering look at the sweet highs and sobering lows of rising up against the powers that be and yes this is quite the leftist movie all the more odd considering it's John McCain's favorite film!".

I can't imagine why 'they' gave the Oscar to Gray Cooper for High Noon when Brando's performance in Viva Zapata clearly outdid Gary's I have seen both the movies and Brando deserves it without a second thought. Well Brando didn't care and that's the best part he certainly is the BEST in method acting and this movie shows just how talented and gifted as an actor he was. The movie overall is a classic poetic rebellious and based on the life of the revolutionary Zapata in Mexico. There are a number a similarities with Che Guevara war tactics and the way he lives and spares no one when it comes to his ideals. It's must watch for the lovers of classic artistic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie covers the life of the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata from 1909 until his death in 1919. The opening scene has a group of about fifteen Mexican peasants meeting with their president Porfirio Diaz. Diaz refers to the group as my children and to himself as your father your protector. However when it comes to protecting the land rights legally due the peasants it is seen that Diaz is more inclined to protect the wealthy land owners who have usurped the peasant lands for their own use. The peasants are deferential to the president except for one who stays behind when they are ushered out and that is Zapata Marlon Brando. This is a great entrance for Brando as he appears out of the anonymity of the group to challenge the president to act. This is an interesting role for Brando since his characterization of Zapata is more of a man of action rather than a man of words. Brando speaks in straightforward sentences often with little emotion but he is superb in his ability to express indignation. Recognizing the corruption and injustice of the Diaz regime set Zapata on the revolutionary road.Anthony Quinn is good in his Oscarwinning performance as Zapata's more impulsive and earthy brother Eufemio. As a Mexican by birth Quinn is well suited for his role. I did have a small qualm about having a white American play Zapata. But Brando had a nice tan and did something with his eyes to where I reacted to him as Zapata rather than Marlon Brando. I found Jean Peters a bit weak as Zapata's love interest Josefa. In fact I felt that exploring that relationship bogged things downare we really to believe that the two spent their wedding night having Josefa trying to teach Zapata how to read using the Bible?Trying to cram a decade's worth of turbulent history into two hours in addition to the love story presented some problems. On occasion Zapata would appear at his home having announced a major victory but no details were given as to who had been defeated or the significance of the victory. I was often confused about the big picture.There are many memorable scenes. The gradual emergence of the peasants out of the hills to foil Zapata's early arrest as he was being led on a rope like and animal was beautifully choreographed. And the final scenes have been burned into my memory since I saw this movie on TV some fifty years ago. Reseeing some of these old classics on modern equipment is a delight.As presented here Zapata was not a terribly complex man. He was pure of heart and obsessed with righting wrongs. Zapata's walking away from the position of authority he had achieved was an interesting turn of events implying that he was more comfortable as a rebel than as an official leader.The screenplay has many Steinbeckian touches. The struggle of the common man against what often looks like a stacked deck is a favorite Steinbeck theme and that is emphasized in this movie. How could Steinbeck not have been interested in this? There are some great quotes the likes of which we rarely see in contemporary movies o A monkey in silk is still a monkey.o A pediment of the heart is the stomach.o Can a man whose thoughts were born in anger and hatred ... can such a man lead the peace?o A strong people is the only lasting strength.o Sometimes a dead man can be a terrible enemy.o A strong man makes a weak people. Strong people don't need a strong man.o Peace is very difficult. I wonder how a man can stay honest under the pressures of peace.These latter quotes are relevant today in light of the uprisings in the Middle East. After the oppressive regimes are overthrown then what?In spite of some of its flaws I think this movie deserves more of an audience than it appears to have had over the years.".

Emiliano Zapata as played by Brando is a beautiful simple man whose ideals are used as a pawn by others. Jean Peters plays his wife and she is convincing. Anthony Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor award for his role as Brando's brother and the scene where Brando is compelled to execute Quinn is highly emotionally charged. Kazan is not really known as an action director his action scenes in Streetcar and Waterfront are generally regarded as the weakest parts of the film's though they are both still pretty much perfect. But he does well here and the guy really was a great director. The script by John Steinbeck is not too shabby either. I loved the intimate wedding night scenes between Brando and Peters. So real.

The ending itself remains powerfully symbolic.Unfortunately the movie stumbles outside of the cautionary context. The narrative itself comes across as disjointed at best John Steinbeck or no. Major developments such as game changing wars are either left out or only briefly alluded to while too much of the dialog is that clunky pseudopoetic phrasing Hollywood identified with noble primitives. Then too director Kazan achieves little of the dramatic intensity he was famous for. Likely he was hampered by the broad historical canvas that had to be crowded into a relatively brief space.Which leads to Kazan's most famous protg the redoubtable Marlon Brando who appears to have swallowed a lemon since his entire performance consists of a single sour expression. We realize the burdens of peasant liberation are great but does it have to be quite so tedious. On the other hand Quinn projects enough boisterous personality for them both becoming as tiresome in its own way as Brando's one note. However neither of the stars can compete with the outrageous overacting of Florenz Ames as the snooty father. Nevertheless there are some good scenes especially where Kazan choreographs the latent power of the peasantry. But on the whole the movie is a disappointing followup to the previous year's Streetcar. Looks to me like the lesson may be that action features are not the best venue for stage directors and actors no matter how good they are.".

Wiseman who never received the recognition for his acting that he deserved was a fascinating person who relished playing somewhat wacky oddball roles. I got to know him when I lived in New York and in real life he was an extremely intelligent polished gentleman in the literal sense of the word. He played such an offbeat role to perfection in Detective Story which was released in 1951 one year before Zapata. In that film he plays a maniacal criminal who is arrested along with his partner also played with great skill by Michael Strong. They are collared and brought to a crowded room in a New York precinct where they are handcuffed to chairs waiting to be booked. What happens when they slip out of the handcuffs is a stunning scene in which Wiseman portrays to perfection a crazed threetime loser with nothing more to lose and no way out. Others have noted that Wiseman deserved but did not receive even a nomination for best supporting actor for his role in Detective Story. He did memorable appearances in several other films including a very believable Mafia bosskiller in The Valachi Papers.".

It mixes with ability the French and the American conceptions of entertainment and it also includes a few memorable scenes  in fact it contains all the ingredients of a potential cult movie.

And I was impressed by the way they played tough criminals. Good acting !On a personal note this movie was a very nice surprise for me who have lived in France for many years and speak French fluently. I had picked up the DVD in the video store only because I saw Harvey Keitel's name on the cover. The title did not mean anything to me and I did not bother to read anything else on the cover. Harvey Keitel was enough assurance the movie would at least be OK. Then the movie starts in total darkness with some people whispering. At first I did not understand what was said as I was expecting to hear English but no they spoke French. And for the next 10 to 15 minutes it was a French movie set in Paris. I was sure they had put the wrong DVD in the box but I did not mind so much as I found the movie entertaining. Then of course the action moved to the USA...".

It was past one in the morning when I saw it and I considered going to bed instead then after watching the first few scenes of the 95m movie it said 84m on the box I thought I'd watch half of it today and the other half tomorrow but it kept me watching till the end occasionally laughing out loud. Comedy caper films nearly always fail. The Italian Job is overrated. Don't even get me started on publicschool educated Guy Ritchie's films. But any fan of Donald Westlake's Dortmunder books in which a hapless crime planner is saddled with a team of nonstarters and has to extricate himself from increasing complications will see that this is the best Dortmunder movie the late Westlake never wrote. The only successful Dortmunder adaptation was How to Steal a Diamond in Four Uneasy Lessons also known as The Hot Rock. All the others failed to a lesser or greater extent. Despite the predominantly French tone and the minimal characterisation of Depardieu's character Dortmunder is usually silent unless complaining anyway this is what a Dortmunder adaptation should be even though it isn't. Not a great movie by any means with too many respectful nods to Tarantino surely the greater influence here and not Ritchie? but a very watchable one that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Wayne Newton's yes that's a man singing 'Danke Schoen' is used to great effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crime Spree is a good movie. It's not a great one but it's certainly very funny and quite entertaining. Its major problem is though that it's almost completely ripped off from either Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed Crime Spree immensely and I do recommend it. However don't go into it expecting to see something original or revolutionary especially if you're a Guy Ritchie fan.Writerdirector Brad Mirman crafts a cute international comedy with the requisite murdertheftconvoluted plot that has dragged Ritchie to the spotlight while bringing nothing new to the table. One disappointing aspect of Crime Spree though is that it neither has Ritchie's blitheness nor his gravity in serious matters. When in either Snatch or Lock Stock the characters find out that they're screwed we can feel just how screwed they are. In Crime Spree we don't know them well enough to comprehend the level of crap they're in. This is probably because Mirman doesn't take the time to establish the characters well enough to make us feel anything for them. We see that they're a likable group of guys who happen to be hapless thieves and that's where the character development ends.I think Mirman's biggest problem is that he underwrote the script. The scene that catapults the story is too unexpected and weird because it involves a character too peripheral. It takes a huge leap of faith to think that something so minor could result in an onset of problems that big because said peripheral character lacks the motivation to be involved in the plot in the first place.Now speaking of the plot. The plot has Ritchie's signature written all over it only whereas Ritchie begins at the beginning so to speak when he introduces his characters Mirman gets lazy and does expository dialogue instead. This is probably a mistake since he has neither the style nor the substance to fill the holes well enough and make me ignore the sloth of his writing.Lastly Mirman's work suffers from a lot of side ordership. There are only two important groups in the forefront but Mirman stuffs the movie with side characters that seem to distract from the development of the main characters. Whereas Ritchie somehow incorporates these side assemblies into the main plot Mirman doesn't have the skill to do this so I wind up feeling annoyed at the fact that some totally arbitrary people are stealing the screen time. I wish to Christ that in the cases of both Ritchie and Mirman or any of the numerous ontherise directors who want to follow in that vein people learn that simplicity isn't always a bad thing. A movie doesn't have to have thirty protagonists to be good. Both Snatch and Lock Stock had this problem but in those movies the side characters were at least somewhat amusing.Despite these rather grave errors Crime Spree as I said before is a good film. It's light though not light enough with dark moments that are alas not dark enough but it works in its own odd plagiarist way. Mirman has style in terms of shooting the thing and a couple of moments in the film work better than anything Ritchie has ever spawned. Also on the plus side in the Mirman column he has assembled an excellent cast that can at least act.Do I recommend it? As I said absolutely. But if you're looking for something to blow your mind and you've not been living in a Luddite compound in terms of the Ritchie Revolution Crime Spree just won't do it for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brad Mirman's Crime Spree is the perfect example of movies where you could easily tell who saw it and who didn't either it inspires a huh? or a big and sincere smile in the face. The film that features a gang of criminal screwups 100 madeinFrance in Chicago the American is so hilarious with the same level of gentleness than other goodhearted comedies such as My Cousin Vinny or Wayne's World that the whole Tarantino or Guy Ritchie's ripoff allegations are absolutely meaningless.To understand the simple but efficient greatness of Crime Spree imagine the opening scene set in the dark. Two thieves are whispering probably because the house owner is there Gerard Depardieu as Daniel and Stephane Freiss as Julien that came to steal a painting one of them brought the flashlight but forgot about the batteries. Why? Because he brought everything that was on the list gloves pen knives except the batteries because they were not on the list. The absurdity of his argument confined to comical genius  wait now as if it was not funny enough there's the third one Raymond as the fat wellmannered getaway driver who joins them because  he felt alone in the car. In one minute we have an idea of the guys we're dealing with.Indeed what is so great about Crime Spree is that the movie never cheats the viewer by delivering something else than laughs even the most unexpected and random gags are inserted not to mention some priceless oneliners. When Daniel's boss Bastaldi remarkably played by Ricahrd Bohringer wants to point out his crew's incapacity he throws a plate at his hands to indirectly signify that they were empty. Anyway he has a mission for them in the States. You speak English? asks Bastaldi in French to which Depardieu immediately replies Yes as if it was the best guarantee that he does. Just imagine the scene in reverse You speak French? Oui. Each gag catches you totally offguard.This attention to little gags redeem the overall Bmovie feel that makes Crime Spree inferior to Pulp Fiction or Lock Stock in a larger scope but it's one thing to say that and another to accuse the film of being a cheap imitation when it clearly has no other ambition to be a funny story playing on cultural gaps if one thing let's not forget that the screenplay was written in 1996 and maybe if it was made in a time where France was more popular remember in 2003 French fries were renamed Freedom Fries just to give you a certain idea of the context. But seriously I'd trade any genuine laughs from predictable gags unoriginal than a timid smile from a film that tries too much on the sophistication.Crime Spree is a raw pleasure with a level of naivety that almost confines to tenderness What makes the film less 'cinematically' great is. At one moment two of the crew join the team Renaud as the laconic Zero the name is so neutral that it's hilarious and Johnny Halliday as Marcel. At one moment they fight to decide which radio station they'll listen to they each want to listen to their own song. The joke is funny because it's so damn predictable when you have two of the most popular singers from France. The film doesn't forget to mock French' culinary habits with a beautiful scene in a restaurant conclude by Zero's comment no smoking no drinking what kind of country is that? At least Brad Mirman spared us the clich with frogs' legs.There is no need to summarize the plot which is a typical gimmick of the crime genre with the intricate plots that gets everyone gets mixed up from a corrupt cop a gang of Mexican hoodlums black guns dealers and to an obligatory Mafia leader. Predictable maybe. But it works. And on that department Crime Spree uses two of the most endearing character actors who starred in the most acclaimed gangster films  Abe Vigoda as the venerable Giancarlo aka Mr. G. and his plotting capo Frankie Zemetti played by Harvey Keitel in a great comedic performance as the no nonsense gangster who takes his business so seriously that he's inevitably hilarious.As the fitting antagonist Zemetti has a deal of good lines to a negotiator who explains that the proceeds will be supernumerary the stares he gives when he hears the word is priceless and naturally he asks what it means. The funny thing is not that the guy used the word because he's taking courses to enhance his vocabulary but that Zemetti uses it the next scene with Mr. G provoking the same what the ? reaction. Still it's nothing compared to his explicit What the F does that mean? after Zemetti explained that he broke his own brother's arm because honor without respect is like a horseless carriage. I can go on and on if there was a Top 10 of Keitel's greatest roles I'd put this one. His wisecracking and interactions with his men are absolutely hilarious  You mean French guys from France?.The plot escalates very fluidly featuring common archetypes of the gangster genre shootouts car chases and even some dramatic moments handled efficiently because we do care for these characters. There's something absolutely endearing in characters that mustn't goof and yet can't help it that's the quality that makes them irresistibly funny with a honorable mention to Said Taghmaoui as Sami the Arab intermediary who's the only one to believe in his toughness and macho attitude. And take it from someone who hate outtakes in ending credits as they kill the very purpose of a film this time it works because the film is so humble it doesn't even ask us to take it seriously... yet we do because it's truly one of the funniest films of the last decade ... and deserves to become a cult comedic classic.".

	schema:headline " Beware of the praise";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is awful. It tries to be funny and fails every time. You can see where you're supposed to laugh you know the intention is humor but it's just not funny. The characters are terribly written. They start off as complete fools and by the end they're devising intricate schemes that come together in entirely ridiculous fashion. But the most painful part of watching this movie has to be sitting through these pathetic attempts at humor.The next point is this splitscreen editing. Some here are raving about it. First of all it's terrible. Second of all why even use it to begin with? Brian De Palma used it to tell a story Norman Jewison used to perfection in the first Thomas Crown Affair. In Crime Spree it just pops up an hour into the movie and then disappears. It's like the editor discovered a new trick on the Avid and then got sick of it before he knew how to use it. Only one of the three splits moved at any given time the other two were static. What's the point? If you want to direct our attention to the only one of the three splits that's moving then don't use a split screen.The director desecrates the masters time and time again. Remember the baby carriage on the staircase scene from De Palma's The Untouchables Crime Spree has the little girl in the hallway scene without one iota of the suspense. How about the great Leone showdowns with Clint Lee Van Fonda and Bronson the close ups of the eyes the tension before the first man goes for his gun. That's here in Crime Spree too. Not the tension or the beauty or the sheer power Leone had of capturing the moment and making it last forever but the close ups of the eyes that say Look at me I've seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly that's there. Then we move to Tarantino right out of Pulp Fiction remember when Jules and Vince escape a barrage of bullets miraculously and Jules is changed forever? Well Crime Spree has that too without the revelation of course.And though not a master Crime Spree also steals liberally from Guy Ritchie as well right down to the bridge scene in Lock Stock. Not to mention the hole in the door shot.This director has seen good movies that's obvious he's tried to copy them. But he has no idea what makes them good. It's like when these bozos in Hollywood decide to remake the old Twilight Zone series. They give you the shell of the old show with some weird premise but with none of the depth with none of the soul of Rod Serling.There is nothing good about Crime Spree. It's bad on every level from the script to the editing to the lighting to the directing and everything in between. I can't believe that of the 260 people who have thus far voted on this movie that 60 have given it a 10. If I could vote from one to and hundred I'd give this a zero. It's truly awful.I just can't believe these other reviews. I think someone's stuffing the ballot box. Anyone who rates this movie anything higher than garbage is suspect.I rented this and Dirty Deeds on the same night and although I didn't think much of Dirty Deeds it's looking Oscarworthy after seeing Crime Spree.".

The characters are terribly written. They start off as complete fools and by the end they're devising intricate schemes that come together in entirely ridiculous fashion. But the most painful part of watching this movie has to be sitting through these pathetic attempts at humor.The next point is this splitscreen editing. Some here are raving about it. First of all it's terrible. Second of all why even use it to begin with? Brian De Palma used it to tell a story Norman Jewison used to perfection in the first Thomas Crown Affair. In Crime Spree it just pops up an hour into the movie and then disappears. It's like the editor discovered a new trick on the Avid and then got sick of it before he knew how to use it. Only one of the three splits moved at any given time the other two were static. What's the point? If you want to direct our attention to the only one of the three splits that's moving then don't use a split screen.The director desecrates the masters time and time again. Remember the baby carriage on the staircase scene from De Palma's The Untouchables Crime Spree has the little girl in the hallway scene without one iota of the suspense. How about the great Leone showdowns with Clint Lee Van Fonda and Bronson the close ups of the eyes the tension before the first man goes for his gun. That's here in Crime Spree too. Not the tension or the beauty or the sheer power Leone had of capturing the moment and making it last forever but the close ups of the eyes that say Look at me I've seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly that's there. Then we move to Tarantino right out of Pulp Fiction remember when Jules and Vince escape a barrage of bullets miraculously and Jules is changed forever? Well Crime Spree has that too without the revelation of course.And though not a master Crime Spree also steals liberally from Guy Ritchie as well right down to the bridge scene in Lock Stock. Not to mention the hole in the door shot.This director has seen good movies that's obvious he's tried to copy them. But he has no idea what makes them good. It's like when these bozos in Hollywood decide to remake the old Twilight Zone series. They give you the shell of the old show with some weird premise but with none of the depth with none of the soul of Rod Serling.There is nothing good about Crime Spree. It's bad on every level from the script to the editing to the lighting to the directing and everything in between. I can't believe that of the 260 people who have thus far voted on this movie that 60 have given it a 10. If I could vote from one to and hundred I'd give this a zero. It's truly awful.I just can't believe these other reviews. I think someone's stuffing the ballot box. Anyone who rates this movie anything higher than garbage is suspect.I rented this and Dirty Deeds on the same night and although I didn't think much of Dirty Deeds it's looking Oscarworthy after seeing Crime Spree.";

If they would've attempted to make this film with unknown actors by an unknown director it probably wouldn't have made it past the script stage. It looks and feels like a generally amateurishly constructed lowbudget independent fare except with big name actors and a big budget.How do big names like Gerard Depardieu and Harvey Keitel get involved in this kind of turd totally escapes me. One would think they had better taste and a sort of responsibility to deliver to audiences worldwide who based on their attachment might just check out this worthless pieces of youknowwhat.

	schema:reviewBody "Crime Spree is a dark crime comedy about a group of French thieves getting into trouble in the US after a job goes sour and this movie is fing awesome! It is amazing that this film got stuck under the radar and almost faded into obscurity.Let us start with two notable participants Harvey Keitel and Grard Depardieu. These two people are a treat to watch and comedy suits them well but it is nice that they do not overstay their welcome in scenes and there is a large supporting cast who also do a good job though some do it better than others. One of the protagonists is Albert Dray who is an obscure actor outside of France but he gets a good amount of screen time and his appearance as a short nice guy really adds to the character of the main group to which he belongs. Another notable appearance is Abe Vigoda as a crime boss. He is not on screen for long but for long enough to be awesome. There is a Hispanic gang member that wasn't even part of any jokes but made me laugh with just his facial expressions and hand gestures.The only problem is that the main protagonists are not very fleshed out. There are quite a few of them and you do not learn much about their background. One of the thief protagonists dies midmovie and I wasn't even sure who it was and when he entered the movie.The dialogue is smart and flows well. The jokes are subtle but still good. Sometimes they hit you 30 seconds after the fact. Sometimes they only work if you understand a little bit about the movie's background or the cultural differences. Perhaps this is another one of the movie's flaws probably prompting a lot of the humour to go over people's heads. The humour would work if all the people involved were really famous and the cultural nuances were all wellknown stereotypes but the movie is at times too subtle and obscure for its own good.Let me tell you something and see if you are still on board. Half of the movie is in French with English subtitles. If you are already hesitating about this movie based on this information then it is probably not for you. It is that kind of movie with a foreign taste and a special peculiarity.Camera work is notably interesting. There is for example a continuous shot of a group of guys moving from room to room as the camera follows them from above going over the walls. No cuts. There are smart shots like panning over into the sky of one city and then panning back down to see another city.In general you can sense the effort behind the film. There is a scene at one point in which one of the thieves needs to steal a wallet from a stranger. The thief bumps into the guy on a street and makes a move for the wallet. Now how would this end in your typical American crime comedy? The thief would skilfully pull out the wallet although slapstick may be involved and the victim would not notice it and would keep on walking. In this movie however the victim does notice and naturally starts running after the thief though in the end the thief still gets wallet. This short chase scene did not need to be added. It takes more effort to add it. However it does feel more natural realistic and in line with the movie's premise that the thieving protagonists are bad at what they do.I heard about the similarities with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but I watched that movie and although it does run in much the same way I like Crime Spree better. I did not laugh once during Lock Stock but I did during this movie. And there are so many movies like Lock Stock now that you cannot call it plagiarism. It is just its own genre now.Crime Spree is a smart movie perhaps a little too smart at times. It does not bring any revolutionary changes to the crime comedy formula but is funny and wellmade and is most definitely recommended.".

	schema:headline " A wonderful journey to the age old classic cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "I seldom review 'fairy tales' because of their speculative nature. Such tales usually take me to an imaginary world for an hour or two and when their effect fizzles out I realize that it didn't work on me as it should have. However this isn't the case with 'Alibaba Aur 40 Chor' released in the year 1979 or 1980. It was a collaborative effort between India and USSR. It was a film directed jointly by Umesh Mehra and Latif Faiziev. The duo would also direct 'Sohni Mahiwal' in 1984 yet another milestone with evergreen songs. Since 'Alibaba Aur 40 Chor' is a 3 hour film we would better look at the characters and their parts in this film.1. Fatima Zeenat Aman She is the daughter of an old and rich merchant Madan Puri who is not only a businessman but also the inventor of explosives! When his caravan is raided by 40 thieves headed by the dreaded Abu Hassan Rolan Bykov Madan Puri and his aides try to stop them with explosives. Successful to some extent the aides finally break down under the might of Abu Hassan who takes Fatima and his dad captive and confines them both in an underground cave. Madan Puri is forced to make explosives for the thieves and Fatima is given charge to arrange stuffs for making bombs. In course of time Fatima discovers that her dad committed suicide and is left all alone to avenge his death. With the help of Alibaba Dharmendra she finally manages to grab Abu Hassan.2. Alibaba aka Ali Bin Yusuf Dharmendra He is a resident of Gulabad a fictional town located in a fictional Islamic State of Baharistaan and a wastrel. He loves to spend time with his beloved friend Hamid. Alibaba is concerned about the wellness of Gulabad and wants to serve the people of his community. Time takes turn when Alibaba's mother Sofiko Chiaureli asks him to look for his father Yusuf who is a trader but hasn't returned to Gulabad in the last 40 years. Alibaba's journey takes him to Baharistaan where he finds that the current ruler Shah Alam Parvez Pinchoo Kapoor has been deposed and killed by his commanderinchief Shamsher Prem Chopra. Alibaba rescues princess Marjina Hema Malini killing Shamsher in the process and they both join a caravan that's heading to Gulabad. He meets his long lost dad Yusuf in the caravan but the happiness is short lived when Abu Hassan and his men attack the caravan and Yusuf is fatally wounded. Ali vows to slay Abu Hassan and his men not really knowing that Abu Hassan is mightier than what people have ever known about him.3. Qasim Zakir Mukhamedzhanov He is Alibaba's elder brother. He is an industrious businessman and runs a store in Gulabad. His greed takes him to Abu Hassan's hideout where he enters using the magical spell Khul Jaa Sim Sim but forgets it at the time he's about to leave. Abu Hassan and his henchmen discover Qasim hiding under the pile of dimes and quarter him. His corpse is hung inside the cave but Alibaba recovers it and gets it sewn by an experienced tailor.4. Marjina Hema Malini She is the daughter of Shah Alam Parvez and the princess of Gulabad. First Alibaba rescues her from Shamsher and then from a lecherous merchant Mustafa Frunze Mkrtchyan when he is about to sell her in the slave market. Marjina becomes Alibaba's trusted friend and lover and helps him in devising a plan to track Abu Hassan down.5. Abu Hassan Rolan Bykov Abu Hassan is the dreaded chief of 40 thieves. He is cruel mean cunning courageous and a great actor. When I say actor I really mean it. Rolan Bykov needs a standing ovation for his part. He has literally lived the character of Abu Hassan on screen. He portrays two different characters in the movie who are not only one and the same but also exactly opposite. Either ways he has justified his part and plays it fairly well. His dialogs are menacing his humors are vengeful his personality his turban his eyes his looks and everything about him is sinister and the manner he magically transforms from one character to another is miraculous. The way he scolds his henchmen and makes them run like rats tells a lot about Abu Hassan's excellent commanding persona. I am so much in love with this man. He has sidelined all the other actors and meets success in making a special place in the viewer's mind.Even though 'Alibaba Aur 40 Chor' has considerable differences from the actual '1001 Arabian Nights' yet it is no boring and is capable enough to take the viewers in the old Arabian world where Merchants Caravan Raiders Magicians Qaazis Haakims and such unique figures used to exist. The part of Abu Hassan has been well handled. The original '1001 Arabian Nights' doesn't have Abu Hassan in it but here Mehra and Faiziev introduced him and thanks that they did. This is indeed a fine example of classic cinema and the lovers of classic cinema would appreciate it. I also appreciate Javed Siddiqui for penning down dialogs that are in simple Urdu unlike Razia Sultan MughaleAzam SikandareAzam and some others and it is also 100 times better than other films with Arabian backdrop like Ravikant Nagaich's 'Thief of Baghdad1977' and 'Shabnam  1964'. The songs are fresh and soothing. Overall a complete family entertainment.".

Nearly all his stories are melancholic tales about the loss of childhood innocence. With a paranormal twist but that really isn't the most important. I even think that Hearts in Atlantis would have worked even better if the whole paranormal thing would have been left out. The most interesting aspects of the story are Bobby Garfield and his relationship with his mother girlfriend and Ted. Whenever Ted brought up the lowmen my personal interest curve got a bit of a dip but hey it's a Stephen King movie I guess we'll have to live with it.As it is Hearts in Atlantis remains a wonderful film. It's the kind of film where the scenes in the present are filmed in gloomy blue and grey tones and all the flashbacks get a golden sepia treatment. Sure it's been done before but rarely have the effects been of such a shattering beauty.Anthony Hopkins never shy of giving a bombastic performance is remarkably softspoken in this one though I doubt that he was really interested in this movie. The star of the show however is Anton Yelchin as Bobby Garfield. He looks like the young Elijah Wood with the same angelic blue eyes and he's truly captivating. He even has genuine chemistry with the girl that plays his love interest. A big fat wow' is in order here let's hope he'll get the chance to exploit his talents further.It's a shame this movie failed at the boxoffice but then again so did The Shawshank Redemption. So let's all rentbuy this wonderful film and boost that IMDb score.I gave this one a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure to be one of the bestloved films of this fall Hearts in Atlantis adapted from Stephen King's best seller mines a lot of familiar territory from Stand by Me but that beloved film is a good model.  In Stand by Me it was a writer reflecting back on the childhood summer when we found the body here it's David Morse as a photographer remembering the summer of his eleventh year when Ted the boarder moved upstairs.  Downplaying King's supernatural elements this film slowly but surely builds to an emotional payoff every bit as moving as the end of Rob Reiner's gem.This is a small gentle film with lots of character development and period atmosphere.  The tech credits such as production design and cinematography are superb and bring to life a time1960which for some of us was not that long ago.  The childactors are perfectly cast and Anthony Hopkins as the mysterious stranger gives one of his best mostheartfelt performances. This guy could read USA Today weather forecasts aloud and make them sound like Shakespeare.  While others may have taken a radically different approach to the material emphasizing action and suspense I think screenwriter William Misery Goldman and director Scott Shine Snow Falling on Cedars Hicks ultimately hit the right notes.  I will interested in seeing if this decidedly lowkey approach strikes a box office chord with moviegoers frazzled by the big dumb summer action films.  If there's any fairness left in the world it will.  It's that good.".

In Stand by Me it was a writer reflecting back on the childhood summer when we found the body here it's David Morse as a photographer remembering the summer of his eleventh year when Ted the boarder moved upstairs.  Downplaying King's supernatural elements this film slowly but surely builds to an emotional payoff every bit as moving as the end of Rob Reiner's gem.This is a small gentle film with lots of character development and period atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King seems to work well with movies.  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS represents the latest adaptation from one of King's novels.  Actually borrowing from two stories it introduces us to a young boy named Bobby Garfield who seems to be living a seminormal although simple life.  His day consists of playing with his two best friends Sully and Carol.  His relationship with Carol is on the fence of being romantic.  Bobby's widowed mother is too focused on her career to notice what's going on with her son.  A strange man named Ted Brautigan Hopkins comes to their small town looking for a place to stay and finds a vacant room within Bobby's house.  Brautigan almost immediately intrigues Bobby offering the young boy a job simply reading the newspaper out loud.  As these two bond Bobby notices his new friend has some strange traits.  Ted fears that mysterious men are looking for him. It's not long before Bobby realizes that his new friend has some unique capabilities and begins to understand why others would be looking for him. In the meantime Bobby deals with his own desire for a dream bike his need to protect Carol from neighborhood bullies and his confusion about his mother's lack of finances despite her fancy dress collection.  No one is perfect in this story just like in real life.  Even the oddly endearing Brautigan seems reluctant to expose his true roots. HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a simple tale that offers nothing new to audiences. It doesn't have the magic exhibited in THE GREEN MILE or the emotional importance of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and although it's similar in feel to STAND BY ME it doesn't seem to match the quaint aspects of that tale either.  Where it succeeds is in it's ability to present the familiar aspects of the youth we've all experienced.  Childhood memories are what make us who we are.  This film helps us to remember those special times. While not all of us met a Ted Brautigan in our lives we can all relate to the troubles Bobby faces or even the victimization Carol endures by bullies.  There are several familiar elements here and that's why it works. Hopkins is appealing as one would expect but the film as a whole plays out in a very tame fashion.  Scott Hicks SHINE has directed HEARTS with simplistic and appropriate fashion.  He never assumes too much from the audience which is an admirable quality for a director.  What you walk away with is a understanding that youth can define you future and memories can have a profound effect toward your outlook on life.  Never judge a book by it's cover.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the many acting skills Anthony Hopkins possesses is the ability to attract and disturb at the same time he can charm you to no end with sly smiles and unspoken allure. But all the while he's hiding something unsettling that you can't ever quite figure out. In Hearts in Atlantis the latest of what by now must be a truly massive box set of Stephen King film adaptations Sir Anthony finds a writer perfectly suited to these unique talents. What we see is a movie eerie and enchanting both in mood and in style  a story that holds onto its cards throughout letting you see each of them slowly one by one and only when absolutely necessary. In the end we find we have been held captive by a stunningly memorable and powerful film.The story begins as a retrospective Robert Morse plays the older version of Bobby Garfield the central character of this reminiscent story. It takes a recent tragedy to send the older Bobby unwittingly in the mind to his days as an 11yearold in 1960. There we go to a place common to almost all of King's stories rural New England where Bobby lives with his mother Hope Davis and spends his innocent aimless days with his two friends Sully Will Rothhaar and Carol Mika Boorem. His father died when Bobby was only five and his mother is so busy hopefully tending to a real estate career that she has little time to tend to her only child. To this point nothing is out of the ordinary this childhood is deliberately portrayed with hazy warm undertones akin to the sense of youth so familiar to many who look back upon it. Fairly early on we meet Ted Brautigan Hopkins a boarder who shows up quite suddenly on their porch his belongings in grocery bags. He is clean wellspoken unobtrusive and generally a placid sort. But he is also an instant enigma he is of unknown origin means and intent and Bobby's mother quickly decides this is a man to be viewed with caution. Bobby on the other hand innocently curious and most likely desperate for anything that could spell the boredom of his uneventful summer decides this a man worth knowing. They become close Brautigan dispersing kennels of wisdom and even offering young Bobby a dollar a week and cold root beers to read him the newspaper daily. But Brautigan clearly has a special quality about him he can sense things and see things that are not readily apparent to most others. Bobby seems to have this gift as well though in a lees pronounced way and through this they form a bond one Bobby's mother slowly and begrudgingly affords him. She's suspicious of this man still while we the viewers begin gradually to glean some of the mysteries of his past. I don't dare say what they are but they do involve the Low Men people Brautigan warns Bobby who may some day come looking for him. He tells Bobby what signs to look for about town gently using the boy as a scout of imminent danger. Bobby does not know who they are or what they represent. Neither do we for a long time but the key instrument of this story is to make it intentionally vague. We are not to be concerned about these details but rather to know that Brautigan has experienced them and will do whatever he can to shield Bobby and his youth from the corrupting darkness looming behind them. Stephen King has been widely read as an author of horror and suspense but his best works like this one work on a much more insidious level evoking a sense of foreboding and unknown that manages to inform everything that happens within. The makers of this film find great success emphasizing the shady murkiness of the story and they still manage to keep things centered. The mysteries of Ted Brautigan find parallels in the wonders of youth Bobby experiences his first kiss naturally encounters a menacing bully and learns to view his mother in evolving ways...grownup ways. This is really a story of innocence and maturity of youth's purity and the dangers that lurk at its end. Bobby finds that end to a certain degree but along the way finds friendship knowledge and a sense of the mysteries of adulthood that await him. Ted Brautigan is really more than a friend to Bobby he is a guide a protector and a teacher. These two actors provide real natural on screen chemistry in this film and there is one delightful scene early on where Brautigan intensely relives for Bobby a glory day of Chicago Bears football lore. This is an actor who can take any available strengths of writing and magnify them for us viewers who watch him say them aloud. As a result Anthony Hopkins anchors this infectious little film to the ground while still allowing it to soar skyward when needed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hearts in Atlantis is an interesting movie. For one it is based upon a story contained within a book named Hearts in Atlantis by Stephen King. But the story is called Low Men in Yellow Coats and the story Hearts in Atlantis has absolutely no bearing on the  movie at all. It's rather unfortunate actually that the film makers couldn't find some way to incorporate all five of King's Hearts in Atlantis stories into the movie. But if they had to pick one  which they did of course  Low Men in Yellow Coats is an excellent choice. And it makes for an excellent movie but the book should be required reading. Some of the complaints about the movie have been that the characters are not well developed. Perhaps they are but as someone who's read the book my mind filled in any gaps so I couldn't say. In fact knowing what was in the story did nothing but  enrich this film. Because the movie was so close to the book the  background information supplied by King's plot filled in all the places the movie could not or would not go. One bad aspect of the movie version however is the elimination of all supernatural elements. Instead of making Anthony Hopkins' character a Breaker from the Dark Tower universe King has created like Brautigan is in the book he is a psychic sought by the FBI to root out communists hey this is 1960 after all. So the string is still intact Of the more than 30 movies based on the work of Stephen King not a single one even mentions the Dark Tower. How unfortunate. The movie itself is simply wonderful especially after dealing with two weeks of absolute crap The Musketeer and Glitter? Hmmm. Anthony Hopkins has the pleasure of two Academy Awardworthy performances in 2001 I don't care Hannibal was still an excellent movie. His performance in Hearts is as understated as Hannibal  was... well... Hannibal. He keeps to himself stays quiet and when he talks he is close to divine. Hopkins continues to prove why he is one of the best actors of all time. Anton Yelchin is simply amazing as little Bobby Garfield. He is the second coming of Haley Joel Osment if not better than he. The plot is good if not great  although with the book already in mind  it assuredly makes any potential holes disappear  and the character development is superb. And isn't that a wonderful breath of fresh air after a summer's worth of movies that were cool and some were even good but overall brainless and similar.For that alone I give it a 10 even if it is perhaps closer to an 8 or a 9. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Elevenyearold Bobby Garfield lives in New England in 1960 with his mother and his friends Carol and Sully. Ted Brautigan a strange old man moves into the rooms upstairs and the two become good friends but Bobby soon discovers Ted is on the run from some sinister figures known only as The Low Men ...This is a charming little movie which doesn't really have much of a plot it's just about a friendship between a boy and an old man. It is extraordinarily rich in character though and the four leads all step into their roles perfectly. It's also an exquisitely wellmade periodpiece of the time by which I mean to say everything looks right  the clothes the hairstyles the cars the furniture and so on  without ever drawing your attention to the fact. It's based on a great book by Stephen King which is really five separate stories with lots of linking themes and characters all centred around the Vietnam war. The movie is really only the first story in the novel Low Men In Yellow Coats so if you want to find out more about Bobby Carol and Sully please read the book though be warned it's not too cheery. Eloquently scripted by William Goldman and featuring a great atmospheric score by Mychael Danna. Beautifully photographed in Virginia by Piotr Sobocinski who sadly died not long after its completion.".

I never read the Stephen King novel that this film comes from but as always King has crafted an intriguing and absorbing story.Anthony Hopkins never disappoints and his performance as Ted Brautigan here is no different. Brautigan lives upstairs from young Bobby Garfield and his widowed mother and a friendship soon develops between Bobby and Ted. Bobby knows that there is something different about Ted and the bond between them grows when Bobby starts uncovering some of Ted's secrets. Bobby's father passed away when he was very young and he has no knowledge of who his father was except the word of his neglectful mother that his father was a drunkard and gambler. Bobby through Ted learns a lot about his father and more importantly himself. I don't want to give away too much of the plot of this wonderful movie especially if like me you have not read the book. This is a thoughtful insightful well written and well acted movie and is definitely a part of my own library.Dont miss Hearts in Atlantis.. you will be sorry if you do!! 810".

I have a theory that when King wrote the story he hoped it would lead to a novel but for some reason or another it was cut short much like the film and book. In the film you are left with no doubt that the Lowmen are real but in the film you never know if it is part of the boy's imagination or if they are police and the old man is on the run from them. The book also focuses on the Supernatural side of the story the film does not and i would suspect makes it feel quite slow for some viewer's. Hopkins is great as usual  as is the boy  Anton Yelchin and the latter has a great career ahead of him. One thing that does come from this is that i usually always enjoy Castle Rock productions is this is no different. 7 out of 10.".

The book delved so much deeper into Ted Brautigan and anyone who is a fan of King's Dark Tower series will appreciate the strong connection. But that whole connection was taken out of the movie. Maybe this would have added too much confusion but I think it would have done a much better explaining Ted's powers and his origin. The book is really collection of related stories and the movie only told the first and the last story. If there were to be a remake it would have to be much longer or split into two parts but the plot would be stronger for it.Other than that the movie is wonderful. The acting is superb as it usually is with Anthony Hopkins. If I hadn't read the book I would have much less to criticize but I'm still glad I did.".

Of course I understand now that there is much more to life then riding bikes and playing games but a part of me wishes I could go back just for one more day.

That sounds goofy but if you watch the film you know what I mean. The only things I didn't care for are the typical Liberal bias with cheap shots against Richard Nixon J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI all bad guys according to all liberal filmmakers. Also some paranormal baloney was inserted and wasn't needed.The kids  Anton Yelchin and Mika Bororem  are good especially Yelchin who has a far bigger role. It's nice to see a kid Yelchin's character Bobby Garfield actually listening to an adult as he does here. The romance between the two kids is handled well not sappy.I very much enjoyed the cinematography. It's a wonderfully richcolored film with a touch of film noir in spots with the cobbled street shots at night.Finally this was a film that moved me with it sadness.".

I thought the balance between the happy memories and dark aspects were well balanced out.I read the short story before seeing this film and thought it worked on film without so much of the supernatural though I think it could have worked both ways.Anthony Hopkins' performance is great as ever...though I may be biased as I am a big fan .  Anton Yelchin gives a fantastic performance as Bobby really shines alongside Anthony.  Also Mika Boorhem as Carol is sublime a very pretty girl standing out.  I also think the casting of David Morse as the older Bobby was very good...his expressions tell everything.So I highly recommend this film.".

This has apparently led him to enormous wins at poker which has made him a target of angry mobsters though this part of the story is left sketchy. The boy senses something special in Ted and their friendship grows to where Ted begins to look out for the boy protecting and guiding him.And so this is filmed in the late 1950s or maybe 1960 judging by the most recent cars and it has a little sweet aura to it all. There is an overlay in contemporary times that is unnecessary though it wraps things up nicely for people who like that. It's all enjoyable but not very deep or even surprisingly very surprising.".

	schema:headline " Absolute breathtaking";
	schema:reviewBody "The one great benefit that any film based on a Stephen King story has is just that it's based on a Stephen King story. The guy is just such a prodigy of fiction that even if the film version of one of his books doesn't deliver one can still see the brilliant blueprint lurking beneath the frames. When the filmmakers are successful however we get a visually stimulating project founded on the tale he has weaved to support all the other elements. Hearts In Atlantis is based on an anthology volume of his and in fact the story the film follows isn't even called that it's actually 'Low Men In Yellow Coats'. I can see why the director went with Hearts In Atlantis though as it's much more akin to the ethereal sentimental tone he was going for and less of an ominous hook. The story itself follows a mysterious man named Ted Brautigan Anthony Hopkins a recent tenant in the home of young Bobby Garfield Anton Yelchin and his wayward mother a miscast Hope Davis. The setting is Midwestern America in the dead heat of a 1950's summer. Bobby spends his days cavorting in the local woodlands with his fastest of friends Carole Mika Boorem and Sully Will Rothhaar. He takes a shine to Ted though who pays him a dollar a week to read to him and warns him of shadowy 'low men' threatening figures who doggedly pursue him for nasty reasons. Ted becomes a father figure for young Bobby whose mother has questionable ideas about not only raising a son but taking care of her own affairs. Now the film may seem a bit thinly plotted to some and there's a reason for that. This story is actually a tiny fragment in a much larger tale King's magnum opus The Dark Tower. Ted and Bobby have important parts to play in that saga in which the events of this film are but a sentence long. Some viewers may feel slighted by a lack of context but the filmmakers here still find a way to make this its own story crafting a touching coming of age story melded with whispers of otherworldly intrigue. The fusion of beguiling nostalgia and the vague menace that advances on Bobby and Ted makes for a unique tone something just south of a thriller which can't quite be pinned down by genre labels. Hopkins can be both terrifying and tender depending on the role. Here he is kindness incarnate as a man whose worldly intuition goes beyond telekinesis into the kind of qualities reserved for the best and brightest. Yelchin and Boorem who would star alongside each other again a few years later in the lacklustre Along Came A Spider are the superb heart of the film. Yelchin has shown a constant progression of strongly realized believable work and the quality of his craft can be traced back to this stunning genesis role. Boorem is highly underused these days and one need only watch her light up the screen with emotional sincerity in this to see why she should be working far more. There's neat supporting work from Tom Bower Celia Weston Alan Tudyuk and David Morse as an older version of Bobby who yearns for days gone by. I found myself deeply enjoying this one whilst constantly drawing back to the knowledge and context I have for it via The Dark Tower but the film on it's own is enough to provide a rewarding experience for anyone who isn't familiar with the multiverse. Amid King's favourite topics and settings are Midwest adolescence idiosyncratic nooks of Americana and the ever present supernatural aspect dynamics which Hearts In Atlantis gives us aplenty along with an open invitation to explore the universe farther should one want to venture along the path to the Tower. I'd recommend it.".

STREISAND HERSELF NOTED THAT THE COLOR TINT ON THE VHS TAPE IS INCORRECT SOMETHING SHE HAD CORRECTED FOR THE UPCOMING DVD this is the type of story about conquering your fears and stop at nothing to achieve your dreams that is fatally missing from films in our present time.If there is an aspect to this movie that is the most formidable it's the music and songs in it that's what is most successful about it since they carry the story as it progresses through its tale of passion love struggle and perseverance.Ignorance has kept the film from being enjoyed and appreciated by several groups and individuals. Hopefully someday they will find the courage and wit to understand such incredible gem.NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE";

	schema:headline " An absolute triumph";
	schema:reviewBody "Streisand's directorial debut is easily her most passionate and personal film to date. It was hailed by Steven Spielberg as the best directorial debut since Citizen Kane and I am in complete agreement. Streisand worked for more than 15 years on bringing this film to the big screen and it was well worth the effort. YENTL is an absolute triumph Every single aspect of the film works flawlessly the story is clever the dialogue is extremely wellwritten the cinematography is beautiful and the performances are firstrate.Many critics and fans found Streisand's performances in A STAR IS BORN and THE MAIN EVENT to be labored and overlymannered. However there is little doubt that she once again emerges as a true actress in Yentl. As a matter of fact Streisand's pitchperfect portrayal of YentlAnshel is quite possibly the best performance of her legendary career  I simply cannot think of any way her performance could be bettered. Broadway tenor Mandy Patinkin is terrific as the object of Yentl's affections it is a role which should have made him a huge screen star. The character of Haddass could have easily turned into a thankless role however Amy Irving brings a layered depth to the part that many other young actresses could have glossed over.YENTL is also showcase for the wonderful music of Michael Legrand with outstanding lyrics by Marilyn and Alan Bergman and the film uses these songs to brilliant effect. There are no production numbers nor singing out in the street. Except for the finale Streisand only sings when she is completely alone or silently as a voiceover. The songs take the place of spoken soliloquies and represent Yentl's private thoughts. This device has a great Shakespearean feel to it and along with Streisand's ever passionate singing help cement the film into the realm of fantasy. Though YENTL was infamously snubbed by the Academy Awards justice was served when Streisand was awarded with the Golden Globes for Best Picture and Best Director the first female to ever win the latter honor.Appropriately for a musical the film's song score is firstrate. Composer Michael Legrand is an unrecognized genius and his score is both complex and inviting. Alan and Marilyn Bergman have penned the lyrics to many of Streisand's bestloved recordings the 1 hits The Way We Were and You Don't Bring Me Flowers just to name a few but they really outdo themselves here. Their words and Legrand's music complement each other perfectly and their collaboration is largely the reason the film's score is as consistent and as cohesive as it is. However the main factor to YENTL'S artistic success is the phenomenal vocal performance of Barbra Streisand. The songs for this film were recorded twenty years after her official studio debut and she has never sounded better than she does here. Whether the tone of the song is anguished Where Is It Written Tomorrow Night euphoric This Is One of Those Moments or incredibly sensual The Way He Makes Me Feel Streisand's hushed restraint and dramatic range are nothing short of incredible. Her phrasing is put to excellent use in Will Someone Ever Look At Me That Way and the three renditions of No Wonder each with different lyrics and a different meaning while both No Matter What Happens and A Piece Of Sky are terrific showcases for Streisand's astonishing vocal prowess. YENTL also marks the first appearance of Papa Can You Hear Me which instantly became one of Streisand's signature songs due largely to her intensely soulful performance. YENTL is a motion picture that is very close to the heart of many Streisand fans. It is a project that Streisand believed in with all her soul and both the film and its soundtrack remain near the top of the list of the best things any popular artist has ever done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yentl is based on the story Yentl the Yeshiva Boy by the late Isaac Bashevis Singer the last great Yiddish author. Yentl is the bright intelligent daughter of Reb Rabbi Mendl a widower played by the great Nehemiah Persoff. She looks after her father's household and almost by osmosis learns the Torah Pentateuch and the Talmud by listening to the lessons of the young men who come to study with her father. She also wants to become a Jewish scholar but in the rigidly patriarchal society of Eastern European Jewry only boys are allowed to study. After her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get into a yeshiva school. Now going by the name Anschel she succeeds in getting into a yeshiva and becomes close friends and eventually falls in love with fellow student Avigdor Mandy Patinkin Avigdor is Hebrew for father protects who is in an arranged betrothal to a beautiful young woman named Hadass Amy Irving. But when Hadass's family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide the wedding is called off. YentlAnschel is then selected to marry Hadass. Avigdor supports this because he sees this as a way to remain close to his friend Anschel Yentl and Hadass. YentlAnschel goes through with the marriage and manages by clever subterfuge to live with Hadass but never consummate the marriage or reveal himself to be a woman. Eventually YentlAnschel and Avigdor go away for a few days and YentlAnschel reveals her secret to him. But rather than accepting her as a woman and returning her love Avigdor rejects her. Avigdor returns to Hadass and the movie ends with Yentl on a ship to we suppose America to make a new start where presumably she will change her name to Fanny Brice and become a big star in vaudeville then years later as an old woman be reduced to visiting Max Bialystock's office for some lovin'.Visually Yentl looks perfect. The village the landscape the people their language and dress are a convincing reconstruction of the lost world of the shtetl and its denizens. The actors look perfect too although there are problems It's a stretch to believe that Barbra Streisand could pass herself off as a boy for an extended period but if the Hilary Swank character in Boys Don't Cry could do it I guess we can suspend disbelief for the duration of Yentl. Streisand puts in a capable performance as do Mandy Patinkin and the actors in the other major roles. You have to figure that Hadass was pretty dumb to be hoodwinked the way she was but I guess that's supposed to be part of the charm of the story.However Yentl suffers from a major problem The music. What cabbagehead decided that Michel Legrand would be the right composer for this movie?!? His score was completely inappropriate and Streisand's constant singing under the action drove me crazy. Barbra shut up once in a while and let the action speak for itself! It was like Fiddler on the Roof collides with The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and that's the kind of road accident I'd rather not see. I suppose that in order to get the project made Streisand had to agree to sing in the film. Would making Yentl into a typical musical  la Fiddler have ruined it? Probably a whole lot less than it was ruined by Legrand's music. After all Fiddler which came out 12 years before Yentl had a number of dark moments as well as some light and humorous scenes and the songs worked. But the score of Fiddler on the Roof deliberately used musical motifs and themes derived from and inspired by the rich musical tradition of Eastern European Jewry. They should have stuck with that very serviceable approach. The clash of the music and the rest of the film is a fatal flaw from which Yentl does not recover.".

	schema:reviewBody "A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough Yentl a girl interested in studying the Talmud wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off. Yentl now calling herself Anschel is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. YentlAnschel and Avigdor go away for a few days and YentlAnschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to and marrying? Hadass and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long but there are several things that ruin it. For starters there is the constant SINGING. I can already hear the critics shouting. Yes I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voiceover. Only one song stands out from the rest Papa Can You Hear Me. It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren't necessary. Second Streisand's makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the YentlAnschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even Hadass into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn't think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair. Nevertheless in the 1900s if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country. Therefore the feminine makeup on Streisand does not lend to the character's credibility and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful it should have been scrapped. Thirdly when YentlAnschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custommade vehicle for Streisand to fuel.Lastly there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities I am not a fan of her style of singing. However I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like so I am not a hater nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie  several times even  and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear selfabsorbed and thus turn the film into a laughfest unworthy of her fans or audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough Yentl a girl interested in studying the Talmud wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off. Yentl now calling herself Anschel is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. YentlAnschel and Avigdor go away for a few days and YentlAnschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to and marrying? Hadass and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long but there are several things that ruin it. For starters there is the constant SINGING. I can already hear the critics shouting. Yes I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voiceover. Only one song stands out from the rest Papa Can You Hear Me. It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren't necessary. Second Streisand's makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the YentlAnschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even Hadass into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn't think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways.

And don't even get me started on the plot. You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible. The rampant ego of Streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame him.

A lot of character interaction and a very good study of human nature. I was both impressed and moved by this work. The only reason I gave it a 9 was the very long length of the film. However I could not pull myself away. The interaction of the characters was done very well. The family sitting at the dinner table speaking of the day's events and the progress of herhis studies of Holy Scripture were dissected talked about and learned at the table. What a paradox from the current day's common house hold with the Television on or near the dinner table. We are entertained instead of interacting with our family.Restricted from possible learning and potential closer relationships with family membersthat could play an important role in our future especially if one of the children of the family.The movie is somewhat deep and very emotional.

This basically has good clean if silly humor.I admit most of the movie had me rolling my eyes but I did keep watching. I actually did laugh a few times towards the end the reactions of a woman being interviewed on the street were very funny and it was fun seeing Russell and John Ritter so young. Also Flynn has his moments as does Harry Morgan as the president of the network. North is sweet but not TOO sweet as Jen and look for Bill Daily at the end. And the chimp was adorable! So it is silly and predictable with a title song that makes you want to cut your ears off...but it's perfect for the kids. I give it a 5.".

Somewhat silly harmless fun it is not hardhitting and has really no deeper meaning or social commentary. One could if they wanted point to the jokes about monkeys picking what we see on TV. But that is not exactly deep satire.Kurt Russell was alright early in his career but it seems like this was an even bigger showcase for John Ritter. As Ritter's first film he does not get a large amount of screen time but certainly makes the most of each line he delivers.".

	onyx:emotionText "A young man who works in the mail room at a TV network wants to move up the corporate ladder but finds himself stymied by his selfish boss. By chance he discovers that his neighbor's chimpanzee has a knack for picking successful TV programs.This is classic Disney all the way. Somewhat silly harmless fun it is not hardhitting and has really no deeper meaning or social commentary. One could if they wanted point to the jokes about monkeys picking what we see on TV. But that is not exactly deep satire.Kurt Russell was alright early in his career but it seems like this was an even bigger showcase for John Ritter. As Ritter's first film he does not get a large amount of screen time but certainly makes the most of each line he delivers.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I was born The Disney Company released 'The Barefoot Executive'. The BE does a fairly good job managing the TV station. For starters it has employed a young Kurt Russell. What a delight to witness the early career of so great an actor who has given us great movie treasure's such a 'Big Trouble in Little China' and 'Executive Decision'. He may have gotten older and fatter but is still a class act.Along for the viewing experience is John Ritter who makes his acting debut. Interestingly when I was young I was not allowed to watch 'Three's Company'. Harry Morgan from M.A.S.H. is on hand to deliver yucks as the grumpy TV president alongside with McHale's Navy's Joe Flynn. The film has some other talented actors and also stars a Chimp named Raffles.  That's funny... 'cause they're monkeys! Homer Simpson The movie centers on Raffles uncanny ability to pick out what TV shows the public will like and which they will not. Raffles informs Kurt Russell's character Steven Post of this inside information which he uses to raise himself to the top of the TV executive world. Forget about such schlock as 'Cavemen' 'Emeril' the sitcom and the latest reincarnation of 'The Bachelor' and concentrate on 'Heroes' 'Lost' and 'The Office'. Steven Post even has ideas of his own. One of his show ideas is a TV program entitled Abe Lincoln's Doctor's Dog.' This was an actual episode on 'Screen Director's Playhouse in 1955.Most fake TV shows in movies tend to be so badly produced it seems very unrealistic and unlikely that anyone in the real world would ever want to watch them. It is possible however that someone would actually green light such horrid programming. For this very reason it was probably a wise idea to keep the story focused on the people who were in charge of the programming and not the programming itself although the few clips one sees of the TV shows talked about are standard looking TV show clips and promotion for such Disney classics as the 'The Shaggy Dog'.The movie has very many funny and wacky moments and makes it worth a movie rental and maybe even a place in the family library. But there are a few glitches in the TV screen. When Kurt Russell's girlfriend catches him with her kidnapped chimp he gives her a sweet apology and explains the real good for himself that came out of the deceit he has pulled on everyone around him. For the sake of moving the plot along she seizes from being majorly being cheesed off at him and accepts his weak apology with a smile. For some reason I thought there was to be a great slapstick chase at the end of this film and for that reason I was a tad bit disappointed in the ending. Although the greedy TV executives get what they deserve in the end I thought the ending deserved a little something more.Although not perfect 'The Barefoot Executive' is worth turning on. It was remade as a TV movie in 1995. This version has not been deemed worthy to be released on either VHS or DVD. But you have the original one to watch and enjoy.".

Joe Flynn was funnier than in any episode of McHale's Navy in which he played a similar character. His crabby confused exasperated behavior and expressions throughout the film just made me roll. Starts out kind of slow and campy with a silly plot. I thought at first just another squeaky clean shallow 70's family movie. But the film really starts to get funny when Kurt Russel's character realizes that the chimp can pick the winning TV shows. As Russel tries to sneak the chimp into the TV preview room the scenes of the chimp going up and down the mail dumbwaiter are great. The interaction between Flynn and his chauffeur Wally Cox are hilarious. The chimp's reactions when a very young and very funny John Ritter sneak into the apartment are great. When Flynn Cox and Ritter spy on the chimp and the resulting kidnapping scene on the building ledge it just absolutely cracked me up! Lots of comical sight gags and facial expressions in this movie. A very funny moment that's easy to miss is when Flynn is eating a banana soon after hearing a Doctor expert theorize that bananas are brain food  one example of great humorous satire throughout the movie. Bill Daily has a brief but hilarious part towards the end. A great and appropriate ending wraps it all up in a neat package which I won't reveal  all very funny!".

	schema:reviewBody "In this FrenchGerman production Luc and Gaston get a job as bus drivers in order to hit on girls. One of them I forget which takes a girl called Marguerite to a fancy restaurant where they cannot afford anything on the menu. So they fake food poisoning and are sped to the hospital without paying. During the night he steals a nurses uniform in order to escape. All this happens before the actual plot gets started but it shows you what kind of movie this is. It's all about getting everything for free by taking advantage of others. Your typical comedy heroes.Now Marguerite has missed her train so the boys 'borrow' a bus from their fat slob of a boss to drive her and four girlfriends from Nice to Kitzbhel. They forget to take along any money food or even their passports but since all of them are natural born bullshit artists they can always dupe other people into paying for them or giving them things for free. Along the way they pick up another couple of low life liars claiming to be DJ's who add nothing to the proceedings. So now there are 4 guys and 5 girls on the bus but since 3 of the girls are quite plain none of the guys show any interest in them at last a hint of reality. There is too much lame disco dancing along the way and some slapstick ski action after they arrive in Kitzbhel but at least it never gets boring.

Also included is the usual sub plot about the girls' clumsy coach trying to catch up with them and predictably two bank robbers show up near the end to show that the lead characters are not so amoral after all all. They all become hero's when they help to catch the real baddies. Didn't every comedy in the eighties end that way?4 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "In this FrenchGerman production Luc and Gaston get a job as bus drivers in order to hit on girls. One of them I forget which takes a girl called Marguerite to a fancy restaurant where they cannot afford anything on the menu. So they fake food poisoning and are sped to the hospital without paying. During the night he steals a nurses uniform in order to escape. All this happens before the actual plot gets started but it shows you what kind of movie this is. It's all about getting everything for free by taking advantage of others. Your typical comedy heroes.Now Marguerite has missed her train so the boys 'borrow' a bus from their fat slob of a boss to drive her and four girlfriends from Nice to Kitzbhel. They forget to take along any money food or even their passports but since all of them are natural born bullshit artists they can always dupe other people into paying for them or giving them things for free. Along the way they pick up another couple of low life liars claiming to be DJ's who add nothing to the proceedings. So now there are 4 guys and 5 girls on the bus but since 3 of the girls are quite plain none of the guys show any interest in them at last a hint of reality. There is too much lame disco dancing along the way and some slapstick ski action after they arrive in Kitzbhel but at least it never gets boring.

This is a novel plot based on the painful partition after independence in the late 40's. It looks so realistic to the point that no other current hero could have aced this role like Sunny Deol did. It is NOT aimed at running down Pakistan because Sunny Deol's Sardarji character is married to a Pakistani girl after he saves her from attacks as he believes in humanity. All he wants to do is keep his family together as one. Sunny Deol brilliantly fights hard to save the day and cow down his inlaws. People should understand that like his dad Dharmendra Sunny Deol has that fire intensity and command unlike that overrated SRK! Anyways watch this and enjoy it! 1210!".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie apart from having a good story good performances and good direction also has reflected upon reality.I was not expecting much from this movie. But that turned out to be the best part.Pakistan was a part India before 1947. It was created on the basis of religion and hatred. That hatred has not settled down still and probably never will. It was at its peak immediately after the Britishers left.How do the Pakistan politicians exploit the religion and hatred against India to their own advantage is shown in the movie for real. Even educated and openminded Pakistanis have accepted and appreciated this. Apart from the reality point of view this movie has some visually great scenes like the one where Tara escapes to India from Pakistan in a goodstrain. Nice work by the team as a whole.The story starts with how there was hatred and killings on both the sides during partition. And how the girl Sakeena Ameesha Patel is separated from her family in the chaos of so many people moving from either sides to the other. She being left alone in the opposite side results in the people trying to molest her. Tara Sunny Deol stops people from doing that to a girl separated from her family. He has to bear the brunt of opposing his own people for someone whose people have killed and tortured women of his sunny's own. But he sticks to his.Love blooms between this uneducated poor truck driver and the educated rich girl and they get married and have a son. After years of Sakeena living in the ignorance that her parents are dead she sees a picture in a local daily newspaper that shows her father to have become a prominent political figure in Pakistan. She has a desire to go meet her parent and Tara has no objection to it. But once she reaches her parents they use her to earn political mileage by projecting her as a brave girl who fought against India's tortures for years and finally returned to her homeland.She is shocked to know that she is not allowed to return to her husband and son. Even Tara Singh the husband is denied visa to Pakistan.The movie then shows how a insignificant truck driver Tara has to fight the powerful bureaucracypolitical figures to get his wife back to his home. His trauma and bravery are very nicely shown.The wellknown loud verbalexchanges between Sunny DeolAmrish Puri in this movie are too good to miss.A must see for all those who don't have a clue as to what happened during the partition era.I give it 8 out of 10.".

There were two people who put this masterpiece of a movie together Anil Sharma and Nitin Keni not necessarily popular names like Satyajit Ray and Raj Kapoor but the sheer brilliance of the production the reconstruction of the authenticity of the period reminds me of David Lean production. It is difficult to relive part of the history that should be long forgotten but to recreate this history is the genius of the director in this case Anil Sharma. Sunny Deol as Tara Singh is a performance of a life time for this actor whose talent has been under estimated and then we have Non Indian and idiot actors like Aamir Khan have been over estimated and put on a pedestal by morons of Mumbai media and these imbeciles for a cup of garam chai will worship anyone like pied pipers. Very few Hrithik Roshan Abishek Bachchan can portray the raw emotions and bring a certain velocity to the character as Sunny Deol does here. He is matched by another thespian Amrish Puri who is just an Volcano of talent. A new comer by the name of Amisha Patel who gives a soulful sobbing stellar performance. She has subtlety and depth to her gaze and a femininity of emotion she brings to this character. Overall this is a masterpiece that will be tough to be outdone.".

Indeed this film seems to suggest that the Sikhs and by extension perhaps the Hindus as well are more benevolent compared to the evil Pakistanis who kill without question. then again Tara saves Sakina only because he knew her from an earlier period and had developed feelings for her. For all its biasness perhaps a silver lining is a scene where Sakina asks Tara why he saved her when he was out on a hunt for Muslims like the other men who were trying to capture her. On the whole however this film seems skewed at a time when other filmmakers are painstakingly trying to convey a notion of amity between the two warring countries.one such film is Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi's film Pinjar 2003. this film gives a more balanced perspective of the partition and suggests that the blame cannot be pushed to just one actor. if one needs to get a better understanding of this cataclysmic event watch Pinjar. if one prefers to rejoice in bashing the Pakistanis for being evil then Gadar is something for you. But do not for one moment think that this is the story to believe. It is only a biased account which seeks to poison minds more than mend ties between people who never knew what was coming their way when they bought the national interests of their leaders.".

One of the reason I watched this movie was because I was very interested about the history behind the separation of Pakistan from India. Although I will need to watch some documentaries to get an accurate picture this movie showed the brutalities and struggles that occurred.

He even kicks a metal jail door Indian and kicks a moving car far away Teesri Aankh. I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. But even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesn't. Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim but she doesn't act like one in the movie. Overall this is a poor show all the way I'm sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys. Give me a break.".

The mother dies soon afterwards. An ape enters the house and kills the father and a female ape takes the tiny boy as a replacement for her own dead infant and raises him as her son. Twenty years later Captaine Phillippe D'Arnot discovers the man who thinks he is an ape. Evidence in the tree house leads him to believe that he is the direct descendant of the Earl of Greystoke and thus takes it upon himself to return the man to civilization.";

	schema:reviewBody "After I first saw this I thought Wow this is the most spectacular movie visuallyspeaking I've ever seen. Since that time I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. I'm just disgusted the longawaited DVD was so poorly done the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape.The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon and lush is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds seeing is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no hearing no dialog until Tarzan Christopher Lambert befriends Ian Holm and viceversa....so be ready for that if you haven't watched this film. Storywise all I'll say is this is not the Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller films.....but that's not a complaint. For those craving action and don't care about cinematography as I do you just have to get past that silent introduction period In this Tarzan version our hero goes back to Scotland his roots adapts to that environment for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility frankly and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burroughs's famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen til one's thirst is quenched notably during the thirties and the forties by Hollywood. Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. Several years later Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkeyman and it's a more natural more wild and more downtoearth Tarzan that he gives away here. Hudson skilfully avoids the clichs that you usually grant to Tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet Cheetah. Not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories. The movie was partly made in Africa more precisely in Cameroon. The movie introduces two obvious parts the first one which takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends the apes and considers himself as their lord. But he ignores his real origins. The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society. Ian Holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and Hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay. Indeed Holm teaches Lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the English society and the result works. Moreover in the second part noone ever laughs at Tarzan and he's even really appreciated. As far as the end is concerned well it's a both bitter and happy end. Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives. But bitter too because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line won't be ensured and is condemned to disappear... Christophe Lambert finds here his first and last? great role. Sadly he'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he'll play in poor and insipide action movies. Nevertheless as I said previously a clever screenplay a performance of a rare quality some impressive natural sceneries both the jungle and the English country and we get a gorgeous movie. It's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel. So why is it only rated barely 610?".

	schema:headline " Tarzan as Burroughs intended!";
	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recounting of the Tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories.Tarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds  the natural and the civilized. In a stunning performance Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. If he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag the audience especially the adult audience targeted by the film will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip. It will plummet into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never lets that happen. Forget what you may think of him in other movies when I saw this film at the theater on its original release I thought he deserved an academy award.The supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them in that I didn't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I wouldn't have nominated her for an academy award  the role is undemanding  but she is completely up to it such as it is. I don't know why her voice was overdubbed either.The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vivid.But this is also a period film and the cinematography also magnificently depicts Victorian England  the countryside the city and the interiors. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive.There are some disturbing scenes  especially for animal lovers  but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature personified in the young Lord Greystoke convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.".

His reversion to ape behaviour in moments of emotional stress is funny and touching.  Ralph Richardson's potrayal of the Sixth Earl is full of humour and subtlety only to be expected from a master of the art. Ian Holm again a masterful performance. They put Andie MacDowell to shame.The first half is mainly in the jungle and is fascinating to watch.  A huge amount of research about ape behaviour is put to entertaining use. It comes to a close when some amusingly nasty English explorers and a disdainful Belgian appear in the jungle. The second half when Johnny Lambert is introduced to Victorian society touches on what it means to be 'civilized'. He meets his grandfather and is expected to take his place in society but then discovers what society is like.A great adaptation and an entertaining film.".

They bring him back to Victorian England where he meets his real family and is educated to join the civilised society where he should have grown up if he hadn't been shipwrecked all those years ago. In an ironic touch he realises that civilised people are actually more barbaric than his ape family and in the end he returns to where he truly belongs.The audiences seem divided over this one. Some love it others hate it. My view is that it is mainly a very good film nicely performed and photographed with an interesting and mostly convincing script. I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that certain scenes are a touch unintentionally funny but aside from that I rank this film quite highly.".

All the actors in the movie did a great job..the jungle scenes are beautiful and the original score is a masterpiece.   9 out of 10";

I have seen this movie several times and still enjoy it. Although i find Christopher Lambert a mediocre actor in most of his films i feel that he shines here a good idea to let him speak in his native French accent cleverly written into the script by means of the Belgian explorer who finds himinstead of making him put on a bizarre accent and it works well. Ian Holm and Ralph Richardson are fantastic and moving but McDowell spoils it again and most of her scenes are irritating to watch. Some of this movie was actually quite upsetting the taxidermy labs and the scene where the apefather is shot but very well done. The scenery is fantastic and the musical score is brilliant and stirring. Great makeup effects for its day. This movie is well worth watching give it a try you might be pleasantly surprised!".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably the most serious and realistic adaptation of Tarzan I've seen. The first act is great. The harshness and grittiness in the tone was a great way to set the mood. The second half is good and has some better moments but it doesn't hold up as well as the first half and leaves the film a little anticlimactic.The development and exploration of JohnTarzan's character is well thought out and the performance was really believable. Ian Holm is fantastic in the film as his friend and the journey they make together should have been explored more. Going into the film i expected to see a film where Tarzan defends his animal friends from evil humans in the jungle but I got a very grounded and simple film about a man trying to adapt into a life he naturally wasn't raised for. The duality and having to choose between the two lives is an interesting concept but it leaves it unresolved in my opinion.There are some very dramatic and sad moments here too. The bond between the apes and the man is felt more than the bond between humans sometimes. The apes have their cheesy moments but there's also really strong and emotional moments too. The detail in the costumes switches around a bit. The best compliment to the ape costumes I can give is that the eyes where done so well that I actually thought those were real ape ayes.There are even some scenes that deal with the human beings desire to kill and rip apart other animals like dissecting hunting and chaining them up. Seeing those things from Tarzan's perspective was a bit haunting and heartbreaking and you feel the conflict.Some great performances great first half gritty  grounded moments are all strong points but it loses steam in the second half and drags on a bit for too long and leaves you feeling unresolved. The film also lacked more tension and intensity towards the end which would have picked the whole thing up and made up for the calmer moments. I like calmer films but it really builds up to something exciting to happen and it never does.Still it's probably the best adaptation of Tarzan I've seen and the one who truly makes you feel the tragedy of this truly sad and haunting tale. It ain't as light as you might expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in Scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad I couldn't watch some of it. However this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn't understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldn't be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible. I do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle.Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of Tarzan role as was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's ultrarich nobilityreeking gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's gussiedup and civilized Jane in her first movie role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in. The terrific Ian Holm as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in Scotland was great as always.I am so glad Tarzan got sick of and didn't stay in the animalcruel civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1984 Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes stars Christopher Lambert in the title role with Andie MacDowell as Jane Ian Holm as his French friend D'Arnot and Ralph Richardson as his likable grandfather who's nearing senility. James Fox is on hand as Tarzan's stuffy high class nemesis in Scotland.One thing that sets Greystoke apart from previous Tarzan flicks is that the filmmakers were determined to depict him the way Burroughs did in the books as an extremely intelligent talented man who happened to growup with a tribe of apes and not as a dimwitted wild man who had a hard time construing five proper words in a sentence. Lambert was only 26 during filming but looks  acts more mature and perfect for the role. This is a more realistic version of the ape man moving away from the whole me Tarzan you Jane clich that presumably started with the Weissmuller flicks which explains why the movie's called Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan and not Tarzan... The first half is the best part shot on location in lush West Africa and presumably some parts in the studio although you can't tell. While the apes are people in ape costumes they look amazingly realistic particularly considering Planet of the Apes came out a mere 16 years earlier. The progress made with FX in that short time is amazing fifteen years later and CGI would take over most FX. There are a number of great scenes like Tarzan's fighttothedeath with the ape leader and D'Arnot's introduction to Tarzan with a couple of curious apes behind him causing D'Arnot to pass out.The second half switches to Scotland and this is where most people have a problem with the film. They say it's too slow blah blah blah and they're right to a point. I think the last discussion at the mansion before going back to Africa could've been cut almost entirely. After all by this point we've already seen Clayton Tarzan confront Fox' character multiple times with intimidating animal sounds. So it was redundant and unnecessary. Nevertheless I think the second half reveals a lot of characterdefining stuff about Tarzan His loving kinship with his grandfather his defense of the lowly his uncanny intelligence  talents his compassion for encaged creatures his passion for Jane and his reviling of the pompous.MacDowell is fine in the role even stunning and I didn't even know she was dubbed by Glenn Close until someone pointed it out which shows they did a quality job with the dubbing. MacDowell is one of the reasons the love scene works so spectacularly possibly my favorite love scene in the history of cinema. She and Lambert had great chemistry.The ending is a turnoff until you think about it MILD SPOILER Tarzan's rejection of his ancestral estate in Scotland is akin to him rejecting Western Civilization in general. I'm assuming that Jane would decide to later join him in Africa. Too bad there wasn't a sequel I should add that 1998's Tarzan and the Lost City is SAID to be a sequel of this film but it lacks Lambert and MacDowell in the key roles plus it's mediocre by comparison yet still worth checking out if you're a Tarzan fan.The film runs 143 minutes and was shot in Cameroon Africa and England.GRADE A keeping in mind that Tarzan is my alltime favorite fictional hero".

	schema:reviewBody "A bit of an oddity this a few years ago I read through the original Burroughs novel and was eager to find out how this adaptation held up. The answer is that it follows the story in the book extremely closely  especially in the first half  depicting events with a kind of vicious believability that's miles away from the chestbeating vineswinging Tarzans of old.It's not entirely accurate  there's far less of that grisly business involving the hostile tribesmen  but what I saw I liked. The apes are played by men in pretty convincing suits and watching Tarzan growing up to become lord of the jungle is a lot of fun. In addition to that the film plays an ace in the casting of Ian Holm as the Belgian captain who 'civilises' Tarzan. Holm gives a subtle mannered quite excellent performance one that's filled with emotion and is the best in the entire movie.That's not to say that Christopher Lambert as the title character is bad. It's a memorable debut turn carefully judged and entirely physical. He gets the movements and mannerisms of a jungleborn man just right which is why it's a shame that the ridiculous decision was made to rub him over with animal noises. If he's angry a lion's roar comes out of his mouth etc. The filmmakers rely on such things a lot especially in the second half and it's a real shame.That's not the only problem with the second half. Once the action shifts to England the pacing slows right down and the film feels devoid of incident. Andie MacDowell is fairly uninteresting in playing an insipid Jane and even a final unexpectedly touching turn from Ralph Richardson fails to liven things up. As I remember this part of the film deviates quite substantially from the book and it suffers for it. Basically we get an hour of Tarzan wandering around his mansion and it's all rather depressing. It's a shame because earlier on a great deal of effort was made to bring those jungle scenes to life and it all fizzles out at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edgar Rice Burrough's classic character of John Clayton Viscount Greystoke aka Tarzan Lord of the Apes springs vividly to life in the most accurate celluloid rendering of the original novel Tarzan of the Apes given a somewhat more unwieldy title here  the only demerit against this spectacular adaptation.Christopher Lambert of Subway and Highlander fame heads a cast of luminaries such as Ian Holm and  in sadly his farewell performance  the late Sir Ralsph Richardson as Tarzan's grandfather Earl Greystoke. With superb direction by Hugh Hudson following his Oscarconquering Chariots of Fire we are swept from the bleak moors of Scotland to the primal uplands of equitorial Africa and back again as we follow ClaytonTarzan from his birth to shipwrecked aristos through his youth amongst the great apes and to his return to and disillusionment with Western civilisation. A young Andie McDowall gives her debut performance as Jane Porter of Me Tarzan you Jane fame although that line is not uttered here or indeed in any Tarzan story or movie much to the amazement of many with a vocal performance dubbed by Glenn Close.Some of the greatest performances in the movie however come from the apes themselves or rather the performers portraying the apes. The scenes of the young Tarzan cradling his dying ape mother and later the adult Clayton discovering his ape father caged in the back of a museum are extraordinarily poignant. No wonder Tarzan rejects the bland soulless and vicious humans to return to the wild life among the apes the simian characters show more humanity than some of the people on display here.I have seen some commentators calling this film pretentious usually whilst championing earlier Tarzans such as the Johnny Weissmuller efforts of the '30s and '40s. All i can say to that is if it is pretentious to actually stay true to the original text and character then there is something strange going on. That's like championing Adam West's Batman over Christian Bale baffling.This is a superb movie and certainly the best portrayal of Burrough's story and characters on screen thus far. I simply can't see it being bettered any time soon unless someone picks up the rights and does straight adaptations of Burrough's original novels and stories. I can't see that happening somehow so i'm more than happy to stick with this.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Greystoke Lord of the Apes' has received a lot of ridicule over the years and it certainly is a bit hard to take especially in the first half hour when John Clayton is being the ape boy in the jungle in West Africa. His 'mother' ape has facial expressions that cross the line of the ridiculous and is a highly risible thing to view. Aside from that it isn't too difficult to accept the fantasy of this story which is exactly what it is... fantasy. The fantasy of the perfect human male 'half Earl of Greystoke half wild' as John says at the end. Christopher Lambert is wonderful in this role his international film debut. Beautiful sympathetic dangerous and highly appealing throughout. It's a shame the producers decided to dub in a smarmysounding Glenn Close over Andie MacDowell's performance. It is the one really huge blot on the film. MacDowell looks wonderful and though she is not the world's greatest actress I can't imagine her vocal performance being any worse than Ms Close's insipid performance. This was also Ralph Richardson's last role and he is an appropriately dotty Lord Greystoke always a pleasure to watch. The other fine performance is from Ian Holm as Philippe the explorer who discovers the apeman and takes him back to England.The cinematography is spectacular especially in the African scenes. The music is a bit too slurpy but Elgar's tunes fit the mood very well overall. There are many touching moments in this movie a real tearjerker in a couple of places which are not overdone thanks mostly to the committed performance of Mr Lambert.It's a good one for the kids over about 8 years of age and a good flick to watch on a rainy weekend afternoon when you just can't take any more reality. A good antidote to the recent familydividing elections that have just taken place.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is both an entertaining and a touching version of the classic tale also quite intelligent not of the 'Me Tarzan You Jane' school at all.It's the famous story of a child reared to manhood in the jungle by apes. A titled British couple the wife pregnant is stranded in the African wilds after a shipwreck. After the parents' deaths the baby is raised in the jungle by apes. Twenty years later this young man i.e. Tarzan rescues a wounded Belgian explorer nursing him back to health. The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful estate in Scotland where he must adjust to civilized society. The movie is sort of divided into two parts. In the first half we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert I am unaware as to the realism of its depiction of ape community life but it is certainly entertaining. For me the more moving section is the second half when Tarzan must meet his real family develop language skills and adjust to aristocratic British society all the while wooing Jane Andie MacDowell. He is portrayed as a 'noble savage' whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian parlors. By contrast the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the jungle Tarzan left.Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of Tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments. He conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict torn as he is between the two very different worlds his original ape family and his new human one. Sir Ralph Richardson one of the old British legends is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather the Sixth Earl of Greystoke. The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits. This unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure but also above all a moving personal story. I wasn't surprised to note here that its director is the same individual Hugh Hudson who also directed Chariots of Fire another brilliant movie.".

I know I had already touched on this before but I just don't think all the hate on this movie is justified. It's coherent from beginning to end all the lines are delivered well and it's very goofy. Not to mention the cgi isn't half bad as well.Overall it's definitely a fun movie with a few small flaws.

Also this person stated his kids found it boring is this a kids film?? not really. One more thing there are quite a few saying this film was not very intelligent...have you watched crank 2?? if you expected to watch a film with an intelligent plot and intricate story lines watch death note this may satisfy thirst but then again it probably won't.

I agree that they could have cut out the useless mature sights and words that left the kids out because it would have appealed to them. We particularly loved the scenes between Farrell and the obviously more intelligent Dino. Danny McBride was sweetly silly too. The female actress was okay as eye candy for the guys. All the criticism on this site is for people who place stock on what others have to say. Happy to say we avoided these critics.

Yes it's goofy and silly but I think a lot of the negative reviewers here are people who were fans of the original and are judging thru the haze of nostalgia. The original was every bit as goofy and ridiculous it's just that this movie has the good sense to acknowledge it. And yes it may not be appropriate for very young viewers as there is some sexual innuendo and cursing but it does have a PG13 rating so I don't know why you would be dragging young children to it anyways...'Land of the Lost' starts with a quirky and oddly arrogant scientist played by Ferrell claiming to Matt Lauer on 'Today' that we can solve our energy problems by tapping into interdimensional blah blah blah. Of course no one believes him but a beautiful student from England Friel who convinces him to build his whatsit to open the portal to other dimensions. And of course they soon find themselves trapped in what appears to be a large dumping ground for interdimensional portals along with a yokel McBride. From there it's just a journey across this strange land to find their way back home.I realize I'm glossing over a lot of details here but you really don't need to know them. The whole point is to get a kick out of the satire and broad physical shtick as they encounter the bizarre inhabitants of this world and react to them. If you don't get too hung up on the logic of it all and just roll with the jokes I think it's quite good. And Ferrell who I have often disliked in previous works because of his tendency to gnaw on the scenery was reserved enough to deliver a good number of very funny scenes.In short don't go to this expecting a children's film a summer action flick or something akin to the original. And as with almost all Ferrell movies don't go if you don't like physical humor. But do go if you are looking for a pleasant hour or two of goofy gags and simple fun.".

It doesn't deserve the rap it's getting and if this is the movie Sid and Marty wanted then that's fine with us. It's their creation and we enjoyed their take on it. I can't help but think that a more serious treatment might have been more pleasing to hardcore fans like us but a film has to span the masses so we understand the direction they went.

It doesn't deserve the rap it's getting and if this is the movie Sid and Marty wanted then that's fine with us. It's their creation and we enjoyed their take on it. I can't help but think that a more serious treatment might have been more pleasing to hardcore fans like us but a film has to span the masses so we understand the direction they went. Now bring on the Sony H.R. Pufnstuf movie!";

I think a 5 or 6 is quite reasonable unless you love Will Ferrell.I tried I really tried to watch the original Land of the Lost when it was on but it was obviously for kids about 612 boys and girls that being fairly older than that late teens to early 20's I just couldn't get into it. I mean a park ranger and his two kids? A poor man's Lost in Space. I turned it on several times I really remember all the creatures but the stars faces are lost to me! The problem I have with this is that I think the writersproducersdirectors were torn between what audience to appeal to  fans of the original Land of the Lost who would be in their 40's  50's or young boys 1216.So they made a movie that really didn't appeal to either. Just fans of Will. Fine. I get the zaniness of the movie. Three lovable losers. Pratfall after pratfall. But the dino urine turned me off. I get it you didn't have to hit me over the head twice more the second dose the uh yeah!.But I suppose what really turned me off was reading that two of the original stars were given cameos and then cut. Sorry that tells me the writersproducersdirectors didn't really love the original how could they they must have been about 3  or less!  when it originally aired!. Part of the appeal of nostalgia is tossing out little appreciations to the original fans  like cameos. Because they axed them to me it meant they also axed the original audience.I get the humor sarcasm satire but it didn't do much. 5 is much better than 1 but it's only a soso comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Land of the Lost is another in a long line of old TV shows lazily packaged into summer movies too dumbeddown for fans of the original show and nothing all that memorable for those younger viewers coming into it for the first time. There is no doubt it will join the class Bewitchedwhich Will Ferrell also was in Dukes of Hazard and Wild Wild West of films so bad that they make The Brady Bunch Movie look like the BenHur of the genre. There is just zero reason to care about anything in this movie. Will Ferrell you should have known better. Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall a paleontologist disgraced by what others call his nonsensical theories about spacetime vortexes. The only one who cares to believe him is Holly Cantrell Anna Friel a research assistant from one of those fancy British universities who encourages him to keep working on his tachyon thingiemajigger a device that finds tachyon particles that somehow allow people to jump between worlds. They find the most amount of the stuff in a crappy little souvenir shop run by a redneck named Will Danny McBride and before they know it Marshall Holly and Will are traveling back to another dimension that's all desert. The place is complete with TRex creepycrawly bugs a bunch of things from our world littered about like a stretch limo Bobs Big Boy and Golden Gate Bridge and a primate named Chaka Jorma Taccone who befriends them and helps them navigate their way back to their dimension. What needs to get lost is the screenplay by Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas. When Matt Lauer playing himself is the funniest thing in a movie you know that something went horribly wrong. The laughs are childishly inane. Ferrell is forced to embarrass himself considerably in one scene drenching himself in and yes even drinking dinosaur urine. Dino poop and gross insect infections also get high regard. Then you have Chaka a supposedly lovable primate who's big comic bit is molestation. Hilarious! And this is the biglaugh stuff. The rest is hard to even remember. That this movie manages any chuckles at all is due to Ferrell and McBride's improvisation abilities. Ferrell is the arrogant goofoff and McBride the brash sidekick but they're facing an uphill battle with this screenplay.And the plotwait what plot? And what character development for that matter? It's all very basic aimless and easy to follow except you'll be too bored to do so. Characters run around like idiots dinosaurs and insects chase after them not much happens. And when not being chased the aimlessness doesn't stop it just gets more persistent. A scene where Marshall Will and Chaka sit around in a stupor getting high off of some coconut drink yes this is a family movie is unbelievably drawn out unnecessary and above all pointless. Finally in the third act the Slestaks reptilian villains bent on world domination start to put their plan into effect but even then it's too little too late to care. The special effects are cheesy. I'm assuming that was the plan cause the show was the exact same way but what you can see at home for free and what your willing to pay for are two different things. A dinosaur against an obvious green screen isn't much fun and little green reptilian men in obvious costumes and masks that barely move other than to open and close their mouths are hard to take seriously. Land of the Lost is just lost misguided in every way starting with even deciding to make the movie in the first place. It deserves to be shunned and left to be the summer's first big boxoffice bomb. Ferrell McBride and Matt Lauer are the only things that keep it from being horribly unwatchable but not from being one of the very worst of the summer and the year thus far.".

	schema:headline " Stupid and uninspired mess with a horrible script that doesn't leave Will Ferrell and Co. a chance!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film as the title suggests is affiliated with the famous children's TV Series Land of the Lost from the 70s which was about Rick Marshall and his two children Holly and Will who got stranded in a strange and mysterious worlds where time and space collided. Now this take on the story is a parody on the original story with the same basic concept but a more humorous storyline.I have never seen the original TV Series but I doubt it would have made too much of a difference. Land of the Lost is without a doubt one of the worst films of the year 2009 especially considering that I actually thought the movie looked pretty decent in the trailer. I will never know how such an interesting and original concept was screwed up so badly and turned into an unfunny and pointless mess.Dr. Rick Marshall is ridiculed on national television after he suggests the existence of time warps that could be used to solve the worsening energy crisis. Reduced to teaching science classes at elementary school Marshall drops his theories until Cambridge student Holly shows up at the school and urges him to test his tachyon amplifier a device that can create the necessary energy waves to open those gates. They drive far out into the desert where the crazy redneck Will is running a cave entertainment park. While giving them a rafting tour through the cave Rick and Holly get the tachyon amplifier to work and the three fall down a massive waterfall. When they wake up they find themselves in the middle of a desert right next to a Viking ship proving Rick's theory of an alternate dimension where the past present and future collide. Unfortunately though they lost the tachyon amplifier and now can't get back home to prove to the world Rick's been right all along. After the saving a primate from being sacrificed by his own people the little monkeylike creature named Chaka reluctantly guides them through the strange land of the lost which is inhabited by green aliens large dinosaurs and filled with objects from the human world.Several words can be used to describe this film among them being uninspired dull pointless and unfunny. The entire movie pretty much consists of the three main characters stumbling from one enormous mess into another which for one reason or another doesn't turn out to be so dangerous after all. If you try really hard you might find the attempts of creating a plot once in a while but all in all the entire thing is just all over place and never seems to find a point of focus. First the dinosaur appears but when that plot line is finished after around ten minutes the aliens are introduced about halfway through the film and they of course have the incredibly evil master plan of conquering the universe. The humor which includes several sexual references is childish and ridiculous with many of the lines often not fitting with the scenes they are said in. And when the primitive monkey man Chaka has grabbed Holly's breasts for the fifth or sixth time I just got really tired of it. To be fair I laughed about half a dozen times in this film once when Will Ferrell pours dinosaur urine all over himself in order to cover his human smell. It's really quite amazing how such a disaster was created with a 100 Million budget and a director like Brad Silbering who made Casper and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events both great and inspired movies. Most of the blame here can be put on the writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas who both don't have too much experience writing comic dialog and most of the punch lines just completely fall flat. Those unfortunately occur at least two or three times a minute and it's just painful to see that if the script had been completely rewritten dialogwise the film could have been so much better.I'm really not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell since most of his comedies tend to be hit and miss and often don't really work for me and this film without a question belongs in the category complete miss. Surprisingly though I don't think Ferrell is really the one at fault and if once again the script had been better this could have been the perfect role for him. But here he just stumbles around and has absolutely no chance against the horrendous words coming out of his mouth. The same goes for Danny McBride who is the expert of sexual humor in this film or at least he was probably supposed to be. While I thought he was amazing in Tropic Thunder last year in here he pathetically fails at being funny. Anna Friel's role is not really a very comic one in the first place and since she's incredibly serious among the two idiotic men accompanying her there's not really that much bad stuff that can be said about her performance. Jorma Taccone though as the primitive Chaka is just plain awful because even though he doesn't say too much all of his attempts to be funny are somehow related to sexuality and that's just not really my kind of humor.Land of the Lost was definitely the biggest disappointment of the summer and I actually really enjoyed the trailer which literally contains all the funny moments of the film. Will Ferrell certainly didn't do himself a favor by taking on this role even though it would be unfair to bash him alone for the failure to deliver a solid movie here. While Land of the Lost is not the worst film of all time which is mainly due to the fascinating sets the absolute majority of it was catastrophic and it would have been better if the entire project would have landed in the land of the lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having never seen an episode of Land of the Lost it is hard to judge the film as anything other than the next entry into the hall of zany Will Ferrell comedies. He plays Dr. Rick Marshall a scientist laughed off the Today show for his theories regarding alternate dimensions and periods of time flux. A few years later a budding doctorate student named Holly Anna Friel convinces him to continue his research into the idea and going on a hunch inside a grimy water trail lead by the obnoxious Will Danny McBride. Sure enough the group end up in a totally different time where dinosaurs roam amongst apehuman hybrids and creatures referred to as Sleestaks.It sounds needlessly complicated and unfortunately for Land of the Lost it comes off as trying to hard in many areas. On one hand it wants to throw a bunch of scientific terms and ideas at the audience to try and claim it has some semblance of being smart but then takes it all back by inserting a whole plethora of jokes involving poop breasts drugs and homosexuality. Apparently somewhere along the line of production the cast and crew missed the memo about how unfunny and unoriginal these jokes are in 2009. Sure some of them are fairly amusing and a few are laughoutloud hilarious but many of the jokes are used throughout the movie over and over again in the same ways. Apparently they missed the memo about beating a dead horse at the same time.There is a lot of obvious camp sprinkled throughout the film but that does not give it an excuse for feeling so stale and undercooked. Many of the jokes not involving anything mentioned above are totally hit or miss there is no middle ground to be found at all. And of course the film is a grand showcase for Ferrell to play another clueless idiot thrown into a totally unrealistic situation. While his shtick has not worn as thin as the work of comedians like Jim Carrey Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller albeit the latter two seem to be on a career rebound as of late it is starting to lose its appeal rather quickly. And while McBride holds his own for the most part Friel and a nearly unrecognizable Jorma Taccone of Lonely Island and Saturday Night Live fame are forced to endure through Ferrell acting through one ridiculous idea after the other. I found myself so divided over the jokes that I actually became baffled at why so many audience members in the preview crowd thought the film was such a riot.McBride is actually the saving grace for the film. He nails almost every line and reaction perfectly continuing to cement his status as the obnoxious and pompous jackass supporting character. He never resorts to the foolish heights Ferrell puts himself through even during a silly drugfueled sequence that drags itself out for far too long and seems very content at playing the absurd straight costar. While his attitude is a bit overwhelming at certain intervals he just has too much charisma not to be liked on screen. He believes in his character and he makes it shine from beginning to end.But while the opening bit and many of the jokes are a mess I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of adventure that takes place throughout the film. It feels like an extended chase film at certain points especially because of the Tyrannosaurus Rex constantly gunning for Ferrell but it manages to slow itself down to really allow the audience to take in the ideas it is trying to explore and get across. There are some highly extravagant and clever ideas on display here and when the film wants to it really allows the camera and the audience to appreciate and take all the interesting things in. But since it blows through the majority of its running time when it is not stalling on certain sequences these slowdown moments come very few and far between.The special effects are also quite marvelous to look at. Although the entire film looks like it needed a lot less green screened effects there is still plenty of obvious effort put into the creatures that show up during the film. The showpiece of a Tyrannosaurus Rex is incredibly detailed and downright terrifying in some instances. It is not the game changer like the TRex in Jurassic Park was sixteen years ago but it still looks relatively magnificent. The makeup effects to bring the apehuman hybrids and Sleestaks to life are just as good if not better. What I did not like was how fake many of the effects look. I imagine this was done specifically to align it with the show but some are so glaringly bad that the filmmakers should have put in more work in the post production to make them look a little more realistic. After being horrifically disappointed in the graphics in XMen Origins Wolverine I was not expecting another film to appear so soon that looked like it needed more effects work. I was wrong in that assumption but at least the effort was put in here to make them look great nonetheless.I was not expecting a lot out of Land of the Lost but parts did surprise me. I did laugh quite a few times and while they work to mixed effect the special effects and makeup are amazingly well done. But there is still plenty wrong with the film whether it be the messy opening the offthewall pacing of the film the bad jokes or Ferrell himself. It wants to be a better movie but it does not seem to know how to do it. Relying on McBride as a crutch can only work so much.510.".

I was never a Will Ferrell fan and to be honest and this movie was exactly what I expected it to be.....a waste. If you want stupid pranks and people doing stupid things just watch MTV. I think next time I see Will's name associated with a movie I will go and watch something else.

In fairness the MPAA rated this film PG13 and explains that it contains crude sexual references but the previews make this look like an actionadventure movie. Additionally Farrell's character makes a completely unnecessary blasphemous comparison of himself to Jesus on the cross. I know that Farrell is an acquired taste. I thought he was great in Stranger Than Fiction but he is back to wideeyed stupidity in this film it is not funny and the film does not work. I predict long lines of parents asking for refunds and feeling misled by the trailers. This film may accidentally have a big opening weekend but expect sharp declines in week two as word gets out about this stinker.".

Its themes run deep and leave a lasting impression on the viewer. The story grabs its audience and doesn't let go until everything is resolved. There is not a whole lot to complain about this film. It has a great story and great characters is artfully thematic keeps a sense of humor and still has room for some great fight scenes.This time around Tsui Hark's focusing a little more on characters sweet action and a little story development pushing the film two twoandahalfhours. Unlike other long martial arts films this one somehow never gets boring. Obviously it does have its slow moments but with the cool fight scenes and interesting characters you tend to forgot how much time has passed.Set in the early 1600's the film follows a group of poor villagers as they get the aid of 5 skilled swordsmen to help fight against an evil general and his army of bounty hunters. All of a sudden a new government has been established banning any use of martial arts and evicting anyone who's practicing them. This is rather just in order to prevent any contingency of uprising and the ultimate overthrow of the actual empire. In the vein of the classic 50's Japanese classic Seven Samurai the skilled swordsmen and a couple brave villagers fend against the army and hope to take down the new law. The plot thickens as we learn that as they flee the village there may be a traitor among them not only leaving clues to the enemy but also is about to impair wellestablished selfrighteousness of the peaceful society. Which brings up the relevant question which unified group of people can survive their enemy? or the villagers themselves? I was really astonished by what was accomplished here. The romance characters and extremely well shot action. But what truly caught my attention was the quality and artistic creativity of the quite genius editing. I think to admit that this is just another addition to the previous classic films featuring similar main theme 7 warriors defending the hapless villagers i dare to say that this film can rank as the very best of them. Maybe still not on the worldwide scale today but i fairly believe this film will once slowly grow up as one of the greatest masterpieces of the world cinema.If you have a passion for cinema this film is a gift. If you just like going to the movies then this film will cure your insomnia. Better to spend your cash on Last Holiday and let true cinema nerds like me take in this masterpiece.Thank you Mr.Hark. I look forward to your next masterpiece... a 15 years from now?!".

My favorite characters would definitely have been the Wind Fire and Chu. Each character had a sad part of their life that made them so much human. The action although very fast paced made the viewer feel as though they were part of the fight and the moves much more realistic than flying to the top of a building.

	schema:headline " Tsui Hark is back";
	schema:reviewBody "Not sure if I can call it a misfortune but director TSUI Hark certainly faces the predicament of having made Mountain Zu. For those who have watched it it is difficult not to fall into the thinking of well if he could do this in 1983 what wonders will he be able to do in the 21st century. It's a tough benchmark.Zu II 2001 was a disappointment flashy but little else. In 7 Swords however director Tsui finally got it all together again and for a good reason. Zu a fantasy without a really strong story was sustained essentially by the novelty and dazzling special effects. Zu II despite Tsui's attempt still lacks a good story to sustain it and ends up with special effects that look quite hollow. 7 Swords on the other hand has good human stories.Although 7 Swords is inspired by Leung Yusang's novel and characters it's nowhere near to following the complex stories in the novel. It follows rather the familiar plot of seven heroes leading a group of oppressed against the oppressors as in Seven Samurai as in The Magnificent seven and most recently as in King Arthur.In such ensemble stories the lead characters do not dominate the entire plot. Reasonable coverage is given to a large number of other characters and their stories.The storyline between top billed Leon Lai as second sword Yang Yunchong and Charlie Yeung as Wu Yuanyin a village girl who becomes one of the seven is delightfully simple and natural. It's rather Yang's own history that carries for a while as a mild suspense and I like the refreshing theme of no revenge.Unlike many Hong Kong movies that follow the fashionable trend of having a foreign Korean or Japanese actor playing a Chinese character through dubbing Kim Soyeon from Korea is cast to play a Korean slave girl Luzhu speaking Korean. Donny Yen's character first sword Chu Zhaonam is originally a Korean. I don't know if the Korean portion of Yen's lines are dubbed or spoken by himself but it's most probably the latter judging from the voice. In contrast to the gentle barely perceptible affection between Yang and Wu the passion between Chu and Luzhu is fiery.Added to this is village girl Liu Yufang's infatuation for Chu which briefly interrupts her relationship with fianc Han Zhiban who has become one of the seven swords. Another of the seven swords loner Fu Qingju played by veteran martial artist Liu Chialiang has his own painful history which made him vow never to kill again. The remaining two swords are younger characters who have not been given a particular story of their own but have characteristic that make them recognizable.Other than Kim the cast is split between actors form Hong Kong and the Mainland of China. This is a well balanced ensemble with no weak link. My worry that Leon Lai might be a bit too contemporary in looks proved unfounded as he certainly came though with a solid Yang Yunchong. As for Charlie Yeung this is not her first martial art appearance but I doubt if many will remember Wong Karwai's Ashes of time in which she plays a minor and nonfighting role. In Seven Swords Yeung has delivered a very likable simple village girl turned expert swordsman.Donny Yen and Kim Soyeon have the chemistry to fuel the strong emotion portrayed in their story. The two most notable in the Mainland cast are Sun Honglei who plays the villain Firewind and Zhang Jingchu who plays Liu Yufang. In particular Zhang reminds me of top Taiwan actress Renee Liu who in her younger days would have been perfect for the role which Zhang handled very well.In addition to these main ones there are a lot more characters and stories to cram into the 140 minute movie. Overall director Tsui has managed to keep good track of this proliferation of characters stories and events through crisp editing and occasion montages of flashbacks to recent occurrences. Those looking for breathtaking photography will not be disappointed. The background music does its job the way it should. Action sequences are well designed. Director Tsui has put it all together in this very respectable epic. Tsui Hark is back.".

It's rather Yang's own history that carries for a while as a mild suspense and I like the refreshing theme of no revenge.Unlike many Hong Kong movies that follow the fashionable trend of having a foreign Korean or Japanese actor playing a Chinese character through dubbing Kim Soyeon from Korea is cast to play a Korean slave girl Luzhu speaking Korean. Donny Yen's character first sword Chu Zhaonam is originally a Korean. I don't know if the Korean portion of Yen's lines are dubbed or spoken by himself but it's most probably the latter judging from the voice. In contrast to the gentle barely perceptible affection between Yang and Wu the passion between Chu and Luzhu is fiery.Added to this is village girl Liu Yufang's infatuation for Chu which briefly interrupts her relationship with fianc Han Zhiban who has become one of the seven swords. Another of the seven swords loner Fu Qingju played by veteran martial artist Liu Chialiang has his own painful history which made him vow never to kill again. The remaining two swords are younger characters who have not been given a particular story of their own but have characteristic that make them recognizable.Other than Kim the cast is split between actors form Hong Kong and the Mainland of China. This is a well balanced ensemble with no weak link. My worry that Leon Lai might be a bit too contemporary in looks proved unfounded as he certainly came though with a solid Yang Yunchong. As for Charlie Yeung this is not her first martial art appearance but I doubt if many will remember Wong Karwai's Ashes of time in which she plays a minor and nonfighting role. In Seven Swords Yeung has delivered a very likable simple village girl turned expert swordsman.Donny Yen and Kim Soyeon have the chemistry to fuel the strong emotion portrayed in their story. The two most notable in the Mainland cast are Sun Honglei who plays the villain Firewind and Zhang Jingchu who plays Liu Yufang. In particular Zhang reminds me of top Taiwan actress Renee Liu who in her younger days would have been perfect for the role which Zhang handled very well.In addition to these main ones there are a lot more characters and stories to cram into the 140 minute movie. Overall director Tsui has managed to keep good track of this proliferation of characters stories and events through crisp editing and occasion montages of flashbacks to recent occurrences. Those looking for breathtaking photography will not be disappointed. The background music does its job the way it should. Action sequences are well designed. Director Tsui has put it all together in this very respectable epic. Tsui Hark is back.";

This film is different Tsui Hark has included enough backstory for the main characters to explain their motivation. I felt like I understood what was behind their actions and that allowed me to be part of what they were going through. The action sequences were exciting and sometimes brutal but they were only there to provide jeopardy for the victims and motivation for the heroes to act and overcome the dangers. Constant danger is also the context for the final climactic fight scene. Honglei Sun who plays FireWind is a superb bad guy with an arrogant sense of humour. I found myself understanding that he too had some sadness and tragedy that was driving his cruelty. Something else that strikes me about this movie is that I felt I was in amongst the action  rather than watching it from a distance. Zhang Yimou's Hero and House of Flying Daggers were very beautiful but more like theatre where the audience is definitely separate and a little distant from the action. Seven Swords is more immediate and that makes it a stronger film I think. In short it is an epic story set in an unforgiving landscape a struggle where courage and integrity fight against greed and brutality.".

Solid acting job by all involved.MinusDue to the cutting form 4hr footage to 2 hr some of the subplot all totally underdeveloped and should have been cut altogether to make the story flow better I'm sure with the extra footage it would be more cohesive.I didn't see all of the bad guys die there were at least 2 of the 12 henchmen unaccounted for by the end of the movie again don't know if the 4hr version accounts for them.I don't mind the different accents but when the supposed characters from the same village speak in wildly different accents that is very annoying. Kind of like trying to make me believe someone with a southern drowl grow up with a guy with a south philly accent doesn't work no matter how you cut it. Not enough blood! No seriously! I don't want it like Kill Bill where blood was shotting out like jet stream but when you cut so many necks and limbs with major vessels they got to squirt a little right?Despite all its faults this movie makes me want more stories from its world know more about the characters and more sequels.

This is not a film this is a documentary of the history and the very beginning of the Wuxia culture and heroism in general and you are invited to the fictional world that is frighteningly reflecting our own. I was amazed at how staged and stylized scripts acting editing and action have become and how this director seemed to say so much with so little words.

In the end this film will reward such audience with an unforgettable experience that can sometimes appear only once in a lifetime.On a side note evidently there's a lot to look forward to upon hearing that along with the sparked enthusiasm by the producers and audiences alike and the recent reports of the preparation of a number of sequels this film officially marks the beginning of the new wave of martial arts moviemaking in the 21st century.".

	schema:headline " Another masterpiece from Tsui Hark";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything from the characters swords romance action scenery editing wonderful dialogues art direction is enormously memorable to me. I saw the film at the Toronto film festival last year and since then i still could not put so many of these details especially the characters and images out of my mind. What i started to more appreciate in this film with the coming years is quite neglected and unprecedented in swordplay movies the strong emphasis on the characters background and development which has ironically become the most distinctive and memorable mark of this film. One can feel how the Seven Swords background abounds with those remarkable ideas and touches that could be witnessed only in dozens of Tsui Hark's other works. If there's anything that will make this awesome film stand out it's that innovative technique because i have quite simply never seen anything like this before and i have a collection consisting of nearly thousand Asian films including the martial arts Chinese historical dramas and many other genre classics. However i have to admit that i was quite disappointed by this film the first time i saw it but is a little surprising to me how this film truly grew upon me this movie simply gets better and better and i'd do anything to take back what i said about this film a couple of months ago. Although it must be admitted even though a bit late by me that Tsui Hark has finally gained back his magical touch and what's the most important that he showed an indescribable improvement over the last years so as many others i have to honestly applaud him for this achievement as well. Undoubtedly he's not only returned to his form but is very possible that he's much better than ever before. I am completely blown away by every image framing and lighting not to mention the spiritual heart and poetic meaning hiding behind them carrying a true sense of cinematic power. Although what i always admired about this guy is definitely his originality and innovative ideas. I think it'd be quite relevant to mention his infamous working method as well Tsui Hark is very often infusing his basic framework which is usually the traditional Chinese story fairytale novel.. whatever he wants to remake by his own original ideas always reflecting the current social values and atmosphere and through this artistic combination of the past and present he's systematically modernizing that for the new generation. I think this is quite unprecedented working method in order to being constantly groundbreaking and at the same time preserving the Chinese traditional values for another generations. This is why the whole repertoire of his is usually comprised of the remakes of or ideas taken from the classic Chinese films that are slowly losing the touch with the modern time. Interesting to note that Tsui Hark's loose usually very original remakes have been much more successful at the audiences than their predecessors but that certainly has a lot to do with their exposition to the mainstream as well. He's keeping the Chinese legacy alive. And it's also no surprise he's being usually called a champion of the Chinese nationalism and culture. I just wanted to clarify what some people still don't understand.Note If Wong Kar Wai thought his 2046 was art or stylish he should have engaged Tsui Hark's skills and team to shoot it. Once again Wong could have learned from him. After all who do you think started as the first in HK using the whole combination of meditative voiceovers scattered storytelling visual metaphors stylized cinematography moral sermonizing and political allusions the lastminute revisions during postproduction developing subplots into main plots nonsync dubbing to inject additional meaning though WKW does this only just to provide continuity and belief that the unmade incomplete version is the better version  Yes Tsui Hark. Then who do you think was more successful at the audiences with this technique Yes Tsui Hark not Wong. This is just my little hatred and lesson centred at some stubborn freakish WKW fanboys and moviegoers who apparently know only 15 years old movies at most.It might as well be interesting to note that the renowned Wuxia writer Jin Yong stated on many occasions that no one has adapted to screen any one of his works sufficiently. Although he explained that Mr.Tsui Hark was the only filmmaker to this day who was successful at the audiences with these adaptations but only at the expense of the personal vision and fully original approach rather than a conformity. The reason why so many Yong's adaptations failed is that his stories are very complicated long and feature far too many characters. Therefore Jin Yong stated that Tsui Hark as many others never got too much out of his novels! This is just in response to some of the people i found here who intentionally? badly misinterpreted Jing Yong's claimings.Take into consideration that Liang Yu Sheng the writer of the Seven Swords novels was all the time at the forefront of the whole production of this film to take care of the film's faithfulness to his original novels.

	onyx:emotionText "Everything from the characters swords romance action scenery editing wonderful dialogues art direction is enormously memorable to me. I saw the film at the Toronto film festival last year and since then i still could not put so many of these details especially the characters and images out of my mind. What i started to more appreciate in this film with the coming years is quite neglected and unprecedented in swordplay movies the strong emphasis on the characters background and development which has ironically become the most distinctive and memorable mark of this film. One can feel how the Seven Swords background abounds with those remarkable ideas and touches that could be witnessed only in dozens of Tsui Hark's other works. If there's anything that will make this awesome film stand out it's that innovative technique because i have quite simply never seen anything like this before and i have a collection consisting of nearly thousand Asian films including the martial arts Chinese historical dramas and many other genre classics. However i have to admit that i was quite disappointed by this film the first time i saw it but is a little surprising to me how this film truly grew upon me this movie simply gets better and better and i'd do anything to take back what i said about this film a couple of months ago. Although it must be admitted even though a bit late by me that Tsui Hark has finally gained back his magical touch and what's the most important that he showed an indescribable improvement over the last years so as many others i have to honestly applaud him for this achievement as well. Undoubtedly he's not only returned to his form but is very possible that he's much better than ever before. I am completely blown away by every image framing and lighting not to mention the spiritual heart and poetic meaning hiding behind them carrying a true sense of cinematic power. Although what i always admired about this guy is definitely his originality and innovative ideas. I think it'd be quite relevant to mention his infamous working method as well Tsui Hark is very often infusing his basic framework which is usually the traditional Chinese story fairytale novel.. whatever he wants to remake by his own original ideas always reflecting the current social values and atmosphere and through this artistic combination of the past and present he's systematically modernizing that for the new generation. I think this is quite unprecedented working method in order to being constantly groundbreaking and at the same time preserving the Chinese traditional values for another generations. This is why the whole repertoire of his is usually comprised of the remakes of or ideas taken from the classic Chinese films that are slowly losing the touch with the modern time. Interesting to note that Tsui Hark's loose usually very original remakes have been much more successful at the audiences than their predecessors but that certainly has a lot to do with their exposition to the mainstream as well. He's keeping the Chinese legacy alive. And it's also no surprise he's being usually called a champion of the Chinese nationalism and culture. I just wanted to clarify what some people still don't understand.Note If Wong Kar Wai thought his 2046 was art or stylish he should have engaged Tsui Hark's skills and team to shoot it. Once again Wong could have learned from him. After all who do you think started as the first in HK using the whole combination of meditative voiceovers scattered storytelling visual metaphors stylized cinematography moral sermonizing and political allusions the lastminute revisions during postproduction developing subplots into main plots nonsync dubbing to inject additional meaning though WKW does this only just to provide continuity and belief that the unmade incomplete version is the better version  Yes Tsui Hark. Then who do you think was more successful at the audiences with this technique Yes Tsui Hark not Wong. This is just my little hatred and lesson centred at some stubborn freakish WKW fanboys and moviegoers who apparently know only 15 years old movies at most.It might as well be interesting to note that the renowned Wuxia writer Jin Yong stated on many occasions that no one has adapted to screen any one of his works sufficiently. Although he explained that Mr.Tsui Hark was the only filmmaker to this day who was successful at the audiences with these adaptations but only at the expense of the personal vision and fully original approach rather than a conformity. The reason why so many Yong's adaptations failed is that his stories are very complicated long and feature far too many characters. Therefore Jin Yong stated that Tsui Hark as many others never got too much out of his novels! This is just in response to some of the people i found here who intentionally? badly misinterpreted Jing Yong's claimings.Take into consideration that Liang Yu Sheng the writer of the Seven Swords novels was all the time at the forefront of the whole production of this film to take care of the film's faithfulness to his original novels. From the very beginning there was written the socalled Seven Swords bible containing more than what ended up on this film which was under Yu Sheng's guidance as well. Reportedly at the screening of this film Liang Y. Sheng was extremely satisfied with the result and its accuracy. So it seems that his presence during the production was worth it after all.Also remember that this film was just one seventh at the very least of the whole giant volume comprised of several generations stories themes intrigues characters and many more that form all the novels this planned saga of films is going to be based on! I'm also very confident that this film can't even work just as much on its own as only a part of all seven films.";

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Swords is a movie like no other. You cannot look upon it or compare it to just a regular film. It is so much more than that. It is a martial art film sure but at the same time it is also a true piece of art!! Tsui Hark is a genius in filmmaking and delivers us a truly unique movieexperience in this uncommonly well made movie. He gives us a rare sense of humanity and love and displays naked feelings vividly and honestly to us letting us feel them ourselves without the use of wornout clich's. Even quite uncommon is that the action here drastically subsides to the background and letting us concentrate more on the human relationships and psychological development of these unique swordsmen. In fact in terms of the characters' depiction and development this is arguably much better than Seven Samurai. With amazing technical artistry which is mainly highlighted by the powerful music and very sharp editing Tsui Hark manages to say so very many things with the use of so very few words. However this movie may though not suit everyone. It is extremely special and you need to have a mature viewingeye and patience. You have to appreciate movies not just as mere entertainment but also as the works of art. If you open your eyes sit back relax and take in the power and majesty this movie will astound you letting you leave the room having grown on the rich experience it gives if you let it.Seven Swords is a wonderful Wuxia film that carries with it the segregation of the public and modern materialistic time ultimately showing us the true movielovers! Once again Tsui Hark proves time and again that he can be even better than Akira Kurosawa if he wants to. And once again his movie is ahead of its time and highly underrated! Let's wait the time will tell.".

I was so moved ... if you do one more thing in your life before you die .. see this film! It's true...I am sure your are all familiar with the story however I think that i couldn't spoil it for you because it's all the visual direction that's so extraordinary and original. At it's basic level the story follows the characters' adventures and interactions through out the film and we're getting right into their own mind and destinies that brought them together. The movie exactly feels like it's a beginning of something very big... the whole friendship and personalities of all swordsmen is still not as tight clear and developed... and that's a good thing as we'll be slowly witnessing the whole build up of the characters through the entire series.Just like many other Tsui Hark's films Seven Swords is gorgeous. The action and costume design in the film is extraordinary and there are so many frames that are just beautiful and indescribable it's just something what has to be seen. The use of camera movement is as intriguing as the movement and choreography of the main swordsmen and I really can't think of anything but this film or recollect any other wuxia film that could get even close to the monumental magnificence of Seven Swords. It's great to know that there's so many others who were also so deeply affected by this incredible work of art.The certain characters become in the mid of the film very colourful and fleshed out enough so that the viewer feels they know them but still not enough that they'd know everything about them and that's one of the elements intentionally left out for many other sequels. The past is something what's haunting these characters in many ways that is a thematic point of the film that is truly just about the destiny redemption and peace and love that all the swordsmen want to achieve and hopefully will achieve in the process of the ongoing sequels and as we follow the moving and struggling drama between and in the minds of the characters we may even come to understand something within ourselves. It is truly a very humanistically inspirational for the viewers and should be noted that much more so than was even Seven Samurai. Seven Swords is just a brilliant example of the true power of the cinema. And Tsui Hark once again proves that he's an unadulterated cinematic genius. It seems that some people still don't know what film can do to the viewer's senses Tsui Hark does.".

Here's just a decent proof that one can hardly ever beat a true genius. I didn't care so much for these characters of course but that's very positively stated that's the strength of this film. It's an abstract film and more philosophic study of the characters than just another schmaltzy entertainment.I liked Once Upon A Time In China which was good and popular 15 years ago but not necessarily better than timeless films like Legend Of Zu which i adored unlike anything before and by far not as great as this groundbreaking film. Which prompts me to state that something what is popular or easily accessible not necessarily means it must also be better than much more powerful more demanding films.Seven Swords is the best wuxia film in the last decade for certain. 1010".

The landscapes the love affairs are simply breathtaking. As if the movie didn't want us to be completely part of their affairs and issues but just gently touches on them with an honest sensitivity and tenderness that let them move with a tranquility and an innocence which evokes in the viewer the sense of the genuine art of filmmaking that I have not seen in a very long time. I did not go to the theater to see this movie which i'll probably regret for the rest of my life but rented the DVD but my thirst for a beautiful not just entertaining but a truly BEAUTIFUL movie was finally quenched! Thank you Mr. Hark for your unique artistic voice and talent. You will be remembered as one of the greatest for evermore!".

	schema:reviewBody "What i've seen simply can not be fully described it's a movie full of emotions and heroism. Whoever directed this movie knows his craft even more than Kurosawa and Godard ever did. Incidentally when i already mentioned J.L.Godard i must admit that i'm a bit perplexed why so many European critics constantly comparing this film to Godard's style... i don't remember Godard ever did an epic film like this. Anyway this wuxia film cares more about the characters than most of the films of this genre i've seen in the past including Touch of Zen or Onearmed Swordsman this gives them a very good development throughout the film.Of course the movie has a very challenging nature right from the very beginning as to the way how some of the fight scenes and story development being treated on the film. What i liked the most was the second half of the film because only then it started to give the meaning what the film is about... the characters! Not one scene or just a one single second of the film is wasted everything there has the reason and meaning. The romance as much as the action of the film are evidently the most important and the most effective. It kind of shows the viewers that the romantic subplots is what this whole series is supposed to be about. Honestly i found myself crying several times during the film especially in the middle when Zhang Jingchu talks about love with soyeon Kim that scene is almost unbearable in terms of the emotional intensity induced mostly just by looking at both actresses's eyes and facial expressions and almost no dialogue!... strictly genius! Another almost cry inducing scene is right at the end when Hanzhiban decides which way to go which is clearly one of the most important and emotional moments in the film.The fact that this movie is in no way some popcorn is also one of the aspects i admired very much because it's much more demanding than usual wuxia films were used to be in the past. It tries to carry several strong messages and images that can very easily grave in your mind so i must warn you all that it's a very memorable film that you won't certainly forget so soon.The movie is an obvious antithesis to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Hero or House of Flying Daggers strictly speaking it's one of the most realistic wuxia films out there and far better than any one of those futile attempts at this genre. But on the other hand this is also a movie that relies on the imagination and acuity of intelligence of the viewer. What we have here is a very intelligent movie that goes against many expectations as i noticed and that's a good sign i think because i believe that best and the strongest films are usually those that situate themselves on the border between love and hate.However be aware that if you find yourself entirely immersed in this fictional world of seven swords throughout the movie you won't be disappointed in its powerful end... and trust me it'll leave you wanting more. A perfect testament of the perfect movie! It's without any doubt one of the best wuxia films that appeared in the recent years but i'm sure that only the time will tell that it's probably destined to be the best wuxia film in the Asian filmmaking history. Just wait if you want or see this fascinating and magnificent jewel immediately!".

Sure at 2 and a half hours length it is still missing over an hour but I had no trouble understanding the story and to me the characters were pretty fleshed out. For some reason people are dead set against this film and I wonder if it has to do with Crouching Tiger Hero and Daggers?Maybe these people haven't seen The Bride With White Hair The Blade or films like that. I get the impression that many complaints are leveled by Hollywood trained fans who don't yet understand the context of this film. Whatever the case this film deserves accolades for it's imagination and for hewing so close to sword fight movie tradition.The action was fantastic and the fights were creative and very clever. Yes they did it with wires. That's why we keep coming back. The swords themselves rules and the cinematography had that Tsui Hark attention to detail. The middle of the film has mostly dramatic elements building up to a huge finale. I never thought it dragged on and I found myself rapt until the final credit rolled.Seven Swords was beautifully shot the characters embodied the fantasy perfectly and acting was full of heart. Get it.".

I get the impression that many complaints are leveled by Hollywood trained fans who don't yet understand the context of this film. Whatever the case this film deserves accolades for it's imagination and for hewing so close to sword fight movie tradition.The action was fantastic and the fights were creative and very clever. Yes they did it with wires. That's why we keep coming back. The swords themselves rules and the cinematography had that Tsui Hark attention to detail. The middle of the film has mostly dramatic elements building up to a huge finale. I never thought it dragged on and I found myself rapt until the final credit rolled.Seven Swords was beautifully shot the characters embodied the fantasy perfectly and acting was full of heart. Get it.";

It will be unfair to criticize how accurate or inaccurate Tsui Hark based his movie on. Did Donnie Yen's character 'Chu Zhaonan' and the mysterious girl spoke Korean in the original novel? Or it is Tsui Hark's idea to add some Korean flavor hoping to break into the Korean market?I do want to say that the fighting scenes are too tightly edited. Too many different camera angle cuts during a single fight scenes make my eyes sore. I believe the quick cuts was edited to make the characters look more skilled and smooth because in actual filming they have difficulties handling the heavy swords or stunts.Mao points 710".

The older Jet Li movies have attained a sort of cult status but perhaps starting with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Oriental cinema has really hit the mainstream. Hayao Miyazaki has even brought anime to the fore. Seven Swords I believe is a great movie that marks yet another strong phase in the easternization of Western cinema. Given that Hollywood has failed recently to impress as much as it has in the past it's key source material being old TVshows biopics and remakes largely of Eastern films the shift of our attention east is not surprising. As with movies like Hero Seven Swords possesses some remarkable cinematography and even more remarkable fight choreography. To an extent the extremely well designed fight scenes are superior to many before it specifically because of its rejection of wirestunts. The result are some intense and believable fights that are far more aesthetically pleasing then for example watching Chow Yun Fat sail through the air. Many will appreciate and rightly so the strong ensemble cast featuring all round fine performances. Essentially I find very little to fault in this superb film!!! Hollywood can may attempt to defend their claim as the masters of cinema but I'll eagerly await the day when they can produce a martial arts film of even nearly this ones quality. Until then I'll continue to appreciate with great pleasure the steady flow of truly entertaining work coming from most notably China Japan and Korea.".

	schema:headline " Seven Swords The best movie ever made. MASTERPIECE!";
	schema:reviewBody "OK I'm a massive admirer of Tsui Hark. I think he is the greatest living filmmaker. His films touch part of my psyche that are left unmoved by any other filmmaker even though they still manage to entertain others such a stylistic and intentionally universal fusion is part of his uniqueness that still can not be categorized by today's critical measures. But... Nothing repeat NOTHING prepared me for the sensory explosion that is Seven Swords and that is a genre film though unlike any others made so far. I had been following the production for over 15 months watching the trailer online... counting the days... But I was worried. Some suggestions that Hark has overreached himself was selfindulgent. So with optimism but trepidation I took the plunge... and  well let me tell you that now i may have found out what the cinema looks like in heaven. This is possibly the best film i've ever seen in my life. I wish Kurosawa saw this version so he would change his own.Why is it so wonderful? The only word I can give is that it unlike any film that I have seen since O.Stone's Heaven  Earth is deeply deeply spiritual. We have familiar Tsui Hark motifs  the barriers between languages searching for the path and purpose in life the endings with no relation to the plot but only to the meaning of the whole film strong women that don't lose their own feminity the fighting against the impending fate  but here that take on a completely new and more satisfying meaning as this time Tsui Hark is treating this much more seriously with more concern for the characters plights and meaning behind each character's action. Tsui Hark uses his poetic imagery to set our senses aglow with the sheer wonder and of purity of the indigenous lifestyle which he lets counterpoised by the opposite lifestyle led by the greed hate jealousy dishonesty betrayal and violence. This is cinema at the level of what I can only term 'superexpression'  imagery communicates complex interaction between things and the way our senses perceive them but it does so at an incredibly elevated level. The most remarkable thing for the casual viewer is how much Tsui manages to express complex and wonderful things completely without dialogue. Yang Yun Chong Leon Lai barely speaks to others just like Green Pearl Kim So Yuen but we see and sense their emotions through their facial expressions. The masterful scene at the lake serves as a perfect example of the communication of love despite the language barriers. We sense what they are thinking through Hark's absolutely magnificent use of imagery and sound.There are other motifs. People hold hands. They express themselves through their tone of voice or breathing. And yet again Hark has found a wonderful vehicle for his vision in the form of Green Pearl which might as well represents Tsui Hark's own point of view. We feel the pain inside her we feel the hidden passion for life through her. Her screen presence and the range of emotions that she suggests with so little dialogue is little short of miraculous.For people who love the cinema not just on the basis of the quality of the stories that it tells but the manner in which it tells them this must be one of the films of the decade. Many people have said that the cinema is like a language but that is to belittle it. It is not like A language it is simply like language itself. Just like there are many languages there are many forms of cinema. And in each language there are masters of the language who excel in expressing themselves in poetry prose or through the philosophy. In English we had Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. Now in sort of a 'postmodern philosophic cinema' at a higher level even than Stan Brakhage we have Tsui Hark. But with one oddity Tsui Hark represents an eminently new form of film language that was still not registered yet by the wider community as it's practically still way ahead of our time and waiting to be resurrected.Yes Seven Swords is a genuine masterpiece of a new form of film language as well as the genre itself. See it  if you want to see something what you haven't seen before. See it  if you want to see a new evolvement of cinema. See it  if you want to see an actioner with brains and the probe plunged deeply into the human soul and nature. I can guarantee you that this is not another momentary crowdpleaser hit like Oldboy or Battle Royale. This film can completely change your life! This film will be remembered.".

If you want just stupid entertainment where's everything just spelled out for you don't watch the real movies like this one. Even Hitchcock believed in the power of imagination which is one of the most important things that allow us to be creative there's lying the essence of the art itself. As a matter of fact a lot of films offer certain portions of imagination simply put if there was none i would be just reading books but the movies always try to incorporate some of that to get closer to this potency of the books. This movie is even more vigorous and successful in it and most of the people grown up on the Hollywood generic moviemaking seem to be very confused and find it very hard to get used to this eccentric new filmstyle.My point is that the film Seven Swords is just a brilliant example of an absolutely challenging cinema! When you decide just to pass through the film without paying attention to little tiny details offered to connect with the screen or imagining what you don't see like in reality you'll obviously find the film very boring. This film offers the reality possibly unlike any film you've seen before the reality is not as clearcut and obvious we also are not part of every event happening around us there are not always explanations to what we see in reality. That's the biggest strength of the the film and the reason why it's leaving several paths for the viewer to solve out something what's not on the screen. Don't come to this film expecting a mindless entertainment in all probability you'll just end up bored and confused. Keep in mind that this is a pure art that demands a certain effort from the viewer to connect with the given reality of the film and help you to properly appreciate its merits.First of all the action sequences were probably the most creatively shot in a very long time something what can not be surely compared to what you still see nowadays. The stylistic way how are shot certain scenes is undoubtedly far ahead of our time. What's very impressive about the fight scenes in particular is the given exuberance and richness in its complexity each movement of the warrior was connected to the essence and limitation of the particular sword but also each sword was clearly resonating with the personality of its holder. The unique strength of the film is also the visual stylishness that incorporates the jagged disorienting camera and editing in order to create the confusing reality especially in the middle of the furious fight with the camera right in some characters face or even under the water so as to give the feeling as if you were part of the actual fight to the point you'd feel the attacks pain and sweat on yourself. This was close to the most realistic fight scenes that were ever filmed. The movie absolutely exceeded my expectations it's already one of the best epic films i've ever seen in my life. Thus far i can go here because Seven Swords is a film one of a kind that you don't see every year and as a moviegoer grown upon the most essential martial art films in Asian history i can fully assure you that you will hardly find better martial art film in terms of the character development visual virtuosity art direction storyline. It's easily one of the best films out there... get it! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of Tsui Hark films I had been looking forward to this film for a long time and even though Leon Lai is in the movie I still thought it would be watchable.The film was shot quite beautifully with certain scenes showing some fantastic imagery. However do not take this to mean that the film was full of beautiful landscapes no. The way the film was shot was matched fully well with the barren lands that the majority of the scenes take place in.The music was captivating and suited the moment when you actually noticed it was playing. In my opinion the typical 'Hero' theme in this film was a perfect mix of cheesiness and just plain pure brilliance.The fight scenes were fast and furious but sometimes due to the camera work it was difficult to see what had become of the amazing choreography.At this particular moment in time I can only really think of two bad things about the film the first being pacing and the second being the timelineediting. The film tends to jump from scene to scene fairly well but there were certain moments where it is obvious that something was missing be it dialogue or scenes and this made the pacing factor unbearable as it seemed forever for the film to get anywhere.Overall though I guess if you like wuxia movies then this might appeal to you but I still feel quite doubtful that this would actually appeal to a larger audience.The swords are awesome by the way....  Let's hope that they release a better DVD version though...".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film two weeks ago and I'm still under the strong impression. Overwhelming and powerful are two words that can best describe the experience watching this work of art. All is brilliant  the direction screenplay performances cinematography the inspiring musical score by renowned Kenji Kawai...Certainly there are motifs from other films  Seven Samurai or Musa  but they are organically interwoven in the canvass of Tsui Hark's film.This oeuvre like other recent films by Tsui Hark is a result of a happy amalgamation a synthesis of Western and Chinese cinema traditions which does not happen often.The film is profoundly artistic by its symbolic nature and defying of the genre traditions and developments in terms of the characters or the story but at the same time it's incredibly entertaining. This is also achieved not least by a careful choice of details and selfreflecting images and meanings. It just didn't take me so long to realize that all the 7 warriors actually mirrored the seven basic behavioral variations of the human personality.What's quite neglected by most of the people who watched this film that it's a film that strictly falls into the arthouse territory except for a few concessions that happen to side with the populist cinema. Calling it an experimental avantgarde film would be more appropriate. But i can't shake off the impression that most of the people who are watching this film just wrongly expecting the traditional wuxia film with clichs of a popular action genre. Let me advise you all this is NOTHING like you've seen before. This is the first the most essential exploration of the spirit xia you could witness here.I saw the film in a 3disc DVD edition and the only disappointment was the subtitles and mandarin dubbing. The English translation is sometimes too inexact and leaves too much dialogue untranslated.Of course the best is to see the film in Cantonese. But even if you do not speak Cantonese try to see this film because it is a masterpiece of a universal value which transcends the language barriers. Watch it with an open mind.I wish that all people on earth had that rare chance to see 'Seven Swords'. Then maybe they would've come to realization that every human being on this planet has the certain given destiny and valuable purpose in their life. Moreover either we can be those who help or the ones that are desperately waiting for such help or in other words for the celestial beam of the redemption and reconcilliation to our sore sinful past.Thank you Mr. Tsui Hark thank you very much all who made this excellent film! 1010 I found a new purpose in my life thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The true story of Howard Stern's rise from schoolboy nerd to leading DJ in the USA.  This is adapted from his book and is a whirlwind ride through 30 years with the main focus being on his career at small stations and his big break at NBC.  The fact that it is from Stern himself means that the story focuses on his good sides and tends to brush over the more difficult issues relating to his insensitivity towards his wife etc but that doesn't stop this being a funny enjoyable film.Stern plays himself with a great sense of self  most of his jokes put himself down rather than being arrogant.  This helps endear the audience to him with great effect and makes him more sympathetic.  The comedy is very sharp and rude throughout and even if we don't get any great insights at least we have a good laugh.Stern is good in the lead role admittedly if he can't play himself what can he do!  And his colleagues are also good as themselves.  Paul Giamatti is great as the put upon producer at NBC and the rest of the cast is filled out with weird characters.  One complaint would be the copious amount of nudity in the film  I realise that it's a true story but it did seem to be put in just to get the audience at times well....like Stern's show itself I guess.Overall this plays like a rude Woody Allen film funny narrative voiceovers and it has a certain charm to it that towers over the smuttiness to make it feel a much nicer film than it is.  Even if you don't know who Stern is i.e. most people outside of America this is a very funny enjoyable film.".

I rarely get a chance to hear Howard Stern. I was only vaguely familiar with his program and the folks on it. That being said I absolutely LOVED Howard Stern's Private Parts. Wait... that didn't come out right... anyway...HSPP follows Stern's career from being the misunderstood son of a radio engineer with aspirations of the big time through his student film days at Boston University where he meets and marries his wife Allison to his first big radio gig at DC101. The humor comes from Stern's slow realization that pushing the envelope was the way to garner HUGE ratings. His arguments with management and Paul Giamatti as Kenny Pig Vomit Rushton in specific are at once both hilarious and sad as management tries to crush Stern's free spirit. It's also nice to see that yes Howard Stern is really a nice guy a devoted friend and a loving father and the image that we know as Howard Stern is really just an act. Although he did make some questionable decisions in his life he always stood by those who stood by him and for that he should be admired. Whether you are a fan or not check this movie out and see if you don't come away from the experience with a smile on your face and a respect for the selfproclaimed King of all Media!".

	schema:headline " Awesome movie! One I never get tired of watching!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of Howard and I'm sure fellow fans will also have a kicka time with this hilarious biopic of Stern's road to stardom.  This is obviously not a professional biopic.  There's even one scene where Howard plays himself AS A TEEN!!  He tries to patch it up in the voiceover by saying For this movie ya just have to believe.  There are many hilarious antics and if you're a fan of Stern I'm sure you will not stop laughing! If not I can't say you'll have the time of your life.  I've heard many critics say that this movie is even suited for those who disapprove of Stern's behavior.  I can't say I agree and for those who want to take the critics' word for it and give this movie a shotenter at your own risk. Expect lots of Stern's typically crude offensive tasteless humor.  Of course you also get to see his sweeter side and learn that his personality on radio does somewhat differ from that in real life.  Just like Andrew Dice Clay his crude actions are exaggerated and he really isn't exactly like the pottymouthed jerk that the general public sees or hears in Howard's case.  The openminded moviegoer will probably come to that realization after viewing this movie but others will be so turned off by Howard's crude antics that they won't feel compelled to sit through the entire running timeapproximately two hours and fifteen minutes.  Private Parts is based on Howard's autobiography so this is pretty much the life of Howard through the eyes of...Howard.  Yet I can't say this movie is a glorification of Sternthough he obviously boasts jokingly about his Godlike status among his many followers And I'm one of themGO HOWARD!!!.  Personally I still think there are a lot of closet Howard fans out there who are simply opposed better yet act like they're opposed to him because they would feel humiliated to say they're not.  There are hypocrites out there and I know some of them.  So for those of you who locked yourselves in that closetget out and rent this movie!  Stop your whining!Many of Stern's fellow cast members on the show appear as themselvesFred Norris Jackie Martling Robin Quivers Gary Del'Abate.  The other actors are good as well especially Paul Giamatti who plays the NBC manager with a short short fuse who springs from his seat if Howard were to utter the word penis.  Just his facial expressions alone crack me the hell up!  I've never seen Howard's real wife Allison I just found out she appears as an NBC operator but I have to watch it again to spot her on screen but Mary McCormack who plays her is absolutely BEEUTIFUL!!  Nice casting Betty Thomas.  She is stunning to look at and the chemistry between she and Howard is electric.  I sometimes forget that she's just PORTRAYING his wife. If you're in the mood for Howard's comical vulgarities gratuitous nudity cool 80s music and a damn entertaining comedy that will never tire outPrivate Parts is DEFINITELY worth seeing!!  If you're not a Stern fan I'm pretty sure you'll be croaking more than a sick frog so don't start preaching your blasphemous thoughts on Howard.  We really don't have the time.  My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed Private Parts I think Howard Stern is an iconoclast who won respect from people by breaking the rules.  This movie had a lot to do with the 70's and the 80's when Howard Stern's career was in the process of evolution and was a time before I was born.  I don't like how he shared his personal life on air for millions of listeners to hear.  However I do respect Howard Stern as an artist and entertainer even though most of his material was vulgar and raunchy as it is portrayed in this movie.  I originally had no intention on seeing this film but spotted it in blockbuster video and I just grabbed it off the shelf since I was in a hurry.  Private Parts is somewhat of an appealing movie I must say I liked it even though I had no interest in Howard Stern prior to watching it.  I think the acting is pretty good I love how a lot of these real life characters play themselves several years later to capture the experiences they had during their careers.  I'd say this is a good movie to catch if you are over the age of 14.  Three out of Four Stars I give Private Parts.P.SWARNINGLADIES MIGHT BE OFFENDED DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS FILM.".

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoyed Private Parts I think Howard Stern is an iconoclast who won respect from people by breaking the rules.  This movie had a lot to do with the 70's and the 80's when Howard Stern's career was in the process of evolution and was a time before I was born.  I don't like how he shared his personal life on air for millions of listeners to hear.  However I do respect Howard Stern as an artist and entertainer even though most of his material was vulgar and raunchy as it is portrayed in this movie.  I originally had no intention on seeing this film but spotted it in blockbuster video and I just grabbed it off the shelf since I was in a hurry.

However this is one of the best autobiographical movies I have ever seen.  It is thoroughly enjoyable and it shows that Stern is really just a normal family man and his other persona is all schtick.  I had serious reservations about watching this movie but after I did I was very happy. The basis of the movie is that if you believe in yourself set goals and work hard you can achieve those goals.  Now how can that be bad?!?  A rating of 9 out of 10 was given.  A final word.  This is not an endorsement for Stern but give this movie a chance.  There are some very funny scenes and a most excellent story to be told.".

Uh yeah right. It's just another example of Stern having his cake and eating it too he's a bad boy but not really. Like any Hollywood bio you have to take a lot of it with a grain of salt. If nothing else it proves why he's the king of all media. No matter what he says you still like him and want to believe him. As for plot it's just the old underdogmisfit makes good storywith an attitude. What makes Howard Stern funny on the radio is his lack of pretension and the way he skewers everything equally. The movie is best when it shows this in action. The love story works surprisingly well too. What's refreshing about the movie is that it never gets stuck in a groove. It finds the right balance in its elements. Cutting to Bababooey for instance auditioning women on the street then cutting back to Howard's home life then cutting to Howard's battles with network execs such as Pig Vomit and cutting to the show itself. The portrait of Howard as a gawky nerd in the seventies is something that all us gawky '70s nerds can identify with. It's got some of the funniest tasteless humor this side of the Farrelly brothers ie. the Match Game parody and the woman with a special orgasmic attachment to stereo speakers. When I give acquaintances the onesentence description of Private Parts I say it's an Xrated WKRP in Cincinnati. Somehow it all works beautifully.".
