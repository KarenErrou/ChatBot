	schema:reviewBody "Well done melodrama that tells the story of Sally tomboy dancer in the circus raised by sideshow performer McGargle played by W.C. Fields he of the top hat little mustache checkered pants and proficiency as juggler pickpocket and runner of carnival con games like Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle has raised Sally who worships him as her real father since Sally's mother kicked out of her home by her father a judge when she married a circus man died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is feisty and loyal to McGargle no matter what he gets up to  but McGargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. When they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live McGargle uses the opportunity to investigate Sally's real family with the idea that he may restore her to them. But grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to Sally 'cause he doesn't like a show girl  what a stern narrowminded man he is a real piece of work that guy! And meanwhile Sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches.This is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style I don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown. Carol Dempster who plays Sally is delightful here  quite cute and comical in her performance. W.C. Fields even without his famous voice is very funny  just the way he moves and his amusing comical reactions to things like a small dog seen in one funny scene we even see him juggling briefly in this. I love the few peeks at the oldfashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. The print of this featured on the DVD is very nice looking tinted a light sepia tone and the piano score for this is really excellent performed by Philip Carli based on the original cue sheets.".

	schema:reviewBody "SALLY OF THE SAWDUST United Artists 1925 directed by DW Griffith the man responsible for such early silent epics as THE BIRTH OF A NATION 1915 and INTOLERANCE 1916 as well as Hollywood's first tragedy BROKEN BLOSSOMS 1919 now past his prime attempts a feature length comedy taken from Dorothy Donnelly's 1923 stage play of Poppy which helped establish the career of vaudevillian WC Fields. Reprising his stage role as Professor Eustace McGargle sporting checkered pants derby and a mustache this not only became Fields' first important screen role but one of his most notable characters. He would repeat his McGargle role once more minus derby and mustache in the 1936 sound version of POPPY Paramount with Rochelle Hudson taking the title role. As for the silent original Poppy is renamed Sally as the movie itself has been retitled with the background shifting from the 1800s to modernday 1920s era. Being able to see and compare both SALLY OF THE SAWDUST and POPPY it is evident that no two versions are alike. The only similarities would be McGargle Fields the carnival con man rearing a young girl since childhood as his own unaware to he that he's her surrogate father his attempt to restore her back to her deceased mother's wealthy parents and the girl's love for a rich man's son.For SALLY OF THE SAWDUST being the best known feature length film for either WC Fields or Carol Dempster during the silent era mainly due to its current availability and frequent revivals it's nearly forgotten that this particular assignment was actually directed by the father of film himself DW Griffith in spite the fact that many of his famous trademarks are evident here such as his signature beneath the title cards numerous closeups on the title character being Dempster flashbacks giving insight to Sally's origins her mother and how McGargle was chosen as the little girl's guardian prior to her mother's death along with cut to the chase and last minute rescues. For today's audience aware of this film's very existence SALLY OF THE SAWDUST is remembered solely as a Fields comedy but it's Dempster who acquires most of the attention under Griffith's careful supervision. Dressed nearly throughout the story in shabby attire one scene set during a society function spotlights Dempster's Sally all dolled up in elegant fashion styled hair necklaces and wearing lowcut evening gowns.As for the story Sally Carol Dempster is the circus waif reared by Professor Eustance McGargle WC Fields a lovable con man sideshow juggler and entertainer. Flashbacks reveal that Sally whose mother had married a circus man against the wishes of her father later becoming a widow with a child and before she too dies entrusts her little girl to their best friend McGargle. Now that Sally is a young adult McGargle comes to the conclusion that Sally is growing up and decides to return her to grandparents now living in Green Meadow. Upon their arrival they both stir up controversy when attending a charity bazaar for homeless children which is taking place near the estate of the very wealthy Judge Henry L. Foster Erville Alderson and his wife Effie Shannon who happen to be Sally's grandparents. Complications arise when Peyton Lennox Alfred Lunt the rich young son of a respected leading citizen engaged to marry a society society girl he does not love becomes infatuated by the visiting Sally. After her Pop escapes arrest for dealing in a crooked card game Sally in turn is arrested and jailed while Peyton gets sent out of town by his parents hoping that he'd forget about this common girl. As McGargle learns of Sally's predicament he's in one himself being held hostage by bootleggers in a far away cottage.Regardless of numerous changes from the original play SALLY OF THE SAWDUST does remain loyal to Fields' character a juggler and shifty con man who never gives a sucker an even break with motto being It's the old Army game. Fields who makes the most of his initial movie lead does display his given talent through several key scenes but it's director Griffith who makes one big mistake by shifting Fields' juggling act in the background with the camera range at a far distance distracted by the heads of his curious spectators instead of focusing in a nearer range and center stage of him. While not one of the best comedies from the silent era SALLY OF THE SAWDUST does include some fine comedic moments mostly supplied by Fields himself. SALLY OF THE SAWDUST was first introduced to public television as part of the 13week 1971 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS hosted by Orson Welles which was by this time the only known surviving WC Fields from the silent era. During Welles' profile on both film and Fields it's interesting to note how Welles affectionately spoke of Fields by addressing him as Uncle Claude. Out of circulation for little over a decade SALLY OF THE SAWDUST resurfaced on video cassette by the 1980s with one of the distributors being Blackhawk Video accompanied by Wurlitzer pipe organ score by Jack Ward the same score that was used for THE SILENT YEARS. The movie's length ranging from 90 minutes to nearly two hours depending on the distributor and the silent projector speed. For an added bonus KINO Video distributed the restored 112 minute VHS DVD version with new orchestral score consisting of prologue opening and some lost footage supposedly unseen since its initial release. Because of the mild success to SALLY OF THE SAWDUST Griffith reunited Dempster and Fields in THAT ROYAL GIRL 1926. Due to the unavailability of that reunion SALLY OF THE SAWDUST goes down in movie history as the one that paved the way to the future comedy cinematic world of a man named WC Fields. ".

	schema:reviewBody "SALLY OF THE SAWDUST is not a major Griffith film but it is quite good for the most part. The story has been described well in other reviews so I'll limit my comments to other aspects of the film. WC Fields shows the beginnings of his trademark cantankerous persona indeed the movie survives mostly due to his presence. Fields shows natural ability and is an asset to all of the scenes in which he is present.However he was not the star of this movie. That title would go to Carol Dempster. Dempster is something of a polarizing figure for silent film fans. Many have labeled her as a talentless and unattractive Lillian Gish wannabe whose supposedly awful performances led to DW Griffith's creative and commercial downfall. It's true that Dempster could be inconsistent as a performer but when she was good she was superb. Dempster really appears to enjoy this role and it shows. She is by turns irreverent spunky feisty happy and touchingly sad you can see the ache in Sally's heart as she yearns for the love of family. Dempster is highly expressive and uses her trademark athleticism and dancing skills to great effect. She radiates a kooky charm throughout and many of her facial expressions are amusing. I personally thought she carried the role very well and I have watched this movie multiple times in order to relive moments from her performance.As a movie overall the film has its strengths and weaknesses. Griffith had obviously mastered the art of cinematography and there are some nice sequences at the circus as well as the protracted chase scene near the end of the movie. The editing as has been noted above is comically bad. The most outstanding example is when the cops come to bust McGargle's shell game operation and take Sally away it's clearly night time but the cut to McGargle's escape is in broad daylight! Also as has been noted Griffith was NOT a comedy director. One can only imagine the zaniness that Buster Keaton or Hal Roach would have brought to the chase scene but Griffith doesn't have the right feel for it. The movie is more amusing than laughoutloud funny. Whatever does work in the movie is more due to the cast minus Alfred Lunt whom I found very bland as the wouldbe boyfriend than the script or direction.In conclusion SALLY OF THE SAWDUST while not a great film has two great performances by Fields and Dempster and is an agreeable way for silent movie fans to spend two hours.".

	onyx:emotionText "SALLY OF THE SAWDUST is not a major Griffith film but it is quite good for the most part. The story has been described well in other reviews so I'll limit my comments to other aspects of the film. WC Fields shows the beginnings of his trademark cantankerous persona indeed the movie survives mostly due to his presence. Fields shows natural ability and is an asset to all of the scenes in which he is present.However he was not the star of this movie. That title would go to Carol Dempster. Dempster is something of a polarizing figure for silent film fans. Many have labeled her as a talentless and unattractive Lillian Gish wannabe whose supposedly awful performances led to DW Griffith's creative and commercial downfall. It's true that Dempster could be inconsistent as a performer but when she was good she was superb. Dempster really appears to enjoy this role and it shows. She is by turns irreverent spunky feisty happy and touchingly sad you can see the ache in Sally's heart as she yearns for the love of family. Dempster is highly expressive and uses her trademark athleticism and dancing skills to great effect. She radiates a kooky charm throughout and many of her facial expressions are amusing. I personally thought she carried the role very well and I have watched this movie multiple times in order to relive moments from her performance.As a movie overall the film has its strengths and weaknesses. Griffith had obviously mastered the art of cinematography and there are some nice sequences at the circus as well as the protracted chase scene near the end of the movie.

Daughter proves to be just as inconsequential and promptly dies of Little Nell's disease leaving infant Sally in the care of Larson E. McGarrisouse accent on the ague who raises her among tigers and lecherous acrobats Glenn Anders years later to resurface indelibly as the guy who wants to go for a little tarrrrrget practice in Lady From Shanghai. Luckily none of them seem to go around with their arms strapped down as if amputated. Prof. McGargle is offered the chance to write for the Chuckles the Chipmunk show wait a minute they take little Jackie away from him but anyway it all ends happily with her being wooed by a rich young idiot Harry Backstayge in one of his few silent roles despite her indeterminate age she's either 14 or 30 the movie seems vague on that a fairly endless car chase an even more endless courtroom scene and a group hug. The first half of this quite long melodrama is focused on Fields and Dempster in the circus. Since D.W. was only sleeping with one of them we catch frustratingly fleeting glimpses of Fields' cigar box act while long sequences go by like freight cars in which Dempster is allowed to demonstrate goofy clowning showing off a heretofore unnoticed resemblance to Harry Ritz ballet not since Leni Riefenstahl in The Holy Mountain has a dancer danced so galumphingly and ultimately the full Gloria Swanson glamor gal treatment in glowing jewelry and peacock headdresses which she pulls off about half as well as Conrad Veidt in The Indian Tomb. Nevertheless the relationship between the two is simple Fields is effortlessly amusing not just stealing every scene from the overworked Dempster with a minimum of effort but fencing it and spending the boodle while she's still grimacing like Christ in the Passion Play to show teenagerdom. The second half alas has to bear the heavy lifting of resolving the plot and reuniting daughter with grandparents and their money and does so at a length and laboriousness which strains credulity can anyone explain why the courtroom is packed for a hearing to determine if a minor should be committed to a juvie home? Or why the bailiff allows comic characters to do their business for minutes at a stretch? Nevertheless Fields manages to wrap it up with some panache and it's not surprising that he was given his own series after this breakthrough role the first movie taking its title from an oftrepeated line here It's the old army game. As a movie Sally of the Sawdust falls into the watchable but frustrating category. That Fields gets so few chances to really let fly yet cunningly takes every one of them all the same is one frustration. But the greater one perhaps is seeing D.W. Griffith settle in so comfortably with such secondrate melodramatic material. At his best in the teens Griffith is like Elia Kazan alive to every moment and every twitch in his actors' faces seeking truth 24 times a second well 16 to 18 anyway. But Sally is the sort of piece in which real actors need not apply the movie wouldn't know what to do with a truthful moment that really got you in the heart though the actress who plays the grandmother looks like she'd manage a few if the director could be bothered to pay attention. Easily read caricatures are the order of the day. As a character the stern Judge is no more than the sum of his mustaches. The relationship between McGargle and Sally is a selfless sexless bloodless thing with none of the awareness of actual neediness none of the sense of newfound purpose and maturity that you get in Chaplin's Tramp when suddenly he has a Kid to look after. The legendary Alfred Lunt playing the rich young blood could be any young man who looks well in an Arrow shirt collar. The mystery of how Griffith once so alive to movies and actors could have been so dead to them just a few years later is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood forget William Desmond Taylor what killed David Wark Griffith?".

Fields would later add dialogue to his act and cultivate his now familiar persona eventually progressing onto fulllength comic dramas. Sally of the Sawdust his first featurelength movie creates an odd shift in his career. It is adapted from his most recent stage hit Poppy and yet the very different medium of pretalkie cinema meant he had to rely upon the old routines from his pantomime days.The picture sees him teamed up with pioneer director D.W. Griffith now sadly long past his glory days. Griffith was never really much of a comedy director. He doesn't seem to have the confidence in his performers to let them do their stuff and allow the scenes to play out. Instead he seems stuck in the Keystone Cops mode of slapstick which is always very frenetic with lots of cuts. In a way this works out well because Griffith could at least direct a good action sequence and scenes like the punchup at the circus even if not very funny are at least nicely timed and escalated. Besides even if the comedy fails the general air of irreverence stops the picture from getting too mawkish.It is also rather nice to see Griffith returning to a simple human story as his usual epics with ridetotherescue finales had been getting a little stale of late. Sally of the Sawdust more than any other harks back to the short films he made in the early teens for the way he focuses on individuals rather than wider social processes. There are some good examples of the way he builds up an emotional story. In the prologue when the daughter is kicked out we see the mother and father turn away from each other to face opposite walls the camera well back in the large space a perfect evocation of this cold fractured household. And Griffith is still so good at expressing a feeling with the most delicate of closeups showing us for example Carol Dempster's hand clutching at the grass as she canoodles with Alfred Lunt. Acting performances vary immensely across Griffith's body of work but the relatively restrained turns from Dempster and Elfie Shannon as old Mrs Foster add immensely to the poignant final scenes.But what of W.C. Fields himself? We here and there see him going off into some bit of comedy business but the truth is as a slapstick comic he is nothing really exceptional. He doesn't have the energy or flexibility to keep up with the wilder slapstick and sequences like the one where he keeps knocking off his own hat just look out of place. Of course there is a lot more for him to do in Sally of the Sawdust and Fields is at his funniest when simply acting out bits of the play presumably kept intact from the original stage version in his own characteristic manner. When trying to evade the police he emerges from his hiding place wrapped in a cloak disguised as an Indian and it is the way he strolls towards the camera nonchalantly puffing on a cigar that makes the moment funny. Still there is clearly something missing from the act  the delivery the voice not to mention the opportunity to develop a curmudgeonly character without having to occasionally play the clown. It is no wonder his screen career never really took off until the arrival of the talkies.".

I have to say the more of his films that you watch the more predictable they become. I'm not talking just a predictable ending. It's predictable everything  the lame acting the drawn out and overextended scenes the overreliance on subtitles to tell the story the same camera angles etc. You compare Griffith's work to another film from the same era ones starring Harold Lloyd and you see an immediate difference in directing quality. Griffith doesn't seem to want to take chances and that may have cost him his career. I do have to say that Sally of the Sawdust is far technically and aesthetically superior to any of Griffith's previous films. The fight scenes near the beginning would have benefited from being edited out. They were very fake and cheesy looking. The film is very drawn out and moves at a glacial pace. Many of the scenes got very repetitive and overly long. After seeing more than a few minutes of the circus scenes courtroom scenes it just got old. I felt this film could have been half it's length without effecting the storyline. There were a lot of continuity errors which is common for films of it's day but especially true of Griffith's work. The picture quality was surprisingly good though. The background settings and camera work were much better done any of Griffith's previous work.This film's ending simply lacks the excitement that I'm used to seeing  such as in Birth of a Nation and Orphans of a Storm. The suspense and choreography was not well done. Sally's escape from the courthouse also lacked credibility. You're like this is so fake! How could a whole mob of people in an enclosed building not get to her? Overall this film is average. It may be worth watching from a historical perspective. If you're looking for a good story skip it.".

How could a whole mob of people in an enclosed building not get to her? Overall this film is average. It may be worth watching from a historical perspective. If you're looking for a good story skip it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sally of the Sawdust D. W. Griffith 1925 is a nice film from the director of The Birth of a Nation with nary a heroic Klansman in sight. The engrossing storyline adapted from a hit stage musical sees carnival barker W. C. Fields looking to restore orphaned waif Carol Dempster to her rightful place in society. The muchmaligned Dempster is actually very good here save for a bit of overacting among the rushes as the police close in on her backed by a couple of unimpeachable heavyweights Fields and Effie Shannon. There are flaws. We could probably have done without the knockabout comedy for a start. The slapstick interludes aren't as jarring as in Way Down East where the wrenchingly powerful narrative is offset by some of the most inscrutable alleged comic relief ever slapped onto the screen. For one thing it's quite funny. But it does jar a little with the dramatic elements particularly when we see Dempster striving desperately to avoid capture and ruin intercut with Fields bouncing down a hill in an old banger. And there's also the sense of a missed opportunity. For a film that's not afraid to be melodramatic the climactic reveal doesn't really carry an emotional punch at all let alone the assault on the tear ducts I was anticipating. But I liked the film on the whole interesting story strong performances and  once you adapt to Griffith's style revolutionary in 1915 a touch staid 10 years on  very watchable indeed.Trivia notes Alfred Lunt who plays Dempster's love interest was Monty Clift's mentor and acting tutor. The film was remade as the talkie Poppy also starring Fields in 1936.".

He's a joy to behold.Much has been said against Carol Dempster as an actress but her performance here is also richly comic. She was 22 at the time playing a teenager and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be wholly convincing but she truly engages the eye when she's on screen particularly when she's dancing. She's not a beautythough she's positively luminous in the one scene where she's gussied up like a Talmadge sister but her plainness only adds to Sally's character especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious affection for Fields as her guardianfather.

Eventually the woman ends up in a traveling carnivalpregnant. Later she diesleaving the baby with McGargle Fieldsa shifty juggler and carney. The child Sally grows up in this less than honorable environmenttotally unaware that she has rich relatives. As for Fields he knows the truth but figures the child is better off not knowingafter all they disowned her mother and were obviously not very nice people. Later however he decides that perhaps the carnival is not the best life for her and so broke they head to Connecticut to find her family. But some of them STILL are big buttheads AND there's a romance waiting for Sally. What will happen next? Well we sure know it won't involve comedy! While I am not a huge fan of Poppy 1936 it did have good comedy as well as being a rather sweet story. Here in the silent version that sweetness and the laughs are missing and too much time is spent on her romance. As a result it's decent but wholly unremarkable and a rather inauspicious film for Fieldwho looks a bit odd underneath that huge mustache. Mostly of interest to Fields completists.".

The mother before dying leaves the kid with Professor McGargle W.C. Fields who raises her as his own. Years later the girl Carol Dempster now an adult goes with McGargle back to her hometown where he wants to tell her the truth but they end up in the Judge's court where perhaps the truth might come out. This is really just a soso film for the most part. It never gets bad but at the same time it never really reaches a good level either. As with many of Griffith's later pictures this one suffers from its technical style as the movie looks like it was made in 1915. Griffith never advanced with the times and that's one of the problems here. Another problem is that it runs a tad bit too long especially when the ending is pretty predictable. Fields offers up a good performance but just don't expect to see him as most think of him. We really don't see too many characteristics of his later style although there's a couple nice circus scenes which will remind fans of later work. The most controversial stuff from Griffith's later period is his constant use of Dempster in these big roles. From what I've seen she can come off very badly or very well. She's somewhat mixed here as she's a tad bit too wild with facial gestures during quieter scenes but during the final courtroom battle she comes off extremely well and her performance then is quite touching. As far as the direction goes Griffith really doesn't come to life until the end when Dempster is in court fighting to stay out of jail and Fields is racing to get there so he can tell the truth about her. There are several long chase sequences and some nice humor. The overall speed of the film picks up here as well and these are the moments that Griffith handles the best. Fields later remade this as Poppy. Griffith and Fields would go onto do another film the same year That Royale Girl which based on original reviews was suppose to be a lot better but sadly that film is lost.".

	schema:headline " Charm to spare";
	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing that almost all of Woody Allen's comedies have in common it's charm.  Few have more of it than Broadway Danny Rose.  Not Allen's best not his funniest but this warm and sentimental film grabs the viewer immediately and never lets up.  This is accomplished initially by the extremely naturalistic dialogue between the comics whose reminiscences form the bulk of the film.  Notice how they all talk at once they cut each other off and they trample all over each other's lines.  We really feel like we're listening in on a diner conversation rather than watching a theatrical performance of a diner conversation.  This gives the film an initial boost of accessibility. This charm factor is cemented once we meet Danny Rose.  Now many people criticize Allen as an actor claiming that he only ever plays one character... himself.  This is absolute rubbish and Broadway Danny Rose proves it.  I have never seen Allen play a character so kind warm and accepting as Danny Rose.  It was quite a pleasant surprise.  Danny has to be that good though in order for us to accept that Tina is haunted by her betrayal of him.  That denouement by the way was really touching.  The Thanksgiving scene took a good funny enjoyable movie and made it something a little more special.  Compare this to the grossout comedies of today... how many modern comedies can be as funny as Broadway Danny Rose and yet still create characters so real and so sympathetic that moments like the Thanksgiving scene can work?   I try not to harp on about how funny Allen's comedies are because you either like his humor or you don't.  If you like it you don't need me to tell you it's funny and if you don't you won't believe me anyway.  So why bother?  I don't know but I will say that this film had a good six or eight laugh out loud moments at least and it kept me smiling throughout.Also after a good debut in A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and a reduced subdued role in Zelig this is the film where Mia Farrow really comes into her own as Allen's leading lady.  For the first time I don't miss Diana Keaton.".

	onyx:emotionText "If there's one thing that almost all of Woody Allen's comedies have in common it's charm.  Few have more of it than Broadway Danny Rose.  Not Allen's best not his funniest but this warm and sentimental film grabs the viewer immediately and never lets up.  This is accomplished initially by the extremely naturalistic dialogue between the comics whose reminiscences form the bulk of the film.  Notice how they all talk at once they cut each other off and they trample all over each other's lines.  We really feel like we're listening in on a diner conversation rather than watching a theatrical performance of a diner conversation.  This gives the film an initial boost of accessibility. This charm factor is cemented once we meet Danny Rose.  Now many people criticize Allen as an actor claiming that he only ever plays one character... himself.  This is absolute rubbish and Broadway Danny Rose proves it.  I have never seen Allen play a character so kind warm and accepting as Danny Rose.  It was quite a pleasant surprise.  Danny has to be that good though in order for us to accept that Tina is haunted by her betrayal of him.  That denouement by the way was really touching.

	schema:headline " Walking along the docks and reminiscing";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirectorstar Woody Allen plays agentmanager Danny Rose in this funny loving nostalgic look at the lower and fringe rungs of the entertainment industry combined with a mob subplot and not a little philosophy of life contemplation.The film begins with a gaggle of older Borscht Beltcaliber comedians sitting around a table at Manhattan's Carnegie Deli trading stories about Danny Rose. Rose loves acts that are a bit outside the mainstream so there is no shortage of laughs from our storytellers as they remember his onelegged tap dancer his blind xylophonist and so on.After about 10 minutes or so of general reminiscing interspersed with footage of Rose portraying the stories one man says he's got the Rose story to top them all which launches us into the film proper. It's a tale about Rose and his client Lou Canova Nick Apollo Forte a Louis Primastyled singer who had one hit Agita in the 1950s but who is a hasbeen when Rose meets him. Broadway Danny Rose is primarily the story of how Rose gets mixed up in a comically deteriorating situation with Canova's mistress Tina Vitale Mia Farrow while trying to ensure that she attends a careerrestoring gig despite the fact that Canova's wife is also going to be there.Allen treats us to some entertaining postmodernist layering in the beginning. It seems like a normal enough film in the first few moments but quickly turns into almost a mock documentary as our deli comedians talk about Rose. The Rose material is really all flashback and even when it takes over the film during the Canova story it still has a mock documentary feel at first. Eventually the Canova story proceeds as any film would but the bookended storytellers emphasize the nostalgic tone of the film.Allen is drilling in that fact that we're reminiscing. He wants the audience to reminisce about the tone of the main story even if they don't have personal memories of the era or that segment of the entertainment industry. For Allen the film has strong resemblances to some aspects of his personal experience as an up and coming standup comedian and he even draws parallels such as a Carnegie Deli sandwich being named after Danny Rose in the filmin real life you can eat a sandwich named after Woody Allen at the Carnegie Deli. Having characters in the film reminisce about what turns out to be a reminiscent mode in a flashback helps audience members outside of the relevant nostalgia zone to get into the proper mood.Interestingly for this goal even though Allen goes to the trouble to shoot the film in black  white he doesn't attempt to remove blatantly anachronistic elementsas if he's trying to remind us that this is still artificial reminiscing. For example a scene that takes place in a Times Square office features a window through which we can see the large flashing Fuji sign. On the other hand Allen also exploits the fact that Broadway Danny Rose was shot just as the recent familyfriendly gentrification of the New York City area was taking hold as there are important scenes on the old dilapidated West Side docks and in a Jersey City that still looks comparatively like a barren wasteland.One of the reasons that this film is so charming is that even though Danny Rose is a loser he's a goodhearted loser with an admirable philosophy of life despite the fact that he's continually abused andor given the short shrift by those he helps. Allen is still doing his neurotic Jew schtick here but whereas he tends to draw that character as selfcentered in other films in Broadway Danny Rose he's almost completely altruistic. He actually tries to persuade other characters who happen to be selfcentered to change their outlooks. He's a Tod Browning to a cadre of performing freaks promoting and embracing them even if to most eyes it has to involve exploiting them at the same time. But he admirably can't help seeing the best in everyone encouraging them and honestly believing that they should be in a higher position than they are now. He even does this with the nonperforming Tina when she makes some decorating suggestions about his apartmentsuddenly he wants to manage an interior decorating career for her saying that she should be doing hotels and embassies.As is typical for an Allen film Broadway Danny Rose is filled with amazing often symbolic cinematography by frequent collaborator from 1977's Annie Hall through 1985's The Purple Rose of Cairo Gordon Willis. It's also full of great performances including Allen's and it's infused with Allen's trademark prebop jazz in this case heavily depending on variations of the Primalike Agita somewhat similar to how In A Persian Market was used as a theme in the later Curse of the Jade Scorpion 2001.If you like Allen's typical style you've surely seen this film. If you're wondering where to start or dip into Allen's works further Broadway Danny Rose is as good a place to begin as any.".

	schema:reviewBody "Upon my initial viewing of Broadway Danny Rose BDR as I will refer to it henceforth when it opened in theaters back in 1984 I recall being somewhat disappointed at this seemingly frothy lightweight film. Sometimes it takes additional viewings to truly appreciate the fine line between lightweight and subtle.  Coming off of the brilliant sorely underappreciated Zelig  and my first disappointing Allen film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy  I approached BDR with highhopes.  I left the theater feeling letdown at it's slapstick approach esp. after Allen's new direction towards serious cinema.  I'm a devotee of his Annie HallpostAnnie Hall films as opposed to his earlier funny films. How wrong was I in thinking I had seen something frivolous and trivial!The absolute beauty of BDR not only comes from once again Gordon Willis' inspired chiaroscuro use of black  white photography and framing Allen's handpicked jazz score succinct editing and crafty art direction but mostly from its marvelous cast of actors  most esp. Mia Farrow's astounding beautifully wrought and precise performance.  Upon subsequent viewings her character's soul literally exudes through the epidermis!  On top of that the socalled slapstick which initially I viewed askance turnedout to be far subtler than its initial impact.  The righton performances by BDR's numerous subcharacters also proved to be far more meaningful and poignant then initially viewed.And that ending....  What an ending!  It has got to be one of the most heartbreaking and romantic finale's in screen history!  I say this with no hyperbole.  I have seen BDR more than twodozen times and it has never failed to bring me to tears as did Annie Hall Manhattan and his subsequent Hannah and Her Sisters.  The start of the scene with Farrow's character confronting a heartbroken Allen is pure beauty and poetry.  The finale of Allen running after Farrow through the wet and roughntumble streets of New York and his inaudible forgiveness in front of the delicatessen is nothing less than magical!In sum sometimes it takes a different perspective in looking at a piece of art to realize that there's much more there than meets the eye.  Sort of like Diane Keaton's character in Manhattan as she pontificated with much zeal over the textural qualities of the steel cube.  Only this time no pontification is needed  Broadway Danny Rose is pure unadulterated romance through and through!  This is a mustsee.  Enjoy!".

Nothing could be further from the truth and this film is testament to this fact.This beautifully shot film is concerned with theatrical agent Danny Rose a man who takes on blind xylophone players and one legged tap dancers. Terrible acts and yet Rose believes in every single one of them no matter how badly they are doing. His big break comes with the public's newfound appetite for nostalgia which brings egomaniac and alcoholic crooner Lou Canova back into the public eye.Canova flourishes and is set to make his comeback complete when he requires Rose to bring his mistress Tina to the concert. Various complications and highjinks ensure that this is no easy task.This is the comedy of the situation and the movie relies on this farce for its comic effect. However what separates this from other substandard films is the characterisation that Allen brings to Rose. At first glance Rose is a loser whose acts leave him as soon as they get anywhere. But the belief he has in his charges and the commitment he is prepared to put into them allows a great deal of empathy for him. Allen plays it brilliantly allowing just the right amount of pathos and charm.A splendid movie full of the typical Allen one liners and with one very very funny shoot out scene with helium.".

Broadway Danny Rose may be considered as a minor Allen's work but it is equally charming and amusing dramedy that pays specific homage to Damon Runyon who is famous for portrayal New York City's colorful lowlifes of the 1920s and '30s when respectability and the demimonde rub shoulders.Danny's problem is that as soon as one of his clients makes it to the top they would drop him in favor of a bigname agent. Danny stuck with a drinking selfcentered Italian crooner Lou who is attempting and just about to make it a comeback and Danny being a loyal and protective agent unwittingly gets involved with the singer's girlfriend Tina whose family has a long memory and strong resemblance to Soprano family. No wonder poor Danny needs a valium the size of a hockey puck. Mia Farrow is almost unrecognizable as a tough and vulgar but not a dumb blonde. Her philosophy is her way of life It's over quick so have a good time. You see what you want go for it. Don't pay attention to anyone else. And do it to the other guy first 'cause if you don't he'll do it to you. She obviously acts on her words but in the end of the movie she realizes that the things which count most in life are acceptance forgiveness love which is Danny's philosophy. She was cast against the type and it worked brilliantly in the funny but touchingly nostalgic movie. Broadway Danny Rose is a sparkling gem from the writerdirectorstar one and only Woody Allen. I never expect anything else from him.".

Broadway Danny Rose is something quite unique I mean that the script is simply beyond belief.  How someone could concieve of all those lines is truly remarkable.  It is one of the most quoteable films I have ever seen.  The lines which are memorable are tinged with this incredible satiric and ironic sense of humor.  The scenes are at once super realistic and very funny.  Woody Allens way of making fun of people is at its best here.  The opening scene where Lou Canova is at the lounge singing I Like The Look Of You... wow the cast of characters assembled how could anyone have found these people.  I guess alot of credit is due to the person who cast the film.  If you look at the credits you see that most of the faces which appear were appearing in their only film.  This is the basis of the movie's genius. Then there are lines like I'll open with Volare and You Make Me Feel So Young... or I don't know whether to go with Boulevard of Broken Dreams or Three Coins in a Fountain as an encore... or Lou's probably drinking out of a promotional sized whiskey bottle by now.. or If anything happens to that car I'll be furious... or He made juice for the mob?... or Allow me to interject one point at this juncture... or Weinstein's majestic bungalow colony is a classy joint I need a classy act how about Sonny Chase he's fast he's funny... or Pee Wee has been eaten by a feline that comes under the act of God clause... or If you take my advice you'll probably be one of the great balloon folding acts of all time.  I really wish I could find this for sale.  It's a film which can be watched repeatedly without risk of boredom or redundancy.  A great film around Thanksgiving time.  Joe Franklin Howard Cosell Milton Berle.  New York City circa 1972.  The Waldorf. The 70's garb.  New Jersey Italians by the dozen.  Angelina the fortune teller and her little dog and assistant. And yet he cares for you... Don't go to him take care of old buisness... Time out...  Lou the directions were good it was a Gulf station...  A cheap blonde Lou... I could keep spouting fragments of the script for an hour and I don't mean to be didactic or facetious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clustered around a table over lunch at New York's Carnegie Deli a group of film critics are having an enthusiastic discussion about Woody Allen who has been among the most influential comedy directors since the 1970s. The group toss around the titles of a few of his films  'Annie Hall' 'Manhattan' 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'  and everybody nods in silent agreement recognising each of these as classics of cinema. A fourth critic emboldened by the candidness of his companions tentatively suggests 'Broadway Danny Rose' but is not quite met with the enthusiasm he had hoped for. These critics it seems cannot quite agree on this particular film.CRITIC A OK you've asked that I explain myself and I personally believe that 'Broadway Danny Rose' is one of the director's best efforts out of the films of his I've seen in any case. The title character played by Allen is a truly tragic figure a dedicated little man who pours his heart and soul into the performers he manages only to be unceremoniously dumped as soon as they make it big. Allen is excellent in the role  as always  and his character is given more than enough witty and quotable lines. You wouldn't think that an ordinarily meek and delicate actress like Mia Farrow could play a hardedged chainsmoking Italian exmob wife like Tina Vitale but she manages to pull it off perfectly. Also spare a moment to consider Nick Apollo Forte in his first and only appearance in a film convincingly portraying Lou Canova the childish drunken hasbeen crooner who thanks to Danny Rose's management is finally making a comeback.CRITIC B I'm afraid I wasn't quite so enthusiastic about the film as you were. Yes the acting was very good but the story itself left a lot to be desired. Danny and Tina's day of adventures involving the Italian gangsters was fun and entertaining but it didn't really amount to anything significant. The only truly memorable part of the film was the final ten or so minutes with Danny ditched by his protg despite all his hard work. Even then the conclusion seemed to be stretched out for too long but I'll admit that it was made up for by Danny's touching silent reconciliation with Tina on a snowy New York street. Additionally I know that Mr. Allen is fond of filming in blackandwhite but it just didn't seem to be serving any real purpose here. Maybe he just thinks that cinema looks better without colour.CRITIC C I'd also like to say a thing or two about 'Broadway Danny Rose.' You just mentioned that the story itself seemed lightweight to you. Perhaps it was and Allen just wanted to deliver some good ol' light entertainment who can forget the hilarious shootout around a leaking helium container?! but that ending is certainly not lightweight and it hits you when you are least expecting it. The film is a very sensitive contemplative exploration of an anguished character Danny Rose is confident and witty on the outside but inside he harbours a large amount of grief. Whenever he pours his heart into an inept performer he loses everything as soon as he has succeeds in making them a star and must start back at the beginning. Perhaps the most depressing thought of all is that he knows that this will never change. This isn't Woody Allen's best movie but I would recommend it without a second thought.Having reached something of an agreement the table of film critics acknowledge their assent with a quiet murmur and return to their lunch. As you've no doubt already noticed these characters are sheltered within my own mind. And believe it or not I actually agree with all of them!".

Mia Farrow turns in a very impressive performance and so does Nick Forte.  I guess the plot needed more zest.  It's not a cliched story but it's quite ordinary.  It's an ordinary romantic comedy with its only twist being the gangster subplot.  I'm not asking for anything spectacular I just wanted more.  Mind you I'm a good fan of Allen's work. In fact I think this movie and Deconstructing Harry are his only films that I've had lessthansatisfying opinions about.  Of course I'm still a budding fan of Woody.  I haven't checked out all his work but I'm constantly more and more curious about the gifted writerdirector with a sharp extremely original sense of humor.  So recently I've been checking out more and more of his moviesold and recent.  Judging by many excellent reviews I've read maybe I'm wrong by calling this a minor work for the great director.  But that's simply the effect it had on me.  Then again many people called Small Time Crooks a very minor work for Allen.  I still thoroughly disagree being that the movie made me laugh more than virtually every comedy I've ever seen!  So I guess it's always a matter of opinion.  My score  6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Broadway Danny Rose other than featuring Woody Allen as a neurotic character attached to the entertainment industry in some fashion has a much wider appeal than much of Allen's other work. Instead of targeting the uppermiddle class with societal rants and characters more concerned with their personal and social lives than anything else Danny Rose is for the workingclass folk a story that aims to humble the Hollywood or Broadway ego that believes that you have to be selfserving to be in show business.The story of the film is told by a bunch of entertainers at the Carnegie Deli in Manhattan reminiscing about Rose Allen an agent for the most obscure acts in New York back in the '50s and '60s. One of them claims to have the best Danny Rose story and his telling serves as narration to the film.The story revolves around Rose and his biggest talent Lou Canova Nick Apollo Forte an oldfashioned Italian crooner doing covers of Sinatra and all kinds of classic tunes from what back then was considered a bygone era but Lou is having a resurgence. Problem is he's an alcoholic and a womanizer. He insists on having the woman he's having an affair with attend his big performance at the Waldorf that could get him a national gig. Other problem is this Tina Mia Farrow was told Lou was cheating on her so now she's run off to her Italian mob family and through strange circumstances the mob wants to knock Danny off.There are elements of classic comedy here which is why the black and white works for Danny Rose. At the same time it's a nostalgic film the early '80s was full of that for Allen and an intimate one.Without spoiling too much the key to Danny Rose relies in the conflict between self interest and dependency on others. In a way it's Allen's way of saying thank you or perhaps apologizing to those that have been part of his personal journey. No one does it alone especially not Danny Rose a character whose living is dependent on the talents and aspirations of others and who lives solely by the advice he remembers from deceased relatives. Then there's Lou who can't perform unless Tina is there but loves his wife dearly and then Tina who can't make any major decision without consulting a psychic elderly woman.Danny Rose has some memorable Woody Allen quotes and classically comical situations such as he and Farrow's Tina wriggling their way out of some ropes tying them together as a former escape artist client of Danny's used to say or when they're chased into the Macy's Day Parade balloon warehouse.The film is simplistic but truthful and it's nice to see Allen make a point that's so universal instead of one about affluent people solving their life crises.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen writes directs and usually stars in at least one movie every year and has for nearly forty years now. He is easily among my top three favorite filmmakers but even if I've yet to see a film of his that is anywhere near bad you can't make that many movies and pack a punch every time. Broadway Danny Rose is a wonderful little dramedy that despite its heartfelt morale is very light on its feet almost like an old Leo McCarey comedy. It is set in a blackandwhite 1970s even though there is a marquee listing Halloween III Season of the Witch but don't most movies have fleeting minor factual errors?One of my favorite things about Woody Allen's movies is the warm realism of the company one keeps while watching them. In Broadway Danny Rose he pinpoints a specific and rarely as acutely portrayed sort of people. The story of Woody Allen's character is told through the simple dialogue of a group of old comedians populating a table at a deli reminiscing about old times. These guys to me are the essential point of reference when using the words chum pal and buddy o' mine. They're middleaged men that will not be bred into a similar sort of mold ever again because they're dialect mannerisms and earthy customary approach to everything are a product of growing up in the early to mid20th century. When it was said that women are the ones made of water and earth elements of emotion and practicality and men were made of fire and air metaphors for energetic expression mentality and sociability these were the ones they were talking about. Having grown up with parents and an uncle from that generation knowing their friends I was reminded of the coziness and complete absence of pressure in sitting around talking with that kind of easy mild expected value sort of man and Woody Allen writes and directs them with an endearing and intelligent notability.The love of the company doesn't just taper away after the kitchensinkstyle deli comedian narrators sort of a device I would imagine in a Cassavetes film if Cassavetes ever used narration. Woody Allen's character Danny Rose the man with the thankless job of doing everything he can to harbor his acts and make them successful no matter how ridiculous and hopeless they are. He goes out of his way just out of heart to keep them happy and focused on their careers only to be used a stepping stone and a laughing stock. But he keeps pushing new acts and never thinking of building up a shell or an edge with them. He keeps himself available in every way. The movie's farce comes from his beautiful self sacrificial motive to keep his especially selfcentered Italian crooner played effectively by Nick ApolloForte focused and satisfied for his shortly upcoming performance even though the gigantically risky thing Danny must do only comes out of the latently aware musthave everythingmyway mentality of ApolloForte.The film is not a suffocatingly sidesplitting masterpiece like many of Woody's other comedies but it does have its great moments and oneliners. Allen at one point refers to his aunt as looking like something you would find in a live bait store. One of his best yet don't you think? There's a great non sequitur in the middle of being chased by a Mafia hit man where because of an odd objectless circumstance a sequence of dialogue that would normally be a serious obligatory piece of the plot is spoken by Woody Allen Mia Farrow and said hit man all in high pitch as an effect of the inhalation of leaking helium. What a great way to spice up what would've been a rather dull only necessary scene.".

Tina is at a party at Johnny's house when Danny finds her. Mistakenly thinking he's lost Tina to Danny Johnny drinks iodine in an hilarious scene where his mother puts a curse on Danny  using the word feared by Italians worldwide  MALOCCHIA. You have to watch the film to see where Barney Dunn fits in.There's no other word to describe this film but hilarious. The movie opens with a conversation in a deli between some comedians including Corbett Monica Jackie Gayle Sandy Baron etc. reminiscing about Danny Rose.

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen is Danny Rose the fervent yet hapless manager of a bunch of desperate veterans artists who try to make their 'Broadway' in the cruel world of entertainment. There is a lousy ventriloquist with a stammer who can't even grab the attention of kids during birthday parties one is such an expert in hypnosis that he can't even awaken his victims there is also a balloontoddler a glass player  pianoplaying birds and Lou Canova a hasbeen Italian lounge singer who sings an unbearably catchy tarantella called Agita. These artists are so lousy that the premise of Broadway Danny Rose is already funny by itself and it does provide some of the best jokes of the film but as we get deeper in the film we can see that Woody Allen doesn't make these jokes for pure comedic sake. There is a little heart beating within the story of Danny Rose a tale about a man who more than anyone loves his job and even more loves the people he happens to manage.Broadway Danny Rose carries the same charm as Tim Burton's Ed Wood the film about the worst director of all time who fulfilled his passion of making films and loved it. This is the core of Danny Rose's story told in flashback by a group of comedians eating in Carnegie's Deli. And the more we get into it the better we understand their enthusiasm and their fondness toward the man. They do tell funny stories but we know they don't laugh at him but at the crazy situations provoked by his total dedication to his job. In fact they all respect both the artist and the man. And the 'greatest story' about Danny Rose is simply the tribute to a man who took his job so personally that he gave letters of nobility to the notion of 'personal manager' maybe the only profession where you can't hide behind the eternal it's not personal alibi his business is strictly personal and his devotion to reconcile Lou Canova Nick Apollo Forte to his mistress Tina Vitale Mia Farrow forces the admiration. Danny never abandons his artist in fact he doesn't even consider 'abandoning' as an option.But I make the film sound too serious while I was just praising its most underrated value. Overall the film is purely and simply Woody Allen's comedic talent back on the road. After the depressing Interiors the dreadful Stardust Memories and the perplexing A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy hardly are the highlights of Allen's career Broadway Danny Rose seals the rebirth of a comical treasure and the starting of his greatest cinematic streak. Followed by The Purple Rose of Cairo Hannah and Her Sisters and Radio Days the 80's are marked by a Woody Allen at the top of his game able to mix between comedy romance and life introspections with an extraordinary combination of wit and creativity. And it all starts with the adventure of Danny Rose the man who'd struggle to be 'the beard' in agents' jargon's to pretend to be the boyfriend of Tina Mia Farrow barely recognizable as the typical Italian mob girl. The situation worsens when Danny fails to explain to a jealous Italian gangster in love with Tina that he's only 'the beard' which gets him in a catandmouse chase with the Italian mob. Danny Rose's adventure with Tina occupies three quarters of the film where every single Allen's line is pure comedic gold so perfectly written it never even distract from the narrative.One of the most famous exchanges occurs when he quotes his Rabbi who used to say that we're all guilty in the eyes of God. Tina asks him Do you believe in God? to which Rose retorts No no. But I'm guilty over it. The line is not only hilarious but it's totally fitting the discussion about guilt and the fact that Tina could never feel guilty foreshadows the emotional payoff at the ending when she would realize that 'she did something wrong'. Without having the depth of a character study Broadway Danny Rose features a series of jokes that work whether you take them in or out of their context. At one part he asks if a man who was shot in the eyes went blind before realizing that the bullet had to come through this is not just hilarious but it also highlights in a very smart way his total antiviolent nature and inoffensiveness comparing a field of reeds to Vietnam or himself to Moses and refusing to go on the water because he's a landlocked Hebrew. You'll have a hard time to figure if it's the adventure that carry the gags or viceversa and it's as impossible as thinking of the comedic effect of a shootout in a helium factory without smiling.Gangsters streetwise Italian 'broad' tarantellas Family there is a strong Italian feel in the film as if Allen decided to parody the archetypes of Italian to better highlight the bizarreness of his 'Jewishness' in an ethnic mess and it marvelously works because Woody Allen has an incredible talent to use ethnic humor every time with a lighthearted wit and the appealing wisdom of selfderision. The whole film is an exaggeration of cultural traits and stereotypes but is it surprising when the main character is a man with an exaggerated passion for his job and a more curious exaggerated faith in his artists' talent no matter how bad they are. Danny Rose is the last rampart to resist Broadway's unflappable moneyoriented policy an independent worker maybe an embodiment of Woody Allen's vision of himself in the world of Cinema. And after his experimental takes on Fellini Bergman or Shakespeare we realize that Woody Allen is never as great as when he's being himself a true author in the field of comedy wit and creativity. And Broadway Danny Rose is one of his best.".

	schema:headline " Modest But Ingratiating Allen Effort Features an Effectively Blowsy Farrow";
	schema:reviewBody "Mia Farrow is the big surprise in this minorleague Woody Allen comedy from 1984. Before he started deifying Hannah and Her Sisters and then skewering Husbands and Wives her image as the consummate caretaker he cast her against type as Tina Vitale a brassy Mafioso widow in this frequently funny paean to Allen's days on the Borscht Belt in the 1950's. She is the mistress of a loutish Vegastype performer named Lou Canova who is represented by his woefully unsuccessful agent Danny Rose. Danny gets Lou a big break a high profile gig at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel at which Milton Berle is to attend and Lou insists that Danny take Tina to the show. Complications ensue as when Tina's mob connections think she and Danny are a couple and much of the brief 84minute movie is about the chase  which is frequently hilarious.My favorite scene is when Tina and Danny are trapped by a thug in a huge warehouse where Macy's stores their Thanksgiving Day floats and their voices break into a helium pitch when the bullets hit the air tanks. As Tina Farrow submerges herself so completely in the role that in hindsight it seems a shame she didn't push for a greater variety in her film roles. For once Allen plays a completely sympathetic character a nice guy caught up in ludicrous circumstances that are truly not of his own doing. I am not sure who Nick Apollo Forte is but he is completely convincing as Lou especially when he's onstage singing like Tony Bennett and acting like Vegas mainstay Danny Gans.As a framing device for the story Allen assembled several famous comics at the Carnegie Deli to talk about Danny's story. Led by Sandy Baron who later played Jerry's father's adversary on Seinfeld they are the ones who usually played the Catskills hotel showrooms and showed up on the Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960's. Speaking of which I assume the story takes place sometime in the 1970's but I'm not sure since Allen really does nothing to the set designs to make it feel like a period piece. Allen also jettisons his standard jazz score for the Italianate lounge music that Lou sings. The ending is surprisingly poignant given the shenanigans that precede it. Within his filmography this is definitely one of his more modest efforts but along with Sleeper The Purple Rose of Cairo and Manhattan Murder Mystery it's also one of his most ingratiating comedies. Other than the film's trailer there are no extras with the DVD package.".

I didn't particularly like any of the film's main characters either although Allen's downtrodden talent manager the eponymous Danny Rose tries hard peddling washed up ventriloquists and glassesplaying blondes as if they're the next big thing. Danny's subTony Bennett type cabaret singerclient and his extramarital girlfriend Mia Farrow probably deserve each other before the conclusion where wouldn't you know Farrow can't get Danny out of her mind and on Thanksgiving Day natch returns out the blue or here grey to seek his forgiveness which natch 2 she duly gets. The fact that there appeared to be almost zeroconnectivity between them beforehand makes this ending all the harder to take in. Good to be Woody I guess  how many other short redhaired ordinary looking guys get the girl as much as he does in his films.Truth be told this emotional drama very much takes second fiddle to a ramshackle plot involving chase scenes family feuds revenge beatings and an assortment of oddball characters as Jewish and Italian cultures clash only without sparks flying. Only the shootout on helium scene brought a smile to my face at all but other equally obvious comic setpieces like Allen and Farrow being tied up together patently fail while I failed to detect a single memorable line of dialogue in what is a very talky film.In its favour Gordon Willis' monochrome cinematography is beautiful to behold especially one rainflecked shot outside a theatre boulevard of broken dreams indeed and Allen's direction mixes extreme closeups to distant tracking shots in one shot you hear Rose's dialogue with his companion minutes before you actually pick them out on a busy city street with a degree of flair but I found it a rambling shambling film caught between the arthouse and slapstick failing at both.".

	schema:headline " The critics the audiences and the director were all wrong about this oneit's excellent";
	schema:reviewBody "When I got home from a screening of THE FAN I sat down to reread Lady Windermere's Fan and came to the conclusion that the film is significantly better than the play. I don't think this opinion is as heretical as it sounds. Wilde's literary reputation rests largely on his exquisite aphorisms and his one perfect work The Importance of Being Earnest my nominee for the funniest play ever written. Before he hit his stride with Earnest Wilde's plays were an awkward hybrid of sophisticated comedy and stilted melodrama with creaky plots that heavyhandedly flogged their worthy message of tolerance. There is always a woman with a past an acidulous dandy a shameful secret and a selfrighteous young man or woman who has to come to terms with that secret.Otto Preminger seems like a poor choice to interpret Wilde. He did not have a light touch and anyone expecting sly frothy comedy from THE FAN will be disappointed. Watch the Lubitsch silent version instead. Preminger downplays the comedyofmanners aspect without eliminating or destroying it but he succeeds in translating the cardboard melodrama into something subtle complex and moving. Preminger's gift was for creating ensembles in shades of gray with no black villains or white heroes. Here the whole cast is tampeddown and naturalistic there is no mannered camp about the comedy and no teethmarks on the scenery after the dramatic peaks.The first half of the film is original setting up the situation that the play lays in our laps in its first scene. To begin with there is a framing device set in contemporary postwar London where the octogenarian Mrs. Erlynn Madeleine Carroll discovers the fan at an auction of unclaimed property from bombed buildings. In order to reclaim her property she has to prove ownership so she tracks down Lord Darlington George Sanders now a doddering museum piece living in a remnant of his former home. We learn that Lord and Lady Windermere were killed in the Blitz that the two worldly ambiguous characters have survived the pure couple feels appropriate to a changed world. The frame gives the costumedrama portion a wistful edge instead of the usual Hollywood gloss here the past gleams through nostalgia like a flower buried in a paperweight.The flashback unfolds as Mrs. Erlynn relates her story to the reluctant and skeptical Lord Darlington. George Sanders might seem like almost too obvious a choice to play this role. Some of the dialogue As a wicked man I am a complete failure. In fact there are some people who say I have never done anything really wrong in my life. Of course they only say it behind my back might have been written for that inimitable drysherry voice at once rich acid and smooth. But Sanders like the rest of the cast does not lean on wit delivering the bon mots casually almost under his breath. Instead he comes as close as I've ever seen him to suggesting raw feeling behind the polished facade of disdainful boredom. As Lady Windermere delicate Jeanne Crain turns the tiresomely shrill uncompromising puritan of the play into a fresh gentle innocent a young woman of innate but untested fineness. It's like watching a paper doll come to life.But this is Madeleine Carroll's movie. All too often relegated to decorative roles here she gives a nuanced performance as a complicated woman flirtatious scheming unscrupulous but ultimately brave and compassionate proud but stricken with inconsolable regret. She manages the motherlove scenes with compelling emotion never sliding into sentimentality. As a young woman Mrs. Erlynn left her husband and child for another man breaking her husband's heart. In middle age still relying on youthful allure and trailing a scandalous reputation she returns to London. She is not above blackmailing her daughter's wealthy husband Lord Windermere who gives her large sums of money to spare his wife from learning the truth about her idealized mother whom she believes is dead. Gossip turns this transaction into an affair and Lady Windermere is devastated when she believes her handsome young husband has betrayed her.Interestingly the film shows Lord W. initially attracted by Mrs. Erlynn suggesting he is no plaster saint. But he hardly deserves the agony of having to choose between losing his wife's trust or destroying her illusions about her mother. Meanwhile Lord Darlington seizes on the alleged infidelity to declare his love for Lady W. and beg her to leave her husband for him. Would he really have devoted his life to her or would he have abandoned her after a year as Mrs. Erlynn suspects? We're never sure but we believe that he still regrets losing her. This must be one of the few cases in which the movie version of a literary work has a less happy ending than the original.

	onyx:emotionText "When I got home from a screening of THE FAN I sat down to reread Lady Windermere's Fan and came to the conclusion that the film is significantly better than the play. I don't think this opinion is as heretical as it sounds. Wilde's literary reputation rests largely on his exquisite aphorisms and his one perfect work The Importance of Being Earnest my nominee for the funniest play ever written. Before he hit his stride with Earnest Wilde's plays were an awkward hybrid of sophisticated comedy and stilted melodrama with creaky plots that heavyhandedly flogged their worthy message of tolerance. There is always a woman with a past an acidulous dandy a shameful secret and a selfrighteous young man or woman who has to come to terms with that secret.Otto Preminger seems like a poor choice to interpret Wilde. He did not have a light touch and anyone expecting sly frothy comedy from THE FAN will be disappointed. Watch the Lubitsch silent version instead. Preminger downplays the comedyofmanners aspect without eliminating or destroying it but he succeeds in translating the cardboard melodrama into something subtle complex and moving. Preminger's gift was for creating ensembles in shades of gray with no black villains or white heroes. Here the whole cast is tampeddown and naturalistic there is no mannered camp about the comedy and no teethmarks on the scenery after the dramatic peaks.The first half of the film is original setting up the situation that the play lays in our laps in its first scene. To begin with there is a framing device set in contemporary postwar London where the octogenarian Mrs. Erlynn Madeleine Carroll discovers the fan at an auction of unclaimed property from bombed buildings. In order to reclaim her property she has to prove ownership so she tracks down Lord Darlington George Sanders now a doddering museum piece living in a remnant of his former home. We learn that Lord and Lady Windermere were killed in the Blitz that the two worldly ambiguous characters have survived the pure couple feels appropriate to a changed world. The frame gives the costumedrama portion a wistful edge instead of the usual Hollywood gloss here the past gleams through nostalgia like a flower buried in a paperweight.The flashback unfolds as Mrs. Erlynn relates her story to the reluctant and skeptical Lord Darlington. George Sanders might seem like almost too obvious a choice to play this role. Some of the dialogue As a wicked man I am a complete failure. In fact there are some people who say I have never done anything really wrong in my life. Of course they only say it behind my back might have been written for that inimitable drysherry voice at once rich acid and smooth. But Sanders like the rest of the cast does not lean on wit delivering the bon mots casually almost under his breath. Instead he comes as close as I've ever seen him to suggesting raw feeling behind the polished facade of disdainful boredom. As Lady Windermere delicate Jeanne Crain turns the tiresomely shrill uncompromising puritan of the play into a fresh gentle innocent a young woman of innate but untested fineness. It's like watching a paper doll come to life.But this is Madeleine Carroll's movie. All too often relegated to decorative roles here she gives a nuanced performance as a complicated woman flirtatious scheming unscrupulous but ultimately brave and compassionate proud but stricken with inconsolable regret. She manages the motherlove scenes with compelling emotion never sliding into sentimentality. As a young woman Mrs. Erlynn left her husband and child for another man breaking her husband's heart. In middle age still relying on youthful allure and trailing a scandalous reputation she returns to London. She is not above blackmailing her daughter's wealthy husband Lord Windermere who gives her large sums of money to spare his wife from learning the truth about her idealized mother whom she believes is dead. Gossip turns this transaction into an affair and Lady Windermere is devastated when she believes her handsome young husband has betrayed her.Interestingly the film shows Lord W. initially attracted by Mrs. Erlynn suggesting he is no plaster saint. But he hardly deserves the agony of having to choose between losing his wife's trust or destroying her illusions about her mother. Meanwhile Lord Darlington seizes on the alleged infidelity to declare his love for Lady W. and beg her to leave her husband for him. Would he really have devoted his life to her or would he have abandoned her after a year as Mrs. Erlynn suspects? We're never sure but we believe that he still regrets losing her. This must be one of the few cases in which the movie version of a literary work has a less happy ending than the original. The elimination of Mrs. Erlynn's lastminute marriage suits the darker sadder more mature tone of the filmand since we see her in hale old age we know that she landed on her feet somehow.

Nevertheless she is a survivor and in her eighties she will be able to make a balance and reflect on that crucial episode of her past. Madeleine Carroll and George Sanders are perfectly cast as the middleage charmers and schemers and also sound believable as the frail but smart octogenarian survivors and deliver great performances on the hands of Preminger who is able to maintain a good rhythm and to capture what we might figure is the Victorian society's aristocratic milieu of gossips and intrigues. I also enjoyed Martita Hunt as a typical upperclass eccentric manipulative and witty matron and thought that both Richard Greene and Jeanne Crain were OK as the younger Windemere couple. I think that this underrated little gem deserves a wider distribution. I am very lucky that in Spain the DVD of The Fan has been released in September 2007.".

I particularly liked the long take of Sanders and Crain on the balcony while dancers whirl slightly out of focus in the ballroom below. It's certainly not Otto's fault that the movie is overcluttered with dialogue and that Wilde's wit has been drained off and that many of the players have little charisma and are just plain dull. Miss Crain for instance could be described as a dull actress in a dull part. Yes in all the movie is rather disappointing but it's a good example of how NOT to adapt a Victorian comedy of manners. Don't try to make it topical. That just dates it all the more. When Googie Withers revived The Circle she actually set it BACK to the 1890s.

	schema:reviewBody "Save for the casting of Jeanne Crain who was too white bread and too American to be a proper English lady this version of Lady Windermere's Fan this is a decent enough production. It could also have used the lighter touch of Ernest Lubitsch instead of Otto Preminger.Simply entitled The Fan Oscar Wilde's plot is told in flashback by two of the surviving principals of the story. Madeleine Carroll as the adventuress Mrs. Erlynne and the cynical Lord Darlington played by the always cynical George Sanders. Both have survived into the post World War II era in their dotage and it takes a while for Sanders to realize who is this old woman pursuing him. In her younger days Mrs. Erlynne was quite the adventuress looking to break into London society by whatever means.

Madeleine Carroll as the adventuress Mrs. Erlynne and the cynical Lord Darlington played by the always cynical George Sanders. Both have survived into the post World War II era in their dotage and it takes a while for Sanders to realize who is this old woman pursuing him.

Unfortunately the first third of the film was rather disappointing...almost dull. But then the mystery begins and things get far more interesting  why is Richard Geene paying large sums of money to Madeleine Carroll? Is it an affair? Almost certainly...except that it isn't.Jeanne Crain was in my view one of the loveliest actresses of her era and she shines here although I would say this film is more of an ensemble cast than a star vehicle. Madeleine Carroll  in her last film  is absolutely riveting here not to mention mysterious. It's a rather odd film for George Sanders in that he's the character he so often played in the parts of the film that are flashbacks but a very elderly gentleman for much of the story. Richard Greene whose career pretty much stalled after the way was still doing nicely here...a fine and underrated actor though this is far from his best role.I was a little disappointed at the end of the film that we have no idea what happened to Jeanne Crain and Richard Greene. Dead in the war? We never know.Personally I slightly preferred the 2004 film adaptation of the Oscar Wilde story  A Good Woman which takes place in Italy. It starred Helen Hunt Scarlett Johansson and Tom Wilkinson. It had its own flaws but it didn't suffer from the first third of the film being awkward. Although I thought the rest of the Jeanne Crain version was better. Kind of a toss up really.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan isn't one of his best pieces of work and this film shortened to The Fan isn't the best adaptation of it and has the unfortunate position of having been made in between two betterregarded filmed versions of two of Wilde's betterregarded masterpieces the 1945 The Picture of Dorian Gray based on the author's only novel and the 1952 The Importance of Being Earnest based on his most celebrated play. The 1945 film particularly is a beautiful piece of art and a nearperfect adaptation as is Ernst Lubitsch's 1925 silent version of Lady Windermere's Fan.Despite the loss of Wilde's words including the famous epigrams Lubitsch's film retains the spirit of the playwright's wit visually. It even improves upon it as the play is rather uneven in its holding up Victorianage high society for ridicule while ultimately becoming itself rather VIctorian in its moralistic resolution of motherhood. A similar fault befalls this 1949 reworking. Its added presentday framing narrative where Mrs. Erlynne and Lord Darlington rather literally take a walk down memory lane places Wilde's story as a quaint relic but one filled with nostalgia of better times before the country was ravished by war. This takes the satirical bite out of the comedy of manners which otherwise the film follows rather faithfully at firstbefore its resolution falters even more than the original play into melodramatics. The film's latter acts are full of characters either yelling at each other or acting selfrighteously while the musical score is turned up to bombastic levels. Compare this to how Lubitsch's film managed to retain its light tone even while managing a more poignant scene of selfsacrifice.Like the 1925 version as well as the 1916 one before it The Fan opens up the play which helps prevent it from appearing stagy even though it looks like a Bpicture in comparison to the 1945 prestige production The Picture of Dorian Gray or to Lubitsch's version with the director's characteristic insistence upon grand sets including absurdly gigantic doors. I do like one shot in The Fan in particular though which happens when the narration changes to Lord Darlington's memory the camera moves from the present to the past as seen through a window. Besides the flashback structure the remembered past begins before where the play started as do the other film versions and there are other added scenes of Mrs. Erlynne's interactions with the male characters and a fencing match which serves to stage her scandalous effect on society. Much of this is very similar to the 1925 film despite being slightly altered. The fencing match for instance replaces a similarlypurposed scene at the horse track in the 1925 version which itself was a bit of a reworking of a dogshow scene in the 1916 one. I'm certainly not opposed to The Fan adapting earlier filmed versions as well as the play but I don't think it does a very good job of it. The horsetrack scene is impressively constructed in Lubitsch's film with its series of looks and mocked gossiping underpinning a narrative based on dramatic irony and misconceptions. The fencing scene here by contrast is quite dull.The acting is OK I suppose but the problem is that Wilde's characters were never much developed originally they come off as mouthpieces for the author's aphorisms as variously stated by several different persons. Besides eliminating Wilde's words the 1925 version helps to alleviate this with Irene Rich's Mrs. Erlynne who follows in the tradition of the cinematic vamp or flapper type as the play was updated to the thenmodern day. Not so here. Even George Sanders who is my favorite screen version of Lord Henry from Wilde's novel cannot save Lord Darlington who always seems to me to be quite a bore of a cad. Martina Hunt is rather surprisingly good in the more minor role of the Duchess though as the film gets some amusement out of her relationship with her obedient daughter Agatha.".

The quartet drives with the boy to a camping area in Maine closed in the cold winter where they are individually disturbed by whispers that affects their behaviors until Max discloses the dark secret about David and his mother.Whisper is a very effective horror movie that scares without explicit violence or gore. The association of the fallen angel David and the Antichrist Damien from The Omen is quite immediate but the creepy story is engaging and developed in a suitable pace. The young actor Blake Woodruff has a topnotch performance in the role of the evil soul collector and the acting and direction are solid. The twist with the identity of the leader of the kidnappers is a great unpredictable plot point. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Refns do Mal Hostages of the Evil".

However the bank refuses to loan US 50000.00 to them and without alternatives Max accepts the invitation of his former partner Sydney Michael Rooker and his associate Vince Joel Edgerton to participate in the kidnapping of the eight year old David Blake Woodruff the son of a wealthy woman in New England under the command of a mysterious leader. The quartet drives with the boy to a camping area in Maine closed in the cold winter where they are individually disturbed by whispers that affects their behaviors until Max discloses the dark secret about David and his mother.Whisper is a very effective horror movie that scares without explicit violence or gore. The association of the fallen angel David and the Antichrist Damien from The Omen is quite immediate but the creepy story is engaging and developed in a suitable pace. The young actor Blake Woodruff has a topnotch performance in the role of the evil soul collector and the acting and direction are solid. The twist with the identity of the leader of the kidnappers is a great unpredictable plot point. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Refns do Mal Hostages of the Evil";

As for the movie itselfI liked it and it was better then I thought it would be.It has good solid acting and an original idea.It would have made a great Omen sequel since Damien was orphaned at the end and he would have gone to another family anyway and raised hell! His name could have been changed after his adoption.....But Whisper is is a good movie on it's own.And after seeing it I understand the title of the movie.Before I watched it I had an idea about the plot.I knew a young boy was kidnapped and was held hostage by 4 kidnappers and unknown to them the boy wasn't as innocent as they thought.He had a way of tapping into their minds and turning them against one another.I anxiously wanted to see it to see how an 8 year old could outsmart them.I started thinking about another movie I saw called hard candy where a young conniving girl managed to use her mind to turn against the pedophile she was stalking. Well after watching it I realized they were 2 completely different movies and that Whisper was more like the Omen and that David was actually something from Hell.Well indeed he did get even with the ones that kidnapped him and hatched a diabolical plan to carefully destroy them one by one! I think one of the reasons this movie works is because of the evil background music and seriousness of it rather than being brated or movie of the week like.Blake Woodruff did a very good and convincing portrayal of this not so innocent boy. The one problem I had was the beginning seemed rushed and there was a very quick line about David's father dying and him being adopted and all of his nannies dying mysteriously.This was quite confusing because it doesn't really explain where he came from and how he became what he was.At least in the Omen there is a back story and Damien had an origin but with David it's a mystery.I think this could have been explored better.And after seeing the alternate endingI have to say I prefer it better because you can't kill that type of evil.How can an ordinary guy like MaxJosh Hollowaydefeat David's powers so easily where his associates couldn't! Whoever decided on the ending was wrong.The alternate ending is more satisfying and just fits better with the whole story.And another thing tothose extended scenes were better and more detailed  the first 2 deleted scenes should have stayed in the movie also for continuity and to make things a little less confusing.It is a shame that there isn't an option on a DVD to add the extended  deleted scenes back into the movieand pick the ending you prefer.I really like this movie but felt nothing should have been cut outand the alternate ending should have been used!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always enjoyed the evilvsevil subgenre even though the plot eventually turns into a classic goodvsevil struggle. Those films are rare and that much sweeter when they do show up. A demon in the guise of an 8 yearold boy gets kidnapped and ends up having a lot of fun  along with the viewer  with this luckless captors. Most evil children horror flicks suck either because the kids are awful actors or simply due to the fact that when children perpetrate grievous evil deeds they look as ridiculous as talkinggunwielding monkeys in futuristic scifi bombs. There are always the pleasant exceptions though. Certainly some people will moan about this being too much like The Omen but Whisper is far better than that movie. It also has a finale somewhat reminiscent of The Shining but who cares.The kidnappers are a mixed bag as was to be expected. A small minus is the fact that half of them are far too nice to be snatching other people's children for ransom. The female kidnapper hasn't got a bad bone in her body in reality such a woman would be more akin to an Aileen Wournos than a Mother Theresa. Well actually Mother Theresa was more demonic that ten of those demon kids combined but I use her name to make a point and not to unblemish her tarnished name. Her boyfriend is also far too nice to be a former felon. But there you go  that's leftwing Hollywood for you they always have and always will either glamourize the criminal mind or trivializediminish hisher evil. Not that this movie has any political agenda  for once. It's becoming difficult these days to find an American movie that doesn't contain at least an ounce of liberal propaganda and this goes even for the horror genre. I like the fact that they didn't get the kid to overact. I mean the director could have easily shown him Nicholas Cage or John Travolta films or both FaceOff to inspire him to mug and grimace like a bloody buffoon  which is doubly worse when a kid in a horror thriller does it. Instead the kid merely throws a subtle smirk here and there which says a thousand words. The movie has a strange tiny subplot involving the rivalry between two detectives working on the case. No idea why they threw that in.".

Well actually Mother Theresa was more demonic that ten of those demon kids combined but I use her name to make a point and not to unblemish her tarnished name. Her boyfriend is also far too nice to be a former felon. But there you go  that's leftwing Hollywood for you they always have and always will either glamourize the criminal mind or trivializediminish hisher evil. Not that this movie has any political agenda  for once. It's becoming difficult these days to find an American movie that doesn't contain at least an ounce of liberal propaganda and this goes even for the horror genre. I like the fact that they didn't get the kid to overact. I mean the director could have easily shown him Nicholas Cage or John Travolta films or both FaceOff to inspire him to mug and grimace like a bloody buffoon  which is doubly worse when a kid in a horror thriller does it. Instead the kid merely throws a subtle smirk here and there which says a thousand words. The movie has a strange tiny subplot involving the rivalry between two detectives working on the case. No idea why they threw that in.";

Whisper was a very well put together film with great performances from all the actors. Josh Holloway Lost and Sarah Wayne Callies Prison Break put in really good performances as 2 of the kidnappers but I think the most praise has to be given to Blake Woodruff the young boy who played David. To be able to pull off a role like that as convincingly as he did at such a young age I believe Blake was 11 when filming took place even though he was only 8 in the film requires a special talent and I believe this kid has it! Look out for him in the future.I won't spoil the plot totally but what I will say is this See this film! You won't regret it! The ONLY gripe I have is that I would have preferred the alternate ending being used. That also seems to be the general consensous of people i've spoken to who have seen it too. The ending that was used didn't flow as much with the plot than the alternate I won't reveal why but you'll find out if you watch it. So watch it! 10 outta 10. And one of my favourite films!".

But if you've got a few hours to kill and there's nothing else on you could find worse movies.";

A little background would've been good though it isn't necessary for the story other than giving some explanation to the audience.There are a few shock moments making one jump and more than enough psychological moments as when Roxanne is trapped in a shower with a wolf sniffing outside the open bathroom door.All in all an expected good shocker of a psychological drama.".

The kidnappers are in my book scum because kidnapping is not cool at all. IMO these kidnappers deserve to die. So when the Damienlike child started toying with these criminals I wasn't terrified or on the edge of my seat. I couldn't care less about what was going to happen to them because well they're scum. So where's the horror element to the story? Exactly. This is NOT a horror film. You need to empathize with the characters' plight in order for the horror elements to work properly. This never happened in the whole super slick film.The kidnappers were all good looking and young so I guess that's how the director thought viewers would sympathize with these criminals. Oh no don't kill that beautiful babe. Don't kill that Metrosexual guy with the white belt.Yep one of the kidnappers actually wears a white belt. How gruff. How much time did the wardrobe department spend on this unintentionally funny detail? Was it an inside joke? I couldn't concentrate on anything else other than the white belt when that character was terrorized on the frozen lake. Okay enough with the white belt.Obviously influenced by Japanese horror films WHISPER is more about mood and creating suspense than gore and violence. Think of this as a Japanese version of THE OMEN there are two death scenes which are identical to those in DAMIEN OMEN 2. But it even failed at that. As anemic as the story was no one notices the massive painting in the room? what are those wolves about anyway? the main problem was the idea itself. The film could have worked if the writers actually knew something about horror or how to play with guilt vis a vis kidnapping and other human emotions but the drama fell flat. And because the horror never registered WHISPER was doubly forgettable.In the end it's just one of the many boneheaded horror films made these days!Notice the big disparity in the Useful Comments compared to the other reviews. I guess the crew has been logging in and voting not useful! LOL!".

I'm glad to say Whisper really hits a bullseye in that field because Blake Woodruff is an intensely frightening kid who nails every scene he's in. He's almost as scary as Harvey Stephens from The Omen the movie Whisper so transparently tries to ape. In fact Woodruff is almost too good because it's incredibly frustrating how nobody ever picks up on his evilness. You know that scene from every slasher ever where you're supposed to yell don't go in there! when a character's being stupid? Whisper gives you that feeling for pretty much its entire running time and nobody listens here either. Doesn't change the fact that it's quite entertaining though because the scares are very welldone despite the overuse of dream sequences and the finale gives you everything you could want from this kind of Bmovie.

As such when you evaluate his films you do so by focusing on the technical merits.  Personally I find his disconnected editing and surreal lighting styles to be amazing.  Suzuki's skill turns what is otherwise a laughable boiler plate film noir into something more.  The lighting and editing make the exclamations that the script doesn't and the decision to shoot the final scene in a boxing ring is brilliant.It was entertaining to watch person after person jump up and down about the originality of Ghost Dog with no mention of the fact that Jarmusch lifted one of the assassination sequences unchanged from Branded to Kill.

Anyway the usually reliable No. 3 I would assume anyway considering he ranks third in what is bound to be a pretty difficult business botches an assassination attempt when a butterfly lands on the barrel of his sniper rifle obscuring the view of his target. Because of this he becomes the target of the famed No. 1 Killer. No. 1 decides to toy with his prey first going so far as to move in No. 3 providing just about the only entertainment in the film.Suzuki hurtles the story through space and time at an incredibly brisk pace particularly in the first half hour often refusing to take the time to set up locations and situations causing a rather confusing sense of geography for many scenes. The action takes place in a similarly disjointed manner. Sometimes things happen so quickly they seem like the filmic equivalent of runon sentences. Or perhaps a better way to put it would be that Suzuki is that guy we all know who tells stories too fast jumping over and skipping around some of the small details the little ones that help the story make sense. Perhaps in a way Suzuki is not interested in perpetuating the illusion of the motion picture and wants us to remember that we are just watching a movie. I personally think he's just being lazy. Though he does seem to have some sense of composition sometimes creating fantastic images. But just as often his use of blocking becomes irritating.Eventually Suzuki slows down a bit and begins to construct something interesting.

	schema:headline " Suave killer distortion of space and time";
	schema:reviewBody "After viewing Seijin Suzuki I thought This guy violates the classic narrative rules of space time and hell motivation.  And it's so damn hip. The sex scenes are a wonderful example of this phenominon Hanada and his wife are having sex.  Sometimes Hanada is sniffing rice sometimes they're making love on the stairs sometimes his wife is complaining about how Hanada's only sweet to her when they're in bed then they're back to making love.  They could have been in that house procreating for five minutes they could have been at it for weeks.  The location shifts so much from shot to shot that the experience of time becomes altered and it adds a lot to the quirky hip atmosphere of the film.Instead of letting information sink in Suzuki just keeps the ball rolling with the character developement and the plot progression.  There's a scene where Harada has to kill three people in different parts of the city and not five minutes later they're all dead.  No lengthy exposition no set up no explaination just plot point and resolution in such quick sucession that I got the feeling that these scenes weren't important at all.  I could have seen Harada shopping and while it wouldn't have been as exciting I get the sense that shopping would have the same effect as assassination on Harada's character.Not that Harada's entirely heartless.  It's just all part of the style of Branded to Kill.".

	onyx:emotionText "After viewing Seijin Suzuki I thought This guy violates the classic narrative rules of space time and hell motivation.  And it's so damn hip. The sex scenes are a wonderful example of this phenominon Hanada and his wife are having sex.  Sometimes Hanada is sniffing rice sometimes they're making love on the stairs sometimes his wife is complaining about how Hanada's only sweet to her when they're in bed then they're back to making love.  They could have been in that house procreating for five minutes they could have been at it for weeks.  The location shifts so much from shot to shot that the experience of time becomes altered and it adds a lot to the quirky hip atmosphere of the film.Instead of letting information sink in Suzuki just keeps the ball rolling with the character developement and the plot progression.  There's a scene where Harada has to kill three people in different parts of the city and not five minutes later they're all dead.

	schema:reviewBody "I noticed that all the reviewers liked this movieand some absolutely adored it. I guess I'll be the dissenting voice as I thought that a movie that tries so hard to be weird and incomprehensible is not worth my trouble. After all several admitted that the narrative made little sense and the movie needed to be seen repeatedly in order to fully understand it. I say why bother. If I cannot understand a movie and am confused by it my first instinct is NOT to see it again! In many ways this film looks almost as if JeanLuc Godard took drugs went to Japan and made a film. And if you like this sort of bizarre fare then by all means watch it. I just want a film that makes some sense! The film is about an assassin who looks like a giant hamster because of his freakish looking cheeks J Shishidowho actually paid to have plastic surgery to give his this look. He is somehow considered the 3 assassin in Japan though I didn't realize that there was any sort of a ranking organization maybe this is like the BCI and American college football. He wants to be 1 and much of the film shows him on various assignments killing people. Some of this is pretty neat and stylish some of this is just strange. When he's not out killing people to improve his standings he's at home have very very intense and superathletic sex with his wife.A pretty young Japanese lady with a big nose hires Mr. 3 to do an almost impossible assassination. When it fails the film gets really goofy as first his wife tries to kill him then the bignosed lady does. None of this has any sort of a linear or comprehensible narrative and you wonder if the film makers were on crack or schizophrenic.Throughout the film there are lots of bizarre fetishlike flourishes. There are lots of small dead birdsand they keep appearing throughout the film. One even has a needle through its neck. I sure felt sorry for the creatureswhy killing them was necessary I don't know. Also Mr. 3 also had a weird fetish for the smell of boiling rice.Later the wife returns and wonders why Mr. 3 is upset that she tried to kill her. All is apparently forgiventhat is until he knocks her down and urinates on her at least that APPEARS to be what he's doing. She then spills the beans about some dumb plot and begins to cry in a very annoying fashion I wanted to kill her at this point. Moments later her clothes are off and she's begging him to do herat which point he blows her away I mean he kills her and you see her head in the toilet. Nothing like a good romance huh?! Even later Mr. 3 finds the bignosed lady dead along with film showing how she died. I think it's supposed to be touching and Mr. 3 cried a lotthough I had absolutely no idea why. Didn't she try to kill him ten minutes earlier?! At this point Mr. 3 gets a call from what might be Mr. 1. He issues him a challenge and somehow Mr. 3 manages to kill everyone waiting for him at some place near the harbor. But Mr. 1 is not there! Mr. 1 then phones to say he IS Mr. 1 and will one day kill him.The rest of the film consists of the two men trying to kill each otheras Mr. 1 calls to taunt Mr. 3 periodically. This test of wills seems to go on for daysduring which 3 does a lot of mindless things that I won't even bother to describe. Eventually Mr. 1 comes for a social call and the two of them sleep together no sex mind you. In the next scene Mr. 3 is so worried about letting down his guard that he pees himself rather than take a bathroom break. No THAT'S dedication. During this long absurdist sleepover that never seems to end the viewer is left wondering what the crap is happening. All you know is 1 and 3 could kill each other but mostly just sit around staring in space. In fact the entire last third of the movie is just this nonsense.Eventually Mr. 1 and 3 get around to FINALLY trying to actually kill each otherduring which time Mr. 3 sweats like a hog. Thankfully once the deed is done the movie mercifully ends. And I have seldom been this happy to see a movie end!!! Overall this is the lamest excuse for entertainment. The film is incomprehensible has ridiculous characters and leads me to wonder why they made such a film? After all 'normals' certainly won't enjoy it and it seems like it was only made for the select elitethose who get it. Heck haven't any of you heard the story about the Emperor's new clothes?! The only reason I give this a 2 and not a 1 is because a few of the killings were kind of cool AND it had a happy ending because it finally ended.By the way this film has lots and lots of nudity. However the Japanese convention was not to show pubic hair so all full frontal shots have the naughty regions mysteriously covered. Regardless it's not a film you want to show to your mother!".

It was his last because he was fired while still under contract for making a film that made no sense and no money. Suzuki sued the studio for breach of contract and as a result was blacklisted by the Japanese film industry. Undeterred he worked in television for ten years before returning to the big screen in 1977. But time loves an artist and his art and in recent years Branded to Kill has been championed by film makers film students and critics and is now considered a classic.Hanada is a yakuza hit man with ambition. He is the No. 3 ranked assassin and wants to be No.1. But things aren't going right. He botches an assignment to provide protection for a boss then blows a hit when a butterfly lands on his rifle sight as he is ready to pull the trigger. The mob then puts out a hit on Hanada and he is on the run. But he has more problems than that. His sexy wife who has more gratuitous nude scenes that I thought possible in a Japanese film of this era is sleeping with Hanada's boss and Hanada is stalked by the mysterious No.1.A straightforward plot is completely lost in a totally confusing narrative that has events out of chronological order changes in space and time and shifts in tempo that leave the viewer thinking that they are either watching the worst edited film of all time or they have somehow slipped into a David Lynch parallel universe. Suzuki's film grammar is that there is no grammar. You can do anything you want as long as it keeps the film interesting  and entertaining. The result is a fascinating bizarre and mystifying film that is not only highly original but dazzling to look at. The black and white Cinemascope looks as good as anything I've ever seen and the camera direction is inspired.But the look of the film is not disconnected from the story. The expressionist style  amazing lighting effects surreal widescreen images and the confusing edits  all create a nightmare film language that mirrors the nightmare that Hananda is experiencing within the story. There is a femme fatale who has a dead bird hanging from her cars rear view mirror which actually would be better than one of those ghastly air fresheners lives in an apartment full of dead butterflies strung up into a lacy embroidery and has an attraction for water that leaves her glistening wet in most scenes. BTK also has an absurdist comic feel to it James Bond loves his vodka martini's Hanada loves his boiled rice. And in a scene that has since been copied Hanada shoots someone by firing a bullet into a basement drainpipe the bullet traveling up through the pipe and out of a sink on the second floor and into the eye of an optometrist. It all seems to work as it plays with the usual yakuza themes loyalty and honor an existential loner hit man double crosses and hit men assassinating other hit men.This film is not for those who prefer a straightforward narrative or a film with a logic that can be discerned by simply watching it again. But others will find this fascinating film something they will want to watch again...and again.".

	schema:headline " a crazy experimental movie that might be one of the great postmodern crime films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Seijun Suzuki has a lot of nerve as a director and I mean that as complimentary as it can sound. He pushes buttons without being too exploitive he knows the genre by the back of his hand has likely seen his share of 40s film noir and gangster pictures and knows at least a little of the French newwave or rather seems to carry over a similar spirit. So he knows also even more crucially how to turn the genre on its head while keeping a sense of poetry to the proceedings. It's hard to pull off a sense of the poetic in a crime film but Suzuki's camera techniques are to the quality that he can get his actors at the same level of a challenge of sorts. Branded to Kill is about deconstructing the myths of the hitman the qualities of emotion and subservience of duty and sacrifice the coldness and the suppressed longing for death that is encompassing. And damn if it isn't a helluva lot of fun as pulp entertainment a tale told with some strange characters and even stranger twists of fate and loaded to the gills with sex and violence.That last part I might add is important in seeing Branded to Kill in context forty years ago. Who else but Suzuki and maybe Arthur Penn would go for this level of bizarre violence and uncompromising sex at the time and at the same time not turn it into some kind of Bmovie spectacle? Come to think of it the premise and essential plot is pure Bmovie a hired killer Hanada aka 3 Jo Shishido very badass even as he goes crazy is very good at his job so good that he's able to kill 2 in a big shootout scene in the first twenty minutes of the film as he escorts another gangster around. Coming back from that mission he gets a ride from mysterious Misako Anne Mari who gives him a mission to kill someone for her. But it goes bad he's kicked out of the syndicate and now will be killed by his old bosses. This problem is broken up by two things 1 3 is so good even under total stress from his girlfriend Mami trying to kill him We're beasts she says to him crying her eyes out in supposed guilt he kills all of those who are supposed to kill him and 2 he meets killer 1 the Phantom killer who will soon kill him...'soon' being the dreaded word.Well as 'pure' as it can be under the circumstances anyway. It's essentially the story of an assassin who has the tables turned on him and has to step up to the challenge will he be 1? Can there ever be any kind of 1 in the world of hired killers? The last half hour is mostly only 3 and 1 in the apartment as they both reach for their guns at the same time and neither uses them. It becomes a game of psychological torture not to mention nerves which reaches a fever pitch by the time the climax at the gymnasium comes around. But around this genre story we get Suzuki's style as a director which is startling provocative tawdry and surreal whatever one could think to call it. Over the opening credits we see a tiny light go over the names and the first shot is a random airplane image. There's plenty of indelible images from the film killer 2 running out of the building on fire the uproarious delirious moths and lines and other figures that 3 sees around him at one point the simple sight of our hero smelling his beloved rice his first love Misako in closeup staring at the killer in the rain chillingly performed by Anne Mari like she's just got out of electroshock telling him her hatred of men and her lack of fear for death.But around these images Suzuki is confident at casting his torn and frayed 3 killer Jo Shishido gives the performance of a career with him getting better as the film goes on and he's put in more surreal circumstances and at being a master of compositions. He and DP Kazue Nagatsuka put just the right lift of suspense and danger to scenes like the drunken gangster taunting to be shot in the tunnel or 3 being told he'll be killed the first time and laughing it off or even the near scifistyle of shooting the sides of the buildings. There's maybe a reason aside from the perverse attention to dark comedy and weird drama in the proceedings that the producers decided to fire the director after seeing his finished cut he doesn't follow the rules or whatever the rules might be in so much practice going into the norm for shooting a traditional gangster film. Why not just keep the camera still on the whole building as a man falls to his death from the top? Or how about as our hero is on the phone we're seeing most of what's above his head in the apartment then shifting below? It's a risk that Suzuki takes to make the style reflect atmosphere of the urban landscapes on top of that of the terrors facing 3 and only once or twice looking too selfconscious. In a word it's hip.It's probably not surprising then that the speed and energy and form of the style feels influential to so many who skate that line between mainstream and arthouse while at the same time doesn't feel aged at all. If anything the sex is still hot the sudden violence still shocking and shockingly funny and the ending as perfect a sumup of the devastation of the ego of violence and death the monstrosity of it as could be imagined. I love it in all its subtle crazy independent widescreen glory and it serves as a great introduction to Suzuki's oeuvre.".

Coming back from that mission he gets a ride from mysterious Misako Anne Mari who gives him a mission to kill someone for her. But it goes bad he's kicked out of the syndicate and now will be killed by his old bosses. This problem is broken up by two things 1 3 is so good even under total stress from his girlfriend Mami trying to kill him We're beasts she says to him crying her eyes out in supposed guilt he kills all of those who are supposed to kill him and 2 he meets killer 1 the Phantom killer who will soon kill him...'soon' being the dreaded word.Well as 'pure' as it can be under the circumstances anyway. It's essentially the story of an assassin who has the tables turned on him and has to step up to the challenge will he be 1? Can there ever be any kind of 1 in the world of hired killers? The last half hour is mostly only 3 and 1 in the apartment as they both reach for their guns at the same time and neither uses them. It becomes a game of psychological torture not to mention nerves which reaches a fever pitch by the time the climax at the gymnasium comes around. But around this genre story we get Suzuki's style as a director which is startling provocative tawdry and surreal whatever one could think to call it. Over the opening credits we see a tiny light go over the names and the first shot is a random airplane image. There's plenty of indelible images from the film killer 2 running out of the building on fire the uproarious delirious moths and lines and other figures that 3 sees around him at one point the simple sight of our hero smelling his beloved rice his first love Misako in closeup staring at the killer in the rain chillingly performed by Anne Mari like she's just got out of electroshock telling him her hatred of men and her lack of fear for death.But around these images Suzuki is confident at casting his torn and frayed 3 killer Jo Shishido gives the performance of a career with him getting better as the film goes on and he's put in more surreal circumstances and at being a master of compositions. He and DP Kazue Nagatsuka put just the right lift of suspense and danger to scenes like the drunken gangster taunting to be shot in the tunnel or 3 being told he'll be killed the first time and laughing it off or even the near scifistyle of shooting the sides of the buildings. There's maybe a reason aside from the perverse attention to dark comedy and weird drama in the proceedings that the producers decided to fire the director after seeing his finished cut he doesn't follow the rules or whatever the rules might be in so much practice going into the norm for shooting a traditional gangster film. Why not just keep the camera still on the whole building as a man falls to his death from the top? Or how about as our hero is on the phone we're seeing most of what's above his head in the apartment then shifting below? It's a risk that Suzuki takes to make the style reflect atmosphere of the urban landscapes on top of that of the terrors facing 3 and only once or twice looking too selfconscious. In a word it's hip.It's probably not surprising then that the speed and energy and form of the style feels influential to so many who skate that line between mainstream and arthouse while at the same time doesn't feel aged at all. If anything the sex is still hot the sudden violence still shocking and shockingly funny and the ending as perfect a sumup of the devastation of the ego of violence and death the monstrosity of it as could be imagined. I love it in all its subtle crazy independent widescreen glory and it serves as a great introduction to Suzuki's oeuvre.";

It reminded me of dozens of other films I have seen but it still somehow maintained its uniqueness throughout. I cannot wait to purchase Suzuki's other Criterion released film Tokyo Drifter!The story of the film isn't anything to rave over. It is your basic pulp about a hitman and the sexy femme fatales who um err love him. The plot is very like American film noirs but as I said above it's entirely unique. It's like noir as if it were made by aliens. The closest you can get to it from American cinema is Robert Aldrich's brilliant Kiss Me Deadly. The hero and the women of that film noir remind me a lot of the characters here. Even though the plot is quite simplistic it does become suspenseful especially near the end. Still the plot is definitely not why I think this is one of the best films ever made.The acting is great. Jo Shishido is an absolute dynamo. Perhaps he was the Bogart of Japan? Like Bogie he is not particularly handsome but he has this raw masculine power. Maybe it's Shishido's pronounced cheakbones. Shishido is not cynical though like a lot of the pulp heroes of America at least he didn't seem so to me the DVD cover art depicts him with a kind of a smirk that never appeared on his face in the film perhaps the designer was just influenced subconsciously by the American ideal of a noir hero. I actually felt his physical and psychological pains throughout the film. The two femme fatales Mami and Misako are excellent also. And Number One Killer just ruled wait till you see him let No. 1 go in his shoe! You'll know what I mean when you see it!. The real reason why I think this is one of the best films ever made is the style. While I usually dislike style over substance I just couldn't help myself here. It was just so unique and interesting that I had to clap a few times. The music is perfect. It is usually jazzy but is sometimes more unusual. Every piece of music works perfectly where it is placed. And it is nowhere near overused. There are tons of perfectly filmed moments without music. Possibly the most impressive aspect of Branded to Kill is its absolutely stunning cinematography. You could watch this film frame for frame. The mise en scene is unbelievable. Wow! Every single frame could be blown up into a poster and pasted on a wall. Definitely a 1010. But don't see it unless you understand and love film. This is the kind of gem which most people who think they love film would just throw away because they missed the point.".

Parts of the movie were so hard to follow only after a while you'd get clued in on where it was trying to end up. It's a masterful piece of cinema in every form however and is way before it's time with innovations that just seem to be amazingly done for it's time. It kind of reminds me of driving down a gravel road in the dark in that you can't figure out where you're going but when you get to whatever's at the end you're happy you did it.".

All captured by stylistic crazy camera angles and effective black and white cinematography along with some erratic editing. The influences surely came from comic books.Most importantly is the story structure which was a fabulous total mess. It was structured in three parts. First part dealt with a series of shootups and car chasers of the comic book type as Hitman Number 3 attempts to protect a mysterious person. Once the violence was established and dealt with we move onto the next step  SEX. The second part was all about our hitman's sex fetish and mistreatment of women. Very revealing for a 1967 movie once again showing that the Japanese cinema was way ahead of the Westerners. The third part was what interest me the most and that was the cat and mouse game between Hitman No 3 and 1. A very twisted and comic section that had my attention right to the very ending.Director Suzuki delivered a fast paced modern Samurai tale of honor and heroism amongst hit men and lowlife's.

I detested her character  and laughed my head off when those girls gave her just what she  deserved. Some people might say that this plot is old and clichd by  the standards of today but it still works. They should release this on  a double bill with the original.

Hayley Mills carried the dual roles of twins learning of each other's existence and concocting a plot to reunite their divorced parents splendidly in the '60's version and Lindsay Lohan showed wonderful comedic talent at an early age in this delightful remake.It's a Disney flick so the comedy is family slapstick variety as you would expect. The evil stepmothertobe is overthetop evil even called Cruella De Ville by one of the girls and she's a character you love to hate. The obvious chemistry of the parents Randy Quaid and Natasha Richardson is great and begs a question which is never answered to satisfaction Why did they split up in the first place? Everything in the film symbolically shows that they were made for each other even their respective maid and butler take a shine to each other.The fx and editing to stand Lohan's two characters together is magnificently done it really looks like two actresses. No split screens backs of heads of fakelooking doubles etc. to distract you from the movie. Lohan skillfully contrasts the AmericanBritish accents and mannerisms of the two girls you know and believe which twin she is at any given moment.Well directed well acted and fun. I'll even forgive the film makers for ripping off the strandedinthelake scene from Meatballs. The closing credit snapshots provide a sweet epilogue to tie up loose ends.Good family oriented comedy worth a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "School holidays can be deadly for older cinema patrons but sometimes there are films for children that are well worth a visit for adults. Unusually The Parent Trap is a children's film that can even be recommended for children by the most morally bound parent  although there is a divorce that may need to be explained away. The Parent Trap is cute sugary and funny   and unashamedly so. The Parent Trap was originally made in 1961 starring Haley Mills as a pair of twins who accidentally meet when they are eleven years old. Their parents divorced when they were babies. They then connive to get their parents back together. This is classic Disney material and the formula can and does work very well indeed in this modern version. Heaven only knows how the special effects are done but I suggest that you just forget about that and settle back and enjoy the film. You won't have any choice anyway. I was convinced that the twins must have been played by real life twins and I'm sure that I won't be the only one to fall for that particular Parent Trap. Young Lindsay Lohan plays the girls both of them! complete with fabulous accents sunny bright and distinctive personalities appealing red hair freckles and a great sense of fun. One of the girls has become a Londoner and one a Californian and the girls also sport very commendable English and American accents as well as composites of the two accents when the girls switch places. It's also pleasing to see young girls being given the sorts of lightly rebellious antics to frolic with as are usually reserved for young boys. The story begins in a New England summer camp where practical jokes are the go although the film is careful to keep nastiness well out of the way. It would be hard to accuse Lindsay Lohan's twins of any serious crime in any case. The girls decide to switch places so they can each meet their Mum and Dad. In true Hollywood style both parents are rich and attractive and they of course each have hired help Lisa Anne Walter and Simon Kunz who are of course are going to fall in love. But then we must have the wicked stepmother and this is provided by Meredith a gold digger who's out to score the very rich hand of Dad. She's played with appropriate relish by Sharon Stone look alike Elaine Hendrix. The story really revolves around the parents played by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid. We can settle back and wait for the inevitable to happen because we just know that this is going to be one of those happily ever after efforts where Mummy and Daddy will again fall in love and properly become parents for these two very cute and loving girls. But along the way be prepared for some very solid laughs and a wonderfully animated and motivated lizard.".

My name is Zachary Fiducia i'm 18 years old from when i was about 5 years old till now occasionally ill watch this video knowing that for the longest time it was my favorite movie ever. It seems that even over the years this video is still number one in my records. One of the reason's why is because of Lindsay Lohans duel acting part. It was brilliant beyond no matter her acting skills seemed flawless for the time. Along with Natasha Richardson who recently passed away unfortunately at such a young age and Dennis Quaid. What really got me was the selection of music for the film it included The Beatles along with Nat King Cole After watching this Film i have to question myself what happened over the years? It seems that either movies are changing or people are changing. For example Lindsay Lohan a once very talented actress and i say that with no regret seems to be throwing away her talent here in 2009 and continuously over the years and its a shame. She once said that she wanted to Become a director continue acting and go to college She might've tried to stick with that for a few years but it seems that she's given up? It hurts to watch this film knowing Natasha is gone Rest in Peace and that Lindsay is not this delightful young talented actor anymore. It's a shame i still give this film an 8 out of 10 because it proves that Lindsay does have talent she always has she just doesn't know how to show it anymore. I thank the Directors for producing such a great family movie it'll be my favorite for as long as i live.".

The proof is a movie called The Parent Trap.Lohan's performance is great but we also must not forget that it stars Dennis Quaid as one of the best actors I've seen. With his versatile talent in film genres such as drama action or family Quaid has the ability to capture my attention for the length of the movie.The Parent Trap is a light hearted film that will allow the mind to flow freely while sitting and relaxing. In addition the movie was not only clever but original because Lohan pulled off her role as she knew what she was doing without having to be told what to do. Lohan is a natural talent that should be treasured because she is so good and seen in more filmsThe supporting cast also fit which made it that much more enjoyable to watch. Good cast choices all the way around. I suggest that everyone see this film because it is really good clean fun with one of the brightest and youngest stars to hit Hollywood. Bravo to the cast and crew of The Parent Trap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lindsay Lohan shines in her debut film The Parent Trap a remake or more accurately a reimagining of the 1961 Hayley Mills' film. Lohan stars as the twin girls who meet each other at summer camp discover they're sisters living with divorced parents and scheme to get their parents back together. This time one twin is from London and the other is from wine country in Napa Valley. Lindsay Lohan is full of charm and talent she is every bit the equal of Hayley Mills in playing the twins. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as the parents are appealing as well they have great screen chemistry as parents that never really fell out of love. The supporting roles of the domestics are filled well and there are several injoke film references to the first film. The problem with the film is that it is as predictable as it is formulaic offering us nothing we haven't seen before. Elaine Hendrix as the fianc is funny but a bit overthetop in Snidely Whiplash fashion at times. Joanna Barnes who played this role in the 1961 film returns as that character's mother this time. The film contains almost laughable turns of plot which would hardly occur in real life but it is a familyoriented film. Everything has to come out in the wash. It's interesting to note that the thematic elements concerning divorce do not really have the same negative connotations they most assuredly had in 1961. However this is really an entertaining showcase for young Lindsay Lohan a terrific find. This was also the directorial debut for writer Nancy Meyers who is one to watch. 12 of 4 stars.".

But the star of this picture and the one on whom the story turns is Lohan. She is bright perky adorable and completely convincing as both Hallie and Annie. If she isn't this movie falls apart fast. But not to worry. Lovable Lindsay makes not a single false step.She is so good I found myself thinking about the actress not the character feeling a twinge of sadness that Lindsay was not more like Hallie and Annie. This is a wonderful movie almost too sweet at times. It had me in tears at all the right moments when the twins meet when they learn they are sisters when the parents discover they've switched places and when the parents inevitably reconcile. First rate family entertainment thanks to a star performance from a very young very talented Lohan.".

And it was romantic although this isn't typically classified as a romantic comedy due to its family orientation it's perhaps one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen set up by the aforementioned reunions. It was even heartwarming and a bit nostalgic to see the child star so vibrant and carefree back before she well matured into a young adult and its associated questionable behavior. In all this movie was perfectly cast even down to the bad girl and it far exceeded my expectations. Now I want to go back and watch the original again.".

They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence in a circling tracking shot says S just got real. Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a bigbudget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint atmospheric English village given the secretsofitsown flavor and a Agatha Christiestyle expository structure.The filmmaking style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects occasional strobe and montages of grainy bleached out extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any supercool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a deadon impression of Hollywood filmmaking but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so welldeveloped as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive a workaholic a zealot and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line he's also funny in such a direct adolescent way an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his twoyear stint as James Bond but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written beautifully directed atmospheric or intelligently ridiculous.".

Intimidated by his arrest record his cameoappearance superior officers Martin Freeman Steven Coogan and Bill Nighy transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books because to be honest he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents but with the help of his partner Danny Butterman Nick Frost it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.Sound clichd? Good. That's the point. Once settled in Sandford Hot Fuzz becomes a vehicle designed to send up every action film that has ever taken itself even slightly seriously from Police Story to Point Break and it does this brilliantly by simply taking everything from these films and pushing them that bit further making them appear both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. The characters are massively exaggerated especially Pegg's supercop and Timothy Dalton's fantastically overthetop supervillain. The action sequences are outrageous exciting and feature a surprising degree of rough justice perhaps most notably in the form of an old woman getting karatekicked in the face or maybe a pub landlord getting his head beartrapped. The dialogue ranges from obvious parody Did you tell him to cool off? to clever PeggFrost exchanges and even the music is perfectly balanced between actionscene rock songs and mockepic slow guitar pieces.However that's not to say that Hot Fuzz is nonstop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow but there's no reason to worry the cast are simply setting up jokes to be knocked down later on and it is definitely worth the brief wait for the wellpaced comicaction masterpiece that's lying just around the corner. As with Shaun of the Dead the people behind Hot Fuzz are affectionately poking fun at a genre that they clearly love creating a film that embraces its genre's inherent ridiculousness and is all the better for it.".

Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies!Simon Pegg throws you into the extremely tongue in cheek narrative with its quick pace edits booming sounds and terrific camera work that we have come to expect from Edgar Wright since Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg has really exceeded my expectations and credit must also go to Nick Frost who plays the classic sidekick which he accomplishes so well. The aforementioned crafty work by Edgar Wright proves that his style creates some of the best action sequences in the business. Whether it be the shoot'em ups chase scenes or the jump out of your seat surprises Wright can really make a film move and does this one ever!!!This is definitely one of those films you have to watch at least twice to come close to getting every single joke because they come so hard and fast it is sometimes hard to stop laughing at the previous one in time to hear the next.Even though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Sure there are parts that slow it down but it needs this to build momentum to one of the most climactic and hysterical pieces in film history. Speed is the key! It keeps this insanely funny narrative flowing while at the same time giving a huge insight into the extremely detailed characters. Each character brings something to the table. It is an inventive yet classic comedy that reaches most audiences with its tongue in cheek and witty humour. People who thought the copcomedy genre was finished should definitely see this creative film which will pluck those heart strings and have you slapping that knee while feasting your eyes on the adrenaline fueled action!!!".

I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags in fact it is far from it instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film.Another pleasant surprise was the wonderfully impressive murder scenes which were pretty gruesome and definitely stood out from the general vibe of the film which made them far more involving. As well as the comedy and the murders there is also a genuine sense of mystery surrounding these events and it definitely makes for compulsive viewing.Just in case all that wasn't enough to satisfy you there is a very action packed and explosive end sequence that is so out of place and ludicrous it works like a charm and simply caps the film off in style superbly.For me this film was every bit as good as Shaun of the Dead and its definitely one of the best comedies ever made.910".

	schema:reviewBody "So here we have it the eagerly awaited followup from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun hereafter shortened to SOTD drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films more specifically George Romero's Dead films Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider taking in every buddybuddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel Simon Pegg an outstanding officer in the London police force a super cop with an arrest record 400 higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the pictureperfect village of Sandford alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and icecream. He also finds himself partnered with overeager constable Danny Butterman Nick Frost the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman Jim Broadbent. Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.With the setup completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly accidents. Angel is suspicious but noone believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing slightly different roles. Just like SOTD they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustachetwirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.The film is packed full of references which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch. There's some inventively gory scenes which are sure to make everyone a bit more careful around churches and model villages though they are a bit too obviously CGI. It's a shame that the action doesn't kick into high gear until the final third but with the plot not going down the most obvious of routes and since I was laughing all the way through I can't really complain. The film is a success in it's attempt to create a British action film combining adrenalinefuelled action with the mundane and everyday.".

	onyx:emotionText "So here we have it the eagerly awaited followup from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun hereafter shortened to SOTD drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films more specifically George Romero's Dead films Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider taking in every buddybuddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel Simon Pegg an outstanding officer in the London police force a super cop with an arrest record 400 higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the pictureperfect village of Sandford alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and icecream. He also finds himself partnered with overeager constable Danny Butterman Nick Frost the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman Jim Broadbent. Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.With the setup completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly accidents. Angel is suspicious but noone believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing slightly different roles. Just like SOTD they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustachetwirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.The film is packed full of references which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hot Fuzz";
	schema:reviewBody "I will say it out clear and upfront  I love this movie and without a doubt a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment laced with wry Brit wit and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie it never bores and for cinephiles you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.Hot Fuzz follows a typical buddycop genre except that these two are so much more diverse from each other than the conventional cop movies of late milking the obvious race and cultural differences beaten to death by the Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour films. Here we have the city versus country policeman officers buddying up each with work ethics belonging to opposite ends. Sergeant Nicholas Angel Simon Pegg is your nononsense straight laced focused top supercop who aces everything in his field of work apprehending felons who fail to follow the law. And with being the top police officer on the beat the powers that be deem him to be a threat in making them look inept and got him posted from Metropolitan London to the countryside of Sandford.And Sandford is your typical small lazy town where nothing much happens and everyone knows everyone else. If a missing swan is a great deal then you'll know there's pretty nothing much to sustain our supercop's interest especially so when the station he's assigned to have officers which are extremely laid back which makes him get off on the wrong footing with partner PC Danny Butterman Nick Frost. Danny's the antithesis of Nicholas and spends much of his days daydreaming what a top city cop would be like and lives out his dreams through his collection of DVD movies like Bad Boys II and Point Break. But the idyllic life of the country gets interrupted with a series of murders frequently brushed aside as accidents just as our friends are about to get chummy and here's where the fun kicks in at top gear.There are so many things to like about the movie. The violence is one though I'm unsure if the commercial release here will keep scenes unscathed by the editing scissors. Featuring some of the most gruesome ways to die it's a blood splattering fest worthy of any serial killer movie. The movie too rewards the attentive viewer because while the filmmakers load the movie with plenty of easter eggs minute details red herrings and the likes everything will count for something as they come together on the way to the finale so keep your eyes wide open and your ears peeled. The dialogue is full of wit with loads of movie references direct and indirect and its run up to the end is one of the most adrenaline pumping in recent times you can't help but to cheer as you lap up the high octane action. Action fans will not be disappointed.Some may not like its editing style which is quick sudden loud and at times repetitive but that's just a minor blip. There are enough positives here to satisfy almost everyone and one that will definitely bring on a smile by the time the end credits roll. A definite must watch! Don't miss this when it screens commercially!".

	schema:reviewBody "Shaun of the Dead was probably one of the funniest if not the best British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm innocent humour Nick Frost with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together Hot Fuzz had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness of which was Shaun of the Dead.After much keen excitement upon seeing the teaser trailers of Hot Fuzz last year my stomach churned as if to say At god damn last a film I can look forward to in the new year! I felt as though it was best however to go in with an openneutralmind as I didn't want to spoil the film with high expectations.I actually was starting to get worried into the first segments of the film the humour wasn't as sharp as SOTD's first 20 minutes and there were so many characters to remember most of whom didn't make sense for a while. It wasn't till Nick Frost was introduced  that the film started picking up its pace and then decided to grab me by the throat. The film from then was so funny action packed gruesome and dark! You just do not expect anything which was what made SOTD so great. The spontaneous actions and humour just kept the film's pace fantastically back on track.The great thing about Hot Fuzz was just how original it was and the ending no spoilers here just gave itself the stamp of Most Exciting  Fun Ending In British Comedy.The mystery and murder factor was well done as well leaving me guessing who did it all the way through the film but as with SOTD the dark and grotesque violence kept its mature rating of 15 very enjoyable yet very squirming to watch.I highly recommend this film for anyone who just wants a good laugh and likes simple great black comedies. If you loved Shaun of the Dead you will love this film. Just go in with an openmind and have fun. Definitely worth the 6.50 and the 15 when it comes out on DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "HOT FUZZ is one the most entertaining film experiences that I've had in YEARS! This is probably the most enjoyable film I've seen since COLLATERAL. And it's a British film most of which I find heavyhanded and boring! But not this one! It's actually extremely difficult to put this film into just one category cop film action mystery comedy drama parody homage? It's actually all of these things and much more. As parodyhomage it definitely has elements of a lot of other 'old' action movies in it LETHAL WEAPON DIE HARD BAD BOYS II they constantly reference this film along with POINT BREAK and guess what? There's also a bigtime homage to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS at the beginning of the film's spectacular climax! HOT FUZZ tells the story of London supercop Constable Nicholas Angel played brilliantly by Simon Pegg. Angel is one baaaad man! He has a ridiculously high arrest rate and is in top physical and mental shape. But his cronies in the London police are jealous of his success bc he is as the London Chief Inspector says 'making them all look bad'. So Angel is transferred to the small quiet English burg of Sandford. The head of Sandford's police force Inspector Frank Butterman played by Jim Broadbent in a lively funny performance assures Angel that nothing ever goes on in Sandford and that there hasn't been a murder or major case in 20 years! Of course Angel ever the suspicious and dedicated cop immediately finds trouble in virtually EVERY situation. There are times in the film where you actually believe that Angel is actually paranoid bc of his anal personality even though you know that he is indeed right there's SOMETHING wrong in Sandford! We constantly see right before several 'accidents' a mysterious hooded figure murdering prominent town citizens. Angel's partner is Constable Danny Butterman played by Nick Frost in a hilarious and moving performance. Danny is the Inspector's son and is only interested in screwing off watching action movies and eating ice cream and cake! Angel and Danny's relationship is at the core of the film and is truly one of the best buddy relationships that I've ever seen in film. They are complete opposites yet they complement each other to perfection. And both men learn things from each other. Danny learns how to be a much better cop and Angel learns how to take it down a notch and appreciate the finer things in life. Angel and Danny's police cohorts are Constables Tony Fisher Doris Thatcher Bob Walker Sergeant Turner and the 2 Andys played hilariously by Kevin Eldon Olivia Colman Karl Johnson Bill Bailey Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall. They are all just as apathetic to what is going on in Sandford as Danny.The film sports a great cast of quirky characters that along with Inspector Butterman comprise the town's NWA for Neighborhood Watch Alliance played brilliantly by veteran actors grocery store magnate Simon Skinner one of the former JAMES BONDs Timothy Dalton surveillance expert Tom Weaver THE EQUALIZER Edward Woodward the bicycling schoolmarm Amanda Paver Lorraine Hilton Dr. Hatcher Stuart Wilson hotel owner Joyce Cooper Billie Whitelaw pub owners Roy and Mary Porter Peter Wright and Julia Deakin Rev. Shooter Paul Freeman candy shop owner Annette Roper Patricia Franklin local farmer James Reaper Kenneth Cranham and flower shop owner Leslie Tiller Anne Reid.I accidentally came across HOT FUZZ while channelflipping and luckily caught essentially the first 10 minutes of real dialogue of the film the part right after the obligatory opening introduction and backstory of our hero Angel that I saw upon 2nd viewing. This 10minute pair of scenes in the London police station where Angel's superiors are telling him they are transferring him and Angel at the crime scene with his exgirlfriend Jeanine who I later found out was Cate Blanchett in that bodycovering getup had me laughing hysterically and so I thought I'd stick around to see how this movie was going to turn out. I was sure the film was a comedy by this first 10 minutes but when I checked the menu description of it it said it was ActionAdventure and I went 'Huh?' I don't think the real action came until the last 30 minutes of the film but along the way I was laughing constantly and thoroughly engaged also by the mystery element and quirkiness of the film. I think that there were at least 5 or 6 times where I was sure that they were at the end of the film and I was completely fooled and then there was another hitch. And it was all worth it! For me this film is really a great tipofthehat to all the overthetop action movies of the past 20 years or so. It simultaneously mocks those films while paying playful homage to them. And the key word is FUNNY. You will laugh throughout! This is truly one of the very few films in this decade of the 2000s came out in 2007 that I've enjoyed from beginning to end! A great achievement!".

I don't think the real action came until the last 30 minutes of the film but along the way I was laughing constantly and thoroughly engaged also by the mystery element and quirkiness of the film. I think that there were at least 5 or 6 times where I was sure that they were at the end of the film and I was completely fooled and then there was another hitch. And it was all worth it! For me this film is really a great tipofthehat to all the overthetop action movies of the past 20 years or so. It simultaneously mocks those films while paying playful homage to them. And the key word is FUNNY. You will laugh throughout! This is truly one of the very few films in this decade of the 2000s came out in 2007 that I've enjoyed from beginning to end! A great achievement!";

	schema:headline " Buddy Cop Movie Done Right";
	schema:reviewBody "Most people enjoy buddy cop films but a buddy cop film with Simon Pegg Nick Frost and Edgar Wright at the helm we get the best buddy cop film ever made. Sargent Nicholas Angel is forced to move out to the country where he has been promoted to Sargent of a village. He is not too thrilled but he soon finds himself engulfed in a murder case that the town is doing their best to ignore. The deep story is backed up by many laughs and moments this trio puts on the big screen so well.This movie plays the stereotypical buddy cop movie down to the last detail. Angel is the tough cop who is incredible at his job who is forced to pair up with an almost useless Nick Frost. These two bring their chemistry from Shaun of the Dead and bring it into this movie. Nick Frost is not as funny as he was in his previous role but he does a much better job. He is a much improved actor and shows great range in this role. Pegg on the other hand is funnier than ever. At first I hated Angel as a character as I think I was supposed to but he grew on me and Pegg nails it. Hot Fuzz ties absolutely everything together even better than Shaun of the Dead did. Things people say one time come back and play into the mystery. The first time you watch it you want to know who the killer is and solve the mystery. Great but the second and third time you go back and pay attention to all the details. The details are revealed to the audience at the climax but going back and watching it again it is very satisfying. The writing is better than ever in Hot Fuzz. This movie had the laughs but the strongest aspect was the story. For a while the story wasn't really going anywhere but introducing all the characters and getting to know the village. That all changes with the shot of the guy in the black robe face hidden and holding an axe. I remember the first time I saw that my jaw dropped. That was the moment the movie got real and it wasn't like Shaun of the Dead at all. The twists and turns this story take is awesome. The reveal of the murders is so satisfying. I won't spoil but Angel comes up with this whole conspiracy as to why the people got murdered but he was wrong. When the real reason is revealed it was a Wait really? That's so dumb but awesome moment. Its brilliant but at the same time it's a little lame. For the type of movie it is I love it but I can see people being annoyed by it. The gore behind the murders is terrific. The axe and the staged car accident was creative. The explosion was awesome the shears was disturbing but nothing was better than the church scene. Hands down the coolest death I have ever seen. There could have been one at the end involving the model of the church but he didn't die which made it ten times better. Let's just say the scene is suspenseful and it got a bit messy. I went back and watched how he died in slow motion and I don't regret it a bit. There are some jokes in this movie that are hit or miss. Aaron A. Aaronson is a subtle laugh. When Andrew has the foam mustache on his real one brings out a smile every time. The laughs were not as consistent but it wasn't needed. The backbone of the movie is the story not the comedy. In my Shaun of the Dead review I said that Shaun if the Dead was straight up better. I still stand by that statement but Hot Fuzz had the better stories better characters and it got close to better gore. Shaun of the Dead had a special impact on me that left a better taste in my mouth than Hot Fuzz did but it really isn't right to compare movies it's just a popular topic. If I had to choose some flaws I will have to call shenanigans on a lot in this movie. This is a segment I will call Reality Check. First of all I'm pretty sure Angel could have denied the promotion if he really wanted to. I understand it is England and it may be different but the guy should have rights and be able to turn down a promotion if he wanted to. Secondly after Angel discovers the truth behind the town I was thinking to myself that it wasn't possible. I can't say why without spoiling the entire movie but I can say that somebody would have to notice if people randomly disappeared. Before the murders Angel and Danny walk right by the guy in the black robe. The first time he is in an alley so I figured it was possible. The second time he was standing in front of a white garage door under a light. Come on I know Angel and Danny were drunk but they walked right by them. At the church there was no possible way for the murderer to escape due to the fact that he didn't have enough time. Finally I think the lady would have noticed a guy in black trying to kill her. She takes it like a champ before he bleeds out. It's frustrating.Overall Hot Fuzz is a good time. I can watch this movie anytime anywhere and it has everything I loved from Shaun of the Dead. The cinematography was very much the same along with the humor. The ending was an action packed shootout I always wanted. Hot Fuzz is awesome and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval even with the parts I don't find possible.".

It comes off as if it is being serious which makes it all the more funny. The first thing that strikes you is the editing. The quick jump cuts used in action films to make them seem edgier suggesting a frenetic tension filled pace are used through out this film giving any serious action films editing a run for its money. At first it seemed a little obvious and contrived maybe but as the humor started to offset the serious tone being set forth the movie really started taking shape. In the end the editing made this film even more brilliant. The acting was terrific. The Shaun of the Dead stars really proved that they were not just one hit wonders. I now think Simon Pegg is one of the more brilliant comedic writers and actors of our time. His stone faced serious main character sets a tone that made this spoof. I will now be sure to see ANY movie these guys make. This is one of the few movies I'd like to play again after having just watched it. It was just that funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Genre parody is running rampant currently probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek Happily N'Ever After and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.The thing about Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is that both of them manage to make fun of respect AND transcend their own genres. Shaun of the Dead isn't just a funny reworking of zombie horror flicks its a damn good zombie horror flick in its own right and also breaks new ground with the genre. The exact same thing is true with Hot Fuzz. Where any sarcastic Hollywood genre satire would try to show how dumb a clich is by making it even more outrageous Edgar Wright simply has the characters say But that would create a lot of paperwork. Where a lesser parody would make an obvious twist as a nod to obvious twists Simon Pegg finds out that the motivations for the recent crimes is really much simpler.But beyond that these films are good films removed from genre in their own right. Hot Fuzz uses a style of quickcut editing to match the ridiculous quickcut editing that's become popular in such ridiculous nonsensical films as Domino and Walking Tall but they don't over extend it to show how ridiculous it can get... rather they learn something about the form and most importantly make the editing extremely extremely good. Hot Fuzz has quick saturated action film editing but it does it in a way that leads the eye gracefully through the action thus one upping every other bad action flick being ground out by Hollywood.But the best part is that these films don't need prior knowledge of other films in order to get the joke. A more underhanded reason so many Scary Movie sequels keep coming out is that they directly make fun of recent horror films onetoone meaning one must actually see those terrible movies in order to get the jokes. Hot Fuzz stands alone. Even if you haven't seen Bad Boys II or Point Break you can still follow this movie because it has engaging and colorful characters good action and most importantlyCREATIVITY. And even though it provides constant nods to pop culture it also has its own quirky form of English humor to basically make everybody laugh. Not only does Hot Fuzz transcend buddy cop movies and slasher flicks with a hint of Westerns too! it also transcends spoof genre. Take that Hollywood! I figured Shaun of the Dead was a onetime deal but now I hope Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright continue to craft even more genres into actually skillful and fun movies for years to come.PolarisDiB".

I watched this movie when it came to Comcast On Demand and it looked like it was gonna be a pretty funny movie. I got so so much more than that.Hot Fuzz is a parody of action movies and a good action movie by itself. It is really a 3 in 1 movie. It is a slasher comedy and an action movie at the same time. The action does take to get going for a good 3040 minutes but during that time we are exposed to some really great British humor which not all Americans like and witty fast paced scenes.The plot isn't a bad one either. An overachieving cop is sent to a small rural town where a murder hasn't occurred in many years because he was making his fellow police officers look bad. The cop played by Simon Pegg is having boring days at the town until some strange deaths occur. The town thinks they're accidents but Simon thinks there is a murderous lunatic on the loose. That is the plot synopsis and while it may seem a little bland it is executed masterfully with a lot of humor and movie references along the way.Hot Fuzz was a very pleasant surprise for me. It is now among my favorite movies and I can truly say it is a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence in a circling tracking shot says S just got real. Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a bigbudget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint atmospheric English village given the secrets ofitsown flavor and a Agatha Christiestyle expository structure.The filmmaking style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects occasional strobe and montages of grainy bleached out extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any supercool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a deadon impression of Hollywood filmmaking but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so welldeveloped as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive a workaholic a zealot and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line he's also funny in such a direct adolescent way an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his twoyear stint as James Bond but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written beautifully directed atmospheric or intelligently ridiculous.".

Shaun of the Dead left them with a very hard act to follow but Hot Fuzz easily achieves expectations and possibly even exceeds its predecessor. And the team stay close to their roots with plenty of in jokes and sly nods to other films to keep their core fan base happy. And of course there is the inevitable who's who of British comedy showing up in various roles throughout the film most memorably Bill Bailey. Although I have to say I was sad to see that Dylan Moran and Jessica Stevenson were absent.The film tells the story of Nicholas Angel an overachieving supercop from London who is making the rest of his department look bad through his diligent dedication to the job. Cue him being shipped off to a quiet Gloucestershire village Sandford. Angel does not fit in with the local constabulary who prefer to eat cake and drink excessively rather than do any police work. When lots of 'accidents' start happening around the village they are dismissive of Angel's claims that there is more to them than meets the eye and leave him to investigate and piece together the details on his own.The story works well slowly piecing together what's going on and there are various twists and turns along the way if nothing too extravagant. The action setpieces also work well carefully treading that thin line between comic and just plain ridiculous. There are oneliners aplenty as to be expected and this will be another endlessly quoted film I'm sure not that I can remember any at this point in time I'm useless like that!. There is also an inspired take on THAT fence jumping scene from Shaun of the Dead.Some brilliant characters are introduced in Hot Fuzz. Olivia Colman's character PC Doris has to be one of the highlights every time she speaks it raises a laugh.

Nick Frost again proves his worth as PC Danny who is more concerned with cop movies than actual police work. Other classics are the proper Gloucestershire copper who needs translating into English the sly Andy's detectives and a recurring swan..Allinall hats off to Simon Edgar and team for managing to keep the standard up with their second film especially with it not being as obvious a target for them as the zombie movie.

	schema:headline " Funny Fuzz";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw Hot Fuzz a few weeks ago before the big budget summer movies opened in May. Director and Writer Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz cost a lot less than Pirates 3 SpiderMan 3 or Shrek 3 but is by far the most entertaining and best written movie. Hot Fuzz was apparently this independent British film written by Wright and star Simon Pegg that became a hit in England and Europe. With its wry and clever English humor and spot on farce of American action movies this ad hoc dark comedy is outlandishly funny. Part of the genius of Wright and Pegg lulls the audience in the idyllic setting of the English town of Sanford only to vector into faux satanic cults mass destruction and mayhem. A signature moment has Sgt. Nicholas Angel drop kicking shotgun toting grandma in the teeth. Hot Fuzz is admirable in its blindness to taste.Simon Pegg plays Sgt. Nicholas Angel the London Police Force's decorated super cop. He is so good he puts the rest of the officers to shame. Consequently his superiors assign Angel to the quiet town of Sanford which has the distinction of being England's most livable townsomething its township cherishes dearly. Very dearly. No longer in London Nick no longer makes the rest of the police force look bad. At the same time Nick discovers that his girlfriend has left him for another man. Alone and in culture shock Nick arrives in the sleepy town of Sanford. Nick partners up with Danny Butterman innocent funny Nick Frost who is the son of Inspector Frank Butterman Jim Broadbent. Danny is excited to pair up with reallife action hero Nick. Danny is also a fan of the movies Point Break and Bad Boys IIan amazing narrative touch. Danny inquires of Nick Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled 'Aaaaahhh!'? Suddenly Sanford experiences particularly grisly deaths all darkly comic in rapid succession. One is a ridiculously inspired impaling at a church. Sgt. Nick Angel suspects murder and focuses his attention on slick super market king Simon Skinner the great Timothy Dalton. Apparently all is not what it seems in idyllic Sanford. Nick unveils a bizarre cult conspiracy. This soon escalates to automatic weapons mayhem in an action movie satire of Die Hardlike proportions.Along the way Director Wright provides some wacky touches. There is a great sequence in which Nick clears a bar of drinking minors. And Nick and Danny actually watch Point Break and Bad Boys II during a sleep over which is hilarious. The fact that this foreshadows events to come is either sheer genius or just plain disturbing. Simon Pegg is awesome. Even in the abounding chaos Pegg maintains his English reserve and dry wits about himself as Nick Angel. Pegg is so deft at providing a light comic air in the most droll and most distressing moments of his character. Ultimately this is a parody and Pegg is the believable noble hero. Nick Frost is sidekick genius. As Danny he is the kid on the bench yearning to be the hero. To the movie's credit he is allowed. Timothy Dalton almost steals the movie as the evil Simon Skinner. The former James Bond is such a versatile and talented actor. Here Dalton revels in the role and has so much fun with the over the top villain.Hot Fuzz is a great dark comedy. It is well written clever and deadly funny. Hot Fuzz is a classic send up of all high decibel action buddy movies. It comically nails all the clichs and creates some new ones. Simon Pegg is a star. He and Edgar Wright have made a great and entertaining movie for a lot less money than the big summer movies thus far. Someone should take note of this accomplishment.".

	schema:headline " I heard about this movie but I didn't know that it would be THIS good....";
	schema:reviewBody "I knew what this film would be about before I rented it but I'm stunned that it would be THIS good. Nothing against Saving Private Ryan or Shakespeare in Love but this film should have won Best Picture in 1998 and it was a shame that it wasn't nominated. It's an even bigger injustice that it did not get a nomination for best screenplay or cinematography.In the hands of another writer this movie could have been made as just a parody of 1950's sitcoms like Leave It To Beaver or Ozzie and Harriet. But this film isn't about how clichd those series look decades later. It's about the false nostalgia for a past that never existed. We survived the past and we know that everything turned out all right. Because of this we selectively choose our memories and weed out the unpleasant ones. That's why the past is sometimes seen as the good ol' days. Pleasantville does not represent how the 50's actually were but rather an idealization of what people THINK the 50's wereno one had sex everyone got along swell and life was fairly easy. Nothing could be further from the truth and there are many film from that era which show how real people even in suburbia actually lived. This film argues that free will and choice is ESSENTIAL to life and that we should embrace freedom instead of fearing it. It isn't just about making out but having the OPTION to make out.Another reviewer claimed that this film was an attack on the 50's but David and Jennifer could very easily have been dumped in the world of The Brady Bunch Gilligan's Island  or Batman. But setting Pleasantville in a 1950's sitcom allows for the brilliant metaphor of black and white versus color. Black and white photography is a stylized depiction of the universe but unless you're color blind it's not the way you actually see the universe. When we first see Pleasantville's citizens all of them are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes. As they begin to open up and become real people color seeps into their world. The catalyst seems to be the willingness to experience new sensations and become vulnerable. Jennifer has slept with lot of guys when she was in the normal world so sex does not change HER into a color character. On the other hand when she actually finishes a book without pictures for the first time in her life THEN she becomes colorized. Similarly David does not bloom into color until he breaks out of his aloofness and defends his mother. Compare the way he ignores his real mother at the beginning of the film to how he consoles and comforts her at the end to see how much David has changed.I could go on and on but I think you get the idea. There are a lot of films out there that are very entertaining andor very movinglike Raiders of the Lost Ark or Titanic. Movies like Pleasantville which challenge the audience and force them to think are very rare and should be treasured by the discerning filmgoer.".

	onyx:emotionText "I knew what this film would be about before I rented it but I'm stunned that it would be THIS good. Nothing against Saving Private Ryan or Shakespeare in Love but this film should have won Best Picture in 1998 and it was a shame that it wasn't nominated. It's an even bigger injustice that it did not get a nomination for best screenplay or cinematography.In the hands of another writer this movie could have been made as just a parody of 1950's sitcoms like Leave It To Beaver or Ozzie and Harriet. But this film isn't about how clichd those series look decades later. It's about the false nostalgia for a past that never existed. We survived the past and we know that everything turned out all right. Because of this we selectively choose our memories and weed out the unpleasant ones. That's why the past is sometimes seen as the good ol' days. Pleasantville does not represent how the 50's actually were but rather an idealization of what people THINK the 50's wereno one had sex everyone got along swell and life was fairly easy. Nothing could be further from the truth and there are many film from that era which show how real people even in suburbia actually lived. This film argues that free will and choice is ESSENTIAL to life and that we should embrace freedom instead of fearing it. It isn't just about making out but having the OPTION to make out.Another reviewer claimed that this film was an attack on the 50's but David and Jennifer could very easily have been dumped in the world of The Brady Bunch Gilligan's Island  or Batman. But setting Pleasantville in a 1950's sitcom allows for the brilliant metaphor of black and white versus color. Black and white photography is a stylized depiction of the universe but unless you're color blind it's not the way you actually see the universe. When we first see Pleasantville's citizens all of them are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes. As they begin to open up and become real people color seeps into their world. The catalyst seems to be the willingness to experience new sensations and become vulnerable. Jennifer has slept with lot of guys when she was in the normal world so sex does not change HER into a color character. On the other hand when she actually finishes a book without pictures for the first time in her life THEN she becomes colorized. Similarly David does not bloom into color until he breaks out of his aloofness and defends his mother.

	schema:reviewBody "One night after working something like 6 or 7 hours at a movie store I went to see a one of the last films on my list for the week that I hadn't gotten to.  My manager and I seem to go out to movies a lot after work.  It's odd how people who around film all day cling to it for relaxation at the end of the shift.  We knew the manager of the theater so we got in free.I knew Pleasantville was about some kids who fall into a world of television and adventures ensue.  Plus I knew that it had Don Knotts and I've always loved his acting.  Expecting a funny little film about TV I got a brilliant commentary on the social and political environment of the 50's.  There were countless religious political and racial references throughout the film.Life in Pleasantville is perfect.  For breakfast you get everything your heart desires the basketball team wins every game and everyone is just swell.  The only problem is that life is set there is no free will selfexpression or new thought.The Characters begin turning colour when they break their set mold break out of their lives into something new.  When Mary sue first has sex with Skip he doesn't turn to colour because he doesn't know what's happened. The event does lead him to begin seeing the world differently hence the red rose.  People only change when they do something freely and of their own will.  The mother and her bathroom incident when Mary Sure finally discovers life beyond sex and seduction in books and thought and when Bud finally stands up for himself.The fact that new thought and experience leads to the thought of the breakdown of the Pleasantville world speaks to the desire in the 50's not to change.  Things were good values were abundant and life was good.  Dinner was ready at 6 the wife was always home cleaning or cooking or something. Then came those greasers and people doing more than holding hands.  One of the main points of this film was that change is one of those things that can become undesirable but is needed to evolve and grow as a society.Another big statement this film makes is one the issue of racism and very well I might add.  There are no black people in Pleasantville.  This isn't an attack of any sort on race.  I'm sure you can count on one hand the average number of black people in a 50's television show.  The point is that the colored people are representative of all nationalities oppressed in the fifties even through today.  Because of things they could not necessarily control they are all hated and spat upon for being different.  Especially in the end when all the colored' people are at the top of the courthouse segregated from the noncolored people.  And don't forget the no colored people' signs in the shop windows.This film is about more than the way things were and how change is good. It's about the way we see ourselves inside and out.  If life is static and nonchanging then all you get is black and white.  It's only when people allow themselves to grow and mature as people and human beings that they see the world through coloured eyes.  Pleasantville only becomes whole when everyone sees appears in colour.  Only then do the roads open up and the life beyond the town exists.  It's odd how people in the city know what colour is yet are shocked when it appears everywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some critics here are saying the movie takes itself too seriously  but I believe some people are taking it too literally. ... Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore clearly misses the point. ... The 50s  or more specifically 50s TV  is used as a metaphor because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically this movie is about Living Life to the fullest whatever that means. More specifically to live life to the fullest  to truly feel alive  you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting pleasant all the time is no way to live. That's what Tobey McGuire's speech at the end to his real mother is all about. Bad things happen it's part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives  but suppressing true feelings for the sake of pleasantness is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that issue is everlasting to the human condition. Another point People fear change. This is universal from the start of time until the end of time. The film suggests that changing and growing as a society and as people  even if scary  is good. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for that don't believe for a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.Another issue common for people critical of this film is the sexual issue. They say that Gary Ross is promoting sexual promiscuity sex out of wedlock etc...  Again I believe it misses the point.  Is Ross suggesting that premarital sex is OK?  Yes and I'd agree  and I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't agree with that and that's OK too.  But again the sex is just part of the theme  used as a highprofile example to making the overall point about openness  and not suppressing one's feelings.  Note that the Reese Witherspoon character was already promiscuous and her transformation was actually something completely different.I can't make everyone like this film  I'll just say that on a personal note I was so floored by this film I had to see it again the next day. That had never happened to me before or since. Ross' commentary goes on to speak of everything I felt about the film when I first saw it. It was great to hear that his reasons for what he did meshed exactly with how I took it. I had to write him a letter to tell him so  another thing I'd never done before or since.This is not a perfect film. I liked its subtlety but then the racism correlation and the censorship stuff got a bit more overt. The courtroom scene at the end is a bit cliche ... and I also agree with one poster who said that to make the point about taking the good with the bad we should've seen a bit more about the consequences of their actions.Those are merely nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. This is a 10 out of 10.".

They both showed larger than life happenings and captured our minds with their perspectives. In EdTv there was a humble video store clerk guy having his life filmed for a reality show which was happening in present time. Though in Truman Show very futurist and fantastically Truman Burbank was not even aware that his life is being filmed offering the viewer the vision of life from God's perspective. Distinctively here in Pleasantville there is a journey which starts with materializing a TVseries into life and ends up with materializing the life into this TVseries.The cheerful 1950s' TV sitcom Pleasantville is revived in the '90s on cable. A homebody teen David Wagner escapes from the daily rush of the real unpleasant world by watching this show. He doesn't even miss the reruns memorizes the scripts and speaks them out before the actors in the show say their part. One day after school he and his sister Jennifer can't agree on the right TV channel to watch. Then they fight over the remote control and it breaks. The new remote which will zap them inside Pleasantville given them by a strange TVrepairman.When they entered Pleasantville they become the part of the show and turn to blackandwhite as the TV show displays. David and Jennifer take up residence as the son and the daughter of the sitcom family. Soon they realize that there the life is always pleasant the temperature is always lukewarm and the seasons are always spring with no rain no snow no hot no cold weather books have no words roads end where they start nothing burns and matches are useless married couples sleep in twin beds sex does not exist nobody gets sick nobody gets hurt and nobody ever questions this hasslefree life. David fits right in as he always dreamt to be while her sister persists on him to try to figure out what should they do to escape from there. Though she changes her mind when he gets a boyfriend from school. Her attempts of putting her lifestyle on effect causes Pleasantville gets colors. Thus wonderful and frightening changes start to take place.Pleasantville is a truly original film that soars with dynamism and aesthetic. From a social and deeply political perspective it has deep meaning and relevance in today's society. Consequently it should serve as a reminder for most that the world is made up of how its residents think and act. You can't stop something that's inside you. says David and that could be summation of all that Pleasantville stands for.".

	schema:reviewBody "PLEASANTVILLE had to be one of the biggest surprises I've ever had at the movies. This superbly mounted and completely winning fantasy starred Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as a contemporary teenage brother and sister who are magically transported into a black and white television show called Pleasantville a show similar to Leave it to Beaver or I Love Lucy where everyone in the town knows each other where the fire department only saves cats from trees and never put out fires and where there are no pages in the books or toilets in the bathrooms. Maguire's character is a Pleasantville trivia expert so he knows everyone there and everything that's going to happen but sis Witherspoon is a stranger in a strange land whose introduction of 1990's sensibilities to the citizens of this town brings about extraordinary changes. The film is beautifully made with a very smart screenplay and superb performances the best of which is by Joan Allen who is luminous as Betty the mother in the sitcom who is shocked at first but learns to accept the 1990's coming to Pleasantville. Yes it may borrow from other movies but there is a freshness and originality to this movie that is most engaging and anytime with Don Knotts is time well spent.".

The film is beautifully made with a very smart screenplay and superb performances the best of which is by Joan Allen who is luminous as Betty the mother in the sitcom who is shocked at first but learns to accept the 1990's coming to Pleasantville. Yes it may borrow from other movies but there is a freshness and originality to this movie that is most engaging and anytime with Don Knotts is time well spent.";

Joan Allen Jeff Daniels and Tobey Maguire are also excellent and the idea is brilliant. In other words this film is one of the best of the year. It is fun for the eyes and filled with wonderful allusions to great books and other films not to mention some similar events in our country's past. If you will let yourself go from reality and put a little thought into it you will realize the sheer genius behind this film. The messages were plenty and appropriate and while it is extremely fun to watch it still is able to evoke deeper emotions. Fantastic and my vote for second best film of the year behind Saving Private Ryan.".

Two of today's American teens are  for reasons you'll soon find out  'beamed' into an old black and white TV show from yesteryear.

Now that wouldn't be so bad but the locals start engaging in  what they consider  to be 'immoral' behaviour which you'd probably find on kids' TV in today's times. What follows is a tale about whether our two teens can actually escape their TVprison and what will happen to the residents they leave behind.It's truly one of the most clever  vaguely mainstream  films to come out of Hollywood in recent times and if you're in the mood for something that doesn't involve superheroes flying around a destroyed U.S. city then you should definitely watch this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all....I really liked it. Ignore any review and reviewer that says different. We live in a day and age that we seems like every movie has a touch of this old film and bit of that one...or is a remake or possibly a rerelease. But Pleasantville is none of that...it is unique fresh reflective pleasant you knew I was going to use that word someplace sad but yet still had a touch of fun. The film begins by looking at the interaction between and the lives of a brother Tobey Maguire and sister Reese Witherspoon. The brother is very content with his life and enjoys watching television in particular the show Pleasantville. His sister a bit more outgoing enjoys meeting new people and seeing where this interaction will lead. A fight over which show to watch results in the intervention by Don Knotts of Andy Griffith and Three's Company fame. Maguire and Witherspoon are wisked into the television set and take center stage as two of the Pleasantville cast. The only difference is while the world may be watching a tv show to them this is their reality. The film appears to be in black and white but as each character opens their mind or changes from the perception of the Pleasantville tv show then they begin to gain color. As those in color become more prevalent the old black  whites become resistant to change. To ebb the flow of change the black and whites react violently against the new colors and begin placing restrictions on them. Yes the similarities of the 60s civil rights movement are here as are the violent acts of the Nazis in preWorld War II. But while you see these you are also brought to the realization that there still exists a great deal of prejudice discrimination and closemindedness in this world. One of the most pleasing aspects of this film is the cinematography the mixing of the colors with the black  white shots were great. The story keeps your interest and the characters impact upon each member of the audience in their own special way. This is one film to see for I think you will hear more about it around Oscar time. Bottom line...if we open our minds more towards others letting them be who they are rather than who we want them to be then not only will we be richer in color but also richer in character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very possibly my favorite film of all time. Pleasantville explores a greatly simplified fantasy world  a hypothetical 50's TV sitcom  and examines what happens when reality intrudes on its premises. As Shakespeare put it There's more to heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.Unfortunately some reviewers see the film as commentary of another kind. They view it as a confirmation of or attack on their own personal philosophies political social or the like. For those who are expecting such let me say what Pleasantville is NOT It is not a criticism of the 1950s its social mores or political bent. It is not a celebration of liberalism versus some conservative straightjacket view of the world. It is not a groundbreaking original thought piece on philosophy religion or anything of the like.The creators of this film could have made it such but I think they were smarter than that.What Pleasantville IS is a celebration of real life in all its messy confusing beautiful and often painful detail. And the celebration is masterfully executed.The device of the 50s sitcom is used to convey the film's central point that it is often easy comforting even helpful for us to think about things in simplistic terms and even that there isn't anything wrong with that per se.But to think about REAL LIFE this way is to live a smaller lesser life. Life without color is easy to look at and it certainly works. But a blackandwhite life is certainly less of a life. OK that one's easy and that's where Pleasantville starts. I'm supposed to be IN COLOR! Even the next evolution that life is better with sex is pretty much taken for granted but of course that enhancement to Pleasantville later brings the reallife complications we can all predict.And the complications continue as Pleasantville residents discover that there are other places in the world other people other ways to think and imagine as evidenced in the books that had all heretofore been blank. As evidenced in the changes in music we hear at the soda shop. And these complications aren't all good. They introduce upheaval prejudice violence.But the film successfully carries the theme that you just can't have the good without the bad. It keeps reminding the viewer that if you're thinking that way you are missing a subtlety of life and you'd better think again. And I think it goes even further making the case that even the existence of these evils makes life the richer for living because they enable us to distinguish what we like and wish for from what we find reprehensible.My favorite scene of the film may be when Bud brings Mr. Johnson an art book from the library. As he leafs through its pages we are left to wonder what life would be like had we never had the chance to see these magnificent works what a tragedy it would be what a smaller meaner life we would have lived. And a later remark in the film reminds us that seeing is only part of life that the real joy is in understanding what we have the privilege to experience.The film seems at times like it is hitting the viewer over the head but it's deeper than that. When Bud takes Betty Sue? to Lover's Lane his first trip there she offers him some berries as they sit on the grass by the pond. And then she gets up runs to a nearby tree picks a shiny red apple and offers it to him. The metaphor is painfully obvious but it's supposed to be. We all recognize it. The point is Bud recognizes it too and he realizes in that moment that the fact that not all change is good will sooner or later intrude on the lives of these people which is precisely what then begins to happen in the film. The scene isn't precious for a Do You Get It? Adam  Eve metaphor it's precious for the look on Bud's face as HE realizes the metaphor being enacted when a beautiful girl offers him a bite of a nice red apple as his look reveals his thought Uh oh. This is about to get ugly.If you're looking for a groundbreaking thought work look elsewhere than Pleasantville. It treats a classic theme not a brand new one. But it does not in my view pretend to do more than that and it treats that theme brilliantly.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read a review of this movie and they trashed it because they said that it cheapened sex. As such I decided not to watch it. At first I thought that it was in the same vein as the Truman Show but it is far from it. Where the Truman Show had some deep intricate themes regarding control Pleasantville is about enjoying life and questions the ideas of morality.The movie is about a fifties television show where everything is perfect. A boy loves the show while his sister scorns it. They are completely opposite in personality she being a slut while he being a nerd. They then get drawn into the show and the boy is ecstatic while she is angered especially since she misses out on a date with Mr Studley from her school who would want to date a donkey Mr Studley anyway  they sound so tryhard.By the end of the movie the boy has shed his shell and comes to see that a perfect world is not always a happy world while she discovers that there is much more to the world than sex. The movie depicts these changes in characters by giving them colours as the TV Show is black and white. As people come to find joy in life they come to take on colours. The movie emphasises that this joy is not simply sexual gratification as the sister has a lot of sex yet does not become coloured until she discovers the wonder of literature.One wonders if this movie is trying to advocate the 90's over the fifties but I don't think so. What I think this movie is trying to draw out is that which we find joyful. We might be happy doing something but it might not be truly joyful especially since we won't want to do it because of fear of persecution. This is emphasised at the end as those who are still black and white begin to persecute those who are coloured.When I saw this movie I wasn't paying that much attention but what I did see was that it was a much better movie that I expected and will have to watch it again more closely.".

The movie emphasises that this joy is not simply sexual gratification as the sister has a lot of sex yet does not become coloured until she discovers the wonder of literature.One wonders if this movie is trying to advocate the 90's over the fifties but I don't think so. What I think this movie is trying to draw out is that which we find joyful. We might be happy doing something but it might not be truly joyful especially since we won't want to do it because of fear of persecution. This is emphasised at the end as those who are still black and white begin to persecute those who are coloured.When I saw this movie I wasn't paying that much attention but what I did see was that it was a much better movie that I expected and will have to watch it again more closely.";

Not transcending in answer to different but rather setting up what is conventional today as more desirable than what was conventional back then.  Exchanging one convention for another is not for that reason an improvement and the attempt to do so results in a selfcongratulatory narcissism of the form See how much more urbane and sophisticated we are than our parents were?  The 1950s are set up as a strawman while the values of the 1990s are simply taken for granted as superior.

	schema:reviewBody "When a mysterious TV repairman gives David a new remote control both he and his sister gets sucked into an old 50's show called Pleasantville.  A first all seems perfect in a cheesy 1950's way  all language is wholesome everything is black and white none of the sports team ever miss and nothing is unwholesome.  However when David and Jenifer begin to influence those around them they not only change attitudes and behaviour but start to bring colour to the town.  The town splits in it's attitude to this change.This is a very gentle comedy but with a hint of a moral about it.  It starts out with once upon a time' and that's quite apt in that it is a fable with a moral in the way many fairy tales are.  At the start it's all quite small and the film almost shows the changes as bad and something that has comedy value however later the changes are shown as something that should be embraced rather than feared.  Then those who fear change and expression are shown to be wrong.  It's all quite clever  the only problem to me was that the message felt a bit muddled and could have been a bit clearer  but then maybe that's the point we learn our own lessons from it.The effects are excellent throughout  colour creeps in in some objects and people to great effect.  It's very well done and never seems unnatural.  As a metaphor for change or lost innocence it gets a bit tired but for most it's very effective as a way of seeing people's true feelings come out.The cast are great  Maguire and Witherspoon are both good yes even Witherspoon! but the real strength comes from the adult support cast. Daniels gives a great understated role it's not his best as he plays it a little too much like a wounded deer at times but he's still very good. Allen is the strongest as she has to carry much of the story with Macy who it goes without saying is superb  they share some very emotionally charged scenes together.  It's always a pleasure to see the late J.T. Walsh in anything and here he is good in a comparatively minor role.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that is very thoughtful and easily overcomes it's slow pace and slight lack of total clarity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The key theme in Pleasantville is that you do not turn colour until you have truly been set free until you have broken the shackles of your confinement and step out of your predefined mould utopia as dystopia. On face value this seems a little confusing after all Jennifer doesn't seem to do anything much than start reading and studying somehow magically struck by the nerd gene and gaining her pigment and redemption. On a closer look this seems to be linked to the cultural and artistic explosion that occurs in Pleasantville with their arrival  Mr Johnson's multicoloured murals the books and their spontaneously appearing stories and illustrations the rockandroll tracks that suddenly creep up onto the buttons of the jukebox. David goes through the opposite transformation. A cleverly edited sequence of fauxintimate closeups at the beginning establishes his loser outsider status. We expect him to burst with colour as soon as he makes the changes and gets Bud to receive Margaret's cookies. But it is actually an act of bravery in taking on the 'bullies' that harass her coloured mother that sees him undergo the same change. No doubt they are carbon copies of the brutes back in high school in the real world. Gary Ross' imagery is clear and clean cut which is probably why this has been studied in schools. The colour is a delightful and distinct way of representing freedom and blossoming. First it starts with just a red rose after a sexual awakening  a double meaning with the petals also flowering and blossoming. And you have all the sexual undertones that go with roses and 'pins' and cherries. The splashes of colour are applied to other concepts  a buzzing clock to signify time and the town finally moving forwards after years of stasis a burning bush for orgasmic clarity of thought biblical reaching here to the apple and the idea of 'knowledge is power' and eventually a historical mirroring of events that are not so long and completely gone. There is a brilliant allusion here to To Kill a Mockingbird with the 'coloured' congregated in the upstairs level of the court. What's also wonderful is the use of humour to flip our expectations. Ross has more or less established the conventions of the Pleasantville restrictions by the time we dive into the screen but it is nevertheless hilarious when a player missed a shot and the team stares incredulous at the defective ball like it was a ticking bomb or when Jennifer hurries off to the bathroom and find each stall utterly empty. Mr Johnson is so helpless and trapped within routine that he has taken to rubbing the same spot at the bar over and over. But by the end of the film he sits on one end of the bench. Personal and political repression has been replaced by freedom to choose...they have no idea what their roles are or how this particular episode might end...but that is the beauty in it.".

There actions have consequences and result in major changes with the characters from the show.The misandric antimale messages abound. As the positive changes occur in the town the adult males are the ones that are shown as being adamantly opposedand are shown as stereotypical stuckinthemuds that don't like change. The adult males are shown as incompetents that are unable to even cook for themselves and gripe about having no one i.e. their wives which they are dependant upon like children cook clean or prepare their clothing for them.The movie goes into depth to portray what the expectations of women back in the 1950s e.g. cooking and cleaning yet does NOTHING to portray the limitations and responsibilities imposed upon males like providing for the family wearing a suit and tie everyday and maleoriented work like yardwork. As with most aspects of modern culture only the lamentations of frustrated women are shown and males are shown as living in a utopian society with no worries or limits.Just as other movies this movie shows a woman having a extra marital affair and it is justified because she has grown weary of her married life. Despite the fact that she never discusses the matter with her husband who remains OBLIVIOUS to the changes that are happening she has decided that her husband cannot cope with her newly discovered sexual desires and seeks out another man. This of course would be taboo if a man had done it there are enough movies showing what a creep a man is who cheats on his wife yet a when a woman has an affair it is always justified. The father character is shown as being a nice guy who never accosts his family provides for them and seems to do nothing wrong yet this also portrays him as being boring and therefore needs to change.The movie started with an interesting premise and had really good acting and good special effects I just found it difficult to stomach the frequent negative attitudes about males and the male bashing. This movie would fit in well in the book Misandry The Teaching of Contempt for Males in Popular Culture.Overall the movie was pretty hypocritical. The basic premise was People should be free to do what they want as long as what they want is what we tell them they want. For example the father character was comfortable and happy with his old life. That was the life he wanted and he was happy with it. But this is portrayed as wrong because he is not changing his lifestyle to conform to what the other people are saying. Huh?".

We are then kindly told by the directorscriptwriters complete with cheery music that lots of sex with no feelings involved is better than having ultraclean morals. After all clean morals are for boring people. Tobey McGuire's character goes from calm geek to sexstarved teenager because some goodlooking girl he never met made him cookies after he becomes popular awwww true love. This film is filled with such positive values.All in all it's a very childish movie obviously written by an amateur. It even contradicts itself since the nice people portrayed in Pleasantville would never turn into a fanatical violent mob. The worst scene is when the father of the family who is consistently shown as a  nice guy throughout the movie talking to his children kissing his wife etc is ruined by doing a 180 he's turned into a closeheaded chauvinist so that we can give the lively wife a big scene where she proclaims her independence about how she doesn't want to make dinner that she wants to run off with another man. And we're actually supposed to be glad for the wife here.Definitely pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pleasantville has been favorably compared to The Truman Show which premiered earlier this year. However I feel Pleasantville doesn't hold a candle to The Truman Show. While Truman offered genuine pathos a sympathetic even heroic lead and insight into the intrusive nature of television Pleasantville is overlong repetitive simplistic and hollow.The plot of Pleasantville has two modernday teenagers being magically transported to a fictional T.V. show set in the '50's called Pleasantville by no less a character than Don Knotts the movie's only inspired idea. The boy played by Toby Maguire likes it there  it's a nice respite from his family problems which includes his sister played by Reese Witherspoon. She is transported with her brother but feels she has entered Nerdville and so sets out to change her surroundings to something she is more familiar with something with a more 90's sensibility like say with...sex?This is actually an interesting premise especially since the 50's world is in black and white and only gradually introduced to color. Unfortunately the movie takes a black and white attitude in its morality too hammering the same point home over and over again. I think the movie is basically saying the 50's was a time of stifling conformity dull and unimaginative culture and in the end threatening and oppressive patriarchy. The 90's on the other hand offers ultruistic freedom better values and color! to life.Please! One could make a better argument that the 90's offers moral decay and fear as evidenced by broken families teenage pregnancy violence and general cynicism towards all authority. The film takes the logically dubious step of taking 50's sitcom sensibility and making it the reality of that time. Just ask how 90's sitcoms accurately reflect 90's reality. One could defend the movie by saying that it is not making a literal 50's  90's comparison but is making the more general point that freedom is better than confromity. This is a truism and doesn't need over two hours to justify and besides the movie is taking that comparison seriously. The audience shouldn't.".

Gary Ross who previously wrote Dave and Big both of which were excellent comedies as well as being timely moral statements has now crossed the line.Not in filmic terms but in morality.It's obvious that Ross is making a statement about the inherent freedom within everyone from Adam and Eve right down to people within the world of television.  This is a beautiful statement one that should be lauded.  But it is also one that should be tempered with responsibility and reason.Tobey Maguire plays the proverbial Adam a boy that loves everything to do with the 'pleasant' world of forties and fifties television until he and his sister Reese Witherspoon who plays the also proverbial Eve are zapped into the television world of Pleasantville.In this world everything is black and white until Eve feeds the apple to an unsuspecting boy.  As his desire is aroused color appears in the world. Soon all the kids are doing it...literally at the ridiculously named 'Lover's Lane'.  More and more color appears and yet strangely enough nobody gets pregnant.The mother of Adam and Eve played by Joan Allen is Mrs. Cleaver to a 'T' until her daughter teaches her about sex.  After having been taught the mother proclaims that the father would never to THAT to which the evil Eve says There are other ways to find pleasure.  To the mother this means more than just masturbating in the bathtub.  She leaves her home and family without even speaking with her husband and the only after math that we see is that food is not on the table.In the end the normal people of Pleasantville must somehow come to terms with the 'coloreds'.  But what of consequence?  The only true evil in the film comes by way of the males who refuse to partake in the world of color. They burn books rape women and are generally Hitleresque.In Ross's world color means free will.  The freedom to do whatever you please.  This is truly an amazing thing that human beings possess but this gift we have is tempered by the fact that we have consequences for every action that we indulge in.In Pleasantville there are no consequences.In the ancient allegory when Adam and Eve were cast out of the 'black and white' Garden of Eden they were sent into the world we know too well.  A world of hardship but certainly a beautiful world.Nobody dies in Pleasantville before and after color appears there are no accidents no mishaps with unprotected rampant sex comes no disease no pregnancy no remorse...no sense.  With the pleasure there is no pain.Someone said How can we know the sweet without tasting the bitter?  Gary Ross will show you.Pleasantville is like the allegory of Adam and Eve cast UP from the Garden of Eden straight to heaven...  So why are we here at all?".

While you have no idea WHY Don Knotts yes Don Knotts! plays a magical TV repairman who gives them a bizarre looking remote that somehow transports them into a TV show that Tobey lovesPleasantville. They have no idea why this occurred or if it will ever end or if Knotts is god but oddly neither questions this new world that is literally in black  white like an old episode of Father Knows Best. However unwittingly their presence with their modern sensibilities and notions causes this seemingly idyllic world to start to slowly come apart at the seems. Notions such as freedom to choose sex and individuality are missing in this worldand the two interlopers bring this to the plastic world of Pleasantville.By the way Pleasantville is odd in many ways. First all roads in town lead right back to town and no one has ever left the town or knows anything about the world outside. Second books are blank inside and the people have no idea about what they contain. Third when there is a fire the fire department actually has no idea WHAT a fire isthey are only used to things you might see in the TV worldsuch as rescuing cats stuck in trees. In fact how Tobey is able to finally convince the firemen to come to his house when there is an actual fire is pretty funny. There's a lot more that is strange about the town and it gets stranger when the influence of the two outsiders slowly causes actual colors to begin appearing in the monochrome world.The film is a strange surreal sort of thing that is truly unique. Using colorization techniques they are able to achieve amazing results that seem to jump off the screen. It's all a metaphor about how the idyllic life of 50s TV was actually quite stilted and repressive though Maquire and Witherspoon's life in the real world isn't exactly great eithertheir parents are divorced and Witherspoon is to put it nicely a bit shallow and slutty. A happy medium would sure be nicecombining the best of both worldsand I think this is a valid interpretation of the film's intent. Where exactly it all goes and the unexpected consequences are something you'll just have to learn about yourself so watch the film.Overall a rather interesting and innovative film. It was nominated for three Oscars and deserved kudos in these departmentsfor sets costume design and music. While I wouldn't put it in the category of mustsee it is interesting and worth seeingeven if the ending is a bit too drawn out in some ways. The only real misgiving I have is the way SOME might see the film and come to the conclusions that the 1950s were all bad and repressivea rather oversimplification of the era to say the least. This era like all in our history had its good and bad points and I worry that such a revisionist view of our past will be believed by young people seeing this movieespecially since films such as this are the only way most teens get their history. I know as I've taught US and World Historykids are THAT gullible...really. I can't really blame the folks from Pleasantville for this lack of awareness in teens but it did concern me as I watched the film.By the way one thing I liked about the film was the courtroom scene and William Macy's acting. While he said very very little his face showed so much expressionnow THAT'S acting!".

	schema:reviewBody "Pleasantville is a really messy unfocused film that has nothing to do but define its' own atmosphere for over two hours while trying to convince us that there is a much deeper meaning behind it all.I'm no expert on shows from the fifties and I am not a product of that era but I have of course watched many shows from that period and I understand what the movie was going for it was trying to show us that things aren't as picture perfect as they appeared in those shows and that change into the modern world isn't so badit just makes us free. Fine that's a cute premise maybe for one of today's sitcoms in which it has already been done many times before but the town of Pleasantville is such an extreme exaggeration that I never bought the fantasy world presented within it. This is something that is necessary to the viewer when it comes to films involving fantasywe must believe in the world depicted. It didn't work for me at all. Sex was something that was never talked about on shows from the 1950's but I'm sure Mrs. Cleaver Yes I mean the fictional character knew what it was! I also think that the characters from those shows also knew that there was a world beyond their own town that there were days when it would rain and that the local sports teams didn't always win.Director Gary Ross seems pretty unsure of his material himself and that is probably why the film keeps defining itself within the last halfhour of the movie a young boy punches another. Those watching look on in surprise and wonder. They've never seen violence before someone a few rows behind me in the theatre said. Well duh! I thought this was clear as soon as the movie started but I still never bought it leaving the audience to defend the monotony of the screenplay. At one point William H. Macy looks all over the place for his wife looking for his dinner. I feel sorry for him an uncomfortable audience member said.When the movie is not overdoing itself in explaining its world it is trying to shock us with sexual humor also in the same tedious overblown wayafter Paul Walker is deflowered by Reese Witherspoon the camera LINGERS on him emphasizing his shocked and dumbfounded expression milking it for ungenuine laughs. The film then TEDIOUSLY expands this single joke commonly throughout the movie showing us shocking images of kinky sex acts some I can't even mention here for my comments won't be posted HINT one involves a popular number in the double digits and when we're not seeing the acts of sex or the blownaway expressions of those who have just experienced it we get some really shocking conversation Reese Witherspoon has been shacking up with every guy in sight then educates her mother on ways to please herselfOh MY! Another shock provoking embarrassed and courteous laughs from the audience.The final scenes of the film dissolve into complete disorder Don Knotts starts getting angry at the kids for their disruption of Pleasantville and goes quite mad but what was he expecting in the first place and why does his demeanor change so radically from that of the first act? Other characters end their stories without solutions not that its wrong to leave certain stories openendedI just feel that Ross didn't know what he wanted to do with most of his characters. The final scene Gee you know you're pretty smart is poorly written tackedon unsatisfying and forced.I think what bothers me most about the film is that since these banal characters are just imaginary dull caricatures of 50's television shows who don't even really exist why should we care about them? At one point Tobey Macguire's character is offered the chance to leave Pleasantville but he turns it downhe wants to make a difference here. WHO CARES! It's just a TV show! Maybe I would have cared if I found the world of Pleasantville to be believable but I never did.  Grade D".

First of all it features Carroll's secondplace finishing Academy Award performance as Best Actress Norma Shearer won for her Divorce. At the time Carroll was a considered a new talking pictures star in that respect she was the first talkiedominant actress to move in on the Quigley Poll top ten list of established silent stars. Carroll was 10 in 1929 and seemed assured of superstardom with the new dramatic range she showed in Devil's Holiday where she displayed real sweat and tears.Holmes is also at his best playing the lovestruck rich kid with wideeyed innocence. And he gets one of those great smacked on the staircase scenes. Holmes falls in love three times in this movie but only for Nancy Carroll. She and Holmes had great chemistry as you'll see and box office returns dictated they would be reteamed fairly quickly for the close to but not quite Stolen Heaven. Writerdirector Edmund Goulding manages well considering it was early 1930. You also get two pioneer players Messrs.

	schema:reviewBody "Nancy Carroll's opportunity to show Hollywood that she could handle more substantial parts than the musical fluff she was always given came about by the death of another actress. Jeanne Eagels was a top Broadway actress who had originated the role of Sadie Thompson in Rain. She had appeared in a few films when she suddenly died of a heroin overdose. The Devil's Holiday' was to have been her next film. After Ruth Chatterton's name was mentioned people remembered the impression Nancy had made as the hardened chorus girl in The Shopworn Angel 1928 and the role was hers. This was also her first pairing with Phillips Holmes.Hallie Hobart Nancy Carroll is a manicurist who earns most of her money in commissions entertaining out of town buyers of farm machinery and persuading them to purchase from her associates. Charlie Thorn the brilliant Ned Sparkes has a proposition for the little fella as he calls her. He wants to introduce her to David Stone Phillips Holmes the youngest son of one of the wealthiest men in the country. He is a country hick and Hallie believes she will have no trouble in taking him to the cleaners. She gets him in her clutches and Kent Carr  Jed Prouty a rival salesman sends for David's brother Mark James Kirkwood. He talks to Hallie and they have a showdown. He tells her that her kind have been hunted off the streets and are now masquerading as decent working girls. David then proposes to her and she agrees thinking that she will demand 50000 to abandon him if his father will agree.Back at the farm Hallie finds she is having feelings for David who is doing his best to make her feel wanted and loved but she manages to fight them off. David's father Ezra Hobart Bosworth does offer her 50000 to leave the house and she accepts. Meanwhile David and Mark have a fight on the stairs and David is hurt.Hallie is now back in the city but she has changed she has become melancholy and surrounds herself with hangers on and alcohol. David has recovered but Dr. Reynolds Paul Lucas the only doctor David feels understands him thinks the only sure cure would be Hallie's return. Ezra goes to the city to bring her back but when he sees Hallie drinking and carousing disgustedly returns to the farm. Hallie has a change of heart and has sold everything she owns to return the money to Ezra. After another confrontation with the family David has a relapse when he realises that initially Hallie was bought off but he then rallies knowing that now he has Hallie's unconditional love.This was a really great movie and unlike many old films did not play on viewers emotions. It showed that Nancy Carroll was up there with the film greats and not just a song and dance cutie.Highly Recommended.".

Edmund Goulding also wrote the screenplay for the movie. This movie has substance. There is character development by several characters and spiritual overtones. What is greater than being selfish and bad and admitting it? With inimitable virtuosity Nancy Carroll is able to traverse this course of human change. She incidentally was nominated for an Oscar in 1930 for this movie. Phillips Holmes is able to play his difficult part to the hilt as a naive and sweet character hopelessly in love.

Ha ha ha....but it's not meant to be funny....ha ha ....Then there are the gruesome twosome of Mark and Ezra Stone who belong in a horror movie along with Dr Reynolds as played by Paul Lukas. He must surely have been considered for the role of Dracula with his stupid accent. Bela Lugosi is a carbon copy of this guy. Throw in the very irritating Ned Sparks with his annoying chirpy character and that stupid voice that he affects and this film is one very big unfunny joke. And to round things off Nancy Carroll isn't particularly good either.The story also sucks and is completely unbelievable. Every relationship between every character doesn't work and it is laughable how Nancy Carroll who doesn't give a fig about Phillips Holmes suddenly falls in love with him. What a nonsense!

	schema:reviewBody "An outrageously funny spoof on the Western film Lonesome Cowboys is a synthesis of Warhol's sorties into the New York underworld but much more humorous and with closer adherence to a nonsensical plot. The film was photographed in Arizona in a ghost town where somehow two of Warhol's superstars are discovered. The incongruous montebanks happen to be Viva as chic and sarcastic as she was in Bike Boy and resembling a displaced model for Hound and Horn and Taylor Mead. Mr. Mead  is the zany of our time and when five mysterious cowhands saunter into town the hilarity commences. The cowboys are an odd assortment a bit androgynous and citywise and they interact with the two in varying attitudes of lust and indifference in setpieces of inspired film comedy. Often Lonesome Cowboys reaches the ultimate in surrealist imagery cowboydeputy Mead performing the Lupe Velez Twist his own choreographic distortion or one of the cowboys performing ballet exercises at the hitching post. Viva's langorous seduction of the most innocentlooking among the cowboys is actually a satirical comment on sexual artifice. This erotic sagebrush comedy has its cruel edge and one feels that Andy Warhol attempts to make some statement about the nature of brotherly love and the impossibility of virtue rewarded in these times of fallen idols. Select just about any Warhol film from the midsixties and you'll find a scandal tucked away. Lonesome Cowboys's most notable runin with the law was in Atlanta where it was seized after replacing Gone with the Wind in a mall theater. Lonesome Cowboys is filled with wildly comic setpieces including a cowboy practising ballet moves at the hitching post and a peevish lecture on the misuse of mascara. These desperadoes are real trailblazers when it comes to libidinous appetites and it is here that Lonesome Cowboys distinguishes itself from the herd. Unflinchingly Warhol shoots down the myth of the desexed cowhand.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sentimentality of Love Story What can you say about a 25yearold girl who died? is a hearty welcome retreat to the past... There is nothing to spoil love trust confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...Jenny Ali MacGraw is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver Ryan O'Neal is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease and has a very short time to live...Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel giving a heartbreaking performance as the ultrarich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny the dying heroine the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...Ray Milland is the 60yearold Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong articulate civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...John Harley is Phil the father of Jenny... For him Father's love is something to cherish and respect.There is three sequences that I liked the most in the filmJenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on both were entirely engrossed with each other ready to risk anything for love...Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny until he sees her sitting outside on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny all shaken and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection Love means never having to say you're sorry.Oliver sitting alone and lost to the world uncertain and perplexed unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind a minute in his heart a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life' and this is our great gift our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once Love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So Love Story was followed by Oliver's Story.Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears... Love Story won 7 Academy Award nominations and Frances Lai  touching music  mixed by Bach Mozart and Handel won an Oscar enriching the beauty of the film...An intense toughlooking leading actor is seen Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut...".

The movie stays focused on Jennifer's and Oliver's relationship that is portrayed with the utmost simplicity. A movie like 'Love Story' could have easily gone wrong but kudos to director Hiller for his fine execution and for pulling all the ingredients together so effectively with the help of whimsical cinematography impressive soundtrack and fine actors. The chemistry between O'Neal and McGraw sizzles on screen. Both actors complement each other brilliantly and convincingly portray the 'opposites that attract'. Hiller has done a commendable job by bringing these two actors together and a strong rapport with them to enhance their work. Of the supporting cast John Marley and Ray Milland stand out by their strong presence. Overall I liked the film a lot for its subtlety ambiguity and simplicity that makes it feel more genuine. Clearly it stood the test of time as there are hardly any more movies being made these days that could reach anywhere near the level of this classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't even alive when this came out. I'd never even really heard of MacGraw nor O'Neal before though they both looked vaguely familiar. The Love Story theme I was definitely aware of though.I saw it for the first time in 2002 and bawled like hell. I saw it for the second time a few weeks ago 2005 and cried like a baby again. I instantly needed to get my DVD copy. My parents always say that they don't do movies or music for that matter like they used to and on this occasion I had to agree.The movie's premise is simple the typical boy meets girl love story with the clich rich boy poor girl angle. But I think its simplicity is part of what's so great about it. I fell in love with Oliver and Jenny and as corny as it may sound I think their undying love for each other is ultimately what we're all searching for and their tragedy became my devastation as well. It's generally your typical soppy chick flick with the exception that the pair don't live happily ever after but probably the best one of its kind. A story like this has become so banal today 35 or so years later but it was surely one of the first of its kind. It hits all the right emotional buttons and although I'm not one to usually cry over films this one certainly had me in tears.The two very attractive leads make a cute couple and have good chemistry. O'Neal and MacGraw both turn in very solid performances and I quite enjoyed the foulmouthed MacGraw. Good writing solid acting great music I could listen to the musical score all day beautiful scenes. I love Love Story. Hee! 10 out of 10 from me.".

It is a touching story and the direction and coordination of some of the scenes is amazing.

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I was quite surprised as the low rating the movie gets her since I've always been under the assumption that this movie is widely regarded to be the best and ultimate romantic movie ever made.The movie has all the ingredients a romantic movie needs even the most formulaic ones. Two totally different boy and girl from different social levels fall in love with each other and of course not everyone in the environment mainly the parents of course are happy with this. Their love life has a couple of ups and downs in which they have to weight some choices for themselves against choices for their love together. Further more the movie also features an unavoidable dramatic twist in which one of the characters get seriously sick Don't worry this is not really a spoiler since this is mentioned right in the beginning of the movie already. In other words this movie has all of the formulaic sappy sounding ingredients to make this a sappy formulaic romantic movie. Yet Love Story is not. Why? It's hard to put your finger on why Love Story is so much more and so much better than your average love story but I guess that you can still answer this question once you start analyzing the movie. Although the story and all of its elements are sappy and formulaic the movie itself doesn't try to be sappy or dramatic. The movie doesn't attempt to make you cry by putting in overthetop dramatic filmed moments with dramatic loud music and all that sort of stuff. Instead the movie chooses to take a realistic approach no real surprise considering that this is a '70's movie. The decade in which the most realistic and best movies were made. It has as a result that the movie never feels forced or overdone. It even makes the most formulaic and predictable elements of the movie work out as strange and unbelievable as it might sound. You also have to keep in mind that at the time it was released this movie was not formulaic at all. It was a fresh approach on the genre and inspired many later movies. In a way Love Story was bare raising and set the standards for many later romantic movies. The movie was nominated for 7 Oscar of which it won 1 in the end not just for no reason. The movie is obviously made on a low budget but it makes the end result look all the more creative. It's effectively directed by Arthur Hiller who later went on directing lame comedies. A real waste of talent. The musical score by Francis Lai is a classic and the simple effective cinematography from Richard C. Kratina makes the movie feel all the more realistic. The movie made Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal big stars for the moment and they were both even nominated for an Oscar. To be frank I didn't even always liked their characters in the movie and I've never been to fond of Ryan O'Neal as an actor. In that regard I liked the supporting cast way better with John Marley Ray Milland and Tommy Lee Jones in his very first and very small screen appearance. He looked so amazingly young that he was hard to recognize.Although the movie takes some formulaic and obvious dramatic turns the movie still always remain perfectly watchable just not always emotionally involving enough. So I'm not to sure about it if this is a movie that can still make people cry. Nevertheless the movie still has its powerful moments mostly due to the realism of it all. Everybody should be able to recognize the situations and put themselves in the place of the characters of the movie. Everybody have been through similar events in their life at one point in one way or another.Now days lots of people actually complain about the tagline and famous quote from the movie 'Love means never having to say you're sorry'. People find this a stupid and illogical line. To those people I would like to say Wait until you've truly falling in love once. If you've REALLY been in love you'll understand what is the meaning of that line. Love is about mutual respect and also accepting each others less pleasantries and still love each other for it. This also means never having to apologies to each other. Actually when I was in love once and the girl felt the same way about me Yes amazing I know. It seems like ages ago now whenever one of us said 'sorry' for something the other always said 'You never have to apologize for anything to me'. None of us had ever seen the movie or heard of its famous line before so I think that really says something about the line and the truth that is in it.It in my opinion certainly is one the best and perhaps most influential romantic movie ever made. A mustsee that deserves more objective respect and higher rating on here.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Very pleasant surprised by this wonderful and brilliantly acted Love Story. Owkay the title captures everything of the movie. You instantly know what it is about. But that doesn't bother. This movie is almost twice my age and before I started watching this movie I wasn't sure if I would like it. After all I want a movie to be recognizable at least with a movie about a love story I'm not talking about movies in general. You can't expect a movie like The Godfather to be recognizable and the acting has to be real. With certain movies from a couple of decennia ago I sometimes have the feeling the acting isn't real you're all the time aware of the fact that they are acting and I think a movie can't have that.The acting here was amazing. Ali MacGraw as well as Ryan O'Neal were both excellent in their roles as Jenny and Oliver. I thought both fathers were quite good as well specially Jenny's father Phil performed by John Marley who surely deserved his Academy Award Nomination. The music was also terrific in this movie. I think it's beside the acting one of the most important points to make this movie timeless.Unfortunately this movie became the only success of the leading actors. It could have been the beginning of a brilliant acting career but Love Story became the highlight of their career. To conclude I can only repeat that Love Story is a brilliant and timeless romantic classic! Watch this movie! 910".

Author Eric Seagal appeared on all TV talk shows all the time as did Ryan O'Neil and Ally McGraw. Every teenage girl in America copied Ally McGraw's hairdolong straight and parted in the middle. Some blonde girls even dyed their hair brown. Teenage boys carried around the Love Story paperback in school and got all the chicks because they thought he was sensitive. But the truth is this was an awful movie. The acting was bad and so was the script. Scene after scene was so melodramatic...poor Oliver working in a Christmas tree lot...oh the indignity! Big deal..like a strong 24 year old man can't carry a Christmas tree to a lady's car? And when the doctor broke the news to Oliver...so unintentionally funny...she has no symptoms at all and he announces she will die soon because they took three blood tests and found...what? Doctors don't announce a patient will die unless all extended treatment is exhausted. He didn't even begin treatment or tell Oliver what was killing her. Later on they mentioned white blood cells and a lack of platelets but even a veterinarian would treat your dog before giving up on it. Then she seemed her usual bright eyed and bushy tailed self n her deathbed before she just croaked. Even if she had lived I don't see how this marriage could have survived more than a few years.Oliver was passive and Jenny was aggressive rude and teased him constantly while saying goddamn to punctuate everything. Best comedy of 1970.".

It's not deep and the characters are not very appealing for a movie that depends on us loving them enough to hurt when they do. Ryan O'Neal's character is a spoiled sniveling rich boy who falls in love with the opinionated bitchy Ali MacGraw.I think the big problem with the film is that MacGraw's character is so abrasive it's difficult to muster up enough sympathy for the ladder part of the film when she lays dying in a hospital. Even as she lays dying she is still strong enough to spout her opinions and swear like a truck driver well like a truck driver in a 1970 PG rated movie.O'Neal comes off far better and we do have sympathy for him. It also helps that the beautiful musical score is played over every touching scene to help underscore our emotions.Watching Love Story today it is easy to see why it was a blockbuster back then. All the ingredients were there. It will move you. For some hard nosed viewers it may just move you on to the next channel.".

	schema:headline " Generic Title Says All That's Necessary About This Unapologetic and Severely Dated Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1970 hit film has not aged well but frankly it was not that good when it was released. Yet it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV a privileged Harvard hockey player who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background. His oldschool father naturally disapproves of Jenny and in a typical act of rebellion that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippieera extemporaneous ceremonies. He lands his dream job in New York but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. There is a veneer of thencontemporary filmmaking techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller but none of that can hide the oldfashioned clichridden story at its core. The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic faade. John Marley two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in The Godfather does better as Jenny's plainspoken baker father Phil as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias. The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. The print quality on the DVD is good though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller. The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal upon whose book this movie is based conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew  Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver's roommates.".

When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness I couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care.

I may be a bit of a snob but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal  I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon  because most of them but not all are ruined for me by his presence.  The lone exception is What's Up Doc? in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist  and not coincidentally he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure!  McGraw and O'Neal tend to mug their lines rather than act them.This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career it was Tommy Lee Jones's first movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Love Story in a Film Analysis class. This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is terrible the story is poor and the direction is flat out lazy.The acting is terrible because the sarcasm used by Oliver and Jenny is tough to notice. Most people have some kind of joking tone but Oliver and Jenny sound like two people in a heated debate. When Oliver makes Jenny angry and she runs out of the house I don't feel the way Oliver is supposed to feel. His face is plain but with an added gawk to add nervous tension to the scared husband that wants to apologize to his wife. Oliver's parents are the basic snotty rich people who have a son in love with a poor girl. Oliver himself isn't that interesting a character either. Jenny and her father are basic characters the poor family with a small business that barely let them scrape by and Jenny is the girl smart enough to get accepted to a good college.The story is generic as generic can be. It is simply a modern day Rome and Juliet story but instead of Montagues and Capulets we have a rich Protestant and a poor Catholic. Dragging economic status and religious background shouldn't be a wedge between the characters because its not powerful enough especially in this film. Romeo and Juliet is fine we don't need to see its plot mindlessly abused by this film among others. The only curse Shakespeare brought upon Romeo and Juliet was the simplicity of duplicating the story. What's even worse was that the novel was written by an English professor who was not satisfied with the romance genre of novels. A student then said that he should write one if he thought he could write a better story. The problem here This story is too basic. This film is basically the film student's guide to a quick buck an easy plot and how to go minimalist.On that Minimalist note this film is incredibly lazy. This movie has a famous soundtrack according to my Film Analysis professor. My complaint was that there is one song and its used in the stupidest scenes. A scene where Jenny is riding her bike to her house that she owns with Oliver is accompanied by this abused song. When Jenny and Oliver are just playing in the snow the music plays. My point to my Film Analysis professor was how over used it was my professor used an example like the Indiana Jones theme my response was that when Indie is doing something heroic we hear his signature theme. Love Story has a signature that is supposed to symbolize loneliness or being cast out but it is played too often in unusual situations. Another lazy aspect of this film was the directing. In the scene where Oliver is running around town to apologize to Jenny the camera hardly moves. It is right in front of Oliver but when he goes into the laundromat the camera doesn't follow him inside. The camera doesn't had a sense of urgency. The rule with the camera was Here's where I can see so the actors walk within this one shot. Need more proof. The camera is lazy near the end after Jenny dies. Oliver is in the park and he's by himself but the camera doesn't do much exploring if you will.Avoid this film at all costs. You've probably seen this story before its only Romeo and Juliet which we've all read before.".

However obviously I did not die young! I still admire the look of Ali McGraw the way they dressed her for the film is timeless. I think it will always be a classic... the piano score is quite moving and in many key scenes proves a perfect substitute and far more powerful than dialog hence the lack of! I also think it was beautifully filmed. Look for Tommy Lee Jones if you blink you will miss him!A film for all ages classic and moving.

After the first few scenes I thought she would get it under control but no she had that horrible performance all the way through. Ryan Oneil was just as bad. Over acting and sappy. The scene with the doctor was most annoying. What kind of Doctor tells him flat out she's dying then suggests 'treatment'?? Also his response was ludicrous. No question about what can be done to help her. Sorry folks but wow I thought this was bad. One major directing failure was almost the entire movie was just the two of them including the sickening sweet montages of them frolicking in the snow  which went on wayyyyy to long. Big thumbs down for me. However I think the script has potential for a modern remake with some rewriting better acting and please no 'zoom ins' and 'zoom outs' like this movie. That style of film making was used briefly when the first invented the zoom lens but quickly died it because it is too cheesy.

When she dies of asthma Nigel is left with a distant father but worse is to come when the 'common' Mrs. Joan Potter arrives as the Slaters' cleaner. Nigel fears rightly that her aim is to be the next Mrs. Slater and soon he has a new stepmother and is whisked away to the country. Joan is however a superb cook but this only makes for rivalry as Nigel the only boy in his cookery class at secondary school competes with her to find the way to his father's heart. A weekend job in a pub kitchen introduces Nigel to an older boy another great cook and gay like himself who gives him the confidence and inspiration to leave home after his father's death and head for the hotel kitchens of London.";

	schema:headline " A comingofage memoir as complicated as TOAST.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Toast is based upon the autobiographical book Toast The Story of a Boy's Hunger written by English food writer journalist and broadcaster Nigel Slater. It is a memoir of Slater's early years and his memories of his mother who died when he was just 9 years old.The bookfilm is entitled Toast as that was the ONE food his mother was able to successfully cook ... and he tells us that a person will always love the one who prepared slices of the warm crunchy buttery goodness to you as a child. The young Nigel must've held true to this mantra even in childhood as he never accepted or trusted his father's new cleaning lady Mrs. Potter Helena Bonham Carter  Sweeney Todd The King's Speech Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who won her way into his father's heart with her culinary expertise ... much to Nigel's chagrin.As Nigel was already interested in food he'd drool over the exotic cheeses at his local grocer or sneak a flashlight into his bed to look at the mouthwatering pictures in the family cookbooks he eventually becomes highly competitive with Mrs. Potter in hopes of winningover his alwaysdistant father.Toast takes place over a span of ten years and so Nigel is played by two different actors. Young Nigel is played by a remarkable Oscar Kennedy who is making his feature film debut !!! while the older teenage Nigel is played by Freddie Highmore Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Finding Neverland The Spiderwick Chronicles. Highmore is a great young actor but it is surprising to admit that the younger lessexperienced Kennedy outshines him in this film as Kennedy's Nigel does more of the grieving and Highmore is scripted to do more of the pouting.Toast isn't as boring as the title makes it sound nor is it overly compelling as it turns into a mostconventional litebiopic. Bonham Carter is always good and her scheming competitively outrageous behavior here is the butter on this piece of toast. The film is about Nigel Slater kind of a blank page as he gets older but he wouldn't have become who he is without the provocation of this film's Kitchen Queen Mrs. Potter ... nor would the film be what it is without Bonham Carter.".

While it doesn't quite make my favourite dramas of alltime list it is for me one of the better programmes airing over the Christmas season. Is Toast sentimental? Yes in a way I suppose it is. But it is also warm gentle and tender not to mention evocative and multilayered. Toast looks wonderful certainly as the production values and period detail are really quite pleasing. The photography is very skillful while the scenery and costumes are beautiful. In general I did like the music. It did occasionally get a tad overbearing but in its more subdued moments it was quite charming and quaint very like the drama itself. The script is always touching honest and funny while the story is engaging throughout and the pacing and direction are also spoton. The acting is perfect across the board. Oscar Kennedy is wonderful as young Nigel Slater and while Freddie Highmore as his teenage self is good Kennedy was better. Ken Stott is also winning as his father and Victoria Hamilton is very touching. Helena Bonham Carter also gives one of her better performances of late. All in all this is a very absorbing and beautifully done drama. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "The British always seem to have such interesting faces and because of that their movies seems to have more depth and feeling than American movies. Toast is no exception. This movie contains little dialogue and relies much on visual communication which could easily have turned it into one of those movies that makes you glance at your watch every twenty minutes. But the casting of such physically unique individuals makes it riveting.The dynamics of family. I know I know. Do we really need to go there again? Yes we do and Toast puts it out there in a raw youarescarredforlife way that we can all relate to. It hurts to watch the way Nigel Carter the British food writer on whose biography the movie is based hurl insults at his dying mother knowing this behavior will haunt him in the end. It's equally hard to watch the miscommunication between father and sonthis could be any home in America where parents and children seem to speaking foreign tongues to each other tearing the already weakened fabric of parentchild relationships. It's a wonder anyone survives.But Nigel was a survivor. I liked how he listened to the voice inside him ignoring society's pressure to fit in. In school he was the only male who chose to take home economics over shop and he stood at his father's wedding by the cake he'd made so carefully even though the wedding represented everything that would alienate him even further from his father. Our Nigel did it his way. I halfexpected to to hear that Frank Sinatra song at some point during the film.I loved the reference to toast. Soft inside the toasted shell where the butter nestles in or something like that. I loved toast when I was growing up and I think it is the only comfort food that doesn't have a sugar base. My personal favorite was cinnamon toast but hey to each his own. I have never met anyone who doesn't like toast and it was a perfect metaphor.Which leads us to wonder is it possible Nigel's mother was that bad a cook? Is it possible that someone could boil cans for dinner and burn them? Go see Toast. Then cook something. Feed those you love with culinary delights you enjoy making and let the sweet and savory fetes roll.Nice film.".

Apparently a story based on a shallow little prick that due to his lactose intolerance throws up on his teacher due to his selfishness made his fathers life miserable and despite the movie's insistence that he has some talent or respect for food he tears down the only character in the movie that shares this love. There is a nice scene where a young man creates a masterpiece of a salad and but we are left to believe this culinary performance is somehow better or executed more naturally than Mrs. Potter's years of consistent good cooking yet when the lead character tells the chef at the Savoy why he should be hired he says it is because he can make a great Meringue Pie the recipe he lifted from Mrs. Potter. The very idea that the chef the story was written about actually plays the chef at the end of the movie that gives him a job is so laughably bad cinema as to sort of make me angry I watched the entire thing expecting at least something more than a bore. Instead the prick is rewarded the real life chef winks and the viewer gets absolutely nothing. That's all folks.This movie would do well to have a twist in it similar to It's a Wonderful Life but instead after this main character jumps off the bridge...he's gone from the movie...and the father and HIS love live happily ever after in Pottersville.".

I have been put off watching it till now though not being keen on biopics and doubting that there was enough substance to Slater's autobiographical novel to make a fulllength feature.In fact there probably wasn't but it didn't matter thanks to strong performances all round. Oscar Kennedy makes a notable dbut as the 9 yearold Nigel and Ken Stott was made for the part as his emotionally stunted bullying father but for me it was Helena Bonham Carter who stole the show as the manipulative vulgar and mildly toxic Mrs Potter. Freddie Highmore in his first youngadult role was good too and carries what feels like a rushed ending well though the role didn't give him the chance to shine as an actor as he did in the likes of August Rush.MILD SPOILER FOLLOWS The weakness in the screenplay for me was the cut from Slater's childhood to his late adolescence 23 of the way through the film. It jarred the continuity and left me wondering what had gone on in the intervening years. From then on I felt the story lost its way and all sympathy for the protagonist evaporated with his behaviour which seemed every bit as heartless as his stepmother's. It seemed to me that Slater's intention was to portray how much of a bitch the woman was but if that's the case then it misfired in my heart.A thoroughly enjoyable film all the same whimsical nostalgic even for one born in the '80s and engaging in its own right. One wouldn't have to be aware of who Nigel Slater is to enjoy it.".

Yet before long Father hires an eccentric divorced housekeeper Mrs. Potter Helena Bonham Carter to clean up the home. Mrs. Potter dresses exotically and plays Dusty Springfield records as she disinfects the place from top to bottom. Out of the blue the buttoneddowned Mr. Slater becomes smitten with Mrs. Potter much to Nigel's chagrin. Well opposites can attract. Before long the adults decide to move to a remote part of England dragging a kicking Nigel with them. Thus an enmity has sprung up between Mrs. P and Nigel.

This is quite an unusual film based on the true tale of Slater who became a chef and food writer in his later years. The performances of Stott Kennedy and Highmore are great and Carter delivers a whamslam turn as Mrs. P. Then the early sixties time span and British setting is a treat as is naturally the lovely songs of Springfield one of the best female singers ever. Mrs. Potter's costumes are also lots of fun and provide a great counterpoint to the more conservative choices given to Stott and Hamilton. There is one point that might upset some viewers. Nigel is gay and there is a scene of him kissing another male as a teen. It is quite a minor point in the overall movie but it may deter some viewers. Nevertheless Toast deserves a big hearty glass of wine in a raised hand as its extraordinary story is captivating.".

	schema:headline " BBC production of food writer Nigel Slater's life is extremely tiresome  unpleasant a film to endure rather than enjoy";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is how I imagine this hypothetical sequence of events. Screenwriter Lee Hall best known for the Billy Elliot script sat down and read Nigel Slater's autobiography. Hall loved it so much that he sat down and turned it into a screenplay named Toast. This is not unusual since the main characters in Billy Elliot and Toast are very similar. BBC One bought it instead of a film studio which should be clue number one that Toast was not going to be a potential Billy Elliot sequel. They hired a director S.J. Clarkson mostly known for directing TV episodes on both side of the pond such as EastEnders and Dexter. Most surprising and most perplexing the BBC and the Toast script were able to attract acting talent most notably Helena Bonham Carter.What did Carter see in this script? She took time out of her life the very same year both Alice in Wonderland and The King's Speech hit theaters to slap on illfitting kitchen attire and help bring the life and times of Nigel Slater to the world. Nigel Slater is a British food writer most notably for the Observer and previously for Marie Clair. He was born in the Midlands to repressed but somewhat wealthy parents who did not dedicate much time and effort into the domestic side of life.Nigel's mother played by Victoria Hamilton seems to have no experience in the kitchen whatsoever as she puts actual cans of food into boiling water and at the same time sucks on an inhaler to indicate to Nigel and the audience that something is not quite right. Nigel's father Ken Stott disappears to some sort of job during the day and returns home with few kind words for his son and prances on eggshells around his wife. When he tells Nigel to do something the reason behind it is usually Do it for your mother although Nigel cannot quite make sense of why eating a miserable ham would benefit his mother very much. Most conversations between Nigel and his father end in the exclamation You stupid ignorant boy. Not surprisingly at all given the overt setup Nigel's mom dies early in the film and then men are left to their own selves. This does not last very long before Helena Bonham Carter shows up as Mrs. Potter the new house cleaner. Nigel sees straight away that the lady from local council housing has set her eyes on their nice house and well to do Mr. Slater. She goes above and beyond mere cleaning she starts to darn socks and even cook. The allure and mysteries of cooking are a subplot so far as Nigel has never seen anyone make a proper meal before but is wise enough to recognize and agree with the axiom the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Mrs. Potter knows this proverb all too well. Pies turkeys and potatoes all start to regularly appear on their dinner table items which had never been there before. Nigel begins home economics training at the expense of his popularity to match wits with Mrs. Potter in the kitchen. His motivation for doing so is not clear. Is it jealousy for his father's affection? Does he despise Mrs. Potter so much that the one way he thinks he can get her fired is to be a better cook than she is? The Mrs. Potter character is one of the main reasons Toast is a truly horrible film. In Nigel's eyes she is the epitome of evil however to every other rational human being and the audience she is a normal woman who truly seems to take a shine to his father and even Nigel himself although he is a true brat to her every chance he gets. She may latch on to the possibility of climbing the social ladder a bit too readily but she is not mean. She shoulders all of the domestic responsibilities of the home and never once hits little Nigel and never even gets in a shouting match with him.Nigel's hostility wears on the audience very quickly and after a bit just seems tired and out of place. Nigel is played by newcomer Oscar Kennedy as an eight year old and by Freddie Highmore Charlie  the Chocolate Factory Finding Neverland as a teenager. His animosity never recedes and by the end I was absolutely fed up with watching him. The interactions between Nigel and his father and between Nigel and Mrs. Potter do not work. I am incredulous that anyone especially an actress of Helena Bonham Carter's caliber would read this script and agree it would be a good idea to turn it into a film.Stay away from Toast at all costs. Even though it is based on an autobiography it is ridiculous monotonous and worst of all despising all of the characters on the screen is no way to enjoy a film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here is how I imagine this hypothetical sequence of events. Screenwriter Lee Hall best known for the Billy Elliot script sat down and read Nigel Slater's autobiography. Hall loved it so much that he sat down and turned it into a screenplay named Toast. This is not unusual since the main characters in Billy Elliot and Toast are very similar. BBC One bought it instead of a film studio which should be clue number one that Toast was not going to be a potential Billy Elliot sequel. They hired a director S.J. Clarkson mostly known for directing TV episodes on both side of the pond such as EastEnders and Dexter. Most surprising and most perplexing the BBC and the Toast script were able to attract acting talent most notably Helena Bonham Carter.What did Carter see in this script? She took time out of her life the very same year both Alice in Wonderland and The King's Speech hit theaters to slap on illfitting kitchen attire and help bring the life and times of Nigel Slater to the world.

	schema:headline " Disappointing Movie Made from a Fine Memoir";
	schema:reviewBody "I think Nigel Slater is the best writer about food in the English language today and have read many of his cookbooks as though they are novels. I enjoyed TOAST his memoir growing up in the drab late 50s and early 60s that was postwar England. Slater the only child in a marriage of a dying mother and a cold and remote father just makes you wish for a happy ending. Mother can't cook a lick except for making toast and mince pies. The food subjected to middleclass English households is pretty grim. Once mum is firmly dispatched father engages a housekeeper played with delicious relish by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. She's a bit coarse and determined to snag young Nigel's father. She does so with her superb cooking skills. But Nigel's stepmother isn't quite the monster he would have you believe nor do I recall her being written quite that way in the memoir. In TOAST young Nigel is a sullen and angry boy yes his father is a cold fish but his life is dull with bad food. He's not abused or mistreated or unloved. That is a typical family of that era. I could understand his resentment of his eventual stepmother but he is stiffbacked and cruel to her and she is mostly agreeable holding her ground against this lowwattage brat. In the movie Nigel decides to compete with her as a cook and she's not having it. She pulls out all the stops and she trumps him until his father dies. Then the older Nigel is off for his culinary career vowing never to set eyes on his stepmother again. Frankly my sympathies were with the stepmother and not Nigel as this movie disappointingly droned on. There is much charm and lovely observation in the real Slater's memoir and I wish I had suck to that only. A young Oscar Kennedy makes an impressive film debut as the younger Nigel with Freddie Highmore stuck trying to give the teenage Nigel some interest. Ken Stott is excellent but ends up with onenote rage as Nigel's father. Victoria Hamilton imbues the role of the dying mother with a wistful sadness. The film belongs to Helena Bonham Carter. Always a good actress even when she fails she got Mrs. Lovett in SWEENEY TODD nearly right but ran off the rails for lack of a real voice to sing this tough part. In a career that is now over twodecades long she's making an indelible impression in nearly every film she takes on these days which is terrific. Someone has to fill the shoes of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench and Carter is more than their rightful successor. Though TOAST sports a good game cast it is let down by an illconceived approach to this story and a director who lacks a light and sensitive touch to pull it off.".

It came up amidst a discussion of great foodie movies and I thought I ought to watch this one in my eternal search to find something to top the perfection that was Eat Drink Man Woman 1994.This movie fell short on multiple aspects.As a general narrative one of the things every good story tries to do is build a sense of empathy around the protagonist. In this case he seems like a whiny arrogant spoilt brat and there's very little in his struggle that anyone might identify or empathise with. His relationship with his father is strained but both his father and biological mother are portrayed as such cardboard cutout characters that they don't seem convincing at all. The mother is shown to be a lousy cook and even the representation of this inability seems to have been overacted and exaggerated in an utterly unconvincing way. Nothing the protagonist does even paints himself in any positive light. His struggle doesn't seem greater than any that anyone watching the movie might have had to endure.The movie could have easily redeemed itself in its portrayal of food but they only appear as cursory flashes as Helena Bonham Carter's character cook up one storm after another with the camera barely pausing on a single dish for more than half a second. I understand this is a TV movie but there's a clear lack of skill in the direction and writing of this movie. I think the actors did the best they could have with what they were given to work with but the movie does really drag for the first 40 minutes or so before Helena Bonham Carter's character shows up and actually starts to make the movie watchable. To be clear the movie doesn't drag because it's boring but because it's mostly spent with this annoying child who whines and throws tantrums and his parents have no depth beyond his father hating him unreasonably without even trying to understand why and mother being a good for nothing sick person.Some scenes even seem quite hard to believe like one where the boy brings home some spaghetti to cook and the father breaks a piece of raw spaghetti and goes 'what is this it's so hard!' I find it extremely hard to believe that people in the UK wouldn't know how spaghetti works in the 70s.This movie began to annoy me within the first five minutes of watching it and did nothing to relieve this only going from bad to worse.I only chose to write this review in case another fellow culinary enthusiast decided to watch this film hoping for a great foodrelated movie. Don't you will be sorely disappointed.".

Like many redblooded teenage boys Philly and his young buddy Sherman are looking for cheap thrills by spying on sun bathing girls and dreaming of sex. What a surprise Philly's in for when Miss Mallow catches him watching her undress from outside the window one night and then invites him inside to get the best view. Soon the maid is seducing the boy and Philly begins to experience every adolescent male's fantasy  scoring with an older woman. The problem is Miss Mallow and her partner Lester have other plans in store for this aspiring Casanova.I first saw this unusually risqu teenage comedysex fantasy back in 1981 when I was 19 which was considerably older than the 15yearold character is. But the dream was still something I could relate to and when I saw that a DVD release was coming out I decided to revisit it and see how it stood up so to speak after 25 years. Turns out it's still fun and Eric Brown is humorous as he stammers while trying to contain his excitement at seeing Sylvia Kristel and her body double in some shots naked. Kristel was popular doing this type of film in Europe so it was interesting to see her in an American production doing something that would never be allowed at your local cineplex today. Not only are some of her sequences sensual but there are a fair amount of laughs some of them courtesy of Philly's pudgy knowitall friend Sherman and also from Howard Hesseman who has some funny moments being pushed around and humiliated by Ed Begley Jr! As is the case with many early '80s teen comedies the soundtrack is pretty good too and features music from Rod Stewart Air Supply and John Cougar among others.The most easily obtainable version of this film I would guess is now the 2006 Lions Gate DVD but purists should be warned that a couple of quick lower frontal nudity shots have been obscured on this release by an annoying white dot. Well it's not like this is great art and the movie doesn't really suffer from the brief obliteration. Besides this was a forgotten cult classic of sorts and hard to locate for so long that it's just good to be able to view it again. I know some people get uptight about this daring film especially in these days but relax. It's just a fun little movie if not a great one and sometimes even has a little bit of charm to it as well. And it's nothing that many average teenage boys aren't thinking about already.  out of ".

Overall I was not disappointed.One major detraction I didn't remember seeing before was the crude whitepaint censor blots in the two fullfrontal nude scenes boooooo!. This film has a few details on refusedclassification.com which suggest that it might have been doctored in this way in order to gain its R rating even back in 1982. I wonder why it was not offered with a director's cut as a special feature of the DVD e.g. Dressed to Kill  artistically speaking I would rather have a scene cut than done up with something so cheesy and distracting as a censor box shame!.This movie is what it is  for me it represents just a little piece of my childhood and contains a few moments that were interesting to revisit. If the features of the DVD had been more complete I would have given it about an 8. I'm hoping I will be amused by the commentary when I hear it.".

While I wouldn't call it one of the best of its subgenre it still was rather a popular and influential outing that would spawn knockoffs like Homework My Tutor and to some extent Class. This is one of those films that its best to just go along with its lowbrow attitude as its quite asinine especially the plot progressioncringelike with the circumstances characters find themselves in and smutty. But then again the hormones run wild. Older lady young boy. What fantasy can you think up? 15 year old Philly Fillmore's father has gone away on business where he's left home alone with Nicole the new French housemaid. Soon Philly becomes infatuated in her but her open advancements towards him come at a surprise. While shy at first she slowly starts gaining his affection. But unknowingly to him his crooked chauffeur Lester has blackmailed Nicole to seduce Philly in the scheme of getting money out of him.What the film has going for it is the iconic soundtrack of buoyant tunes from the likes of Rod Stewart Eric Clapton Crazy Horse Air Supply and Earth Wind  Fire. It was like a jukebox at times with some oddly placed tunes. The other distracting element other than spending a lot time leering of its attractive female cast and extras was that of European goddess Emmanuelle's Sylvia Kristal as teasingly upfront foreign housemaid. She looks beautiful the best moment arises when she seductively strips in front of a gobssmacked Eric Brown. Although another body double was used for Kristal's nude scenes. Eric Brown plays the gawky nave young lad Philly whose curiosity turns to obsession  in what he believes is love for the housemaid. Howard Hesseman is good as the deviously slim bag chauffeur Lester and Ed Begley Jr. has fun with his little support role. In one humorous sequence he does his best Dirty Harry persona with Hesseman at the end of it. Patrick Piccininni plays Philly's obnoxious pal Sherman and Pamela Jean Bryant is Sherman's stuckup older sister that Philly kind of fancies. Or better put likes to see naked. Ron Foster turns up as Philly's father and Dan Barrows amusingly chips in as the gardener. Also showing up in minor but enjoyable parts are Peter Elbling Dan Greenberg the writer and a delightfully titillating Meridith Baer as an uptight school teacher. It's technically wellmade by director Alan Myerson and breezily paced with Greenberg's simple material.".

It does have a cute premise but it's never done much justice due to all of the amateurish writing and pacing.Eric Brown is Phillip Fillmore Philly Philly?? a 15yearold kid with hormones gone berserk. In other words he's pretty damn average. His deadbeat dad has left on a... business trip wink wink nudge nudge and has left Philly back home with his recently arrived immigrant housekeeper Nicole Mallow Kristel and sleazy chauffeur Lester Howard Hesseman. Seems Philly's got the hots for Nicole and Lester takes advantage of this persuading Nicole to fake her own death at the hands or loins of the boy so he can make off with Philly's money like a bandit. But Nicole switches around midplot deciding instead to help stop Lester's HalfBaked Evil Scheme. Cue several slapstick hijinks culminating in a final sex scene and serve.Obviously you don't watch movies like this for plots no matter how inane and farfetched they may be you watch them to get sprung. Alas this was back in the early eighties and unless you had a big name andor a lot of cash to burn your film was almost destined to rot in film quality hell. Such seems to have been the case with Private Lessons and the fact that it is billed as a comedy rather than an adult movie bewilders me to no end. Even with the nudity the filmography is agonizing to watch but since this was probably produced as a quick buck teenpleaser that's not surprising. Panning shots of Kristel fondling or teasing Brown while the kid makes goofy unrealistic shocked and amazed expressions are about as dynamic as this thing gets.I should also mention that the character of Philly's chubby friend Patrick Piccininni is simply the most irritating part of the movie in my opinion. Some people have commented that this character who comes across as being doomed to remain a virgin for the rest of his life is rather cute in his behavior and I fail to see how they arrive at that judgment... as if one gawking teenage boy wasn't enough. Hesseman's character is strictly pornolevel period end of story. Even Dan Greenburg the author of the book this film is based on had the ego to have a bit role as the hotel owner even going so far as to appear fully credited in the profile shots of the cast during the closing credits! It's hard to recommend Private Lessons for any other reason than the aforementioned Ms. Kristel and the fact that it is better than most softporn out there. Aside from these aspects it's downright mediocre.".

Moreover you just have to admire the giddy audacity of the filmmakers to treat statutory rape in such an amiably goofy and jocular manner nowadays this basic male adolescent fantasy plot would be the subject of a totally serious Lifetime network madeforTV feature. But back in the carefree early 80's people were more easygoing and hence this flick is a totally delightful tongueincheek product of its time. Brown and Kristel make for appealing leads with funny support from Patrick Piccininni as Phillip's fat horny best buddy Sherman and Ed Begley Jr. as Jack Travis a tennis instructor who's persuaded by Phillip and Nicole to pose as a tough homicide detective. Supplying some nice eye candy are Pamela Jean Bryant as the fetching Joyce and Meridith Baer as uptight but enticing teacher Miss Phipps. Of course we also got a sizable smattering of yummy female nudity and some sizzling softcore sex. Further galvanized by a firstrate rock soundtrack and given an attractive glossy look by cinematographer Jan de Bont this baby hits the spot as a good deal of infectiously naughty fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not one to look down on others' sexual desires but this movie creeps me out and I find something terribly wrong with anyone who gets a kick out of the sexual relationship in Private Lessons.  Don't get me wrong I love seeing manwoman sex in movies and I would have killed to have Emmanuelle trying to get in my pants when I was fifteen yearsold but... eww.I've read Philly the Dan Greenburg novel this movie is based on and it reads like something you would write a juniorhigh book report on.  The only noteworthy thing about Philly' is how poorly it's written.  The plot twists are apparent fifty pages ahead of time the sex lacks any eroticism and come off as the dark dirty twisted fantasies of a sinister old guy and inexplicitly the word whore is spelled hoor.  Yet Jack Barry and Don Enright the brains behind The Joker's Wild and the 21 quiz show scandal felt the need to snap up the rights to this garbage.  Sure it was a box office smash and people have fond memories of it but keep in mind these same group of people gave us about two dozen Police Academy sequels.Yeah the original Emmanuelle Sylvia Kristel is in the movie.  And Howard Hesseman and Ed Begley Jr. show up to take advantage of craft services and oh they also appear in the movie.  Don't for a second let this fool you into thinking that this makes Private Lessons worth seeing.  Okay Emmanuelle being in the movie is pretty cool.  However the combined star power of Hesseman and Begley?  Please.  If opening this weekend was a buddy flick starring Howard Hesseman and Ed Begley Jr. where they travel across country in an electric car you would take that as an opportunity to leave the country.  I wouldn't even want them washing my car electric or not. In their defense the directing and writing is so bad the mere fact that they take up physical space in the movie is commendable.  And by just standing around holding a tennis racquet in this movie Begley surpasses his GoldenGlobe nominated role in Transylvania 65000.  Regardless of all this my point is do not lull yourself into thinking that you want to see these two men act in anything.Now back to the dirty sex.  Private Lessons contains a tour de force performance by the nipples of Sylvia Kristel's body double.  These nips should get top billing above the title.  Now I love nipples as much anyone else but I don't believe there is any good reason why a viewer should be subjected to a scene where threeinch erect nipples are rubbed against the chest of an underdeveloped fifteen yearold boy while Rod Stewart's You're In My Heart plays in the background.  If you ever wake up in the middle of the night and hear screaming don't worry that's just me having a nightmare about this scene.No amount of nudity and sex can make this movie watchable.  Plenty of movies have nudity and wacky sex antics so don't settle for this crap.  However if for some reason you find yourself fancying the plot seek out the impossible to find but far superior Private Lessons II.'  Having seen both you'll realize that Philly is no Ken Lester is no Oba Joyce is no Yoko and Sherman is no Koji.  There were scenes in Private Lessons that I was praying for Koji to show up in.  Sure it makes no sense and there's very little nudity in it but it's a much better way to spend an hour and a half.".

I enjoy a welldone striptease as well as the next guy and it's very well done in this film. The basic plot is that the unscrupulous chauffeur played by Howard Hesseman and maid are using the absence of the boy's father for the summer in order to get his money. The maid does the majority of the work seducing the boy played by Eric Brown. Now for the downers...Eric Brown's performance was awful. During the striptease scene his reactions are totally unconvincing. Hesseman's also not up to his usual standards. The plot is somewhat thin but OK. I think mainly the film is poorly acted. Then there are the sexy scenes which are the film's strong points!".

Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman. I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime. To me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an Oscar I would still have to give the movie only 1 star. That TV's Howard Hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But don't take my word for it!".

There were seemingly hundreds of Bond imitators unleashed upon an innocent moviegoing public and the majority of them sucked out loud being cloyingly and unfunnily campy at best or downright boring at their worst  the Derek Flint movies OUR MAN FLINT 1966 and IN LIKE FLINT 1967 being among the best of the lot  so finding a gem amongst that misbegotten subgenre the socalled spy spoofs is a rare occurrence. DEADLIER THAN THE MALE isn't just a rare gem it's an downright treasure of the genre and it came from out of nowhere to make my list of alltime favorite espionage thrillers.Top oil company executives have been dropping like flies horribly and creatively done in by a pair of mouthwatering assassins cold Teutonic Imma Elke Sommer and sunnybutsadistic nymphokleptomaniac Penelope Sylva Koscina. As the body count rises British secret agent Bulldog Drummond Richard Johnson a good ringer for Sean Connery is called in to investigate and must figure out who the murderesses are and more importantly why they're on a killing spree resulting in Drummond's efforts placing him and his randy nephew Robert Steve Carlson square in the killers' sights. To say any more would give away much of this thoroughly entertaining adventure so I'll shut up right here and now. Just take my word for it that if you're a fan of Bondish thrills an enthusiast for chicks who kick ass movies or even a casual observer you won't go wrong by seeking this one out.DEADLIER THAN THE MALE shamelessly set out to ape what made the earlier Bond films so much fun and possesses all of the elements that we've come to expect from the 007 series so much so that one could have easily taken an unproduced Bond script crossed out the words James Bond replaced them with Bulldog Drummond and no one would have been any the wiser save for noticing Richard Johnson heh Dick Johnson filling in for Sean Connery. No lie it's got everything you need to make a decent James Bond flick An interesting plot that takes the hero on a globetrotting adventure. Hot chicks this time being much more clever than just about any Bond Girl you can name. A cool car Drummond drives a Rolls and puts it to brutal offensive use. A memorable title song sung here by the Walker Brothers the guys who performed the 1966 1 charttopper The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore. The hardtoachieve spoton balance of thrills and humor the laughs here are genuine and played totally straight with Sylva Koscina's kooky and homicidal Penelope stealing the film. A coolweird lair for the chief baddie. Kickass fights the asswhuppin' found here is better than anything found in the entire 007 series with the exceptions of FROM Russia WITH LOVE 1963 ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE 1969 AND CASINO ROYALE 2006. No overthetop gadgets that allow the hero to win without really trying in other words technological superpowers. Kinky torture.In short it's all good and I had a big satisfied smile on my face when the film ended.Other than stumbling across it and reading many reviews touting how good it was DEADLIER THAN THE MALE further piqued my interest with the presence of Elke Sommer one of the rare Aryan types who gets me going. Her beauty was compounded by a genuine sense of humor and great comedic chops as proved in A SHOT IN THE DARK 1963 the second and best of the Inspector Clouseau comedies and she turned up frequently in sixties flicks that required a hot piece of Eurotrash who could actually act perhaps most notoriously in the howlinglybad mustsee allstar disaster THE Oscar 1966. And as if Elke wasn't enough to get my attention she's aided by Sylva Koscina a Croatian cutie probably best known to film goons as Iole in the Steve Reeves peplum classics HERCULES 1958 and HERCULES UNCHAINED 1960 a character I've carried a torch for since I was but a kid.Unlike most of the legion of Bond clones this one delivers in spades even as the actual series began to suffer under its perceived need to outdo itself becoming an excessive selfparody by virtue of sacrificing the plot in favor of spectacle and gadgets while the scripts became more ludicrously fantastic and convoluted. I'd even go so far as to say that DEADLIER THAN THE MALE is actually a hell of a lot better than the two Connery Bond films that came out right before and after its release namely THUNDERBALL 1965 a slowmoving bloatfest worth seeing mostly for a great villain and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE 1967 the first of the insanely overthetop Bonds that blends spaceships assault helicopter fights offensively stereotypical western male fantasies about Japanese women and  I kid you not  ninjas to form what amounts to a listless travelogue with wouldbe clever dialog. In every way DEADLIER THAN THE MALE is the Bond film that should have been a part of the series rather than those two lackluster entries both of which used to hold a fond place in my younger Bond fan's heart but now stand revealed in my eyes as nothing more than examples of a franchise operating on autopilot and following the theory of if it ain't broke don't fix it. Why sit through either those for the umpteenth time when you can add this overlooked classic to your Netflix queue?".

Unlike a Bond film Deadlier Than the Male does not feature any spectacular stunts or eyepopping FX. It is a more realistic spy outing and rather than being merely a poor man's Bond is indeed more entertaining than some of the lesser 007 films such as The Man With the Golden Gun.

By the way Johnson plays Bulldog Drummond a character from the pulp novels of the 1920s. They have changed the character quite a bit and made him a suave sophisticated investigator who knows judo and is good with a quip or two. Johnson was apparently one of the actors considered for the first James Bond film and I can see why. He is confident without being cocky and quite smooth. The main villain is revealed about halfway through the film and turns out to be Nigel Green playing a similar character to the one he played in the Matt Helm film The Wrecking Crew. Smooth nonpulsed and very droll. Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina are the two female villains and they are quite nasty. We even get Drummond's nephew helping out the proceedings.There is a terrific sequence with a giant mechanized chess set that must be seen to be believed. Well done. The story is a tad slow and we only get to see London and the Italian coast as locations but the film works well without becoming ridiculous. Give it a chance I'm sure you will enjoy it.

Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond a gentleman who indulged in detective work was conceived in the 1920's in a series of novels and was in quite a few films in the 1930's and 40's. The last one before this was a 1951 potboiler Calling Bulldog Drummond with Walter Pidgeon. This lateinthegame restart of sorts has Mr. Drummond not referred to as 'Bulldog' here as little more than an insurance investigator. However the character and plot borrow heavily from the popular James Bond formula of the sixties and results in the closest approximation to the actual Bond films during this period more so than the 'Flint' duo of films and the Matt Helm series of films which featured American spies. The actor Johnson as Drummond even resembles Sean Connery in some shots with a similar virile approach a slight grim smirk  tough demeanor and Johnson is a fine actor so this isn't just some silly parody yet it does capture that same vicious streak of gallows humor. So yes the wicked humor is there  I mean really wicked. The two main femme fatales played by Sommer  Koscina are curvaceous assassins and they're outrageously effective hence the film's title. They are completely amoral enjoying their work and behaving as if they're shopping in some highend store rather than killing people. Some of their scenes the terminations actually made me wince a little probably because I'm not used to seeing such cruelty and callousness on film from females even if it is comedic in nature and tone. Ironically the lethal ladies would be copied by the Bond films in Diamonds Are Forever where the assassins were gay males rather than female.The plot tends to be fiendishly funny if you like that dark satire take on things the head villain is an outofcontrol capitalist moving through the corporate world with a new set of rules and simplistic ruthlessness. If for example members of a board vote on a corporate resolution and it's tied 5 to 5 he simply disposes of the member whom he feels is holding up the vote to change it in his favor. Drummond catches on to this of course and becomes the latest target. The best and most intense scene straight out of the Bond movies and about an hour in is the requisite 'villain and henchpeople have a last supper with the hero as planned victim' scenario. But Drummond taunts the villain and provokes the henchman a burly poor man's Oddjob into some bad moves. Drummond proves to be fearless  he's surrounded by characters we now know to be very dangerous and ends up mocking them all  it's one of the best Bond scenes and it's not in a Bond movie. Drummond then defies expectations by refusing to partake in the alsorequisite 'hero  femme fatale seduction scene' much to the lady's surprise and anger. And even though the budget is understandably lower than a typical Bonder while we're in London in the 1st half there's barely any spectacle the filmmakers do manage to throw in that wild weird chess board later outdoing many of the grander setpieces in the Bond films. Since Johnson plays it straight even straighter than Connery some might say much of this resembles Dr.No and From Russia With Love the Bonders which relied mostly on pure espionage. Sommer and actor Nigel Green would reunite in the Matt Helm Bondspoof The Wrecking Crew playing similar characters. Drummond and Johnson would return one more time in Some Girls Do.

	schema:reviewBody "Deadlier Than Male of 1967 is a stylish and highly amusing spyadventure flick that was clearly inspired by the popularity of the 60s James Bond films. None other than Quentin Tarantino is reported to love this film and if that rumor is true I can see why. My personal mainreason to watch the film was the ravishing Elke Sommer of whom I've been a fan ever since I saw her in Mario Bava's brilliant Gothic flicks Lisa And The Devil and Baron Blood. And while Elke Sommer and fellow eyecandy Silvia Koschina Lisa And The Devil La Mala Ordina... as well as the rest of the sexy female cast are not the only reason to see this film they are definitely the most convincing one. Bikiniclad babes Bondish villains and a great macabre sense of humor  this is what Deadlier Tan Male is all about. A promising premise in my opinion. While this film is clearly a Bondknockoff it reinvented a detective character of earlier decades. The character of Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond was popularized in the 20s and 30s and a kind of English pendant to the private eyes in American hardboiled detective novels and films. I have not seen any of the old Bulldog Drummond films so far but I sure am going to. The Bulldog Drummond in this film is a very James Bondish rich playboy and spy. He is played by Richard Johnson who was once intended to play the role of Bond in Dr. No. After several people are killed by sexy female assassins and by rather unusual methods Drummond investigates in order to find the one who pulls the strings behind these murders. The film's most ravishing quality are Elke Sommer and Sylva Koschina who play the constantly quarreling duo of sexy female assassins Irma Sommer and Penelope Koschina. The cast furthermore includes Nigel Green The Masque Of The Red Death The Face Of Fu Manchu... and Milton Reid Dr Phibes Rises Again. The relationship between Bulldog Drummond and his slightly annoying nephew is only remotely funny but the constant dark humor especially when people are being assassinated is hilarious. Overall Deadlier Than Male is no mustsee but definitely a highly amusing flick that cultcinema fans should enjoy.".

Bikiniclad babes Bondish villains and a great macabre sense of humor  this is what Deadlier Tan Male is all about. A promising premise in my opinion. While this film is clearly a Bondknockoff it reinvented a detective character of earlier decades. The character of Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond was popularized in the 20s and 30s and a kind of English pendant to the private eyes in American hardboiled detective novels and films. I have not seen any of the old Bulldog Drummond films so far but I sure am going to. The Bulldog Drummond in this film is a very James Bondish rich playboy and spy. He is played by Richard Johnson who was once intended to play the role of Bond in Dr. No. After several people are killed by sexy female assassins and by rather unusual methods Drummond investigates in order to find the one who pulls the strings behind these murders. The film's most ravishing quality are Elke Sommer and Sylva Koschina who play the constantly quarreling duo of sexy female assassins Irma Sommer and Penelope Koschina. The cast furthermore includes Nigel Green The Masque Of The Red Death The Face Of Fu Manchu... and Milton Reid Dr Phibes Rises Again. The relationship between Bulldog Drummond and his slightly annoying nephew is only remotely funny but the constant dark humor especially when people are being assassinated is hilarious. Overall Deadlier Than Male is no mustsee but definitely a highly amusing flick that cultcinema fans should enjoy.";

Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this particular movie compares quite favorably with several James Bond films in quality and entertainment value. I especially liked the way in which it used the strengths of the main actors and didn't attempt to weaken the overall effect by indulging in too much comedy like several of its counterparts did during this period with varying degrees of success. In essence it remained focused just enough to render a final product which most James Bond fans will probably enjoy. Above average.".

For the record I had watched a handful of the run of Drummond 'B' movies from the 1930s with John Howard or Ray Milland but I also own the quartet of wellregarded initial entries two starring Ronald Colman and a couple more emanating from Britain.Interestingly the star of this one  Richard Johnson  had made an uncredited appearance towards the start of his career in the MGM oneoff CALLING BULLDOG DRUMMOND 1951. By the way throughout his two stabs at the role the character is never once referred to by that nickname which I guess suggests his resilience but nor are we ever told just what field the hero operates in is he a Military Intelligence officer or just another secret agent?! Incidentally while he was usually flanked by a flamboyant superior as contact man and a comic butler for sidekick the former's role is downplayed here and the latter replaced with a youthful relative but whose girlfriend  played by Virginia North who would actually turn up in a different role in the sequel and also appear as Vulnavia to Vincent Price's THE ABOMINABLE DR.

As expected there are a plethora of attractive ladies and given the moniker which obviously bears no relation to a similarlytitled 1957 French melodrama starring Jean Gabin that I also own some of them even do the dirty work for the villain who also typically hides behind a veneer of respectability. The most notable are Elke Sommer Sylva Koscina and Suzanna Leigh  the first two make up an interesting and sparring sexycomic duo with the former being the spokesperson for Carl Peterson's nefarious machinations and the latter the 'thug' but whose kleptomania ultimately proves the undoing of both! while the latter is a new thus uncommitted recruit who unsurprisingly takes up with Drummond at the end. Curiously enough though the 2 latterday Drummond adventures were released simultaneously on R2 DVD the edition I acquired of this one was unfortunately trimmed of some 2 minutes  running only 93  with an evident cut in the scene where Johnson and Sommer share a room in Peterson's castle and all of a sudden she is in her underwear this edit is all the more baffling because a splitsecond nudity by Leigh or her standin at the climax has been left intact!The plot is the standard 'bidforworlddominationthrougheconomicmonopoly' which sees a great number of people involved these can basically be divided into associates and victims sometimes filling the requirements of both and include Leonard Rossiter George Pastell Lee Montague from the justviewed THE LEGACY 1978 and Zia Mohyeddin as the latest millionaire coincidentally a school chum of the younger Drummond to be targeted for elimination. Nigel Green then makes for a strong nemesis to Johnson who would also face Harry Palmer and with Sommer herself in tow Matt Helm but never Bond! and it is only in the latter stages that the film treads the camp factor as Drummond constantly rubs his burly bodyguardcummanservant the wrong way so that they eventually engage in a karate fight  the obvious conclusion being that Peterson is much better served by the weaker sex!

	schema:headline " An indecent review";
	schema:reviewBody "In the late fifties a large industrial complex was built near Schwedt in the GDR. This low budget film tells about the voluntary participation of the brigades of the Freie Deutsche Jugend in the building up and as such belongs to the socalled Aufbau films. The FDJ was an organization similar to the YMCA so the youth affiliate of there the Bolshevist Party. The boys and girls are strongly motivated to build a new socialist society but they lack the skills and knowledge. This is remedied by Tomas Breitsprecher played by the famous actor Manfred Krug who was also a jazz player an experienced civil engineer. However Tom is not really a textbook character and in particular has a bad reputation with women. Besides he has never joined the party. Nevertheless the construction proceeds rapidly even though a bush fire temporarily has a devastating effect. Tomas has several collisions with Sigrit the local FDJ secretary played by Christel Bodenstein apparently also a wellknown actress but this soon turns into a love affair. It becomes clear that the early marriage of Sigrit with another party member has been a mistake. The romance between Tom and Grit unfolds rather secretly in the fields and in an attic room. However they ascertain their mutual dedication and it seems sincere. Since the film ends together with the summer the final outcome of the affair remains unknown to the viewer. Marriage was by no means sacrosanct in the GDR. A large part of the film is devoted to the dialogs between Tom and Grit in short phrases Do you love your man? Yes. Does he love you? Yes. Doe you have children? No. Do you love your man? silence. I guess the texts merit a careful analysis which I have unfortunately omitted up till now. For me the intriguing part of the film is the sketch of the party life in those first GDR years since it shows the attitude that the state tried to promote among their people. Already the Soviet Union had its Subbotniks workers doing voluntary overtime. In the Bolshevist philosophy he workers should be willing to exploit themselves and would experience their work as a fulfillment or at least a dire need. Interestingly the rubble women in the GDR who cleaned up the debris caused by the allied bombardments did their job unpaid. On the other hand the women in the FRG western Germany were recompensed for the same work. At first sight the voluntary activity seems sympathetic. On closer examination it can hardly have been really voluntary and was based on social pressure or at best on manipulation. In addition volunteers seldom act in a professional and efficient manner. In the end it is probably best to give any decent work performed a fair pay. With this bold remark I end my rather indecent review.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the late fifties a large industrial complex was built near Schwedt in the GDR. This low budget film tells about the voluntary participation of the brigades of the Freie Deutsche Jugend in the building up and as such belongs to the socalled Aufbau films. The FDJ was an organization similar to the YMCA so the youth affiliate of there the Bolshevist Party. The boys and girls are strongly motivated to build a new socialist society but they lack the skills and knowledge. This is remedied by Tomas Breitsprecher played by the famous actor Manfred Krug who was also a jazz player an experienced civil engineer. However Tom is not really a textbook character and in particular has a bad reputation with women. Besides he has never joined the party. Nevertheless the construction proceeds rapidly even though a bush fire temporarily has a devastating effect. Tomas has several collisions with Sigrit the local FDJ secretary played by Christel Bodenstein apparently also a wellknown actress but this soon turns into a love affair. It becomes clear that the early marriage of Sigrit with another party member has been a mistake. The romance between Tom and Grit unfolds rather secretly in the fields and in an attic room. However they ascertain their mutual dedication and it seems sincere. Since the film ends together with the summer the final outcome of the affair remains unknown to the viewer. Marriage was by no means sacrosanct in the GDR. A large part of the film is devoted to the dialogs between Tom and Grit in short phrases Do you love your man? Yes. Does he love you? Yes. Doe you have children? No. Do you love your man? silence. I guess the texts merit a careful analysis which I have unfortunately omitted up till now. For me the intriguing part of the film is the sketch of the party life in those first GDR years since it shows the attitude that the state tried to promote among their people. Already the Soviet Union had its Subbotniks workers doing voluntary overtime. In the Bolshevist philosophy he workers should be willing to exploit themselves and would experience their work as a fulfillment or at least a dire need. Interestingly the rubble women in the GDR who cleaned up the debris caused by the allied bombardments did their job unpaid. On the other hand the women in the FRG western Germany were recompensed for the same work. At first sight the voluntary activity seems sympathetic.

George also becomes increasingly aware of his alternate lives not only of Joyce in each of them but what he carries of himself between each of those lives. In one of those lives he is the most recent homicide victim in a rash of BE's. In his case he is the first victim where nothing of monetary value has been stolen but only his brain removed from his skull and taken from the crime scene. The lead police investigators Inspector Berkley and Detective Williams although sometimes at odds with each other eventually come to the conclusion that the murder has something to do with brain research and that George may have been targeted rather than a random victim. In addition to Berkley and Williams' investigation and discovering the identity of the murderer the alternate question becomes how this situation fits in ...";

Later we find out he is not super intelligent but retains memories from all his other selves in parallel universes. I suppose at least one of his alternate selves must have gone through the interview already so he just pulls on that memory.He also explores a relationship with the same woman who is strikingly different in each of the parallel worlds. In one she is loving and compassionate in another scattered and distant. The story is never showy gimmicky or clichd unlike what we have come to expect from Hollywood.Visually there are not many films better than this. Each scene is so beautiful it's almost as though every inch of the scene was meticulously composed by hand. Some scenes lingered without dialogue and I wanted them to stay longer just so I could appreciate the scene more. The film leaves a definite mood long after the credits end.".

And when it seems that no ending in the world could possibly make everything previous add up  it does. The ending connects everything neatly. That is if you get it. Plus the script is fair and gives the viewer clues as to what is really going on with the main character. The film makes so much sense on so many levels. There are many interesting ideas presented one could analyze this movie and the ideas it presents for hours.The last scene of the movie will confuse some people but is actually rather simple the main character is dreaming his last dream  of sitting on the beach with his wife watching the ocean  and when a light appears on the horizon that light is the man's brain giving a signal on the machine that is keeping his brain alive. And when the light extinguishes the man says thank God commenting on his own death he is relieved that his bizarre existence is finally coming to an end. It is coming to an end because his wife decided to let the machine be switched off so that the brain can finally cease to live.The film is probably the best in a series of excellent movies that came out around the late 90s and that deal with reality eXistenZ Dark City the Spanish Open Your Eyes The 13th Floor 1999 Fight Club and Eyes Wide Shut. Time will make classics out of all of them.This is one of the best movies I have seen in years and certainly one of the most thoughtprovoking.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Worlds is a low budget independent film by French director Robert Lepage it is a surreal murder mystery which appears to have been made primarily to explore several different philosophical notions. It begins with two detectives arriving at the scene of a crime the victim George Barber Tom McCamus has been murdered and his brain removed from his body. We then meet George Barber alive and well. Since he was a boy it turns out George has had the ability to switch between different Possible Worlds at will. The love of his life is played by Tilda Swinton and we follow George in several different worlds meet the different versions of her and try to woo them all. In one world she is a shy scientist in another she is a confident business woman. What makes these very different women the same person? Well thats partially what the film is about. Simultaniously we follow the detectives as they hunt down George's missing brain and meet a mad scientist who experiments with extracted animal brains Gabriel Gascon.The 'Possible Worlds' from which this film takes its name is a concept of contemporary philosophy it is a method of discussing the nature of possibility and necessity. Instead of saying I might have gone to the shops one says there is a possible world in which I went to the shops. This allows for greater clarity of discussion about the nature of possibility. One of the more eccentric lines of thought in philosophy is idea that Possible Worlds actually exist technically they only possibly exist but every possibility is an actuality for that possibility... yes this is the simplified way of discussing it!. The concept is very similar to the quantum mechanics notion of multipleparallel dimensions as explored in a great deal of science fiction and is the central premise of this film.The film can be best described as a cross between Darren Arranofsky's Pi and the cult scifi Primer. In places it is distinctly Lynchian such as this dream sequence which is the only part of the film available on youtube there isn't even a trailer httpwww.youtube.comwatch?va7odlad7TOc Although the film isn't particularly complex and it isn't as deliberately convoluted as Primer which although enjoyable tries too hard to make its dialogue impenetrable following George through the various worlds and tying the different plot strands together does require the audience to concentrate.For a student of modern philosophy or a person fairly well read in the subject this film will be highly enjoyable. While it contains slightly heavy handed braininavat allusions the film primarily focuses on discussions of identity and possibility. Many different ideas are brought in regarding the nature of consciousness evolutionary development of the mind and physical embodiment and the film makes no attempt to give simple or easy answers to these. However for somebody not read in such areas the film is likely to be frustratingly dull and pointless. The film does not try to overly explain or reduce these notions such an attempt would be pointless anyway it is dealing with some of the most difficult material ever written 5 minutes of exposition isn't going to benefit anyone. But all of the films dialogue is very clear and simple and it never throws in unnecessary technical terms like Primer or tries to fool its audience. In spite of this I do fear its subject matter will alienate many viewers.This dichotomy is perhaps best seen in the film's ending which I wont reveal here. The film has a sad melancholic ending in which the story's plots come together and the characters journeys receive closure. This is good and it does mean even somebody unfamiliar with the concepts it is exploring can still enjoy the film. But at the same time it could appear to be wrapping up profound questions with an overly simplistic conclusion. The ending of the film is good but I think to truly appreciate the film is to realise that as with many great films its conclusion is in fact the least important aspect of it.Possible Worlds is an excellent film with a very niche audience it is to philosophy as Primer is to science. It contains enough surreal imagery and dark dry humour for any audience member to enjoy and I should of course point out that reading philosophy is by no means necessary for somebody to understand or engage with philosophical concepts any more than one needs to be an art scholar to enjoy good art. But its target audience as the name suggests is those who are directly familiar with the material that this film is exploring and if you are a fan of David Lewis Wittgenstein Kant or Descartes then this film really is essential viewing.".

In a similar way the mind alone cannot be considered alive it would create chaotic thoughts and the brain would also create fake sensory responses in a kind of limbo.That's why the movie is too still.

Just find a quiet place no noise no one can disturb. Make sure you can be at least an hour with your eyes closed and covered by a mask or something. To cover ambient sounds take a radio and tune it where there is no station or search on line for white noise generator. Temperature should be constant and comfortable.Have fun!".

Gorgeous scenery lovingly filmed. The photography was measured to include natural structure of beauty and form including the shoreline the rock formations the beach house and even the police station. I found myself enamored of the set design even when the story was quite interesting! THE STORY. Twilight Zone weirdness permeates and Rod Serling would not be out of place narrating. Dimensional or alternative universe jumping is the pretext for deeper probing. First what has the serial killing to do with it? This should be an easy guess for fantasy film cinephiles. Second what has the rat brain to do with it? This is to be fair an apt metaphor. OK but what about Wittgenstein? THE PHILOSOPHY. Actress Tilda Swinton seems to enjoy the deep end of the pool with unending credits of philosophy in her filmography including Francis Bacon Vanilla Sky and.. Wittgenstein. And actor Tom McCamus has a philosopher inserted into his last name. So we know the philosophy herein is deliberate. What is this philosophy? Relative existence.Do we exist or do we not? Can we prove it? Do possibilities exist or are they neverbeen wisps? Are we someone's or something's lab experiment? Is there God? The answers to such questions are somewhat less obvious than you might think. Yet if we are only experiments or dreams someone or something has created that experiment or dream. Therefore a creator. Therefore an existence. As for possibilities both in reality and in this film these are out of our control anyway except for decisions we make at any given time.Some might find the ending of this film to be too easy. I find it embracing and satisfying. Blame writers Mighton and LePage if you disagree. I especially liked when George talks about fossils evidence of the past. Are they evidence or merely part of the construct? Shells within shells.MUSIC. I cannot leave you without telling you how beautiful is the soundtrack especially Peter Gabriel's haunting The Nest. Well after the film was over I was transfixed so much of the music that I merely kept staring ahead awaiting more.RATING. For utilization of budget crafting of story the passionate Tilda Swinton and all else I give this 1010.".

However we endeavoured to watch it objectively and without philosophical prejudice. The result one of the most painful 90 minutes of our lives.A film cannot be termed 'deep' or 'thought provoking' merely in virtue of having excruciatingly long pauses in it or a main character who stares into space constantly. Whoever wrote this clearly has no knowledge of philosophy beyond the opening lines of Wittgenstein Descartes and dare I say Lewis although I doubt the writer had even heard of Lewis as this is such a car crash of an attempt to deal with possible worlds. This film is not deep nor does it address big or weighty philosophical ideas. It fails to be entertaining and it is not particularly well filmed. The acting is stilted and the dialogue where it exists is dreadful.Overall review 110. Do not watch this film if you have any background in philosophy you will be offended. All I can say is I'm glad the late great David Lewis probably never saw this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last month I had met a Time loop Scifi fanatic who has been following crazy mindbenders from the 90's and recommended couple of David Lynch and Mike Leigh flicks and this great Spanish film Timecrimes  Possible Worlds to her  Her review about the latter flick went over an hour's time to sum it up she called it art house hell and incredibly slow and boring.. So wanted to share my thoughts on this great hidden gem of a flick which is not for all tastes.This is one of those movies that are honest piece of art a very rare thing. It reflects very well the changing emotions associated with wandering humanity. None of this is said or discussed in the movie as this is a metaphorical film that uses the visual narrative and some mindbending cinematography to approach these points. The Surreal scenes the poetic cinematography the fact that the special effects are no such a thing but camera tricks and the result of a pernickety preparation and tampering of the movie sets adds even more artistic value to this unique Scifi Mystery Drama. Tom McCamus  Tilda Swinton have never been better than they are here likablepleasant and utterly believable as they make their way through this labyrinthine but spectacularly challenging maze of a screenplay. It's amazing how many things I missed in the movie the first time I viewed couple of years back. I watched it again in two days and Look now this movie really isn't really an extravaganza Science fiction flick in the sense that most people think of how science fiction to be made or your normal Scifi dosage. The film is superbly directed by Robert Lepage and it is arguably Lepage's best film till date. I don't want to shed more info on the film nor the plot basic plot about this film as I don't want to give too much away. I will say though that the final scenes were very powerful which surprised me.This film has so many meanings it would be exhausting to write even half. People especially the detractors of the film should give up on saying that there is nothing at the center of the film and that it is merely pretentious art. Like I said it has so many meanings that it would take me forever to write even a few with the limited amount of paragraph space I have. This one's an example of ingenious filmmaking that inscribe brains over spectacle with some captivating and strong performances.".

Though the film is one that had her costarring with her favorite leading man the film is all Greer.Like Maytime the film starts with Greer as the aged family matriarch of the Parkington family during Christmas of 1938. Her husband who died many years ago was Walter Pidgeon and the family has gathered once again. But there's a crisis brewing. Her grandsoninlaw Edward Arnold has embezzled a ton of money in some bad market speculation. His daughter Frances Rafferty and Garson's great granddaughter additionally has a romantic problem she's torn between her fianc Tom Drake who is whistleblowing on Arnold and family loyalty.During the evening Garson reminisces back to certain crisis times in her own marriage and it eventually tells her what she must do in this situation. I will say this about the Parkingtons Garson's the genuine article the rest of them are a spoiled and selfish lot only Rafferty seems to have escaped the taint.I have to say it was a little strange seeing the much older Gladys Cooper playing the daughter of the heavily made up Greer Garson still both actresses are professional enough to make it convincing. There's a wonderful performance by Cecil Kellaway as the Prince of Wales during the Gay Nineties when Parkingtons are in Europe. Kellaway may be the Prince of Wales but he proves to be real sharp in terms of human relations and delicately removes a bump in the road of the Parkington marriage.Agnes Moorehead got a Supporting Actress nomination for Mrs. Parkington in the role of an impoverished French aristocrat who becomes friend and confidante of Garson. She gives Garson a lot of sage advice. She lost to Ethel Barrymore for None But The Lonely Heart and Garson lost her race for Best Actress to Ingrid Bergman in Gaslight.Mrs. Parkington remains however one of MGM's best films of the Forties. The influence of Maytime and of Citizen Kane in the telling of the Parkington family story is obviously apparent. And the message about both inherited wealth and the damage that mere speculation without creating could have come from Wall Street. For Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon fans a must.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining family saga from Louis Bromfield's bestseller.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an entertaining family saga from Louis Bromfield's novel the kind of long digressive trash wallow that still regularly tops bestseller lists.  Essentially a subversive treatise on why inherited wealth is a bad thing we observe the wealthy Mrs. Parkington as she copes with her selfish dishonest middleaged children in 1920s N.Y. while reminiscing about her stormy Gilded Age marriage to her late husband a Wall Street cutthroat who made a vast fortune.Greer Garson wears a black wig in this role and  surprisingly  it really dims her luster.  One misses that hair so unmistakably red even in black and white which usually illuminates her face.  She also looks too old in the early scenes in which she's meant to be a teenager and her acting is too arch in her scenes in old age.  Even so she's a suitable and sympathetic figurehead for this limousine ride of a movie.  Walter Pidgeon is exactly what the part of the Robber Baron requires  physically imposing and masculine stubborn and rakish by turns he is never dynamic but always convincing.There are several worthwhile points of interest here  In a role that earned her a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination Agnes Moorehead gives a vivid performance as the French mistress that Parkington insensitively presses into service to make his wife the queen of N.Y. society.  Moorehead's efficient acting suggests everything about this woman's precarious existence as well has her combination of artifice and pragmatism. She's like a character out of Trollope.  A slightly lesser revelation is Gladys Cooper cast against type and showing surprising depths of cynicism as a suicidal playgirl.  In addition the film is more frank and relaxed about sexual philandering both preand extramarital than one would expect from an MGM film of 1944.  And several of the sets most notably the spectacular rendering of the Parkington mansion on Fifth Avenue including an entry hall that doubles as a ballroom complete with two endlessly curving staircases and a colonnade of pillars that leads to a dining hall seating 100 are prime examples of the opulent art direction one routinely enjoys in Hollywood pictures of the '40s.Finally although the first third of the film sometimes drags there are two excellent set pieces that are beautifully constructed and lovingly detailed by director Tay Garnett.  The first is a Parkington dinner party to which N.Y.'s 400 are invited  the pervasive tension and gradual buildup to disaster are really memorable here as is the use of the film's most impressive set.  The second is a very droll bit of drawing room comedy during which Mrs. Parkington meets and enlists the aid of the Prince of Wales to win back her husband from the clutches of an English society hostess. The polite bitchery between the ladies is delightful.Prospective viewers can decide if this list of pleasures justifies a look at this luxe movie.".

Greer Garson was exceptional as we watched her age from a young lady to a family matriarch in her 80's.  I must agree that the pairing of she and Walter Pidgeon was superb and Agnes Moorehead's performance was remarkable. Gladys Cooper always stands out in any cast and with costumes of such splendor and the storylines that ranged from tragic to tremendous there was no way to lose with this movie.  Perhaps now I'll go purchase the novel and see if I can get any more from this tale that didn't make it to the big screen. As they always say the book was better than the movie.  I intend to try and find out. I can hardly imagine it but I can only hope to find more and more delight from the adventures of the Parkingtons.  This was one of my favorites with the pairing of Garson and Pidgeon. It's a truly entertaining movie and I recommend it highly!".

I must agree that the pairing of she and Walter Pidgeon was superb and Agnes Moorehead's performance was remarkable. Gladys Cooper always stands out in any cast and with costumes of such splendor and the storylines that ranged from tragic to tremendous there was no way to lose with this movie.  Perhaps now I'll go purchase the novel and see if I can get any more from this tale that didn't make it to the big screen. As they always say the book was better than the movie.  I intend to try and find out. I can hardly imagine it but I can only hope to find more and more delight from the adventures of the Parkingtons.  This was one of my favorites with the pairing of Garson and Pidgeon. It's a truly entertaining movie and I recommend it highly!";

Garson has long been a favorite of mine and I particularly revere her performance in Random Harvest. This film isn't quite that good but it is a gem.Of particular interest here are two very unusual performances by supporting actors. When I read in advance that Agnes Moorehead played a French socialite...well I just couldn't see it. But she was wonderful and this is an Agnes Moorehead you've never seen before! And Cecil Kellaway as Edward Prince of Wales...again a very different performance and so well done.The story itself is interesting with Garson as an old family institution reflecting on her life. If there's a criticism about this film it's that Garson looks too young even in her elderly makeup. But for much of the movie she's her usual alluring self. Is it a sentimental melodrama? Yes. But a delightful one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mrs. Parkington is an incredibly well made filmwith great acting and some lovely production values. Clearly MGM gave this film the full glossy studio treatment. And for her wonderful performance Greer Garson was nominated for an Oscar. However I am very ambivalent about the film because so many of the characters are either despicable or pathetic. In many ways it reminds me of the country music song Stand By Your Manas a woman should put up with ANYTHING in order to keep even the most awful man. Clearly this is a film for dependent personalities! The film begins near the present time. The Parkington family appears to be made up of a group of sociopathsall loathsome jerks who think mostly of themselves. When the matriarch Mrs. Parkington Garson learns that one of the brood is a thief she begins to reminisceremembering her life with Mr. Parkington Walter Pidgeon. At first their marriage seems pretty nicewith a rich and doting husband. However through the course of these long series of flashbacks you learn that Mr. Parkington is vindictive petty selfish and cheats on Mrs. Parkington. And as for Mrs. Parkington she is clever and longsufferingand lifted up as some sort of shining example. I couldn't help but think she was pathetic and would have probably accepted Mr. Parkington back after he murdered or slept with children or sheep. And this brings me to my ambivalenceno onenot anyone in this family is likable in the least. And the film seems to promote the notion that a woman's job is just to put up with this and smile throughout! Talk about an antifeminist message! The bottom line is that I'd hate for my daughters to watch such a film as I'd hate to think that Mrs. Parkington is someone to admire though the film tries HARD to say this. If Garson's character had either shot her husband or left him and bled him dry in alimony then maybe I would have enjoyed it much more. A great job of acting and a sick message to this film.Oh and I should mention that in one brief scene the Parkingtons joke about how it is Mr. Parkington's job to regularly 'thrash his wife'. Wow....need I say any more?! Well yes. If you like films that promote women as lovely doormats also try Mary Pickford's last film Secrets. Her husband is also a piece of work and she looks back fondly to their lives together.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually like Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson in most of their films. I don't feel that the failure of this film lies in their acting but the blame instead lies with whoever wrote the script and the director. Mrs. Parkington is a widow living in a big mansion and her adult children and grandchildren are visiting her on Christmas Eve and we soon learn they are all leading disappointing unhappy lives. An author visits and leaves Mrs. Parkington a copy of a book he wrote about her great American family. This gives opportunity for the series of flashbacks.So as a girl Mrs. Parkington Susie meets Augustus Parkington in a Nevada mining town where he owns the mine. Pidgeon as Parkington is trying to do Rhett Butler with an English accent. Susie is doing a cross between Cinderella and Scarlett O'Hara so she goes between having a Southern accent and an English one as the confused westerners look on. Later on the mine explodes killing Susie's mother and Parkington asks Susie to marry him. Actually I think all of that vibration is Irving Thalberg turning over in his grave appalled at what Louis B. Mayer is turning out as product since his death. But I digress. Marry in haste repent at leisure and even in his leisure Augustus Parkington is a petty vindictive man who seems like a sexist even by 19th century standards. He's not the usual adorable socially clueless fellow that graceful Garson's character customarily falls in love with. And the clichs just go on from there. A tip  Do not play a drinking game with this film where you take a shot every time you hear or see a tired movie clich or you will be dead in twenty minutes. Watch something else. You have better things to do with your life. I give it four points for the art design because MGM always did get that right and also for Agnes Moorehead as Augustus Parkington's French aristocrat ???? mistress. He fires her as mistress after the wedding then employs Moorehead's character as Henry Higgins to Garson's Eliza Doolittle of the Rockies. A novel way out of a sticky situation for Augustus and the only thing in the film that made me smile.".

As his wife Susie Garson wearing a dark wig and looking rather like Yvonne DeCarlo ages from a naive young woman to the crusty 84 year old family matriarch. The characterization is never believable but her scenes as the elderly Mrs. Parkington are especially objectionable she's too arch. Neither Garson or Pigeon is particularly wellaided by a meandering script that fails to adequately clarify the relationships among the family members or takes the time to develop the various characters. Consequently one simply doesn't care what happens to the members of the Parkington dynasty. The supporting cast...among them Edward Arnold Lee Patrick Dan Duryea Cecil Kellaway Frances Rafferty and Tom Drake...is competent but only Agnes Moorehead in a rare sympathetic turn as Pigeon's exmistress and Gladys Cooper as Pigeon and Garson's dypsomaniacal daughter manage to make a significant impression.".

The members of the Parkington family are assembling in the grand house of their mater familia Susie Garson. As they wait for Susie to descend the stair and honor them with her presence they spread their flawed character traits and dissatisfaction with the world around the drawing room.You may have met a woman like Susieone whose very existence is a memorial to the memory of her deceased husband Major Augustus Parkington Walter Pidgeon. This woman usually refers to her man as The Major or Mister So And So. And inevitably the man whose life she celebrates even in death was a real bastard or at least someone very terribly flawed making her love for him supposedly more heroic more saintly. There is something to that. Gus was a man dedicated to Susie in his own way. And his love for her was not in compliance with society's rules. But he never bowed to the will of society.Later that night Janethe missing granddaughterdrops by to see Susie. She explains that she is leaving for Peru with a young man. This sparks the first of many flashbacks in the film. Back fiftyfive years to Leaping Rock Nevadaa small town built around a silver mine. Susie was only eighteen when she met Gus owner of the mine.Up to this point in the film I was enjoying its exposition. But somewhere after Leaping Rock the action slowed to a plodding pace. And the deficiencies in the script and the acting became apparent. Some of the words that come from the lips of the primary couple are inauthenticat least as delivered. There is a scene where Susie confronts Gus upon realizing he has been working to destroy some men who dared to decline a dinner invitation. Here the acting is truly horrible. And it shows how an inauthentic moment can drag down a film.Maybe it's just me but I found the incessant use of I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen in the background monotonous and annoying.Agnes Moorehead is wonderful as the Baroness Aspasia Conti the woman who bridged the gap between Susie and Gus and helped them stay together. Hans Conreid is enjoyable in a smaller role as Mr. Ernst the manager of a temperamental tenor.With all the talent involved this film should have been better.".

The plot is jumpstarted as the family daughter intends to get married but there is a secret which her beau has and intends to tell. This ingot might just kill their chance for marriage and happiness. As it involves financial ruin it causes an assemblage of the remaining members of this family. Here the flashbacks begin that tells the story of the dead Patriach and the matriarch of this family how they met at an old dingy coal town their marriage pits and falls and always in all these scenes Garson luminence is assured. It is said that the writer of the book so loved this adaptation and told the director Tay garnett so. But one can't avoid the fact that in my postTV movie of the week eyes this movie would have made a good miniseries in the eighties. And it feels it. The ending is a good old smacking of American entreprenial values and greed. I particularly remember a scene where Walter Pidgeon promises to crush everybody who refused to show up for a dinner party. It feels like a scene out Of Kane and Abel a book that was turned into a wellreceived miniseries in the eighties. Like I said that's what it is.".

The plot is jumpstarted as the family daughter intends to get married but there is a secret which her beau has and intends to tell. This ingot might just kill their chance for marriage and happiness. As it involves financial ruin it causes an assemblage of the remaining members of this family. Here the flashbacks begin that tells the story of the dead Patriach and the matriarch of this family how they met at an old dingy coal town their marriage pits and falls and always in all these scenes Garson luminence is assured. It is said that the writer of the book so loved this adaptation and told the director Tay garnett so. But one can't avoid the fact that in my postTV movie of the week eyes this movie would have made a good miniseries in the eighties. And it feels it. The ending is a good old smacking of American entreprenial values and greed. I particularly remember a scene where Walter Pidgeon promises to crush everybody who refused to show up for a dinner party. It feels like a scene out Of Kane and Abel a book that was turned into a wellreceived miniseries in the eighties. Like I said that's what it is.";

My own parents born in 1892 and wed in 1914 were partners in their marriage as were most of their friends. Even though women took care of the home and children and men were the breadwinners in all decisions and routines both husbands and wives were equal participants.

Garson goes from anxious young lady to beloved matriarch struggling for years to contribute to society with the ambitious Walter Pidgeon later finding that the ungrateful dynasty they create doesn't share the values she's tried to instill in them. They are neurotic greedy entitled drunkards and even suicidal and as an aging grandmother reaches out to the last one she thinks she can influence in creating a life of meaning not waste. A brilliant all star cast and the MGM gloss helps this become one of the great films of the 1940's and a film I wish in spite of its popularity at the time was more well known.Like the following year's The Valley of Decision this is a family soap opera where each scandal and scheme makes you want to know more about each of these characters. Garson is breathtakingly beautiful aging from late teens to her 80's another example that behind every strong and ethical little old lady was once a face of such loveliness that wrinkles seem impossible until the ravages of time take over. Pidgeon has minimal screen time just part of the ensemble supporting Greer but as their fourth pairing it is as important as those and he is vital to how the story builds. Underneath the titles two fascinating supporting players deliver characterizations that are thrilling in every little detail. As Pidgeon s former mistress Agnes Moorehead delivers her most surprising performance an aging French beauty who knows what she has become and willingly passes the baton to Garson training her in the nuances of becoming a great lady. She deservedly received an Oscar nomination for this part and you will remember her long after this film is over. She would do her final acting work in a very similar part the elegant Aunt Alicia in the original Broadway production of Gigi.Then there's Gladys Cooper as Garson's troubled daughter so filled with self hate and disrespect for the legacy that she needs to be reminded of her parent's struggles so she could be rich and miserable. Married to an amoral count Edward Arnold she mocks everybody other than her mother including herself in her disgust. With her characterization misery has never come in such a well dressed package. Everybody else contributes little bits of detail here and there with Cecil Kellaway Tom Drake and Lee Patrick among the huge cast of fascinating characters. As this is based upon a novel by Louis Bromfield I'm surprised that nobody has had the thought of remaking it. In today's world of self centered individuals blaming their problems on the elders in their family without trying to fix their problems besides claiming to have some mental disorder this feels to be very timely as the world escapes from traditional values and simple beauty that comes from nature and God not man made pleasures that only briefly remove problems.".

Susie and the Major have children and encounter tragedy and separation. With the Major gone now Susie reflects on how best to handle this situation by asking herself what the Major would do.Really lovely film with fine performances by Moorhead Pidgeon and of course Garson. In the beginning she sports a black wig I kind of missed even in black and white her flaming red hair. Strangely Gladys Cooper plays Garson's daughter when Mrs. Parkington was 84. Cooper was 16 years older in reality. In those days it was more economical for studios to use actresses under contract than borrow someone though lending actors out was incredibly lucrative. Possibly Cooper was under contract and available. The film also features Edward Arnold Dan Duryea Lee Patrick Tom Drake Hugh Marlowe Hans Conried with Peter Lawford in a tiny role.Good movie.".

	schema:headline " Exceptional acting in an otherwise average drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Tay Garnett the screenplay for this Louis Bromfield novel was written by Robert Thoeren and Polly James to create a romance which plays out over 65 years mostly in flashback. The drama itself is average but some of the acting is exceptional including Greer Garson in the title role and Agnes Moorehead as Aspasia Conti both performances were Oscar nominated. Although there are several other familiar actors and actresses in supporting roles the film's story revolves around Major August 'Gus' Parkington Walter Pidgeon and the simple boarding house maid girl he married.The Major's a bit of a scoundrel certainly an independent and a risk taker the kind of man who helped build this great country who is somewhat tamed by Susie whom he dubs his 'Sparrow' as their relationship evolves.

The love story a triangle of sorts provides the film its only compelling momentsThe Major owned a mine in some drink water town named Leaping Rock out West in 1873 or thereabouts. His only concern was how fast he could the silver out of it so he paid the workers Harry Cording etc. double so that they'd work it instead of worry about their safety. Susie did the cleaning in the local boarding house which her mother Mary Servoss owned. She's naturally excited to meet the worldly Major when he comes to town to check on his investment he is smitten with her beauty. However she will not give in to his charms and become another of his conquests. When the mine inevitably collapses Susie's mother is killed because she was filling in for her daughter taking lunch to the men. The Major leaves her no choice but to accept his proposal and the next thing you know they're married living and staying in the Royal Hotel in New York. But what do you know the Major had been practically engaged to a French Baroness also living in New York named Aspasia Conti Moorehead before he'd gone out to Leaping Rock. So the first thing he does upon his return after apologizing to Aspasia is ask her to help Susie become presentable to all his friends in New York! The Major's new wife is not initially ever? accepted which in a perverse way leads to a miscarriage of their first child followed by the Major's revenge upon those to whom he assigns blame.

	schema:reviewBody "After giving us two excellent films  The Untouchables and Casualties of War director and auteur Brian De Palma tried to get the masters degree on major filmmaking with the very complex bestselling novel by Tom Wolfe. Faced to the challenge of making a great satire of nowadays America De Palma does not find his own voice as he did in his two previous films and goes back to the copyandpaste path. This time it is not an imaginative and talented personal version of Hitchcock obsessions but an interesting approach to Kubrick's style in Dr Strangelove and even Lolita. After confessing that the director he admires in a most intimate way is Stanley Kubrick Brian De Palma uses the witty Tom Wolfe novel as the story he needs to imitate one of his most admired masters.The result is an excessive but funny satire. It is certainly underwritten overacted and overdirected but still De Palma shows once again a great visual style and a wild sense of humour which makes us laugh several times.Perhaps De Palma should have remembered that such a witty and complex story has to be told seriously with the apparent simplicity and hidden complexity he reached in Casualties of War without trying to underline with the direction that every scene is supposed to be funny. Those strange camera angles taken from Kubrick nuclear satire do not work here and the characters are too exaggerated  Jean Renoir said that each character has some reasons and hereif De Palma had tried harder not only to criticize but to understand them it would have been a much more effective film and being both a Kubrick and a De Palma fan I think that Kubrick influence was not good at all here. In this satire as in his Vietnam drama such a talented director as De Palma  could have given more importance to substance that to form given that this was not one of his brilliant thrillers where form is essential but an intelligent satire about people. In fact in many moments of the film De Palma uses a not so mannered and much more effective style and shows a great talent in portraiting situations ironically something which is not usual in films from the nineties.Overall this work remains as one of the most aggressive portraits of America ever filmed. Perhaps this is why the film was a flop in the Box ffice  it was absurd to make it with such a expensive cast and budget given that such an acid satire cannot be popular and De Palma's career which was on his best moment did not recover completely even after the wonderful Carlito's Way one of his best films. If you study Film direction it is absolutely necessary to see it because of its risks mistakes and achievements.In conclussion one of those strange films which you will find fascinating both because of its values and its mistakes.Forget about the novel the film is an excessive and wild satire which will make you both think and laugh. De Palma genius and talent are present in many scenes. Moments like the initial shot Alan King's speech Clifton JamesDonald Moffat or Andre Gregory performances even the Morgan Freeman final scene which De Palma did not like and is really good reminding me of Capra something extremely difficult in such a cynical decade are not easy to forget.It is not often to find such a complex and interesting film. I strongly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a film that didn't deserve all the bad press it received this is it. The Bonfire of the Vanities is actually an absorbing slickpaced and wellacted piece of cinema that works on several levels. Tom Hanks is great as Sherman McCoy a Wall Street hot shot whose life unravels because of one wrong turn into the Bronx. While behind the wheel of McCoy's Mercedes his mistress accidentally strikes an intimidating young black man who approached the financial wizard. Enter Bruce Willis as Peter Fallow a reporter eager to regain his reputation who sees the incident as just what the doctor ordered. The Bonfire of the Vanities is a fascinating look at how self interests trump decency how public perception matters more than the truth and how lies are sometimes necessary for the truth to surface. One of the reasons this film was so poorly received is that it isn't often laughoutloud funny. But Bonfire isn't really a comedy it's a satire about contemporary society and one that hits all too close to home.".

The Bonfire of the Vanities is actually an absorbing slickpaced and wellacted piece of cinema that works on several levels. Tom Hanks is great as Sherman McCoy a Wall Street hot shot whose life unravels because of one wrong turn into the Bronx. While behind the wheel of McCoy's Mercedes his mistress accidentally strikes an intimidating young black man who approached the financial wizard. Enter Bruce Willis as Peter Fallow a reporter eager to regain his reputation who sees the incident as just what the doctor ordered. The Bonfire of the Vanities is a fascinating look at how self interests trump decency how public perception matters more than the truth and how lies are sometimes necessary for the truth to surface. One of the reasons this film was so poorly received is that it isn't often laughoutloud funny. But Bonfire isn't really a comedy it's a satire about contemporary society and one that hits all too close to home.";

Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance and shows real emotion in bringing this highly plausible character to life. Unfortunately his character is the only one with enough depth to be realistic.  Even Morgan Freeman's Judge White representing a refreshing dose of intelligence and honesty in the film is perhaps too good to be believed.  All of the other characters are mere caricatures appearing too greedy too pretentious too selfabsorbed or too flighty to be believed. Bruce Willis might have made himself an exception as well but I feel he simply lacked enough screen time to flesh out the different faces he had to show.Nevertheless the story is very well told.  If the other characters appear less than convincing accept them as colorful background for McCoy who is the real focus anyway.  There are numerous laughs and the other characters represent elements that are definitely present in society  even if not to the extent shown here. Wolfe's story is entertaining enough to make this movie worth seeing.  And it might even make you think twice about the names you see next time you open a newspaper.7  10 stars.".

The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. Yet one must admit it is a noble effort. It does have a good if poorly cast band of actors who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures. The film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are apparent if not particularly effective.

Tom Hanks even before Philadelphia or Forrest Gump or Sleepless in Seattle played the likable everyman. Hanks' character Sherman McCoy is a wall street tycoon aged 38 with a wife two years older a daughter he adores and a young mistress that he insists he deserves all because he is a master of the universe. In the book Judy McCoy Sherman's wife is described as handsome but matronly at aged 40. Sherman remembers his mother telling him a wife two years older would not make a difference when he was 24 and she was 26 but 20 years later it would and actually it took only ten years.But then one night when he is with his mistress Sherman takes a wrong turn off the freeway into the South Bronx and ends up hitting a black youth with his car because he perceives his life is in danger and decides to not report the accident to police to hit and run. However he is tracked down and arrested and soon realizes he is not the master of anything compared to the grifters community leaders ambulance chasers and prosecutors who finally have a completely unlikable rich white perp and a poor black victim.The novel was wonderful and nuanced. The movie is obvious and almost farcical. Hanks is too likable to play any of the characters in this film I had Bruce Willis pictured as Sherman McCoy more than the drunken yellow journalist and Kim Cattrell who plays Sherman's wife doesn't look like the matronly 40 year old and barely tolerated wife of anybody in 1990. Only Morgan Freeman as the judge rings remotely true. I'd pass on this one if I were you but for sure read the book. After the 2008 crash and the banksters walking away without a scratch Sherman McCoy seems more real than ever.".

It's about lying while alleging being high and great. So how about that in a whole community religious leaders district attorney journalists rich people.. with all the foundations they represent. It burns all of its damn hypocrisy in big tableau of caricature. Sure this is the comedy that Oliver Stone didn't make !The script is smart sneering at that decayed world by one accident which uncovers its many big ironies while leading a tragic situation of an honest man in the middle of it then a thrilling one to prove his innocence. It has a bitter sense of humor enough to remember If you're going to live in a whorehouse there's only one thing you can do be the best damn whore around. I'm leaving you! After the party... and now if you will excuse me we have guests. and the monologue of the lead's father I believe in the truth so lie ! and using the narration of the journalist was great now this is a truthfullair character that makes him the best expression of his reality and a symbol of it too.Brian De Palma entertained us with simple style and no freaky tricks tightening the pace by clever angles and wicked zoomins. I still recall the moment when all the reporters attack Hanks' car in front of the police station while the rain is falling holding their black umbrellas while the camera is shooting them from above to look like many bats blockade and swoop the poor man to suck his blood.I love it. It's a classic for me and a type of movies that Hollywood kind of lost interest in since years ago. Maybe it flopped because it faced the people with their ugly truth. I know that the bad reviews of it were totally dumb or liar themselves. However by fair viewing all of these blind opinions will burn !Bottom line  De Palma made his share of bad movies The Bonfire of the Vanities isn't one of them or even close.".

	schema:reviewBody "The point of Wolfe's original novel  indeed the point of the whole story  is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency. The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter Campbell and that's only touched upon. That aside everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity power money or self aggrandizement.Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head. His response was a denial. After all he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers. Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy. Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. Nobody was any good. And Sherman McCoy wound up broke a professional protester for social justice. The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable. Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist  he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.Yes any of us might have found ourselves as Sherman and his mistress do stuck in the South Bronx threatened by a couple of black kids and making a getaway after bumping into one of them. That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid. But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message however nebulous the message is. Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo take out a shotgun and start shooting into the ceiling with it as he does in the movee. In what's supposed to be a funny scene ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away shrieking. It simply would not have happened. The movie has left the novel's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe's sensibility the work he put into capturing the real has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy fantastic and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up. Similar empty scenes follow screaming out for Wolfe's verisimilitude.The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see Don Juan in Hell at the opera. We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head. The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal it overstates them as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.It's not the acting or the direction that's poor. The film's not bad in those respects. And the photography is pretty good too including two rather spectacular shots  the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It's the script that is thoroughly botched.The first half of the movie roughly is okay in conception and execution. It keeps some of the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is named Marshall. Who the hell would name a dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.Wolfe's cynical redneck rightwingism may be offensive to a lot of people but he's got the cojones to lay his percepts out. Alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.".

Murray Abraham which I understand was uncredited something I do not understand at all. Melanie Griffith is smashing in this  the best thing she ever did aside from Working Girl  and Tom Hanks is perfect. But it is Bruce Willis' performance that holds everything together and he really shines here  in fact his performance is quite compassionate at a certain point showing a side of him I did not think existed although I'm a great fan of his comedy work especially Death Becomes Her  for the life of me I will never understand why this film bombed as loudly as it did  maybe it ruffled too many of those bleeding heart liberal feathers in LaLaLand!".

Murray Abraham which I understand was uncredited something I do not understand at all. Melanie Griffith is smashing in this  the best thing she ever did aside from Working Girl  and Tom Hanks is perfect. But it is Bruce Willis' performance that holds everything together and he really shines here  in fact his performance is quite compassionate at a certain point showing a side of him I did not think existed although I'm a great fan of his comedy work especially Death Becomes Her  for the life of me I will never understand why this film bombed as loudly as it did  maybe it ruffled too many of those bleeding heart liberal feathers in LaLaLand!";

Amping up the dread even when the horror seems inevitable creates a sensation of anguish because one knows that something is terribly out of kilter in this house. What director Shimizu does here with introducing the old lady in the unkempt house by having us see her hands weakly bang on the rice door and then having her stare vacantly out to nowhere as Rika tries to clean up the place only to later meet the entities in the house is unsettling as anything else that comes later. She whispers mantralike something closely rendered to an I told you so and one only has to see the mounting horror in her old eyes to know something horrible is about to happen to her while Rika witnesses this and faints in horror. It doesn't matter that one sees the little boy running around and then mutely screaming in that catlike shriek or the shadow and croak of someone even worse... it's the inexorability in which this curse comes forth and attacks this old defenseless lady and then each person who has comewill come in contact with it and when it becomes clear that the curse is not bound only to the haunted house but is in fact a growing web of death the rug gets neatly pulled out from the viewer's feet because safe becomes only a word and something wicked this way comes.This is a film that people will love or hate.

	schema:reviewBody "Rika Nishina Megumi Okina works for a social services agency in Tokyo although she's never seen any clients. When a new case comes in and they're short on staff her boss has to send her out. Her first case is a doozy. When she enters the client's home no one seems to be there and the house is a mess. She hears scraping on a doorthe old woman she is to care for is there but in a semicatatonic state. Soon after she learns that there is much more wrong than bad housekeeping and a neglected old woman. There just may be threatening supernatural forces behind the scenes.This film is really the third in the Japanese JuOn series. I won't usually watch a series out of order but this is the only JuOn film officially and thus easily available in the U.S. I was very anxious to watch the American remake The Grudge 2004 and actually watched it the day before watching this film.The first 40something minutes are closest to the American remake but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. It's also more episodic. Neither of those facts are negative here and both lend to a somewhat easier understanding of the broader mythology behind the JuOn monsters which is presented much more clearly in this film. However the episodic nature also means that the viewer has to pay attention to the various characters and their names or there is a good chance that one will get lostthis story touches on many different people in many different scenarios. Occasionally there are characters brought into each other's episodes sometimes as subtly as a name mentioned in a news report. These crossreferences which can also slightly break the linear timeline are effective if one is alert.There are things that writerdirector Takashi Shimizu does better in this version and things he does better in the American version. In this version I loved the brutal opening sequence. Although it's somewhat present towards the end of the American version it is much more effective here. I enjoyed the more traditional Japanese homethis film was shot on location in an actual house whereas the American remake was shot on a house constructed on a soundstage. The Japanese house is more claustrophobic. On the other hand the soundstage house was a bit grungier which works nicely in the context of the remake. I liked this film's transition in the famous stair crawling scene although I thought the flashbacks weren't necessary and I also loved some of the more dissonant music here.The biggest differences occur after the first forty minutes when Shimizu expands the number of monsters. The film seems to threaten a Romerolike plague that I'd like to see explored more in other JuOn films if that hasn't been done already.The bottom line though is that this is a nicely atmospheric horror film with a creepy scene per minute. There were a couple very minor flawsoccasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one but overall this is highly recommended. It earned a 9 out of 10 from me.".

I finally tracked it down in LA and watched it the very first chance I got to do so. JuOn is a chapter story about a haunted house in a Tokyo suburb. The film begins when an inexperienced social worker shows up at the house and comes face to face with the horror within. The story jumps around from past to present its chapters focusing on one character at a time until it has come full circle. Everyone unwise enough to enter the cursed house winds up dead the haunting spreading like a virus. It seems that a terrible murder once took place in this house and the rage surrounding the act of violence has spawned its own evil curse. To enter the house is to be immediately infected and the haunting follows people home driving them to near madness before dragging them away never to be seen again. JuOn bears more than a passing resemblance to its popular predecessor Ringu and is nowhere near as frightening but it's not a bad film by any means. Butchered motherghost Kayako is very Sadakolike crawling around with her long black hair in her face and moving with unearthly jerkiness. Her bluewhite face is quite startling with its huge staring eyes and occasional splashes of blood. Her ghost son Toshio is both sad and frightening appearing both as a normal boy and a pale wideeyed ghost. Many of the films most frightening sequences feature the murdered woman Kayako her head full of black hair peeking around a corner her shadow moving down a corridor and filling a security camera a headon shot of her crawling through an attic at night with only the beam of a flashlight illuminating her. The sound effects are quite disturbing as well and the performances are convincingly well done.I wasn't as scared by this movie as had been promised I would be but that's what happens when you buy into the hype. I was simply expecting too much and I got a pretty good ghost story instead. JuOn is good. It's not great but it's a decent straightforward ghost story with more than enough scary moments to please most horror fans. Ringu was scarier but JuOn is a noble effort. Like most Asian horror stories it remains ambiguous and openended leaving room for both a sequel and the chance for you to decide for yourself what the curse of The Grudge really is. 7 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:headline " Very Scary Japanese Horror Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In Japan when the volunteer social assistant Rika Nishina Megumi Okina is assigned to visit a family she is cursed and chased by two revengeful fiends Kayako a woman brutally murdered by her husband and her son Toshio. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears. Juon The Grudge is a very scary horror movie based on a Japanese legend. In the beginning of the film there is an explanation in this regard. When a person is killed in a violent way his or her death generates a curse that will stay in the place where the crime took place. If another person visits the haunted place he or she will be chased by the fiends till death generating another curse. In Western cultures the fiend is generally trapped in a haunted house and the person is safe and sound if he or she escapes from the place. This movie impresses because there is no bloody scene only a tense psychological exploration of the inner fear of human beings for the unknown. The story is very simple and low paced there are very few special effects a great use of sound no gore but the creepy atmosphere is really frightening. Asiatic cinema proves again that in this moment their cinema is the number one in the horror genre. Unfortunately the pretentious American industry of cinema insists in remaking and spoiling these Asian masterpieces. I saw Juon The Grudge for the first time on 02 June 2006. Today 23 March 2007 I have just watched it for the second time with the intention of seeing the Japanese sequel and I startled many times with this excellent horror movie. I recalled the whole story and now I am familiarized with this Japanese belief of the Juon therefore the nonchronological screenplay got better and better than in the first time that I saw. My vote is eight.Title Brazil JuOn O Grito JuOn The Scream".

This original has the better story and the audience isn't slapped in the face with a stupid root as they are in The Grudge although maybe that is fleshed out in the other Ju On movies which I have not seen. The chronology play was interesting and fresh but this is so important to the director then there should have been more inclusion of time indicators. After awhile the movie gets really boringdifferent people being haunted and attacked by the same ghosts in the same way over and over again. I realize this is the point of the movie but it doesn't make for a very entertaining time. My Rating 610.".

The atmosphere is eerie and foreboding but its over all not scary. There are moments that your skin crawls but it doesn't keep it at a constant pace. The multiple story lines does become redundant after awhile. They should have focused more upon only a few people and flesh out their story instead of adding story line upon story line. They don't even add much information to the overall story.I think the problem i had with this is that i got stuck in the cultural translation. At times the mythology went over my head not understanding a lot of the significance that the story holds. Janpanese ghost stories are so different from western styles so it takes awhile to understand the difference between the two.

Not since The Ring original Japanese version has any other horror flicks cause so much tension and screams in theatres. The reason it is so much different from American horror films is that it uses oneofakind sound effects and the now famous 'slow and silent' tempo that causes the eerie feel to the movie. Most horror movie goers prefer watching bigbreasted blondes running around screaming at the top of her lungs whilst a mad knife weilding man chases her. That's where the ratings fall. Japan has established itself for being the 'land of horror film'. And Juon is no exception in living up to the standard. Sam Raimi has remarked this film as scary. From a director of his calibre making such remarks to ASIAN films you know there's something coming up. The movie is a sequence of short stories all interrelated. Which makes it good as it keeps audiences trying to figure out what's going on and at the same time scaring the sht out of them. The films starts out slow and proceeds with the same rythym throughout. I cannot possibly describe the scream scenes as it will largely spoil the fun of watching it.

Sadly nothing here is scary. I had a really hard time caring and was confused by the disjointed and tangential structure of the film. Sometimes the lack of logic in a horror film can work it's benefit. Not the case here. Seeing this film reminded me of why I hate formulaic slasher films. sure there are some interesting things here but nothing really gells.

	schema:headline " The film starts well but ultimately disappoints";
	schema:reviewBody "I got this film from a friend who bought it and its sequel on holiday in Malaysia.I'm not a horror fan in fact I pretty much hate horror films because they are never scary just cheap with gore thrown in to make up for the lack of legitimate scares. Despite this I enjoyed Ringu and hated the sequel so I watched this. The story is about a haunted house in Tokyo in where every visitor ends up dead or goes missing at the hands of a creepy white ghost kid and its mother also a ghost. The appearances of these ghosts stem from a family who lived in the house until the father killed his wife and their child. Now the house is cursed and any one who goes in ends up dead.The story is chapter based much like Pulp Fiction and tells the story of each character who enters the house. This works well for the first 45 minutes of the film. Each character meets a creepy demise and you get a spooky feeling from just watching these characters that appear to be safe nowhere from the two ghosts. Unfortunately the last 45 minutes see the chapters become nothing more than disjointed and confusing. The final chapter is so surreal its ridiculous and makes no sense. To say this film loses its way is an understatement.The story is left open ended and while some may argue that this is to allow the viewer to interpret what has happened I say it is due to the writer and directors inability to wrap up what could have been on of the best ghost stories ever made.In the films defence the ghosts of Toshio and his mother are very unnerving especially Toshio considering they are just people painted white. Toshio has these big black eyes and remains silent throughout the film. Put simply he just looks plain weird appearing from out of nowhere to scare the character out of their wits. Films never scare me but for some reason every time the kid was on the screen I felt cold shivers. The film is probably worth watching for this feeling alone and the first 45 minutes are excellent although ultimately you'll be disappointed with the ending. The sequel is better but strangely loses its way at more or less the same point in the film as the first and ends in much the same manner. It just gives more of an 'ending' that the first film lacks.".

Death becomes a part of that place killing everything it touches. Once it sees you it never lets go.''This explanation makes our movie starts. First we see Rika a volunteer social worker charged for an older lady named Tokunaga Sachie. Rika sees Sachie alone in the house and to make things worst the house is a complete mess. When Rika is cleaning the house she starts hearing noises that come from the bedroom closet and opening the closet she finds Toshio. Toshio is a young boy that Rika recognizes from a photo she saw in the house. Finding everything very strange she calls the welfare center to report the incident and just a little after she is attacked by a black shadow with two big eyes. Each person that lives or visits the haunted house is murdered or eventually disappears. Different characters  different moments and different years are shown through the movie.I watched ''Juon The Grudge'' almost three years agorecommended by a friend who told me the movie was very scary. I watched it and I found it even more scary then I would imagine it to be! I told my father to watch the movie and he liked as well. I just discovered recently that this movie is the third from the Japanese Juon series. I am looking forward to watch the other ones. Definitely the Japanese version of this movie is MUCH better and frightening then the American version not to mention that is the original version. The atmosphere and music of this movie definitely helps in make you feel even more scary that's one thing I love in Japanese horror movies they make you feel frightened without special effects or monsters. It's all psychological and using the imagination of the viewer.This is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen and for sure made me stay scared for more then just 2 days.Totally recommended for horror movies fans!".

That doesn't however detract from the fact it's a pretty decent picture and one of the better Tartan Asia Extreme movies.First things first  I love Ring and of course I mean the Japanese original. That film is by far and away the greatest horror flick ever devised and goes above and beyond what I ever expected a movie to do. However it also instigated a ready conveyor belt of substandard imitators from the same shores ready to cash in on this unique success. Dire nonsense like the hollow Dark Water the dull and over stylised Eye the truly pitiful Phone and the slightly bizarre Audition haven't truly come close to the level of Ring.Now while Grudge isn't quite up there with the very best horror films as far as these Asian efforts go it's definitely one of the more effective selections.Megumi Okina is Rika a volunteer homehelper. On being assigned to a family whose regular assistant is temporarily unavailable she encounters the mother of the family who seems unresponsive. However after a disturbing incident at the family home Rika finds herself seemingly haunted by some kind of entity and everyone who gets involved in the case seems to endure the same trauma.It's a slightly convoluted story to explain but it works pretty well on screen. As usual the Japanese acting is generally pretty bland but a few loud screams certainly add colour.The main 'bad guy' seems to be some type of ghostly being and while it doesn't utterly terrify it definitely brings a few chills. The only real problem is we see too much of it and not enough is left to our imagination ala Ring. This takes away a certain air mystery and fear. Moreover the fact the entity resembles the symbolic Japanese girl with long black hair we've come to expect in the likes of Ring and Dark Water slightly detracts from notions of originality.However this is redeemed by some pretty effective direction and camerawork which aid to promote certain wrongness about what is going on.Perhaps a few aspects don't altogether make complete sense but there's enough style here to paper over such cracks.Movies like this do go to show that when it comes to horror the Far East have a handle over the Western world.It's by no means the most brilliant horror I've ever seen but it's definitely not bad and if you're up for a chill or 2 you could do far worse.".

So i rented it.I chose to watch it in the light so that i could not scary myself to death literally.As i watch this it started scaring me from seeing the Grudge appearing from the bathroom stall distorted face to zombie like friends of Izumi's to Kayako's bloodied body crawling down the stairs.Toshio is brilliantly scary kid. And Rika was a great actress for this. I say this film has the pure horror that does show what horror is really all about. Not some slasher films with half naked girls that just ain't slightly scary. This film got me frightened pretty good. This film is the only kind that actually frightened me good. All horror films in America is either too crappy and lame or nauseating and sick.This movie deserves the compliments. And i compliment all Japanese folks for making this great film.".

And while this film does have some creepy moments I think Ringu is a better film. I will also not win any friends with this comment Shimizu's American remakes were much better films. Juon is a haunted house story. A mother and son were killed in the house and a powerful curse befalls anyone unlucky enough to enter the house. That's the story in a nutshell but it's a bit more confusing than that. This film suffers from a fractured timeline that makes the story hard to follow at times. It's told in a series of vignettes that aren't in chronological order. It does come together at the end but making it there is quite an effort. If you ask me if you should watch Juon before the remake my answer is no. The remake utilizes many of the same scares but to a much better effect and if you've seen them already their power is diminished. In effect I see this movie as a workprint for the remake and Shimizu could fully realize his vision after having made this film. Shimizu is a hit or miss director with me but I'm always willing to see what he's coming up with next.".

I like many and their dog saw this before its American counterpart was released. I was hoping I was going to be in for a good ghost story when instead I was in for a movie about people being scared by the aforementioned naked talcum powder drenched kid and some girl with bad hair who makes some belching noise to threaten her victims. Who'd have known people were so easily scared?There isn't much of a plot to speak of except people go in a house and die by these two ghosts. There was one scary part and that was when the woman got pulled under the sheets but that was done way better and not so cheaply in its American remake. The film's atmosphere sucks too why is everything so light??? The American remake is an improvement as you can see they achieved the scares the original didn't. Way better creepybrooding atmosphere more convincing ghost story etc. Save your money on this dreck.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well? Everyone raved over this film like they raved over Ringu so I should've known better. But I never learn. Ringu was a failure because of its complete lack of imagination and its degeneration into an endless pointless detective story which meant that when resolution finally came it was all explained away and any impact was totally dissipated. Well they didn't make the same mistakes in JuOn?well except for the lack of imagination. But along with that they made an entire no swath of mistakes! A JuOn is a type of curse a spirit of vengeance that haunts a place when the spirit has died in the midst of a great rage. Whoever comes into contact with the JuOn will be destroyed by it. Thus we have a house and we have various stories of people who come into contact with the house that contains the JuOn. This should have been horrifying and freaky and disturbing but at every turn they succeeded in diminishing it to nothing. For a starters we never get to know ANY of the characters we meet them and 5 minutes later they are being terrorised by the spirits. They are less than two dimensional characters and I am not able to just accept dumb bad character writing like most idiot viewers. The key to making your audience feel fear and anxiety is to get them involved in the characters. They get an F for that one. Because of its fragmented style the narrative is totally about the spirits and the evil they perform. Thus there is no actual plot which should allow for some great horror sequences and very little boredom. But after you've seen the first 4 incidents you realise that they are all exactly the same with little to nor variation and thus you sit bored for the rest of the film waiting to see if they do something interesting. The one time they do actually try something different it makes to little sense and doesn't seem to be from the same film and involves a character who you never ever found out what happened to him thus making it irritating and very much not interesting. So there is no imagination in the horror sequences they get an F for that one too. And oh wow look  it moves back and forth in time? so you don't actually really know what is going on half the time and have to stop and try and figure it all out which in a film that is meant to be a continuous driving horror fest is not a good thing. It adds very little to the film and increases the irritation factor. They are remaking this one for the western world as I type. I believe that this one could actually be improved by Hollywood as they will enforce certain narrative aspects and imaginative big budget horror sequences which while not necessarily the best kind of horror is a hell of a lot better than any of the trash that occurs in this version.".

First of all with a very modest budget of about  500.000 the picture looks great. The actors do what they can to entertain and although you cannot always understand what they're saying you never get bored. To see Amsterdam turn into a zombie zone is also very nice for a change. Actress Gigi Ravelli known in Holland for her role in the soap GTST is very funny as a kickass cop. Overall it's the story that lets you down. A man wants to rescue a girl and must travel across Amsterdam to do so. The finale is in a skyscraper in Amsterdam Zuidoost the place where also an alien spaceship crashed that caused this zombie outbreak anyway. Our heroes must fight themselves into the building and save the day. In terms of zombies we have seen it all before and the fact that this one takes place in Holland is a novelty that soon wears off. Yes this movie goes over the top or it least tries to. But in the end the film remains pretty safe and ends in standard mode. Makes you wonder what kind of movie somelone like Paul Verhoeven would've made out of it. I think Zombibi was a nice attempt to make a zombie comedy and it's clear that making it was pure fun. But with more black humour and sick jokes it could have been something special.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Story We follow two brothers two gangster friends a beautiful female police officer and a shady business man as they try to escape Amsterdam after a zombie outbreak. We see how one wants to save a love interest from a seemingly impossible situation while greed takes over others. We see how the group puts together of mostly idiots have to try and find weapons to survive and achieve their goals by escaping the danger. Simply put this is a crazy film it makes fun of nearly every zombie film stereotype and is filled with plenty of over the top zombie kills. What makes these kills memorable is that they seem to come from the most random objects including bowling balls tennis ball gun and giant mallet with many more. This is hugely enjoyable if not barmy storyline that you will remember and continue laughing after it has finished. 710Actor ReviewYahya Gaier Aziz stuck in a dead end job before getting fired he gets a call from the girl of his dreams and wants to save her during the zombie outbreak. Good performance playing the unlikely hero in the zombie outbreak. 710Mimoun Ouled Radi Mo loud mouth party animal who always comes up with halfbaked ideas to get rich quick leaving his brother Aziz to clean up the mess. Good performance as the loud annoying character who tries to talk his way out of everything. 710Gigi Ravelli Kim police officer who tries to lead the four bumbling fools across Amsterdam to the safe zone. She is all action and won't leave anyone behind. Good performance from Gigi adding some much needed beauty to the film. 710Sergio Hasselbaink Jeffrey the first of the two gangsters this one likes to us big weapons to try and stop the zombies but he finds out his tennis ball shooter isn't the best choice. Good performance who gets a lot of the laughs. 710Uriah Arnhem Nolan the big fella gangster who gets his hand stuck in a bowling ball which turns into a solid weapon for him. Good performance and easily the funniest character in the film. 710Director Review Martijn Smits Erwin van den Eshof  Good direction to create a funny horror comedy that you actually want to see who makes it too. 710Comedy Very funny throughout with the characters and zombie kills. 810 Horror It fills all the zombie horror boxes without being too much. 710 Settings Amsterdam makes a great setting for the film as it works out to be original. 910 Special Effects Great effects used to create the zombie kills and attacks. 1010 Suggestion If you are a zombie film fan this is one you should be watching it will tick all the boxes for a horror comedy. Zombie Fans Watch Best Part Super general appearance. Worst Part The lead characters have been used before. Funniest Scene The two super fighters turn up. Kill Of The Film Rapper Believability No 010 Chances of Tears No 010 Chances of Sequel Left open to one Post Credits Scene NoOscar Chances No Budget 500000 Euros Runtime 1 Hour 30 MinutesOverall Enjoyable Horror ComedyCheck out more reviews on httpmoviesreview101.com".

Brandman also directs this stylish charmer and has at his disposal actors not usually associated with a more serious type of story.James Macaulay Culkin and Heather Alexis Dziena are young attractive and in love though Heather is finally able to confide in James that she is unable to achieve orgasm in their otherwise satisfactory sex life. Ellis Kuno Becker and Renee Eliza Dushku are another couple whose intimate life has lost its sparkle. Each of the couples who have never met hears about sex therapist Dr. Wellbridge Joanna Miles who supports the concept of group sex as a means to strengthen relationships grown stale. Each couple meets with the doctor reveals their insecurities and fears and Dr. Wellbridge arranges a 'session' for the two couples to share an evening of intimate interaction. How this 'change' alters each couple's relationship is the message of the film some surprises are in store that are unsuspected.Yes there is comedy here and yes there is thoughtful dialog but the pleasure of the film lies in discovering the expanded acting abilities demonstrated by these four young attractive actors. The film may not be deep but it does entertain and it most certainly has some useful information about love and relationships we all need to know. Grady Harp".

The banter between Dushku and Kuno was lighthearted yet deep giving a feeling of intimacy to the relationship. Contrasted by the dynamic between Culkin and Dziena showing the need to please of Culkin's character and the oblivious nature of being self absorbed in Dziena's character. Throughout the entire file I felt like a fly on the wall seeing into the lives of the characters and getting a real sense for their feelings.As one in an amazing committed relationship with my wife of seven years although I can't relate to opening up the relationship I connected with the struggle to keep the relationship alive. As with anything love needs attention and work. At the end of the film the two couples got what they were deep down looking for a deepening of love and a reason to stay together or the final wake up call and a reason to leave.I liked to film and how it dealt with a sensitive subject. I don't think sleeping with other couples is a good way to force communicating but possibly watching a film about it will spark talk and lead to a better relationship.".

The good news is Eliza Dushku has nice legs and now I want a Denver omelet. An hour and 20 minutes of poor acting weak lines and a forced pill of controversy don't do much for me. Macaulay's mannerisms seem terribly forced but at least it seemed like he tried. He failed but he tried. The rest of the cast was forgettable there are several pointless scenes and what's more the film tries to focus on sex. The awkwardness was decently conveyed but without spoiling a movie short on content the ending really just treats it as a red herring. Sex and relationships at least make up your mind what your movie is about before you shoot it because whoever wrote this obviously wasn't talented enough to include both.

It brings us to a very realistic world where couples do struggle to keep their relationship alive. Culkin and Dziena star as a couple though very much in love have trouble keeping up with a satisfying sex life. Dziena's failure to have a orgasm with Culkin is their main issue. Dushku and Becker is yet another couple who want to try new things in order to keep a spark in their sex life. Both couples turn to group sex counseling as a possible solution to their issues.I've heard of group sex counseling before and it is a very real thing. The movie broadens on the issue and shows the advantages and disadvantages of it. This movie is not 'unrealistic' and many people turn to group sex counseling as a possible solution. And this movie is not about 'selling sex' because there are barely any sex scenes in the film. I've seen horror films with more sex than this film...maybe you should turn to those films.The movie is awkward and the dialogue is a bit brim. The acting from the cast is a bit overrated and overdramatic. Usually Dushku performs well in her films but she fell flat with this one.".

It really doesn't work because there is no real drama here  I didn't feel like I could know the 4 main characters  the only character who seemed to have an attempt at becoming multilayered is Renee.. From the mention of wanting to be with a girl and then befriending the waitress who seemed like she could be a lesbian a new layer began to unravel for Renee. Ellis who felt threatened by this didn't react the way Renee and possibly the people in the audience expected. It was supposed to be a turn on but it back fired and their relationship inadvertently came under scrutiny.I liked the ending for Renee in that she left the waitress' number behind and we don't know if it was by accident or if on purpose to commit to her relationship with Ellis. There was something endearing about that...But this in itself was not enough to make this movie worth a see  I think Dushku fans including myself will watch this just for her and will be glad to finally see her in something anything... however it makes one wonder why on earth she did this! She is capable of so much more and it's sad to see her career not really going anywhere  The rest of the cast were just okay  Macaulay Culkin is miscast you can't help but see the home alone kid only he's gotten old and ugly! There is no attempt on his side to change his look and to be taken seriously as an adult actor either.

While this film had a good concept all the actors were forgettable disregarding Culkin and the movie seemed to drag on depressingly until it came to an unsatisfying both sexually and plot wise end. The only reason anyone could possibly wish to put themselves through this boring movie about 2 couples who are essentially miserable is in an attempt to see Macaulay do something as an adult actor. Good news is Macaulay has not or at least as of 2007 lost his acting skills. I think he actually does come off somewhat appealing and that it is a horrible shame that the only other film he has done as an adult was Saved. He should really start acting again for the sake of us Culkin fans as the closest one can seem to get to Mac these days is by watching a few old Rory Culkin flicks like Lime Life which likewise was horribly boring yet also had a good premise. This movie was a good concept that was dragged on in an uneventful and depressed manner. I strongly believe that given some better writers and having gotten rid of both Eliza's costar Becker and Mac's useless girlfriend who was unbelievable and fake this film could have been good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say the concept of this movie was a very interesting one Two couples try to save their foundering relationships by trying group sex. The whole wifeswappinggroup sex idea has been floating around the sex therapy community for decades but with no definitive results. But it always makes for interesting and titillating entertainment in movies even TV shows think Bob Carol Ted and Alice from the early '70s. So I was curious to check out this relatively new take on the genre.Macaulay Culkin all grown up and Alexis Dziena of Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist fame are James and Heather two young lovers whose relationship started out strong with James in particular believing he had found the love of his life. But apparently love is not enough as Heather's inability to experience orgasm with him builds a huge wall between them. Ellis and Renee played by popular Mexican TV actor Kuno Becker and my personal favorite hottie Eliza Dushku on the other hand are a couple who've been together so long that things have started to get a little too routine. In particular the sexually adventurous Renee is looking to try something a little different maybe a little girlgirl action with the waitress at their favorite diner...Realizing they have problems the couples separately attend a seminar hosted by a sex therapist whose claim to fame is group sex therapy. So it is that these two couples wind up together. I think this movie would have been better if they had immediately gotten to the therapy and explored the results a little more. As it stands they only had one session together toward the end of the movie and afterward they didn't really do much with what if anything they learned. This movie spent too much time on the windup giving us glimpses into their personal situations leading up to the big event while not leaving enough time to experiment one session with all of the angst and apprehension you would expect in this situation and there was plenty would not be enough to truly benefit both couples. Hell if your gonna' sign on to this concept of group sex therapy why not give it a real chance to work? The problem is in the end I don't think writerdirector Miles Brandman ever really signed on. In that sense this movie was a disappointment. That said I thought these young actors did a fantastic job with what they had. Culkin and Dziena played the couple that seemed to have the bigger relationship issues and they both rose to this challenge. Eliza Dushku's performance really stood out to me because Renee seemed to be the most complicated of the characters. Dushku always plays the girl you wish was your girlfriend but with a very edgy attitude. All in all very good performances but they needed a little more to work with in order to make this a really good film.".

The movie tries so hard to be important that it never even tries to entertain and it ends up being neither. As a result it may be one of the dullest and most forgettable movies you'll see despite its shock value which is much less shocking than it tries to be the admittedly intriguing subject matter and the competent editing and cinematography.

But they did come those Spanish intruders. And now never heard before names like Franco Allende Women's Lib abortion the lot have got into my life. Daddy and Mummy have suddenly become communists although this a term that Bon Papa and Bonne Maman my grandparents from Bordeaux in fact just hate.

Of course Anna's grandparents are grand bourgeois but they are not horrible persons. On the other hand a leftist activist is not perfect by definition. Those ambiguities give depth to the characters and make them believable throughout. And Julie Gavras has a knack for unexpected details enhancing the viewer's interest and involvement in the story. I was particularly amused by such features as Anna adoring her catechism class the presence of a violently anticommunist Cuban domestic worker hence the title the succession of nannies exiled from different countries torn by ideological conflicts Anna singing Ay Carmela! to protest against her parents quarreling and many others.All in all a wonderful initiation movie that augurs well for Julie Gavras' future career.".

	schema:reviewBody "In any given festival A.O. Scott of the NYTimes writes today from Berlin there is usually at least one movie that chronicles a time of political trauma from the point of view of a child. He goes on to say that at the Berlinale he's just seen one set in 1970 by Brazilian Cao Hamburger that fits the bill nicely. In addition to politics and soccer it has gentle sentiment the stirrings of youthful sexuality and a grouchy warmhearted old man. Blame It on Fidel based on an Italian novel Tutta colpa di Fidel by Domitilla Calamai is also about 197071 and deals with political events from a child's viewpoint but the rest of its ingredients are different. The emphasis is far more on the child's intellectual development than on political trauma. Gavras' film revolves around nineyearold Anna Nina Kervel and her welloff bourgeois family living in France. Her father Fernando de la Mesa Stefano Accorsi is Spanish from a rich Catholic royalist family she learns later and Fernando and wife Marie Julie Depardieu opposed to Franco who Fernando's uncle is fighting in Spain get excited about Allende's victory in Chile and woman's right to choose and things like that and decide to change their way of living. They leave their big house and move to a small apartment so Fernando can go to Chile and then think. Marie keeps on doing articles for MarieClaire to provide funds but starts a documentary study on women and childbirth. Anna has to give up her nanny and she and her little brother Franois Benjamin Feuillet are minded by political refugees first one from Greece then one from Vietnam. At the insistence of Fernando who's become liaison in France for Chilean activists Anna is taken out of Divinity class at her private Catholic school.Though there are lots of meetings in the little apartment now the violent upheavals in society even in Chile only touch the family from afar but what's fun and fresh about this appealing earlystages comingofage comedy is that Anna engages tooth and nail with the ideas her parents are indirectly imposing on her  the importance of group action the injustice of a market economy etc. She thoroughly enjoyed the perks and rituals of a comfortable bourgeois life and Divinity was one of her best subjects. She thought her conservative grandparents her mother's parents heirs to a Bordeaux vineyard had their own worthwhile ways of doing good. And they did but they didn't disturb the existing social order as Fernando's Chilean activist friends want to do. At first amusingly the feisty impulsive little Franois is better at adjusting to the changes to sleeping in the same bedroom and eating exotic food prepared by their new nannies. In the end though Anna has come to terms with the principle of change and it's she who insists on being transferred to a secular school that's multicultural and freewheeling and she's happily joining in the play there at recess time as the film ends.Former documentary filmmaker Gavras probably inherited her political awareness through her father the CostaGavras of Z and State of Siege but she's expressed a woman's point of view toward politics by choosing a subject that deals with their effect on a family. The film is bright and entertaining and has some good laughs. But it deserves extra credit for having a good head on its shoulders at all times. Rather than showing political events from a child's passive point of view Blame It on Fidel deals with how children may be victimized by the ideas of their parents even when those ideas are wellmeaning and progressive. The film comes up with the startling revelation that a nineyearold can seriously engage with issues like abortion and capitalism vs. communism.To be shown in the RendezVous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center March 7 and 10 March 4 and 6 at the IFO Center. Gaumont opened in Paris November 29 2006. No US distributor.".

	schema:headline " Political Upheavals from a Child's Vantage";
	schema:reviewBody "BLAME IT ON FIDEL! 'La Faute  Fidel! is an enlightening film from France's fine director Julie Gavras a story based on the novel 'Tutta colpa di Fidel' by Domitilla Calamai that addresses the effect of major political philosophical and activist effects on children. What makes this fine film unique is the child's stance on the adult politics what may seem like exciting challenges for change of an existing corrupt system for the adults may indeed be an unwanted rearrangement of the wants and needs of children whose political acumen is less advanced than the need for order and consistency in everyday life.The story takes place in Paris in 1970  1971. 9yearold Anna de la Mesa Nina KervelBey is a bright child who loves the divinity aspects of her Catholic school and enjoys the wealthy bourgeois elegance that surrounds her. She and her little brother Franois Benjamin Feuillet are informed that their aunt an antiFranco activist from Spain will be moving in with Anna and her parents Fernando Stefano Accorsi and Marie Julie Depardieu. This critical move incites a change in philosophy for Anna's parents and soon they become enchanted with the rise of Allende in Chile and embrace the Socialist mindset and the promised feminist movement changes moving from their elegant house into a small apartment and demanding that Anna give up her divinity studies 'because the are against Communist thought'. As liaison in France for Chilean activists Fernando holds strange and frequent meetings disturbing further the life Anna loves. While little Franois is able to go along with the life changes Anna rebels and refuses to alter her goals and needs merely for the 'fad' of her father's frequent trips to Chile while leaving behind her mother to continue writing articles for the 'bourgeois' French magazine MarieClaire! As the political upheavals increase Anna is more pugnacious in demanding her rights and the finest moments of the story demonstrate how a child can respond to political change and still find her 'place' in the world that she chooses! The pacing of the film is fast and captures the exhilaration of the foment 'round the world in the early 1970s. The cast is excellent especially the children who have not had prior exposure to acting. The message is a potent one that deserves our attention both as informative of a political era and as a piece of veritas cinema from a fine director and crew. In French and Spanish with English subtitles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This debut film by Julie Gavras daughter of famed Greekborn director CostaGavras e.g. Z 1969 was nominated for the Grand Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. In addition to directing Julie Gavras also collaborated with Arnaud Cathrine on the script which they adapted from a novel by Italian novelist Domitilla Calamai. What is striking about the story is the way it reconstructs how girls become social how they learn about their world how they question it and how they reconcile the contradictions and how they grow up.Doing the growing up is nineyearold Anna de la Mesa played with fidelity wit and skill beyond her years by Nina KervelBey. She is bourgeois to the core following the lead of her maternal grandparents who own a vineyard in Bordeaux and her favorite nanny and housekeeper who lost everything to the Communists when Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. Her parents however are infatuated with the Left especially with the rise of Allende to power in Chile. The year is 197071.Anna loves their house and garden and going to Catholic school. She is proper and sensible. When they lose their house and have to let the nanny go and end up renting an apartment in Paris Anna is upset and demands to know why things have changed. When it appears that they don't have as much money Anna begins turning off the lights and turning down the heat to save money. When they want her to transfer to the public school she demurs and a compromise is made she can continue to go to Catholic school but she is not allowed to take Bible studies. So when that time of the day comes she has to stand up and go outside the classroom door and wait.But Anna is strong emotionally and intellectually. She questions everything and is not selfconscious about being singled out. The other girls may laugh but when she gets into a fight with one of them she manages to win her over afterwards so that they are friends even though their parents are not.There is in the background the political disputes between the Right and the Left between parents who change the subject when the question how babies are made is brought up and those who tell the truth in short between the bourgeois and the bohemian. One gets the sense that Gavras and Anna are wiser than the disputants and that there is something to appreciate in both ways of life.It is impossible not to identify with little Anna partially because she herself is so fair and partially because it is such a thrill to see the psychology of the socialization process displayed so well and true in a movie but also because Nina KervelBey is such a powerful little actress who was so wondrously directed by Julie Gavras. This is one of the best performances by a preteen actor that I have ever seen. KervelBey simply dominates the film and commands the screen.Will Anna shed her petite bourgeois ways and embrace the politics of her parents? I highly recommend that you see this film and find out.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

It reminded me a bit of Pan's Labyrinth in that way i.e. the way there is an 'adults world' and a 'child's world' although Pan's Labyrinth focuses more on childhood escapism but 'Blame in Fidel' is more about childhood realism. That is to say this film focuses in a really lovely accurate way on a child struggling to understand the real world around them especially when the adults around her don't tell her the full story. There is no fantasy here. It's all very real. Anna clearly wants to understand what's going on. She hears snippets of conversations and tries to put it all together sometimes correctly sometimes incorrectly. Definitely worth a watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "La Faute  Fidel centers on the life of an indulged nine year old girl called Anna Nina Kervel and her adverse descent from the luxuries of a bourgeois life to the cramped destitute conditions of her parents new found belief. Situated mostly in Paris during the early 1970s and among the aftermath of the collapse of the De Gaulle government the film tells of a change of prosperity that occurs after the death of her father's Fernando Stefano Accorsi brotherinlaw. The death compels Anna's parents to readdress their political complacency causing Fernando to become part of the active opposition to Francisco Franco of Spain and Salvador Allende of Chile. Consequently Anna's life is transformed and this is demonstrated through her constant bewilderment intellectual expansion and amusing misinterpretations.During the film the family's new apartment slowly grows hectic due to an encroachment of the barbudos bearded men or Chilean Activists and as most of the story takes place there the director Julie Gavras is able to create a feeling of invasion in Anna's life. This is playedout in a scene when the young Anna awakes to find her home swarming with barbudos and no parents. The camera here and for most of the film is at Anna's height. At this point the audience is aware of Anna's worry and concern. Gavras superbly complements this with her camerawork as a lot of the shots are orientated around Anna. The shot reverse shots are either pointing down at Anna or up at an adult the framing of her achieves narrative centrality and the film is littered with child like symbols most notably the frequent shots of her sandals perhaps an invitation for the audience to place themselves in Anna's shoes.Through the eyes of a nine year old child the film manages to show us the problems difficulties and effects that extreme political transformation can have on a family. Not only are the parents going through a period of enlightenment but so is Anna as she is bombarded with an array of terms and ideologies including communism activism capitalism Catholicism conservatism mythology and abortion all of which she tries make sense of. Despite this Anna is treated like an equal when among her parents and the barbudos because they make the effort to explain and reason to her the things she doesn't understand. The manner in which these adults talk with Anna is shortlived because as soon as she dons a uniform and becomes part of the strict and religious system that is her school she is no longer that freethinking individual. She is unable to question the system once she is a part of it this supported by emphasized further when she questions her teacher over a story involving the dilemmas facing a goat.The fact that the adults endeavor to relate to Anna on their level demonstrates a liberal upbringing and the understanding of children as equals. This is seen through her mother's Marie Julie Depardieu explanation of abortion her discussion on Dad's dickie and the Chilean activists attempt to discuss their ideologies with Anna. Furthermore the family's abandonment of Sundaying is a metaphor for them resisting social constraints and reappropriating them by as Anna's brother points out Sundaying on a Wednesday. This is interesting because it serves as visual allegory for rebellion as it's in direct contrast with the notorious aspects of Franco's fascist regime and his renowned focus on traditional values. This notion is furthered by Anna leaving the confinements of her school dropping her uniform mixing with another genderrace and being embraced this sequence of events is her liberalisation.As the title suggests it is packed with political and literal metaphors and through centering on a child the film keeps itself amusing and fresh. But ultimately and at its heart the film is a fine family drama that utilises the backdrop of political angst and cultural change to help tell its story.".

One review described it as a movie about adults balancing child raising with world saving which is certainly a part of the film but to me wouldn't seem to be the focus. Someone else saw the film as an example of how activists can be bad parents.But really this film is so focused on Anna that I tended to feel whatever she was feeling and as her feelings and understand evolved during the film mind did as well. The movie feels very balanced showing everyone's strengths and weaknesses kindnesses and cruelties honor and stupidity and it feels very authentic I don't know if this is fiction a memoir or somewhere in between but it feels very realistic and believable.This is a quiet thoughtful movie and it took me a while to get into it perhaps simply because I approach French movies with a certain amount of suspicion which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8.

	schema:reviewBody "The family of Anna DelaMesa come from bourgeois backgrounds. It is then surprising the path both decided to follow politically. The father Fernando a Spaniard had lived in France as an exile for many years never returning to visit his own family in Spain. The mother Marie is the daughter of wealthy parents who live in some splendor in a rural part of France.When we first see them they are celebrating the wedding of Isabelle. Fernando a brooding man has recently been joined by his sister Marga and her own kid Pilar something they did to avoid being taken into custody by the Franco regime. Marie and Fernando agree in letting them stay with them for a while something that Anna doesn't appreciate since her cousin only speaks Spanish. Anna who attends a catholic school in Paris taught by nuns sees the world around her from a grown up point of view. She can't say much about what she perceives yet a lot of things affect her. Take her parents' involvement with the leftist Chilean regime of Salvador Allende. Fernando and Marie have been instrumental in his election having even left the children behind in France to work for the cause. Anna is a highly sensitive girl whose life is deeply affected by the way her parents act toward her and Francois her younger brother. To make matters worse Anna is told to stay away from religion classes at her school. She becomes the center of attraction as the other girls can't grasp why is Anna different something that she tries to cope with but to her young mind is never solved. Julie Gavras the daughter of famous director Costa Gavras tried her hand at directing before. This is her second try behind the camera. We have not read the novel which served as the basis of the film which is misleading since one expects to refer to a Cuban situation when in reality the DelaMesas work to help the regime of Chile's former president Allende.Ms. Gavras must be congratulated for the work she got from child actress Nina KervelBey a girl of maybe seven years who does an amazing performance and through whom all the action revolves. Others in the film Stefano Accorsi who has been working in France lately plays the father of Anna. Also notable Julie Depardieu daughter of Gerard and Elisabeth in the role of Marie.Although the film is based on an Italian novel one wonders how much is autobiographical given Ms. Gavra's own background. Maybe she was meant to be the right person to bring the story to the screen.".

You get to watch a child's life through the child's eyes. Her trials are not major and she handles them without major drama. The lead is a child actress Nina KervelBey. Her part is quite unusual. She is not adorable or endearing. She is not a brat. She is not a ninny. She is not a waif. She is intelligent but not freakily precocious. She is admirably stubborn and independent. Just as in real life the adults don't notice how aware she is of all that is going on and talk down to her. She listens in all the time on adult conversations. I recall as a preschooler sitting on the floor while adults had conversations that I was sure they did not want me to hear. As long as I did not move it seemed for them I did not exist or that they presumed I was incapable of understanding what they were saying. Films and books nearly always underestimate children. It is as if the authors can't remember what it was like and go for a Disneyfied haze over the lens making children into happy idiots. This movie does not make that error. Steffano Accorsi plays the father. He was also in one of my favourite movies of all time My Secret LifeIgnorant Fairies where he plays a similar warm gentle character.".

You know the sort of thing Little Anna Nina KB starts off as a spoiled little brat nonplussed by her parents' sudden lurch into radical chic leftism. They abandon their capitalist jobs and transform into selfless Che Guevara types taking her on demo's in Paris etc. Gradually little Nina sees the error of her ways and gives up Divinity class at school and her posh friends for a cosy rosetinted world of brother and sisterly love at the local compo... Ring a ring a roses we all vote socialist. Atishoo! Atishoo! The Capitalists all fall down! Disgusting abuse of the principle of cinema.

As it turns out I was bitterly disappointed. I'll save you the nonsense essays about the 1960's and revolutions. In this contrived film they have little relevance except to act as a crutch for a film that is teetering on disaster.As for the so called little girl  Nina KervelBey. Do you know of any soulless miserable children of nine years going on ninety years of age? I don't. Is Gavras really trying to tell us that children become traumatised because of their parent's political changes? What nonsense. Maybe she should visit a few homes where children have really been traumatised by horrid experiences.Key features missing from this film are warmth love and compassion. A po faced KervelBey and her entourage just don't deliver. Any humour there is comes from a few glib lines from her father. Moreover most of the 'action' takes place within a claustrophobic interior.Should Ms Gavras ever venture into making other films with children she would do well to watch Jeux Interdit or Anche Libero Va Bene. And had she watched the exceptional Together by Lukas Moodysson she wouldn't have bothered making Blame It On Fidel.If nothing else Ms Gavras has performed a minor miracle. She has managed to combine two key French elements into one film. Namely the bourgeoisie and the lumpen proletariat. Maybe that's why it's such a dog's dinner of a film. At least with one or the other genres one knows who is the real enemy.Zero points because it wasted some of my life when I could have been plucking chickens.".

He MAY not have been as inherently talented as Tex Avery or even Friz Freleng I must grit my teeth as I say this but he had one inestimable advantage over them and all his other more highly regarded contemporaries he worked for Disney and so was allowed to direct the most rounded passionate comically inspired cartoon character of all time Donald Duck.Donald is not just as popular belief would have it someone who gets mad. He's someone with ungoverned ungovernable passions of which anger is just one hunger weariness envy spite lust and love are some of the others. The humour comes in part from the fact that all along he thinks he's in control.  And in fact the resulting cartoons ARE more controlled.  Donald does not break the laws of physics as often or as outrageously as Bugs Bunny does  he cannot pull a stick of dynamite out of nowhere just because it suits the plot  but when he DOES do the impossible one feels the sheer force of his personality pushing him.  It's like watching and listening to a jet as it crosses the sound barrier.This cartoon proves my points as well as any other.  It's one of Donald's and Hannah's very best.  The 1950s could easily have been their finest decade together if the economics of production hadn't cut Hannah's Disney career short in 1956.  Very likely it WAS their finest decade even so. Even if The New Neighbor were the routine Donald outing you'd expect from reading a synopsis of the plot which it isn't the strength of Donald's character would be enough to make it funnier and more vibrant than the ritualised gaggery Warner Brothers was churning out at the time.  Except that is for the cartoons of Chuck Jones  another director who understood the value of building his humour on a strong foundation of character.".

Set in the newgetrich town of failed dreams Los Angeles the writer is an inexperienced and virginal Colin Farrell who gradually falls for the uncompromising immigrant waitress Salma Hayek. This is a movie which like its hero has great ambitions but fails pitifully in many of them yet one which can be treasured for its moments of pure beauty and shining rapture in its laboured attempt to become a classic.Colin Farrell's career to this point after a spectacular rise with the gripping and slightly manic role in Phone Booth attempted to scale heights which were out of reach in Alexander for instance and then now seems to be developing more methodically with admirable performances such as The New World. In Ask the Dust his casting seems pitched just right stretching him without making the demands which would need a more experienced actor. Salma Hayek who is never shy about making a stand for Mexican women and why not? slots into her role perfectly. Unlike Farrell's character an Italian who is nevertheless proud to be American Hayeck fights on the back foot against the prejudice which she has encountered in real life even to this day. Her starring against Farrell's delicate writer also comes naturally. She has been quoted as saying in one of her less political or feminist moments I keep waiting to meet a man who has more balls than I do and in our story Farrell has his work cut out to dominate her in true Mexican latino fashion.Farrell and Hayek both being considered among top cinema sex icons it will come as no disappointment to fans of both that they get into the buff on more than one occasion. One of the best scenes in the film is where Hayek challenges him to show her how to 'ride a wave' one night by moonlight. He bluffs it manfully not admitting it is his first time in the sea until she plays a practical joke to pay him back for pretending to have had a heart attack in her restaurant. The colours of the ocean are shot with memorable skill as the two of them outdare each other even though she later teases him for being afraid to show his penis on the beach. The director cleverly avoids falling into romantic comedy by using dramatic tension and the lovehate of their unconsummated affair. When the two of them finally do have sex the turn on is not so much Farrell's heaving buttocks or Hayeck's naked chest  it is the fact that their emotions that they have struggled with for so long finally succeed in speaking each other's language.Other gems include times when translation deliberately falls between the cracks. ''It's not 'grew in me' but 'grew on me''' says Farrell corrected her stumbling attempts at English after asking her if it was love at first sight. She however makes a careful metaphor saying how he grew inside her like a child. Sadly such moments are all too few and far between in this two hour movie. Dedicated cinephiles or older generation moviegoers that have patience for a slowly developing tale will wear the more pedestrian scripting and direction that fills the large spaces inbetween but such shortcomings will deny the film wider audience appeal in spite of its stars' charisma. Any poetic message element on the race and immigration theme  . . . happiness is that you can be in a place where you are secure and fall in love with whoever you want to and not feel ashamed of it is not backed up with any clarity of thought in the script Farrell justifies his Americanness by youth and love of his country throwing ageism in to replace racism and the potshots at marijuana if you will excuse the pun which Hayek uses partly we suspect to ease her illness are so politically incorrect as to be laughable outside of the 'great United States'. The overall message is similar to that erronous belief of George W Bush  that people of other especially poorer countries simply aspire one day to be as great and wonderful as Americans. Salma Hayek may believe this role could help fight for the recognition and equality for all peoples but it is unlikely that many outside of modern misguided America will see it that way. Like its protagonist we can only hope that such promise and talent can somewhere blossom into greater writing that here witnessed.".

Ask the Dust is haunted by the notion that L.A. is the place where people come to slowly die in the sunshine and is fascinating as a piece of sunny film noir. It also explores themes of racism prejudice and selfesteem and how they manifest themselves in personal relationships. There's a daring ugliness to the romance that makes the first third of the film especially compelling. The scene where Arturo Bandini and Camilla Lopez first meet is pure cinema and one of the more remarkable bits of mainstream film making I've seen in some time. In its way it is as sublime as Brassai's photos of cafsociety Paris. In the work print I viewed Ask the Dust wasn't able to sustain this opening intensity but it managed to stay compelling nevertheless. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay Ask the Dust is that it reminded me why Chinatown is such a great film and the comparisons will be inevitable while I don't think Ask the Dust is in the same league it does herald the welcome return of Robert Towne as an artist who understands L.A. by instinct knows how to tap into Hollywood's rich history and can deliver a humanscale film with the power to reward and possibly even change its audience.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful Looking Depression Era L.A. Hosts Ethnic Clashing American Dreams and Sexy Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Ask the Dust has excellent elements that almost come together as a whole.Like End of the Affair and The White Countess it surrounds a fraught love affair with exquisite looking period recreation that almost sucks the life out of it. As with those films the senior citizens at my matine really enjoyed the period aspect. Set in a sepiatinged Depressionera Los Angeles of polluted palm trees it is populated equally by youthful blond California girls and boys and old people at the end of the continent and their lines as symbolized by Donald Sutherland's begging boarding house neighbor like a ghost from his role in The Day of the Locust. What saves the film is the frank dialog and odd sparks between Colin Farrell as repressed ItalianAmerican writer from Colorado novelist John Fante's alter ego with the even more ethnically redolent name of Arturo Bandini and Salma Hayak as a nonstereotyped Mexican spitfire Camilla Lopez. Their repartee about their biases is raw and fresh. Significantly they are not the usual naive teen lovers but are adults with mileage who are striving to change the trajectory of their lives. In this discriminationfilled precelebration of the melting potrainbow environment heavyhandedly demonstrated such as by their viewing Ruby Keeler's famous line from Dames I'm free white and 21. both are trying to make it in a specific image of the American Dream a nonethnic one though we hear very little about their own sense of their ethnic identity. She is even dating a nasty guy named White in the vain hope of obtaining a green card and citizenship.Hayak's character is the easier to understand as we see her exuberate in vibrant blue moonlight when she feels free with him especially in vivid ocean scenes she is absolutely stunning swimming naked and then in bright light at a seashore idyll. This gorgeous scene gives From Here to Eternity a run for its money as the sexiest crashing of waves coupling in the movies. Though after all her sexually aggressive seduction efforts their lovemaking is lit beautifully in the dark but conventionally choreographed as I expected her to demand more equality in bed. But then she's already started coughing with Movie Star Disease even if it's explained more in the plot than usual.Even with his constant florid more than bordering on pretentious narration sometimes in an exaggerated lower register of his writing efforts with the usual scenes of paper being ripped out a manual typewriter as he receives encouragement from H. L. Mencken that doesn't really thematically integrate into the film until the end it is harder to understand why it takes so long to get his uptight clothes off despite many importunings. There is an unusually sweet flirtation over literacy but it seemed more like condescension on his part especially to help her get citizenship than sharing with her his love of words. The nonnarrated scenes are a relief and are beautiful to look at as the cinematography of Caleb Deschanel dad of actresses Zoey and Emily is consistently lovely.But then Farrell is surrounded by eccentric characters who are all hiding emotional or physical scars until he can face up to his own to find his real writer's voice. Idina Menzel's Vera Rifkin is a welleducated Jewish housekeeper whose California dreams or borderline crazed fantasies are for some reason now focused on being a writer's muse.Surprisingly there is very little period music maybe for budget reasons. A prominent and excellent selection is Artie Shaw's version of Gloomy Sunday which has its own legend of love and death. The score is sometimes intrusive and not as evocative of the clashing ethnic traditions as it could have been.".

From Chinatown to Personal Best to The Firm he spouted off anecdotes and insights into Hollywood and the screen writing process in general.Then the audience was treated to a special preview screening of Ask the Dust. It would seem that this has been a labour of love for Mr. Towne one that has been several decades in the making. So in that sense perhaps this film doesn't merit harsh criticism. The fact that Towne got it made is to be commended.It's not a bad film by any right. It boasts two decent performances from its leads Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell lush cinematography meticulous period detail and a sumptuous score. All the elements of a great film are there. However nothing really gels.My guess is that the source material is the film's ultimate downfall. It's dated and contradictory. What begins as a pulpy potboiler in the vein of The Postman Rings Twice becomes a politically correct tirade against intolerance. Oh and there's a healthy dose of La Boheme thrown in there for good measure.The first half of the film is intriguing as the characters' motivations are enigmatic and unpredictable. Hayek comes across as a latina femme fatale while Farrell plays the flawed noirish antihero. L.A. itself is a character  one of a city at odds with its surroundings. The description of the sand or dust from the desert filling the air is particularly poignant.Halfway through the film takes a perplexing turn. Turns out there is no mystery behind the motives of the leads. They just wanted to be lovedunderstood. Cue Hollywood clichs and end scene. You can't help but be disappointed.Perhaps in the hands of a '70s auteur director like Polanski Antonioni or Bob Rafelson the source material could have been tweaked or restructured to yield a more surprising and challenging film. I even wondered what the film would have been like with a 70s screen icon like Jack Nicholson or Al Pacino in the lead role.".

I liked the fact that there was very little profanity which kept the integrity of the book and was most likely accurate for the period that was being portrayed.

While the story is a bit clumsy and selfindulgent with so many sidebars that the momentum of the movie gets bogged down in the telling there are enough fine attributes to make it a recommended evening of reminiscence about Los Angeles the City of the Angels in the 1930s.Arturo Bandini Colin Farrell narrates the tale of a lad from Colorado with one published story in a magazine edited by H.L.

The two play a battle of wits and insults to cover their apparent infatuation with each other Mexican Camilla is looking for a wealthy 'white man' to raise her out of her illiterate station and Arturo is looking for a sexual encounter to spur his writing.During their extended 'courting' Arturo is vamped by Vera Rivkin Idina Menzel a Jewish housekeeper with grossly deformed legs who dreams of a man who will call her beautiful and in a touching encounter Arturo displays the kind vulnerability lying under his rather callous and naive exterior.Arturo and Camilla at last connect and in a Laguna beach house they fall under the spell of love a state that ends tragically like the dust from the desert winds burying all hopes of the people of Southern California.The story is a bit clunky and the dialogue feels forced at times but it is always a pleasure to see the work of Farrell Hayek Atkins and Sutherland. The true beauty of this truly beautiful film is in the atmosphere and the mood captured by Towne and Deschanel. Their work offers a mood piece that forgives some of the awkwardness of the threadbare story and shows off the actors well. The film may move a bit too slowly for some but for others this is a moment of history well captured. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Beautiful lighting cinematography.";
	schema:reviewBody "As voluntary Cinema Manager at Coalville's Century Theatre I'm always on the lookout for films of artistic quality which are not necessarily multiplex successes. I must confess I did read a couple of newspaper reviews when this film was first released in the UK  they weren't particularly favourable but they did highlight the Robert TowneChinatown connection  but I forgot all about it until I visited Italy for a weekend holiday in July. As I was passing a cinema in Verona I was attracted by a couple of very attractive stills...for Ask The Dust. I decided to find out a bit more about the film when I returned home. After doing this I felt it would be deserving of a screening at our little venue and I booked the film as soon as it was made available to the nontheatrical circuit. I eventually showed the film last night and I believe this was the first public showing in Leicestershire. I fully endorse the comments of others before me  the lighting sets period sense and cinematography are absolutely marvellous  just literally lovely to look at. I thought Colin Farrell was fine in the central role and am at a loss why he's come in for criticism from some quarters for this performance. Salma Hayek also scores in her sniping early scenes with Farrell and portrays well her character's fears and insecurities at a time when being Mexican was so obviously looked down upon a very neat selection by Towne for the film excerpt in the cinema scene. Pity our own Eileen Atkins had such a tiny role. Although certainly not a commercial film it does feature some memorable scenes such as the Long Beach earthquake and the moonlight swim among the crashing waves. And I really liked the idyllic seaside period enjoyed by the two eventual! lovers...with the little dog. A good sharp ending in true oldfashioned Hollywood style with a nod towards Camille which apparently is not in the book so I've read. After the film finished I wasn't sure how my audience would react but comments were generally very favourable...and the fairly overt but wellhandled sex scene had caused no offence...in fact I did get a couple of middle aged ladies offering glowing expressions with their references to Mr Farrell's appearance in that scene. A very good quality film lovingly made by Robert Towne...but one couldn't help thinking with a little more sharpness early on it could have been even better. It's a piece that will linger in the memory though in my opinion and you can't say that about the majority of the modern day films.".

I would venture to say the soundtrack was equally flawless since it didn't bother me one bit didn't really notice it either.So what was wrong about the movie? I don't know. Maybe the pace since it was two hours long. Or the subject which was ... smooth. I mean there were no real bumps in it. Everything just went by itself. In the tradition of road writers the character is almost an observer left to his own emotions but incapable of acting. I can't say that characters weren't original but more in the direction of weirdly annoying rather than interesting.Bottom line it's a drama. The romance itself is strong not the diluted stuff you see nowadays but I wouldn't call this a romantic movie. I suggest watching it when you feel philosophical or want something new yet slow paced.".

	schema:headline " The verbal firework between Farrel and Hayak is a huge plus!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a portrayal of people living on the downside of society during the Great Depression a nice period in time for movies that offers a pleasantly raw and nihilistic ambiance. Both characters the writer with more aspirations than experiences to actually write about Colin Farrel and the beautiful yet grieving Mexican beauty Salma Hayek  wander through the sad streets of L.A fighting each other and mostly themselves. They love each other but their own low self esteem and prejudices are standing in the way to form a happy couple. At the core this is just a tragic love story about unreachable love. Nothing wrong with that of course! I really enjoyed the verbal confrontations between Hayek and Farrel. Their failure to communicate as equals is ''delightfully sad ''. At a certain point as they start to understand each other better they start to talk as normal people and at that point the story didn't quite get to me as it did before. What remains is a somewhat melodramatic and predictable piece of drama. It isn't necessarily bad just not that exciting anymore. Sometimes I even checked the time on my DVD player just to see if it would be over soon. Not a very good sign... Ah well I enjoyed it too much to be cynical about it. It has some marvelous scenes in it with an atmosphere that really brings back the sense of being in LA during the Great Depression. Farrel and Hayek fitted in their roles perfectly and it is a pleasure to watch these two beautiful people interact with each other. Donald Sutherland steals the show with a short yet highly enjoyable role.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.  Ernest Hemingway1939. John Fante writes Ask the Dust the tale of a young man embarking on a literary career. Years later a young Robert Towne stumbles upon and voraciously devours Fante's novels most of which attempt to paint a portrait of early 20th century Los Angeles. Decades pass. Towne embarks on his own literary career. He scores big with his screenplay for Roman Polanski's Chinatown a LA set noir influenced and flavoured by Fante. Towne and Fante personally meet in the 1970s. Fante dies in 1983. Two decades later Towne adapts Ask the Dust for the screen.Those looking for a faithful adaptation of Fante's novel will be disappointed. Towne has been sculpted Ask the Dusk into a deliberate fiveway romance a distillation of Towne's longtime love for Fante Towne's adoration of noir and its assorted signs trinkets and decor Towne and Fante's love for early Los Angeles its history its characters locales and heartbeat Towne's idealisation of the Romantic image of the struggling artist and the infilm love affair between an artist played by Colin Farrell and a Mexican waitress Salma Hayek.The film can't touch Nicholas Ray's In A Lonely Place but to those attuned to Towne's very specific yearnings it's a very good film. Towne's no visualist but he's a good enough writer to capture the essence of a noirish LA with its flapping curtains decrepit apartments barflies lonely hearts drunks scroungers conmen palm trees and sunbaked pavements. It's a nostalgia rush all of which is married to an idealised heavily romanticised portrait of a struggling artist  super good looking of course  who spends his time bedding lush Mexican women a bosomy Salma Hayek or sitting valiantly at a typewriter pounding prose on page while chiaroscuro lighting bathes his body. The most interesting thing about the film though is its narrative arc. Farrell who plays our budding artist a surrogate for both Towne and Fante has a massive insecurity complex and hates himself because he's Italian. Of course many burgeoning artists develop their artistic talents as a means of assuaging personal issues alienation rootlessness self esteem problems etc. Art them becomes a means of reconnection the product of the outsider looking inwards. The marginality of the artist then often results in the artist developing as a sort of selfdefence mechanism a sense of superiority or inflated ego I hate them for making me an outsider I want to be with them I am too good to be with them I'm a great artist superior going places don't need them so confused! etc. As the artist must put him or herself far out on the line and often stand alone such an inflation  or an almost bipolar flipflop from feelings of unworthiness to massive selfexaltation  then becomes all that keeps her or him persevering. Now the Farrell character because he is supremely selfloathing begins to lash out at anyone and anything that reminds him of his own lowliness. One of his targets is Salma Hayek's character too beautiful for such a role a poor Mexican waitress. She reminds him of that which he wishes to escape. By the film's end however Farrell drops his hate his aloofness and begins to identify with others empathise and speak up for them. Being a writer then becomes not a mark of status but a duty. This tension itself increasingly obsessed Fante his books ostensibly revolving around arrogant characters seeking independence fame and success while actually serving as a vehicle to introduce readers to a city its inhabitants and their plights. In the film Farrell's reconnection with the marginalised  the very subjects of his future art  is symbolised as a series of romantic or sexual encounters with physically deformed women and society's dregs. The film is not about immigration racism and poverty as some claim but something more generalised artists or spectators forging empathic connections with their objects. As empathy by definition cannot function without imagination you might say empathy is itself a kind of art. This is why it is important that Towne prolong the sex scene between Farrell and Hayek and why it is important that it is at her most desirable moment that she cough and be sickly. Incidentally evolutionary speaking empathy or sharing someone else's emotion need not yield prosocial behaviour. If perceiving another person in a painful circumstance elicits personal physical or emotional distress then the observer may tend not to attend fully to the other's experience and as a result seem to lack sympathetic behaviours. As empathic concern can lead to personal distress such commections are also often blocked out. This may explain why statistically excessively empathetic humans are less likely to be prosocial and perhaps why artists prefer to disconnect and engage with the world safely by proxy.810  Interesting but somewhat poorly directed and should have been better written. Will appeal only to noirheads artists and romantics. Seek out Fante's much copied novel. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a lover of beasts and men. So Colin Farrell's writer Arturo Bandini reveals his humanistic longings and along the way his inexperience with humans. His love is the Mexican beauty Camilla played better than Katy Jurado ever could by Salma Hyeck with whom he fights from the cute meeting to the very end. But it is a love nevertheless with a strength often given only to those who fight passionately. This is 1935 LA land of love and art with a whole bunch of racism thrown in between the abstractions. Arturo's being Italian throws a certain doubt on whether he could eventually marry this Mexican Camilla. Ask the Dust subtly explores a melting pot of racism of course including the ever present persecution of the Jews. In fact no one in the film has found a mate or a home yet anyway so loneliness and disenfranchisement are always there.Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's shots are each a marvel of painterly cinema just the right brownish noirish lighting and shadows to create a marginal world of dream and destitution where only love could create wealth. And what a love. These two leads are to the camera born their dark good looks making them as much brother and sister as reluctant lovers. Farrell speaks almost as if he is narrating which he does as well his intonations are weighty in sotto voce uncharacteristic of the more flamboyant characters he is used to playing. Hyeck has lusty dignity with a spicy stubbornness that makes you believe she is worthy of marrying this gringo and living happily ever after.But that ending is the clichd part of the story as if all stories about writers must end with a tragedy. Towne however tempers the darkness with hope an aspiration in abundant supply in lala land but the compromised kind reminding us at the end of his towering Chinatown that it's out of our hands.".

In fact no one in the film has found a mate or a home yet anyway so loneliness and disenfranchisement are always there.Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's shots are each a marvel of painterly cinema just the right brownish noirish lighting and shadows to create a marginal world of dream and destitution where only love could create wealth. And what a love. These two leads are to the camera born their dark good looks making them as much brother and sister as reluctant lovers. Farrell speaks almost as if he is narrating which he does as well his intonations are weighty in sotto voce uncharacteristic of the more flamboyant characters he is used to playing. Hyeck has lusty dignity with a spicy stubbornness that makes you believe she is worthy of marrying this gringo and living happily ever after.But that ending is the clichd part of the story as if all stories about writers must end with a tragedy. Towne however tempers the darkness with hope an aspiration in abundant supply in lala land but the compromised kind reminding us at the end of his towering Chinatown that it's out of our hands.";

It's a shame too because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I've ever seen. It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere I would say it goes nowhere fast but it really goes nowhere slow...painfully slow. From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters but that's all we get  hints. There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie. Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained...I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff. But these characters add up to nothing. For the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them. As a matter of fact you almost start hoping they die because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling but it's not. Instead of quirky noiresquire characters acting in hardboiled fashion you simply recognize it immediately for what it is a bunch of talented but miscast actors brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. All this for two plodding painfully slow hours. Awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been ages since Robert Towne directed a new film and Ask the Dust did not fail the anticipation of fans who love and appreciate his previous production such as Tequila Sunrise and Without Limits.Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek makes up the new pair of silver screen couple with the background set in the Depression Era of US in the 30's. Farrell takes up the role of Arturo Bandini an Italian author living in a cheap motel in Los Angeles while Hayek plays a Mexican waitress Camilla who wants to marry an rich American for a better life. Life seems to be the same for them until they met each other in a caf where Camilla works. Arturo was inspired by Camilla which leads him to wrote more stories and at the same time making him realize who he loves eventually.Towne brought out the lives and problems of Arturo and Camilla well where a young author will never spare much thought on how will he survive tomorrow by spending lots of money on luxury after he gotten his pay while she will do anything to get herself married to an American for a better life.Ask the Dust also brought out one point faced in the previous century racism. Camilla was despised by the Americans for she trying to get herself hooked up to an American for a better life where she is a Mexican. Somehow it was described in brief rather than a main idea in a whole story.It is not often that the audience would get to see Farrell playing a sentimental role in his acting career. While playing a bisexual trapped in between the love of his homosexual best friend and his best friend's female roommate in A Home At the End of the World 2004 Ask the Dust gives Farrell a greater chance of exploration of a romantic and sentimental man. Hayek on the other hand was given a fair share of appearance in the story. Not really the best among her previous films but she makes the story alive. Keep a look out for the scene where both Farrell and Hayek swims in the beach nude which is one of the attraction of the film where this scene starts their romance.Veteran actor Donald Sutherland appears as a special appearance rather than a supporting role where he plays Hellfrick Arturo's neighbour. Not much room was given to Sutherland for his role was too redundant where he appears less than 15 minutes in the whole film.In all Ask the Dust has not failed that badly and it was definitely worth the 8 years wait from Towne.".

Granted Ask the Dust does little to address corruption of Latin America. The racism associated with the current border crisis is historical. Ask the Dust isn't so much an epic romance as it is a personal romance that hits close to home for interracial families epic romances tend to let characters off the hook by sweeping them away in historical movements here we have only Arturo  Camilla. To be sure the poetry of the waveriding scene could have been misdirected toward some statement about historical movements but Towne keeps the story centered on the characters. Are there other great moments? Well I'll never look at Joan Blondell the same way. The excerpt of her dialog about the benefits of being white was devastating. Great lines throughout. Donald Sutherland's Keep going or otherwise you'll die in Los Angeles like the rest of us arced strongly from Arturo's writing to his evolution as an empathetic human being.

He plans to write a fresh piece on his experience in the city but his work has gone slowly and when we see him he is down to his last nickel. He decides to spend it on a cup of coffee in a near by caf but he gets into a fight with the Mexican waitress who serves him. Her name is Camilla. She is angry with life because she is mistreated by the angelo community. She wants to find herself an America husband for safety and security and she finds herself drawn to Arturo. Although trying to focus on his work Arturo ends up being drawn to her as well.

The screenplay does not make very effective use of them. It seems Donald Sutherland and Idena Menzel not them specifically but their roles are there simply to take up screen time. Menzel is pretty lame actually. Her performance is the kind of thing that would be acceptable in theatre where her background is but for the screen it feels hammed up and overwrought. A careful collaboration between the art department the costume department and the cinematographer have resulted in a picture perfect glance at the city of angels from a hundred years ago maybe a little less. During the day the city is bright shiny and surprisingly clean. But not everything about it is so admirable. The community is racist and largely antiMexican  and of course every now and then an earth quake may come along and bring down a few houses. Ask the Dust is a film I can recommend if you want a nonconventional romance in which the presented couple are more than a pair of bodies but also a pair of brains. It is a film that works. If you don't believe me just ask the dust.".

The acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a coupletoomany raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly I can't believed how little I cared for any character in this movie. Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen. I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the alltooshort earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can say little else positive about this movie.

The only thing that touches it was the budding relationship between the two youngsters.

	schema:headline " Very unique take on the viral outbreak subgenre";
	schema:reviewBody "One would think that the last thing we need is another outbreak movie. But that's not the case when the latest of the genre is directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. Contagion wins for this years most ridiculously impressive cast lineup as it is an ensemble picture about a deadly viral outbreak that affects the entire world. We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.It's not always easy to keep an ensemble cast straight especially when the main plot of the film is run by subplots from the various characters and their stories that continue throughout the film. The stories weave in and out of each other at times but often they are all separate just lead by the same main plot of a viral outbreak affecting the entire population of the world. Thankfully Contagion interweaves its characters and story lines at just the right intervals forming a very structured and well crafted end result. There are essentially four main stories that intertwine. There's the father character's story the CDC the scientists trying to stop the disease and a blogger who claims to already have a cure for the disease. These four stories get basically equal screen time and all serve a purpose towards thickening the film's plot. The way they work together and separate is impressive and makes for a very strong overall narrative.Soderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding overdramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. This makes Contagion a very unique experience and something much different from your typical viral outbreak flick. It does lag in spots as the film attempts to stretch out certain things without doing anything flashy. The film takes a very low key and eerily monotone approach to its storytelling. It seems to choose the simplest solution to things which in turn makes it a more fascinating and much more realistic feeling than something glitzy and spastic. I certainly feel that Contagion paints the best picture of what would actually happen should a serious outbreak like this occur. This of course makes it all the more frightening.Contagion is certainly a film worth seeing. It takes a much different approach to a genre we thought we were so familiar with. Soderbergh's poignant direction and Scott Z. Burns' sharp script give this film a great atmosphere and the incredible cast lineup makes it all the better. It is undeniably slow at points but when you put in the context of a film of this quality it doesn't matter nearly as much. This is a great way to kick off the fall season for film.".

We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.It's not always easy to keep an ensemble cast straight especially when the main plot of the film is run by subplots from the various characters and their stories that continue throughout the film. The stories weave in and out of each other at times but often they are all separate just lead by the same main plot of a viral outbreak affecting the entire population of the world. Thankfully Contagion interweaves its characters and story lines at just the right intervals forming a very structured and well crafted end result. There are essentially four main stories that intertwine. There's the father character's story the CDC the scientists trying to stop the disease and a blogger who claims to already have a cure for the disease. These four stories get basically equal screen time and all serve a purpose towards thickening the film's plot. The way they work together and separate is impressive and makes for a very strong overall narrative.Soderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding overdramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. This makes Contagion a very unique experience and something much different from your typical viral outbreak flick. It does lag in spots as the film attempts to stretch out certain things without doing anything flashy. The film takes a very low key and eerily monotone approach to its storytelling. It seems to choose the simplest solution to things which in turn makes it a more fascinating and much more realistic feeling than something glitzy and spastic. I certainly feel that Contagion paints the best picture of what would actually happen should a serious outbreak like this occur. This of course makes it all the more frightening.Contagion is certainly a film worth seeing. It takes a much different approach to a genre we thought we were so familiar with. Soderbergh's poignant direction and Scott Z. Burns' sharp script give this film a great atmosphere and the incredible cast lineup makes it all the better. It is undeniably slow at points but when you put in the context of a film of this quality it doesn't matter nearly as much. This is a great way to kick off the fall season for film.";

It's full dialoguedriven scenes and most of the characters aren't really fleshed out.I was OK with that because it's able to show the different effects of a pandemic throughout the globe instead having one or two main characters. A small Chinese village near the source of the virus tries to survive. A misguided blogger ends up inciting violence . And a recently single father tries to protect his daughter. The way the story cuts between these different story lines kept me from getting bored and nothing that happens feels unrealistic.So while it's a movie I don't really need to see again it's good to experience once.

If you're smart you know how most of the world would handle it most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Movies have been created the past few decades on plagues hitting again The Stand even if it's a miniseries 28 Days Later Dawn of the Dead etc. It's terrifying to think of hard to grasp even. Contagion was made on a more realistic documentary type of movie on what if factors. With an all star cast we find out how fear can spread faster than a virus and what would life be like if everything and everyone we touched could kill us.Beth goes to Hong Kong on a business trip to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory. While in Hong Kong Beth visits a casino and plays a dice game with colleagues from the plant. Once the ceremony is complete Beth flies back to her husband Mitch.

Dr. Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control leads an investigation into disease related deaths all exhibiting similar symptoms. As the contagion spreads hearings are set up to discuss possible solutions airports within the state are shut down and the national guard is deployed to Minneapolis to cordon off the city set up treatment centers and provide general order. But as the disease proceeds to continue taking millions of lives the question is not only how to be cured but to stop the contagion from spreading.Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything but this movie makes me wonder if it's either trying to prepare us for something or spread propaganda. This weekend I'm writing this review on September 9 2011 is the 10 year anniversary of 911. My boyfriend and I were watching a documentary the other day and I told him how since that day we have lived in a paranoid society of fear somewhat good on the fact that we know we can't be ignorant forever otherwise we'll get bit hard or is it bad where everything has been so horrible to the point where we can't enjoy anything. GermX sales are way high because people are so terrified of catching something. In a society where we are cleaner than ever but we are so panicked to catch a disease of some sort and I wonder because of our media if this causes the problem.I digress onto the movie. The cast is very exceptional the main reason I went to see this was to see Kate Winslet my favorite actress. The cast is an all star though in some ways it could be a bit distracting as Matt Damon looked a little like Mark Wahlberg to me for some reason. But each actor did a great job holding their own and each one having a little sympathy as you hoped for the best in the film. Although I wanted to throw a fit for Gwenth Paltrow's character spreading the disease to Chicago first thank you very much! The style of the movie is done very well. I have only 2 complaints one being that the film could have been a little more shocking since we are thrown right into the disease spreading it's hard to latch onto any character because we know there's a chance of them dying. The tension could have been a little more there. The ending was also a little off thought this is a mild complaint as I would see this like how it fizzled out just like if this was for real if the human race had fizzled out. But it left me a little unsatisfied I wanted more at the end. I think I would recommend this as a rental or a matine for those who want an intelligent film. It does keep you frightened on some level making you wonder if you could be next in a plague that will kill millions of people.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Now go and wash your hands! That's what you'll be doing after you see this film. Contagion is a frightening realistic procedural thriller about the spread of an airborne pandemic virus its impact on an ensemble cast of characters played by a veritable 'Who's Who' of Hollywood and the subsequent race to find a cure.Like his earlier work 'Traffic' Soderbergh skilfully interweaves the various story lines into a bigger picture that breathlessly tracks and encircles the globe. The cast do not let him down. It's impossible to see a bad performance from Matt Damon and once again his role as a grieving father is sensitively and painfully played. We really feel his sense of sudden and unexpected loss as he struggles to internalise the news of his wife's death disbelieving dazed and confused. Marion Cotillard adds an international hue to her role as a World Health Organisation investigator whilst Jude Law plays the role of an insidious Australian blogger who dangerously undermines the medical establishment's attempts to find a cure for his own conspiratorial and financial gains to perfection. I could go on Laurence Fishburne Kate Winslet Jennifer Ehle and John Hawkes all provide solid support in a starry cast.What makes this film so compelling is the way Soderbergh is able to show how unhygienic human beings are and how easy it is to create a pandemic. In hundreds of different absent minded ways we touch our faces on a daily basis and in doing so transfer and spread dangerous viruses amongst ourselves. Next time you're in the supermarket look out for the number of people who pick their noses wipe their mouths and cough sneeze and splutter their way past you without any attempts to cover their mouths. They're picking up and putting back the fruit and vegetables handling groceries and even touching your hand when supermarket staff are giving back your card or change! Worse still a recent survey showed that although 95 of people say they wash their hands only 12 actually do so and consequently 1 in 6 mobile phones have faecal bacterial on them and 30 of all handbags. I could go on.Despite a slightly preposterous storyline when Cotillard is kidnapped in Hong Kong Soderbergh does portray the breakdown of society in an uncomfortably truthful way when people are suddenly and unexpectedly faced with their own extinction and the instincts of self preservation take over. This could have been explored a little further around the world although at all times the story is grounded in reality. Even the death toll of 27 million worldwide in four months has the ring of truth about it and this is due in no small part to the film's chief scientific adviser Dr. W. Ian Lipkin the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University. The televised national lottery in the film is something that I could see happening in the interests of fairness and impartiality when the supply of vaccines is unable to keep up with demand when life and death is only one injection away.At the film's closing credits one thing stands out and that is the unheralded and heroic work of the thousands of doctors microbiologists virologists and vaccine researchers around the world who labour night and day to minimise the effects of such a pandemic occurring which might wipe out the human race. If you're a pessimist like me in this age of global warming massive deforestation the depletion of the earth's natural resources the extinction of wildlife habitats overpopulation and overcrowding go figure...a pandemic like the one portrayed in Contagion is inevitable and long overdue according to the scientific world. The only question that remains is how many people will it kill? Anyway go and see the film  it's a thought provoking and scary chiller that taps into the current zeitgeist.".

As a result I was reasonably prepared for the film and not put off by how matteroffact it was in its delivery. Staying mostly away from hyperbole and false dramatics the film takes us through the spread of the virus across the world with the challenge of containing managing and responding to it.Although there is some emotion to be found in some specifics if you want it and there is a certain horror to the scale and the numbers mostly the film doesn't chill as it could and certainly doesn't have urgency to it  what it has instead is a coldness and procedural approach. Personally I liked this and felt it worked better than the other extreme of lots of wailing and famous actors getting melodramatic death sequences. The downside of it though is that it feels like reading a bullet point summary of what would happen over the 150 or so days so we get the hesitant response tick we get the misinformation tick we get the lines for limited supplies tick and so on. Like a bullet point list on a document it does a great job of giving you the basics but none of it is expansive or has much depth as a drama and I can see why some viewers would have major problems with this  I did too but I took it as the sideeffect of an approach that mostly worked.The cast list is starry but nobody really hams it up and mostly everyone underplays as much as they can to good effect. At times having famous faces in tiny roles was a little distracting but mostly it worked and it totally avoided the sense of old celebrity pals hanging out together at having fun together  a feeling these celebrity heavy films often can have. I think some characters got too much time  in particular I felt that Law's blogger was given too large a chunk of the time considering his small role in the global situation  the guy who discovers a way to manufacture the virus is in the film for seconds despite being played by Gould but yet a blogger is front and center? Not sure why but it didn't really work. Soderbergh's direction is effective and nicely clinical it makes the approach of the film and I enjoyed his handling of it.Contagion is not a brilliant film by any means nor is it the one to come to if you're expecting high octane thrills but it is enjoyable in a very clinical cold way.

	schema:reviewBody "I really have to say that I was completely underwhelmed by this experience. It's not a bad film but it certainly is no thriller. It's exactly what it says. A film about disease and the spreading of said disease. There's no real connection with any of the characters or any of the stars of the cast. They try with Damon and Fishburne's characters but they spend large chunks of this film absent from the story. It's a messy grab bag of a film that splinters and runs off in many directions for no reason at all. Also the impact of this global disaster wasn't even depicted to the level one would expect. It certainly takes a shortcut through just what an economic disaster this would create. No evil liberal blogger would be able to profit and everyone would be economically devastated as much as anything.Overall very disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the year 2000 Steven Soderbergh released a film about the drug  trade called Traffic  and it won him the Oscar for Best Director as  well as three Oscars for Best Supporting Actor Best Film Editing and  Best Adapted Screenplay. The film budgeted at US46 million grossed  over US207 million.  Contagion a docudrama of sorts on a global pandemic is unlikely to  accomplish the same feats although it has the same multilevel plots  that Traffic had. Still it is an engaging drama played out by a  bunch of top stars.  The movie opens on Day 2 of the virus outbreak following a sick  looking Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff at Chicago airport as she  travels home to Minneapolis from a business trip in Hong Kong. She  spreads the virus to her hubby Mitch Matt Damon and son. We are also  shown how others in Kowloon Hong Kong London population 8.6  million and Guandong province population 98 million fall ill from  the disease.  At the Centre for Disease Control CDC in Atlanta its executive Dr  Ellis Cheever Laurence Fishburne swings into action sending his  Epidemic Intelligence officer Dr Erin Mears Kate Winslet to find out  how the virus started. Meanwhile Dr. Leonora Orantes Marion  Cotillard of the World Health Organization flies to China  and  promptly gets into trouble with the locals. As the days add on we see  how other factors  such as conspiracy blogger Alan Krumwiede Jude  Law takes advantage of the situation how panic grips the population  etc. The CDC works against the clock to come up with a vaccination  against the MEV1 virus.  Even though Soderbergh has lined up a formidable cast for this movie  the main 'character' is the invisible virus. As Paltrow's sniffling  Beth dips into a bowl of nuts at the airport the virus is on the  loose it spreads as she hands over her credit card and the camera  follows the chain of contamination  from the bartender's hand to the  till machine to the glass on the bar. When someone drops dead we know  who to blame. Contagion is told in a series of subplots just like in  Traffic but none is as well developed as we would like it to be.  Law's blogger represents the financial and social upheaval on a global  scale but it is nothing as terrifying as the effects of the virus. We  also get to keep an eye on how the tragedy is affecting Damon's Mitch  Emhoff and his daughter as well as the personal side of Fishburne's Dr  Cheever and his wife Aubrey Sanaa Lathan. Of these subplots the  weakest and most underdeveloped is the one involving Cottilard's Dr  Orantes.  Jennifer Ehle does a good job as Dr Ally Hextall  a dogged scientist  racing against time to come out with an antidote. The drama written by  Scott Z. Burns also compares the outbreak with those of SARS H1N1 and  the Spanish flu in 1918 that claimed 50 million lives lending a  touch of realism to the proceedings. Indeed Soderbergh could have  thrown in some terror and horror thrills. I am glad he resisted the  temptation.  You'll think twice about shaking hands after the movie.".

	schema:headline " And Epidemioligst's dream and a Germophobe's nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "So what comes to mind when you think of a disaster movie? Is it gigantic alien invaders? Is it volcanoes exploding and flooding the land with lava? Or is it the world ending in some fiery cosmic or overpowering natural force way? Regardless we've seen various movies that have tried to destroy the human population in flashy explosion filled ways. However one movie that released this weekend called Contagion has decided to approach the threat of human extinction in a different way. Was it worth it? Well read on to find out.Okay let's face it when I first saw the trailer I couldn't help but think that this movie was going to be nothing more than a boring and overdramatic remake of the movie Outbreak. About thirty minutes into the film however I was proved wrong as the tale unfolded into something much deeper. As the trailer pointed out the plot of Contagion centers on a mysterious virus that suddenly appears in a few random cases making the doctors think that it's nothing more than a common virus. The opinion soon changes however when cases across the world come pouring in and many people begin experiencing the symptoms. Soon the experts begin working out a solution to the virus causing the disease but the fear and paranoia filling the general public begin causing major problems which could be even deadlier than the virus.However this tale is really split into two different scenarios one involving Matt Damon and his family and the other on Lawrence Fishburne and his team dealing with the silent killer. Both of these tales were too my surprise actually pretty interesting with their pace and drama balanced to a healthy level. Perhaps what made this movie come to life was the great acting by Fishburne and Jude Law. The two actors played the head of the health team and the weasel journalistic respectively fighting each other to the vary core. While one is trying to pool all his resources into combating chaos the other continues to increase it with his articles. As the two combat one another the rest of the supporting cast most of who are on Fishburne's team attempt to do their part in surviving in the panic filled world. I'll mention here that Kate Winslet and Jennifer Ehle fans will be happy with the roles played by these starlets while fans of Damon and Paltrow will be disappointed as their roles are much more diluted and calmer than what we've seen in the past.Now although the acting was good the biggest factor that gave this movie character was how the crew made your imagination fill you with fear. The combination of the camerawork layout of the scenes and dialog all combined to create a believable scenario about a world caught up in an epidemic. Instead of the flashy explosions scream filled closeup death scenes and high speed outrun natural disaster scenes the virus instead silently travels across the world and you don't know who it's going to strike next. As a result I was caught up in suspense at hoping my favorite characters would not succumb to the virus or be taken out by someone plagued with fear. Regardless despite not being able to see the killer the virus may in fact be one of the scariest killers I've seen in a long time.The other factor that I thoroughly enjoyed were the realistic steps and actions portrayed in this film that were used to combat the epidemic. The science governmental laws and regulations propaganda and many other factors I felt were pretty accurate and I was able to follow and understand what they were doing. I'm not going to lie that my favorite parts to this movie were the scientific explanations about the virus which I was able to understand but lets face it I'm a geek. Regardless I'll warn you that people who don't like science or bureaucratic processes will not like these scenes.Now lets get to the weaknesses of this movie that I wish to share with you. The first thing is that this movie is very sad at parts and people who don't like depression will want to avoid this movie. The movie is not afraid to show the dying victims up close and personal which can either tug at your heartstrings or make you sick. Germophobes as well will want to stay away from this film as their fears will only be amplified by some of the focused shots of the victims leaving the virus on various surfaces. I guess the only other weakness I can say is that for an actionthriller which this movie is classified as there is not a whole lot of action. Again there are no highspeed chases suspense filled acrobatics and climbing expeditions or giant CGI natural disaster attacks. Those looking for said characteristics should choose another movie.Contagion is one of the better disaster movies I have seen in a long time. The good acting well angled shots and ability to use the audience's imagination to paint the fear kept me deep into the movie and kept me surprised through most of the movie. However I do have to say that the focused portrayal of death and the emotions that came with it were not my cup of tea. As a disaster movie this film gets a 9.510 but as a movie overall I would say somewhere around a 7.58.0 will do this movie justice. So until then I welcome constructive criticism and hope you have a fun time at the movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of years ago news and health agencies the world over were concerned about a possible pandemic stemming from bird flu and swine flu. Thankfully like SARS a few years earlier the outbreaks were rather small thanks to a wealth of precautionary information and measures. In the new film Contagion director Steven Soderbergh paints a frighteningly realistic look at a worldwide pandemic that spread without warning and its devastating aftermath. When businesswoman Beth Emhoff Gwyneth Paltrow returns from a business trip to Hong Kong with what appears to be a simple case of the flu her husband Mitch Matt Damon figures it's nothing to be overly concerned about. When Beth all of a sudden begins to convulse and later dies unexpectedly doctors are at a loss to explain what happened.Over the next few days more and more people become sick and die including Mitch's young stepson which gets the national and international disease control organizations working overtime to try to trace identify and treat this mysterious ailment that sweeping the globe. Dr. Ellis Cheever Laurence Fishburne leads the investigation in the United States and calls in Dr. Erin Mears Kate Winslet to track who may have come into contact with Beth upon her return to the Minneapolis. The World Health Organization sends Dr. Leonora Orantes Marion Cotillard to Hong Kong trace possible origins. As the first week passes more and more people become sick worldwide cities start fighting a losing battle against frenzy and panic. In time the virus is identified but due to its unique nature finding a vaccine and producing it can take several months with thousands of lives lost with each passing day. With chaos breaking loose and the bodies piling up the authorities find themselves unable to deal with the threat they are facing and go to extreme measures such as closing the state borders to try to contain the spread of the virus. Adding to the confusion is a freelance blogger named Alan Jude Law who has amassed a large audience with his conspiracy claims that there are indeed cures available for the mysterious virus. He contends the government elite and the pharmaceutical companies are exploiting the situation in order to milk maximum profit from the inevitable release of a vaccine.The film deftly moves around the world showing the victims scientists and investigators and how the crisis is affecting them. It also shows how quickly society can break down as scene after shocking scene of chaos and devastation are introduced juxtaposed with the number of days since the outbreak of the virus.Soderbergh keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't give you a moment's rest. Characters are introduced and given just enough of a back story so that you understand their place in the film. Most heartbreaking is Matt Damon's role as a father who was watching over his only remaining child going to great measures to keep her safe while also dealing with the death of his wife and the unfolding secret of the last days of her life. There is truly an impressive array of stars in the film some of whom play brief but significant parts in the overall story. However the movie's strength is also its weakness in that with so many primary characters there were some diverging story lines with that did not get fully fleshed out.While Contagion is not the first film to deal with viral outbreak it is perhaps the most realistic as it doesn't resort to any Hollywood standards such as car chases explosions starcrossed lovers and so on to tell its story. Instead it focuses on stark somber scenarios and the struggles of each character is very easy to relate to. Kudos has to be given to many of the stars of the film for their understated but pitch perfect work in very unglamorous roles. Their subtle  poignant acting underscore the dire situations that their characters find themselves in. It was refreshing to see leading men and women looking quite ordinary and letting the story carry the picture rather than focusing on one individual to save the day.All throughout the film I found myself captivated and never once did I lose interest in the scenarios or characters nor did I find anything in the film impossible to believe. The film doesn't go overboard on pointing fingers instead it gives an honest and unflinching look at a scenario that we can only hope will never happen. But as the film points out viral outbreaks have occurred all throughout history. Hardly an encouraging message but thanks to the stellar cast and gripping subject matter Contagion is a film you will not want to miss.Gareth Von Kallenbach Skewed and Reviewed".

If you just want entertainment be that action romance whatever then maybe this movie will disappoint. However if you want something beyond shallow entertainment this movie will NOT disappoint. It is a plausible scenario quite thought provoking and I believe an important movie. It is also technically quite good. Acting and camera work excellent good screenplay and directing. The characters ARE human with human failings. It doesn't end happily ever after for all and some of the people in positions of responsibility eg at the CDC put their family first. There are allusions to politicians misusing their position. There are scenes where people loot trample others to get to the head of the queue for medicines steal food generally somemany people behave badly. And in contrast some behave well. So the movie explores the spectrum of human morality and shows good men have flaws. This is much closer to reality than the behavior that many movies usually reflect. A somewhat deeper movie than Hollywood has put out for quite some time. Recommended.".

It is a plausible scenario quite thought provoking and I believe an important movie. It is also technically quite good. Acting and camera work excellent good screenplay and directing. The characters ARE human with human failings. It doesn't end happily ever after for all and some of the people in positions of responsibility eg at the CDC put their family first. There are allusions to politicians misusing their position. There are scenes where people loot trample others to get to the head of the queue for medicines steal food generally somemany people behave badly. And in contrast some behave well. So the movie explores the spectrum of human morality and shows good men have flaws. This is much closer to reality than the behavior that many movies usually reflect. A somewhat deeper movie than Hollywood has put out for quite some time. Recommended.";

	schema:headline " Incredibly disappointing even with the talent involved";
	schema:reviewBody "I was taken off guard when I first watched the trailer for Contagion. It looked like a crazy offtherails thriller that was genuinely terrifying in its depiction of something too close to reality. When I got passes for an advanced screening last week I had to contain my excitement. With Steven Soderbergh at the helm of a plethora of Oscarwinningnominated talent how could I possibly go wrong?A deadly virus has been discovered after multiple deaths begin surfacing around the world. As various members of the CDC and WHO race to find a cure the world stands at the brink of a rising epidemic. While some are safe others must do everything they can to avoid infection or risk the fatal consequences.It may sound vague but with so many characters and story lines going on at once it is slightly difficult to nail down a synopsis without giving too much away. The film takes the approach of giving us the events on a daytoday structure showing how quickly and destructively stretches and mutates. Characters drop in and out to give us varying points of view of the effects of the virus whether it be from an almost random citizen a doctor on ground zero or the scientists in the lab. We learn early on that no one is safe and the film pulls no punches letting you know that sentiment again and again. While I was a little flabbergasted at the almost ludicrous amount of montages early in the film it became clear exactly what kind of slick look Soderbergh intended for the picture. Depending on the location the colour scheme modifies and reinvents itself. Some scenes look simply stunning in their production values making a big budget Hollywood project look like a down and dirty gritty amateur indie. Soderbergh has never been easily classified and with this film his first major motion picture since Ocean's Thirteen he maintains and furthers his enigmatic nature. The pounding 1980s synth score was a nice and bewildering touch too but I would have expected nothing less.Despite what the trailers and some of my early praise would have you believe Contagion is actually a slow and meticulous film that is only partially thrilling. Yes there is a panicked tone that carries the film for a good portion  one that frequently veers into claustrophobia as it dawns on the characters and the audience themselves just how widespread and devastating the virus is  but this tone never seems right. It jumps and fluctuates disappearing almost entirely in some instances and overdoing it in others. It seems completely unable to settle on any one ideal and as a result feels very all overtheplace. It saddens me to say it considering what a master filmmaker Soderbergh truly is but the film starts unraveling the moment it starts and never seems to be able to find its footing. But I think this can also be blamed on the script by Scott Z. Burns. He partnered with Soderbergh before and gave us the moderately entertaining The Informant! but he suffers here by building a complex dense and incredibly verbose narrative around a mere nugget of a good idea. Instead of developing the idea into the thoughtprovoking and horrifying vision we are meant to take from everything we have been shown we are given a crosssection of stories that intersect at points and fail to come to any sort of fruition. By the time the film comes to a close after more than a handful of screeching halts and asinine character motivations and reactions I just found myself asking what the point of it all was. There is some heavy handed satire buried within the picture as is a treatise on some disturbing realities of the healthcare system worldwide. But outside of these vague notions it all feels like a huge buildup to nothing. It feels like Burns and Soderbergh simply stopped caring after the basic idea stage was completed. And if they do not care about what is happening then why should we?And really with all the jargon and technical terminology being thrown around did they really need to talk down to the audience on more than one occasion? I am by no means a genius but I felt kind of offended that the film found the need to hint and then spell things out entirely for me.While it was initially impressive to see such a diverse group of actors in roles of varying importance including Canada's own Enrico Colantoni in a fairly substantial role sadly there is no real time for any one actor to really make something of their role. No one drops the ball thankfully they let the film do that for them but at the same time no one seems like they are putting any substantial effort in either. Singling any one actor out is practically unfair because there are no standouts. I realize this is a very ensemble based film but even the most hardened examples of this type of film have one character that the audience finds unforgettable. This film does not have this character in any capacity. And for such a great pool of Oscarcalibre talent this is the most disappointing and disheartening element of all. While I went into Contagion with excitement I came out let down. For what little the film actually has going for it it just seems like it all went to waste including the absolutely shocking death that is ruined by the trailers. Whether it wanted to be a paranoiadriven thriller a not so subtle satire or just an exercise in fear Contagion fails on all counts. It is overly slow and at the worst of times incredibly boring. You are better off watching the trailer on loop and imagining just how much better the film looks than it actually is. 610.An extended review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

Something happens that promises to change life as we know it or outright destroy it. Okay promising. However very quickly the movie starts to drag and drag badly. There is no continuity what so ever characters who you begin to sympathize with just don't go anywhere. So here is the movie in a nutshell... SPOILER ALERT A killer virus plagues the world. People Die. A vaccine is developed. People Live. That's it. Honestly with an estimated 60 Million dollar budget they could have done a lot more. The visuals were poor. The acting bland. The plot...

	schema:reviewBody "Every here and there there always seems to be a life threatening disease ready to kill us. For most of us we've been able to avoid death with good health care and isolating the disease quickly. But what if we didn't isolate it immediately? Steven Soderbergh's Contagion tries to answer that question with a technique similar to the one he used for Traffic  only with less time on his hands. Although 106 minutes is plenty of time to fill a movie for a virus thriller like Contagion there should either a more time for characters or b less situations and focus on the few.Set across the globe Contagion covers several story arcs relating to a virus outbreak that starts in China and soon spreads across the United States. Here they are based on the chronology of eventsBusinesswoman Beth Paltrow comes home to Minnesota after a business trip to China where she contracted a virus and soon dies in her home while also infecting her sixyear old son. Her husband Mitch Damon is soon infected himself and he is a possible risk to his teenage stepdaughter and others as he waits for a cure and becomes paranoid of outsiders.Dr. Orantes Cotillard is sent to China to investigate the original source of the outbreak with the help of a local Chin Han although she is eventually kidnapped and struggles to stay alive in a village.Dr. Erin Mears Kate Winslet is sent to Minnesota by Dr. Ellis Cheever Laurence Fishburne to get information on how Beth became infected and she tries to get a sample of the virus herself. However she soon becomes infected and fights for her life while Cheever fights off rumors that he alerted several friends and family about the virus before it hit his hometown of Chicago including wife Aubrey Sanaa Lathan.Journalistblogger Alan Krumweide Jude Law tries to tell the truth of how the Government is hiding the dangers of the virus from the public. He goes to great lengths to make himself a hero although his self infection of the virus makes him more of a profit motivated blogger than a prophet of the people.Not a lot of Contagion will give you much reaction since we don't really attach ourselves to the characters. The cast make the movie work to a degree I just wish they were given more to do in this surprisingly low key effort that sometimes seems maddeningly slow. Since Contagion does cover many aspects of the virus' progression it becomes tough which characters to invest in. Though the trailers made us think that Damon would get the most sympathy the truth is that no one in Contagion does enough to gain our sympathy.We simply look at them on screen and hope that they live in the end. With such a scattered focus you'd think that Contagion would be more ambitious than what is actually in the final product. We get glimpses of the effects of the virus and how people try to contain it but we just never get that sense of claustrophobia that good thrillers deliver. Even with Damon's paranoia of outsiders giving his stepdaughter the virus there's just not enough suspense to speak of. If nothing else you'll enjoy Contagion strictly for the star power and how everyone is utilized.Law Winslet Fishburne Damon Cotillard all deliver earnest performances even if Law gets hammy as the mad blogger. While Paltrow is part of the cast in truth her scenes exist as flashbacks in dictating how the virus came about. Outside of the quibble the all star cast do fine jobs in keeping our attention despite a serious lack of involving characters.I didn't expect Contagion to be something like Outbreak and I think it's good that we get a variation of the crisis genre that doesn't merely use the crisis as a backdrop to deliver an action movie. However Contagion feels too subdued if anything else. Too often does the movie feels like a made for television movie  minus the cheap production values.More time could have meant more effect and with the limited time Soderbergh has to tell his story Contagion doesn't seem nearly as involving or thrilling as it should be. Even with a scattered focus Contagion is not nearly as enjoyable as it should be with a cast like this. Soderbergh does a good job pacing the film and the various angles the film takes does create more intrigue near the end. Yet it's not enough for me as Contagion is a passable but deeply flawed film that would be better off with more time on its hands.Grade C".

The whole thing frays out like an old tshirt.We could have had a film that focuses on the global epidemic and the strife of an high ranking government official the global epidemic and a fatherdaughter relationship or the global epidemic and the fight against it from a low ranking official at the frontline. All of that could have potential to make a decent film out of it but instead it touches all of these and leaves you clueless as to what this whole thing was about.".

The whole thing frays out like an old tshirt.We could have had a film that focuses on the global epidemic and the strife of an high ranking government official the global epidemic and a fatherdaughter relationship or the global epidemic and the fight against it from a low ranking official at the frontline. All of that could have potential to make a decent film out of it but instead it touches all of these and leaves you clueless as to what this whole thing was about.";

If this movie wasn't about realism then it should have been about interesting characters but it wasn't about that either. Though I like most of the actors in this movie and their acting the parts that they were given to play were poorly done at best and worst at most. The only really flushed out character was Matt Damon. The worse character was poor Judd Law what in God's name were they smoking when they created his character. I've heard and seen opportunist but this was ridiculous. This movie was slow and boring and could have been so much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "A medical disaster which could potentially kill millions of people all around the world...well that shouldn't be boring. But in Contagion boring it is. This is a medical thriller which is not at all thrilling. The film is a largely tedious totally unfocused mess. You have a great cast filled with some of the most renowned performers of our time. You have a highly acclaimed director in Steven Soderbergh. And you have a story which should be absolutely gripping. How could it all go so wrong? A woman drops dead in Minnesota. Soon people are dropping dead all over the place felled by a new disease doctors can't figure out. The world goes to hell in the proverbial handbasket. We see doctors investigating the origin of this new virus and trying to find a cure. We see ordinary people trying to survive in a society which is crumbling all around them. And in a subplot which should have been excised from the film we see an unscrupulous blogger who professes to have the cure. There are a lot of strands of the plot and these strands don't come together at all satisfactorily. Honestly the whole thing is a mess. And a quite boring mess at that.With the film being so unfocused it's hard to form attachments to any character. If there's one person we come close to connecting with it's an ordinary man played by Matt Damon who just wants to keep his daughter safe. But any time you want to invest in his story the film abandons him and goes off somewhere else. We go to Atlanta where Laurence Fishburne plays the man heading the efforts of the CDC. We go to Hong Kong where Marion Cotillard's character investigates the origin of the disease and ends up in a surprising situation which does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. We have Kate Winslet playing a doctor investigating things in Minnesota. Her story has a little juice to it but it isn't sustained. And we have Jude Law playing that incredibly annoying blogger whose story sends the film completely off the rails. All the while there's a global disaster going on so the film should feel big have some real weight to it. But it doesn't it's all very mundane. An easy film to compare Contagion to is Outbreak. In that film the focus was on an outbreak in one town. Not as big a deal as a worldwide pandemic. Maybe Contagion is too big for its own good. Outbreak was a taut tight thriller. It had focus. Contagion is all over the place. And the thrill is gone.".

They clearly don't understand what's going on but they want to frighten us for some reason perhaps to keep their funding coming in. In any case I would still watch a film like Contagion if it provided more than this kind of apparently unrealistic scenario but it did not.

There is great animosity between the cutters and the generally wealthy Indiana University students each group who have their own turf in town. The dichotomy is that the limestone was used to build the university which is now seen as being too good for the locals who built it. Although each of the four is a totally different personality from the other three they also have in common the fact of being unfocused and unmotivated in life. The one slight exception is Dave. Although he has no job and doesn't know what to do with his life he is a champion bicycle racer. He idolizes the Italian cycling team so much he pretends to be Italian much to the chagrin...";

It is also about a young man in search of an identity including that of a Italian bicycle racer and of a family that is loving and supportive almost in spite of itself.

	schema:reviewBody "I was nine years old when I first saw 'Breaking Away' and I think the book adaptation may have been the first moreorless novellength thing I ever read. My wild enthusiasm after leaving the theatre was similar at the time to my previous reaction to 'Star Wars' a fact that I attribute to the natural electrical charge of the endings of both films.Of course a nineyearold lacks the world experience to empirically understand the central messages of this film and at the time my primary devotion to it was centered around Dave Stoller's orange Masi racing bike a thing that I coveted with the passions of a kid on Christmas Eve.The movie made me mad with bicycle lust and I frowned on every Huffy I saw at school. I used to draw pictures of Masi Bianchi and Olmo bikes all the time after seeing this and I shamelessly begged my parents for an Italianmade Campagnoloequipped racer  a futile thing to do as my parents knew not to purchase something that expensive for a boy who would physically outgrow a pair of Levis within a school year. Ultimately I was propelled into the worship of Eddy Merckx while all my classmates were digging into their Terry Bradshaw Topps cards unaware  as I'm positive they still are  of who the hell Eddy Merckx even is.BUT...'Breaking Away' is not just a bicycle film  not by a longshot and I knew it then too but that just wasn't very important to me at a time when bicycles were allimportant.Despite my youthful energies I never did pursue bicycle racingalthough I am definitely a touring enthusiast whose passion for Italianmade bicycles has finally seen fruition but 'Breaking Away' never left me. It was the REST of the film that eventually got to me  and somewhat later in life  when my emotions and experiences with the world ran deeper.In short this film explores many strands the aimlessness of youth colliding with the responsibilities of adulthood the often heartbreaking romantic fantasies of people who wish they could be something else lying and cheating and the false nature of gains made through them the importance of strong family relations and friendships and life in smalltown America  and it does all this with extraordinary craft honesty and sensitivity. It's beautiful and more importantly it is soulful and original. Although certainly dated in appearance I'll even toss in the cliche that it is timeless because the themes and characters are so.The characters themselves are all wonderfully brought out by the  perfect casting  it's been said here but the fact that Dennis Christopher never achieved starstatus is truly a shame and a waste of a potentially amazing talent. He played the lead role with a believable intensity and a really quite perfect understanding of his character. Dave Stoller's painful selfrealization after the Cinzano race was as memorable a job of acting as I can think of. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barry were also wonderful as were Quaid Stern and Haley  every one of them created a personality for their characters both in dialogue and physical reaction. The rest of the cast was likewise fine each actor doing the best they could with what were sometimes stock roles the college kids for example including Robyn Douglas the female romantic roleThe direction story and most especially the dialogue were great as well.I also picked up a love of Mendelssohn and Rossini when I was just a kid after seeing this  the film score was superb all the while taking the Stanley KubrickWoody Allen approach by choosing some choice compositions of a time long past rather than belabor the audience with the refried horrors so typical of modern filmscore composition.I hope this movie doesn't become a relic  it seems its own sleeper status has kept it shelved over the years. Mention it to just about any American born before 1975 and they'll know what it is but only in the way I did when I was nine they'll usually say something like oh yeah the bicycle film! I remember that one and then they'll likely have little else to say about it which is a shame. I still wholeheartedly place this movie among my very favorites every time and I trumpet it whenever I get into discussions with other people about the movies I love.".

We had decided to go to a double feature of two movies that we had never heard of knowing that in that day and age a double feature meant that at least one if not both movies had to be pretty awful.  The first film was Starting Over with Burt Reynolds and it was fairly good.  So my friends were sure that the other would have to be terrible but we had nothing better to do so I convinced them to stay.  Before three lines of dialogue I was absolutely hooked.  I have seen it at least twenty times and the witty dialogue and rapport of the characters gets me every time.  The music accents the film beautifully. The cinematography is gorgeous.  But the story is what really matters. Four guys finding there way in a place where they feel little hope for the future one a dreamer whose dreams are crushed but he finds the spirit to pick up and start dreaming again.  Delightful all the way around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you remember that time in your life when you were no longer a teenager but not yet an adult? That time in your life when for the very first time you had to begin to make decisions that could affect the outcome of your life. There is no movie that captures this time the transition from teenager to adulthood quite as well as Peter Yates' superb film Breaking Away.The story takes place in Bloomington Indiana  home to Indiana University one of the bigger college towns in America. It concerns the rivalry between the rich snobbish college kids and the local townies called cutters because there fathers cut limestone in the local quarries to build the college among other things. The cutters are played superbly by Dennis Christopher Dennis Quaid Daniel Stern and Jackie Earle Haley. There is not a false note in any of their performances with Quaid and Christopher special standouts. It is interesting to note that of the four only Quaid and Stern went on to bigger and better things.What really carries this movie though are the universal themes that everyone can relate to. We can all relate to at least one of the stars everyone has gone through what they are going through. Most people realize it as one of the more difficult times in their life as it is for the characters portrayed in the movie. What carries them through is their friendship with one another and the support that that gives them. The movie also touches upon family and how hard it is sometimes to communicate with parents who always hopefully love but sometimes just don't understand. Special mention must be made of Paul Dooley who plays the father of Dennis Christopher how he did not receive an oscar nomination much less win the coveted statue for his performance remains a mystery to this day. Barbara Barrie is also excellent as the mother.The story follows the cutters as they try to prove to the college kids that they are real human beings not outcasts to be looked down upon. As one of the cutters is a champion bike rider the climax of the film and the contest to prove their worthiness comes down to the Little 500 Bike Race. This is an annual bike race that is still held at IU and is one of the seminal sporting events of the college year the screenwriter Steve Tesich who won an oscar for his screenplay actually won the Little 500. It is the perfect ending for this remarkable and uplifting film.Praise must be given to everyone involved with the production there is not a false note throughout the movie. Peter Yates did a superb job of taking relatively unknown actors coupled with tough subject matter and turning it into a minor classic.".

	schema:headline " Getting it figured out is like a bicycle race";
	schema:reviewBody "In a bicycle race breaking away describes the oftendesperate solo move a rider makes in a bid to win the race.  Most riders are bunched together for shared protection against the wind and to keep an eye on their rivalsa group is always more efficient than an individual.  But in moments of confusion a single rider might just get a jump on the group and with superhuman effort beat the odds against going it alone and emerge victorious. In Breaking Away we follow the exploits of four misfits just out of high school who contentedly contemplate a future as deadenders.  They aren't particularly smart athletic or goodlooking and they lack any sense of direction in their lives.  Moreover as townies or cutters in a college town they wear a spell of invisibility in their dealings with the studentsthe differences are painfully obvious.  When they hang out on campus or lamely try to chat up the coeds they might as well be ghosts haunting a town they used to inhabit.  Something happened when they graduated from high school and didn't go on to college  they became cutters no better than servants in their own confused eyes.  When we meet Dave Stoller Dennis Christopher we think here's a guy who might be able to break out of his own rut.  He seems to be a kid with a little more on the ball than the others.  But then we see that he's also the most confusedby far.  Dave is wrapped up in a fantasy world where he's an Italian bike racer a champion of a sport virtually unknown in America at the time.  That Dave's charming misfits of friends take him and his delusions in stride shows us the bond of their friendship and shared misery and just how far off the map they've all slid.After a chance encounter with a beautiful sorority girl Robyn Douglass Dave pretends to be an Italian exchange student in an effort to woo a girl he believes would otherwise be way out of his reach.  He draws on his obsessive knowledge of Italian culture and his own quirky charm to fool the girl into seeing him as someone fresh and new an outsider but not a misfit.  The romance seems to be going somewhere and Dave feels he's finally breaking away.While Dave is conducting his fraudulent personal life he also has an opportunity to race with the Italian bike racers he had worshiped from afar. It's his chance to get recognition from the masters of the sport.  He may not have much going as a cutter but he's certain the Italians will see his racing ability and welcome him as one of their own.  But when he shows that he can keep up with them in the race naively hoping for their approval they throw him into a ditch.  Dave's fantasy world comes crashing down.When Dave realizes that the Italians will fight to protect their turf just as much as the Americans he resents his first reaction is to give upeverybody cheats he says resignedly.  And he rejects the friends who had looked to him for something morehis three chums and their own struggles and the sorority girl who had seen in him something special.Only Dave can save Dave but it is his father's hard words that prompt him into action.  To Dave and his friends a cutter is someone who doesn't measure up to the college kids who are going somewhere in their lives.  They affect being misfits because a misfit is one rung on the ladder above how they see themselves which is as losers.  But Dave's father points out that cutters were the original stonecutters who built the grand buildings on the campus.  They may not be collegeeducated Dave's father says but to them cutter is a badge of honor for the hardworking men who built something real out of the flat earth.  Dave will never be a cutter he says meaning a man of accomplishment unless he finds something equally real to do with his own life.The Indiana Little 500 is a bike race the university holds that is taken very seriously by the groups that participate.  At the time it was the largest race in America and fraternities counted some of the best American bike racers on their squads.  But to Dave and his friends who are invited to race it is a chance to prove to the students and themselves that their lives so far weren't just wasted time.Yes Dave is a gifted bike racer but we already knew that.  But the Little 500 and life requires that one rely upon not just inner strength but the creative use of the strengths of others.  It is a team race.  What Dave learns when testing himself against these college students that he never felt would give him the time of day is that the biggest obstacle to his own success was himself.  Breaking Away  is a rich visual tapestry of life lived outside the spotlight.  The characters are not fancy or sophisticated and their life goals are simple and well within reach.  It is themselves they struggle with and their perceptions of themselves.  Breaking Away is the story of kids who had let their own selfimage degrade to the point that a fantasy world and a life of bitter resentment seemed like their best option.".

	schema:headline " When the bitterness of disillusion gives victory its sweetest taste ...";
	schema:reviewBody "If there was one film I've been dying to watch for many years it is the fifth Best Picture nominee of 1979 the 8th most inspiring American movie from AFI's Top 100 the 8th sports movie from AFI's Top 10 the gem that has been impossible to find in my usual DVD stores Breaking Away. The first of the many satisfactions the film provided me was the magical moment where I finally found it and God I wasn't disappointed.Breaking Away opens in a small town of Indiana with four friends and as many personalities to identify with. Mike Dennis Quaid is a former athlete venting the bitterness of unfulfilled athletic dreams on local college' upperclass students. Moocher Jackie Earle Haley is hungup on his height trying to repress his insecurity while enduring derogatory nicknames every day. Cyril Daniel Stern a tall and lanky former basketball player and guitar apprentice cares as much about his future as his own father cared about him. And surprisingly Dave Dennis Christopher the central protagonist is the most upbeat of the bunch.Breaking Away is one of these miracles that only the New Hollywood era could provide something that cuts straight to your heart without you even noticing it. It carries the authentic realism of its Best Picture conominee Norma Rae with a more heartwarming effect you smile laugh and embrace the friendship between these boys who don't know what to do with their posthighschool future and keep reinventing the world when they go swimming in the abandoned waterfilled quarry. And there is something in Peter Yates' directing that invites the viewer to seize the present with enthusiasm.And the enthusiasm is embodied by one of the most engaging and lovable characters I've seen in a long time. Dave is so obsessed with the Italian cycling team he translated it in his own life.

The portrayal of Dave's parents is far from the stereotypical detachment the mother Oscarnominated Barbara Barries cares too much while the father believes a 19year old shaving his legs listening to opera must have some serious issues  While watching Dooley I kept wondering what happened to his Oscar nomination he's hilarious to a Walter Matthaulevel.The story goes on Moocher gets a job but finally leaves it after one 'shorty' too many Mike keeps clashing and competing with the rich college boys who call him 'cutter' a reference to the workingclass that built the college and Cyril is the eternal victim of his helpful nature. Drama always works as a misleading safeguard. Many times you expect an accident to happen in the quarry during a fight but Dave's excitement to compete against the Italian team in a local sporting event makes us lower our guard. Amazingly Dave isn't your typical bleak and disenchanted underdog hero his cheerful attitude towers over his friends' struggles as we would all love to do with ours.And in one of the film's most exhilarating sequences he follows a semitruck in a freeway with the perfect music in the background Barber of Seville's Overture. Dave grabs our heart like Opera our feelings it's so genuine that many stereotypical situations work like serenading Katherine the girl he loves or courting her with an Italian accent we believe Catherina would fall for it because we would too.

Big deal!

Dave finally races with the Italians he approaches them with an insolent ease speak Italian with them but they're obviously irked by that local clown and finally the very team he admired jams a tire pump under his wheel and make him crash and at that moment we witness with shock the collapse of Dave's dreams. The sparkle disappears with the Italian posters he talks normally again asks his father for help and finds him he embraces his friends' mood and feels like a loser naturally he tells the truth to his girlfriend.As painful as the fall was I felt a deliverance to see him act normally to become himself again.

The final victory doesn't surprise us because the real victory is over our demons it's not just winning but winning by being true to yourself. That's the kind of stuff great stories are made on and it earned Breaking Away a welldeserved award for Best Original Screenplay.As a screenwriter myself I was fascinated by the film's narrative and the way it rode back and forth from comedy to poignant drama as a screenwriter it reminded me how happy I was to work with an author putting all my sweat and blood into a sixmonth promising project before he would dismiss me after receiving the first draft. I felt cheated exactly like Dave felt when he was kicked off his bike. But you know what they say about what doesn't kill you.".

	onyx:emotionText "If there was one film I've been dying to watch for many years it is the fifth Best Picture nominee of 1979 the 8th most inspiring American movie from AFI's Top 100 the 8th sports movie from AFI's Top 10 the gem that has been impossible to find in my usual DVD stores Breaking Away. The first of the many satisfactions the film provided me was the magical moment where I finally found it and God I wasn't disappointed.Breaking Away opens in a small town of Indiana with four friends and as many personalities to identify with. Mike Dennis Quaid is a former athlete venting the bitterness of unfulfilled athletic dreams on local college' upperclass students. Moocher Jackie Earle Haley is hungup on his height trying to repress his insecurity while enduring derogatory nicknames every day. Cyril Daniel Stern a tall and lanky former basketball player and guitar apprentice cares as much about his future as his own father cared about him. And surprisingly Dave Dennis Christopher the central protagonist is the most upbeat of the bunch.Breaking Away is one of these miracles that only the New Hollywood era could provide something that cuts straight to your heart without you even noticing it. It carries the authentic realism of its Best Picture conominee Norma Rae with a more heartwarming effect you smile laugh and embrace the friendship between these boys who don't know what to do with their posthighschool future and keep reinventing the world when they go swimming in the abandoned waterfilled quarry. And there is something in Peter Yates' directing that invites the viewer to seize the present with enthusiasm.And the enthusiasm is embodied by one of the most engaging and lovable characters I've seen in a long time. Dave is so obsessed with the Italian cycling team he translated it in his own life. He talks and sings in Italian and in English with Italian accent infuriating his Dad Peter Dooley who must endure food ending with 'ini' all the time instead of something American like French Fries. The portrayal of Dave's parents is far from the stereotypical detachment the mother Oscarnominated Barbara Barries cares too much while the father believes a 19year old shaving his legs listening to opera must have some serious issues  While watching Dooley I kept wondering what happened to his Oscar nomination he's hilarious to a Walter Matthaulevel.The story goes on Moocher gets a job but finally leaves it after one 'shorty' too many Mike keeps clashing and competing with the rich college boys who call him 'cutter' a reference to the workingclass that built the college and Cyril is the eternal victim of his helpful nature.

	schema:headline " Breaking Away is my Willoughby.";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this on the big screen here in Tokyo July 2012. I hadn't seen it for years going back decades probably. I saw it originally when it came out as I was only a couple of years junior to those portrayed on the screen. Like others have mentioned the acting was superb and true to life. Not one second on screen do you feel anyone is acting. Dennis Christopher as lead character David Stoller is really a joy to behold. His enthusiasm is never forced or fake. He pulls it off beautifully. And Dennis Quaid's Mike character is probably all too common in this world of high school stars peaking with graduation. His story is quietly repeated among so many who saw their best years in high school only to watch others get the longer lasting glory. The speeches he gives are poignant deep and yet perfectly fitting of his character. He does a wonderful job of showing the frustration of change. Daniel Stern's Cyril is perfect as the more comical of the bunch  simply perfect casting. Some of his lines are just priceless. And Jack Earl Haley and 'Moocher' looks like so many of us looked like back then me included though I wasn't short. Long straggly hair t shirt jeans and stringbean skinny. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie were wonderful. As were the brief shots of others at the Little 500. I can only imagine they were locals hired as extras. Hart Bochner Lloyd's son did a fine job as the snob jock. Gotta admit they didn't come better looking than that back then. I sometimes wonder if Paul McTiernan didn't intentionally subject Hart to that somewhat comical but deadly ending in Die Hard out of payback for being such a jerk in Breaking Away.Katherina played by Robyn Douglass was wonderful. She had that perfect look of girls you would just die for back then. She even resembled a girl me and my pals were all in love with back in Chatham Township high school. I loved her scenes and her moment when she finds out the truth. Really jolts you out of your seat. Choked me up. Watching this film really made me aware of how we've changed not just in our clothing or hair styles but in our entire lives. Everything is brandname now everyone is so conscious of who made the object they desire and how much it cost. The more expensive the better. Everything is new and shiny. Every single element in a movie is examined from eyeglasses to shoes to pens. Everything is measured for its affluence and brand quality. Back then we had Schwinns Huffys Raleighs even Sears and whatever else we could afford. We wore clothes just like those kids in the movie wore T shirts old jeans cutoffs in summer and ripped up sneakers. We had fishing holes or swimming holes and spent enormous amounts of time riding bikes or just laying in the grass or on rocks in the sun or up in some tree house just thinking or talking or planning out the universe... and also about girls which none of us had actually had any meaningful contact with yet. A magical time in a boy's life. Reminds me of the time we discovered an old playboy in the woods under a fallen tree. It was a huge deal with us at the time. We'd hide it back under the tree trunk wrapped in some plastic and go back to it when we were back there. Nowadays the most descriptive and graphic porn that even Ripley wouldn't believe is simply a click away 247. It's a different world indeed. Ironically as a side note the Playboy issue we found out years later was the one that highlighted the illfated Dorothy Stratton.Nowadays can you imagine anyone especially a 19 year old kid sitting still out in nature or anywhere else for that matter for even ten seconds without whipping out a smartphone or some other gadget? Or being seen not having just the right clothes just the right Nikes or Adidas sneakers? We had converse back then and they were the cheap sneakers. It's just sad that such a time in life is gone forever not just in the styles which were yes sloppy an unkempt but in the way kids lived. It's an entirely different world today and I wouldn't trade my childhood in the 70s and early 80s with any kid today for all the money in the world. I sat through the film twice loving it so much and knowing I'd probably never get a chance to see it on the big screen again. Watching it with tears in my eyes I really felt such an urge that if I could have I would've climbed into that screen in a second to go back to that time once again that is never more. Just like Willoughby must've been to Rod Serling.".

	schema:headline " Endearing hero fabulous music heartwarming coming of age film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my absolute favourite coming of age movie! It has an endearing teenage hero an engaging story a touching theme an amazing musical score and an abundance of humour. The story revolves around Dave Stoller and his three buddies four misfits who have just graduated from high school. Dave recently received a bicycle as a gift has become a good racer locally and his heroes are the Italian Cinzano racing team. To the consternation of some his life begins to revolve around his dreams of becoming a racing champion to the extent that he basically tries to turn himself into an Italian. He learns the language absorbs the culture listens to its operas and gives his cat an Italian name Fellini! He even pretends to be an Italian exchange student in order to impress a pretty sorority girl named Katherine whom he calls Caterina and feels would otherwise be beyond his reach.Dave makes an appealing hero wonderfully portrayed by Dennis Christopher vulnerable but with an amazing joie de vivre. His hilarious attempts at becoming Italian for example shaving his legs like their men but not their women proved one of the highlights of the movie. The scene where he serenades his Caterina at her sorority house has to be one of the most charming in all filmdom. I was also bowled over by his endearing enthusiasm when he discovers The Italians are coming! that his racing heroes will soon be arriving in his hometown of Bloomington Indiana where the entire tale is set culminating in the Indiana Little 500 cycling race.Dave is a kid who doesn't think he is good enough for college lives in a fantasy world of Italian cycling and wants to break away from his own aimless mundane life. This is a typical coming of age movie in that he learns a lot about himself and the realities of life especially from the behaviour of his heroes the Cinzano racing team. His three sidekicks are a sympathetic bunch  the rebellious angry Mike the short feisty Moocher and the goofy appealing Cyril who seems to have no family. Through competing against the college crowd in the Little 500 they learn lessons in self esteem and team spirit believing in yourself and striving toward reachable goals.Breaking Away is a movie with obvious social class themes. Dave and his friends are townies called Cutters named for the stonecutters from the town's quarries. The students at the nearby college campus look down their noses at these Cutters. However Dave's father who is a car salesman lacking a college education himself teaches his son to take pride in the name that it was stonecutters who built these impressive college buildings.The film is refreshingly unusual in having a major sympathetic role played by Dave's parents. I absolutely loved the father portrayed by Paul Dooley the source of much of the film's humour announcing for example that he doesn't want anything in his house that ends with 'ini'! Mr. Stoller despairs of his son's Italian phase fearing verbally that Dave is going to wind up an Italian bum! Both the marital relationship between Dave's parents and the bond between father and son are captured with poignancy as well as humour.When I first saw this movie after its original release the thing that remained with me besides the charming joie de vivre of its hero was the wonderful Italian music from Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony and a Rossini opera. This musical score provides magnificent accompaniment to the bicycle racing sequences especially one in which Dave is racing the Cinzano truck on a highway heading toward Bloomington! This is a heartwarming movie that no one should miss. It may be almost thirty years old but its characters and story are as engaging as the day it was released. I won't give it away but that last scene is priceless!".

	schema:reviewBody "Isn't it great when you find a movie that you'll plan to watch for the rest of your life? I knew it a long time ago. Dennis Christopher was strong in his performance especially the parts where he talks with his father about whether or not he should go to college. When I was a kid and watched this for the first time I knew it was going to be my favorite. I soon became obsessed with cycling as well and managed to enter one of those races and win second place! I love the screenplay which definitely deserved the Oscar it won and the chemistry between all the characters is undeniable. It really makes you believe that they all are good friends. My favorite part is when Dave says Everybody cheats I just didn't know. and as a 13 year old believe me that was really philosophical. If you want to watch a movie that will really blow you away or help you remember what it was like to be a kid this is the movie for you. All the actors were amazing and you find yourself relating to a lot of the problems they face. I even wish I saw it much sooner because after I saw it my entire look on life changed. It's a real masterpiece!".

	onyx:emotionText "Isn't it great when you find a movie that you'll plan to watch for the rest of your life? I knew it a long time ago. Dennis Christopher was strong in his performance especially the parts where he talks with his father about whether or not he should go to college. When I was a kid and watched this for the first time I knew it was going to be my favorite. I soon became obsessed with cycling as well and managed to enter one of those races and win second place! I love the screenplay which definitely deserved the Oscar it won and the chemistry between all the characters is undeniable. It really makes you believe that they all are good friends.

	schema:headline " A classic that is 32 years young";
	schema:reviewBody "We now have more than a decade of reviews on IMDb of Breaking Away going back to 1998 enough to conclude as do many of the reviewers that this is a classic that has passed the test of time. I would dare say that there will be viewers watching and loving this film 10 20 50 100 years from now. Its theme and message transcend time.Breaking Away was popular when it came out. It was mentioned in three different college classes within the context of the professor's lecture to illustrate a point. So don't underestimate the depth of concept of this film. It effortlessly works on many different levels and different people see different things in it. You need to watch it carefully more than once to appreciate this. But it has become somewhat forgotten a sleeper. However tears come to my eyes when I think about one of the key messages explained by the father after Dave's encounter with the Italian team. It has proved all too true with the result that the America of 1979 is crumbling around us. In short if you haven't seen this movie watch it. If you don't own it buy it because you will want to watch it again perhaps even 10 or 20 years from now. I've been watching it now and then for more than 30 years.Jackie Earle Haley who plays Moocher was also in Bad News Bears the original with Walter Matthau. He has some pretty funny lines.  On a bicycling note I happened to find a mint condition Ciocc Itallian racing bicycle from around this period with full Campagnola components and sew on tires. It was a dream to ride far more agile yet stable than my other expensive road bikes. I can see why Dave developed a love affair with his bike. What I learned is that a wellmaintained drive train is nearly silent at least using modern dry lube. Yet in the movie you can always hear the chain and gears grinding away especially in the group scene with the Italians. It makes me wonder if bikes back then were really so noisy. Or whether the director or foley man thought too much silence would seem unrealistic to viewers used to cheap bikes so they added in gear noise.Also it becomes amusingly apparent on close viewing that Dave is in a very low gear moving slowly pumping and huffing away when he appears to be tearing down the road. But most people don't notice this. The bottom line is this movie often inspires an impulse to get a road bike and this is a good thing if you have some relatively quiet roads to go long distances like Dave. On terrain like in the movie many people could ride 50 or more miles in a day once you get into condition but with a road or comfort bike not a mountain bike. It's a great form of recreation. Go for it!".

Peter Yates does a wonderful job directing the pace never lags all the characters are credible and I'll be honest this film does have an impact on me emotionally.

Although the lead Wasn't Italian his desire to be was humorous and brought haunting familiarity to the film for us.That however is not why I have been a HUGE fan of this movie for the last 26 years. The characters are... They are portrayed by the actors with such intense realism that to deny this films significance to every single person who comes from a blue collar background in a somewhat large city would be ludicrous.I dare anyone from a working class family who was coming of age in the late 70s and early 80s to deny this films relevance. I knew every single one of these characters personally growing up from the used car salesman father to the Marlboro smoking muscle car abusing bad ass. From the quiet yet forceful mother to the tall skinny goofball ceral...Moocher to Dave I knew them all every single one of them residing in or near my neighborhood.This film touched our hearts. It spoke of the emotional struggles we went through as children and adults being in a blue collar world. The fantastic part? It did this with humor a sense of friendshipregardless of how dysfunctional and an innocence on the brink of realization. Just the way it was. We cheered loudly at the end of this movie as we ate our goobers and popcorn then sighed silently as we left the theater squinting to take the city bus home...".

	schema:headline " Classic comingofage film";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning Minor spoilers cometh. I first saw this movie in a theatre right after it came out in the fall of 1979. I was like 11years old and trying get into a Saturday night showing of Apocalypse Now with a few other friends during a bday outing.That night I still remember quite vividly 24years later the cashier at the Golf Mill Theatre in Niles Illinois a suburb of Chicago was being a total wench and wouldn't let us  a bunch of wellgroomed freshfaced albeit unaccompanied 11year olds  into an Rrated flick. So the only other option playing that night was Breaking Away which we reluctantly decided to see instead. Being the very last ones in the theater we were seated frontandcenter in the very first row  just feet from the bottom of the screen. And although we spent the entire two hours of the movie with our eyes skyward and our necks bent at an obtuse angle in order to see this movie Breaking Away proved to be one of the best comingofage movies that I have ever seen. Anyways it was great watching this movie in a theatre. During the entire showing we laughed we yelled we screamed we snickered we guffawed we threw popcorn at the screen  we did it all. And when Dave played by Dennis Christopher brought the Cutter Team home in the last lap of the Little500 Bicycle Race we cheered  boy did we cheer  along with the rest of the theatre. Those were the days and this film is now one of my top10 feelgood flicks of all time. Side note About two years after the film came out I happened to bump into the inimitable Robyn Douglass who played the hot coed KatherineCaterina at a sporting goods store in downtown Wilmette Illinois. I wanted to say something to her but I couldn't bc I was tonguetied due to my teenage hormones getting the better of me I was 13 at the time. Come to think of it that just about summed up the totality of my teenage existence back then but I digress. Memorable characters in this film were Dennis Quaid as Mike the aging ne'erdowell townie living on his past successes as a highschool football quarterback Daniel Stern as the bucolic wiseacre Cyril in his first cinematic appearance and Jackie Earle Haley as Moocher the volatile clockpunching runt. There was also the unforgettable performance by secondcity veteran and cocreator of the inimitable 1970's children's show The Electric Co. Paul Dooley portraying the disaffected usedcar salesman Raymond  Dave's father. Some of the most memorable scenes in this movie are set to classical scores  especially the fantastic racing scenes. For example my personal favorite is when Dave finds out that Team CinZano is coming to Indianapolis for a big cycling race. He immediately kisses everybody in sight crosses himself and says Santa Maria  even though his family isn't Catholic. He then hops on his racing bike and proceeds straightaways to the outskirts of town where he intercepts the Team CinZano truck how likely is that? on the Interstate passing through town. Dave then goes headtohead with the speeding semitruck until he overtakes it at 60 mph with the oldtimer truck driver egging him on every step of the way as he calls out his speed with hand signals out the window. The entire scene has outstanding longshots of Dave racing a semi on a highway set to Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony No.4 in A major opus 90.The other great racing scene is during Dave's starcrossed participation in the Indianapolis 100 cycling event where Dave fatefully endeavors to strike it up with Team CinZano. The entire race is set to Rossellini's rousing William Tell Overture and is simply riveting  as well as shocking. The funniest scene though is when Dave serenades his pipedream sorority chick Caterina whom he's infatuated with to Flotow's aria M'appari tutt'amor  MAARTHA MARTHA  in front of her Chi Delt sorority house. To die for  especially when he gets the girl and they ride off into the night in the middle of campus albeit with Caterina precariously perched atop the handlebars of his tenspeed. Incidentlally of all the Breaking Away cast members Dooley and Quaid had the most prolific and successful careers afterwards. Dooley would go on to play Molly Ringwald's goofball dad 7years later in Sixteen Candles and Dennis Quaid of course has been in everything from The Right Stuff to DOA to InnerSpace to The Rookie. Sidebar I graduated from a landgrant state university myself that was virtually identical to I.U. Bloomington  complete with townies and everything. I did a lot a cycling at the time and every time I did I couldn't help but feeling exactly like Dave Stoller. Hat's off to a primo nummero uno comingofage flick!".

Come to think of it that just about summed up the totality of my teenage existence back then but I digress. Memorable characters in this film were Dennis Quaid as Mike the aging ne'erdowell townie living on his past successes as a highschool football quarterback Daniel Stern as the bucolic wiseacre Cyril in his first cinematic appearance and Jackie Earle Haley as Moocher the volatile clockpunching runt. There was also the unforgettable performance by secondcity veteran and cocreator of the inimitable 1970's children's show The Electric Co. Paul Dooley portraying the disaffected usedcar salesman Raymond  Dave's father. Some of the most memorable scenes in this movie are set to classical scores  especially the fantastic racing scenes. For example my personal favorite is when Dave finds out that Team CinZano is coming to Indianapolis for a big cycling race. He immediately kisses everybody in sight crosses himself and says Santa Maria  even though his family isn't Catholic. He then hops on his racing bike and proceeds straightaways to the outskirts of town where he intercepts the Team CinZano truck how likely is that? on the Interstate passing through town. Dave then goes headtohead with the speeding semitruck until he overtakes it at 60 mph with the oldtimer truck driver egging him on every step of the way as he calls out his speed with hand signals out the window. The entire scene has outstanding longshots of Dave racing a semi on a highway set to Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony No.4 in A major opus 90.The other great racing scene is during Dave's starcrossed participation in the Indianapolis 100 cycling event where Dave fatefully endeavors to strike it up with Team CinZano. The entire race is set to Rossellini's rousing William Tell Overture and is simply riveting  as well as shocking. The funniest scene though is when Dave serenades his pipedream sorority chick Caterina whom he's infatuated with to Flotow's aria M'appari tutt'amor  MAARTHA MARTHA  in front of her Chi Delt sorority house. To die for  especially when he gets the girl and they ride off into the night in the middle of campus albeit with Caterina precariously perched atop the handlebars of his tenspeed. Incidentlally of all the Breaking Away cast members Dooley and Quaid had the most prolific and successful careers afterwards. Dooley would go on to play Molly Ringwald's goofball dad 7years later in Sixteen Candles and Dennis Quaid of course has been in everything from The Right Stuff to DOA to InnerSpace to The Rookie. Sidebar I graduated from a landgrant state university myself that was virtually identical to I.U. Bloomington  complete with townies and everything. I did a lot a cycling at the time and every time I did I couldn't help but feeling exactly like Dave Stoller. Hat's off to a primo nummero uno comingofage flick!";

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite genres of movies is sports movies. Usually there is drama comedy and often surprising results. For me Breaking Away is certainly one of my top ten favorite sports movies and quite possibly on my top five list.Breaking Away is a story about a teenage cyclist growing up in Bloomington Indiana. Somehow he has become obsessed with the Italian cycling team. And whether his motivation is a unique way to meet young coeds at Indiana University or something else he is an incredible cyclist.The fun part of this movie is his interaction with his mother Evelyn Stoller who seems very understanding about his Italian cultural ways and his father Ray Stoller who doesn't understand why his son thinks he's Italian. Give credit to writer Steve Tesich whose script takes viewers on a humorous and believable adventure in this wonderful smallbudget movie.Add in three friends who just graduated from high school and this story is a fascinating jaunt with coming of age. Dennis Quaid plays a former high school quarterback Jackie Earle Haley plays the short and defensive Moocher and Daniel Stern plays Cyril a student whose father likes to encourage him when he fails. Each of the supporting actors does a great job in helping to convey the story but you can really see Daniel Stern's strength in comic acting in his first major movie role.The sports rivalry is actually established by the city kids called Cutters competing for dates against the college male students. Eventually the two rival groups compete against each other in a bike race called the Little 500. But honestly the joy in this movie is the journey with all of the characters in the Peter Yates directed movie.As in life there is humor and sadness friends and family rivals and conflict brought out on the big screen. This movie was surprisingly good the first time I saw it and still enjoyable 30 years after its release. How good is Breaking Away? It won an Oscar in 1980 for Best Writing Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen with Steven Tesich doing a tremendous job in wordsmithing the script. The movie also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actress Barbara Barrie and Best Music Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score Patrick Williams.Perhaps my best recommendation for Breaking Away is that I consider it better than that other famous Indiana sports movie about High School basketball. That's probably a minority view but if you haven't seen Breaking Away you have missed a jewel of a movie.".

First it is not a vampire film in the vein of Bram Stoker's Dracula or Interview with the Vampire. It is an iconoclastic love story similar to the nonvampire film Eye of the Beholder. Love cannot be explained obsession cannot be understood for both must be felt in the heart. This personal film Immortality is filled with ideas and themes many of which are conveyed in allegories. Jude Law and Elina Lwensohn are eating takeout Chinese food. She begins telling him a Confucian tale about the difference between heaven and hell. There is ample food in both dominions. Yet the only implements you are allowed to use are 5 foot chopsticks. Those in hell starve those in heaven are wellfed. How is this so? The souls in heaven cooperate by feeding one another while those in hell being selfish go hungry. Yes love is about giving and this is the dilemma of the film. Jude Law needs blood to continue his existence. Elina Lwensohn needs Jude because he unlike most men is her protector intellectual equal and I know it sounds silly soul mate.The DVD release of this movie is fascinating. The special effects do not overwhelm you. For instance there is no shapeshifting or gory feeding orgy. Yet the cinematography is unforgettable. There are twisted bonespinal fragments that are about the size of 3inch pretzel sticks. Possibly they have a reptilian ancestry. Jude has a box of these collected from his earlier victims all women?. Jude's coffin is not a coffin but a circular metal chamber with swivel doors. He straps himself with electrical medical devices to maintain his heartbeat and respiration. They even wake him from his sleep. His regular bed is covered in a silver cloth. On the mattress are blood stains from his previous victims. This is never shown. It is left to the viewer's imagination. The only way you know this exists is from Elina's reaction to Jude uncovering the bed. How horrifying this vision must have been to her. Another interesting aspect of this film is a scene Jude has with a little girl. She appears to be having her kidney stones disintegrated by an ultrasound device. Thus Jude is most likely a gastroenterologist. Elina is a structural engineer. Two competent intelligent literate people in the 20th century. How shocking given the abundant number of films about stupid people in typical Hollywood schlock. Miramax should be commended for importing this film to the US. Pochih Leong d and Paul Hoffman w should be praised for bringing this wonderful story to the screen.".

The plot isn't overly original but when you look at some of the details it's obviously well thought out. I loved most of the dialogue witty to the point and original. No fake grandeur or excessive posing like many vampire movies do have subtle jokes and no giveaways by the characters.The movie is a good one overall but even on its strong points it sometimes misses genius and excellence so only a 7 for this one.".

This is fully represented through the whole of the films strata for example when a fight breaks out involving local thugs we are not treated to a slowmotion fest set to some industrial metal or matrixlike techno but a realistic scrap with a weird white noise sound crossed with choral singing musical accompaniment.The film is also successful in some small touches that make it worth rewatching. Some little things that seem normal on a first viewing that take up perhaps a second are seen in a different way on repeat viewings.

PoChih Leong did an excellent job of directing a film which kept me a vampire movie enthusiast glued to my seat.He didn't use the typical dark gloomy setting per typical vamp movies neither did he restrict hi vampire character to the typical stereotypes of common vampire movies. This vampire could be out in the sunlight see his reflection yaddayaddayadda. The only thing that holds to the truth is he must drink blood. He is caring sensitive and above even his thirst all he is searching for is love.The plot of this movie was outstanding. The dialog made me think of having everyday conversations. Jude Law was an excellent pick for the main character. I give this movie a 10 based on it's originality and new look at vampires. It can be a bit slow at parts but over all an outstanding movie.".

The thing that surprised me with this movie was that it was a complete dramaromance with suspense and thriller elements in it but in NO way is it a horror or vampire movie. This delighted me because I am getting very tired of the formulaic vampire flicks Dracula 2000 John Carpenter's Vampires.

	schema:headline " A dark and brooding thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wisdom of Crocodiles is one of a new breed of vampire movies. Probably started by Abel Ferrera's The Addiction vampirism has turned into a sort of curse that turns it's afflicted into brooding philosophers. Gone are the vampire bats wooden stakes and crucifixes that once were the staples of the genre and the vampire genre has been changed into a commentary on disease. However I'm all for innovation even if it's not always advisable innovation and The Wisdom of Crocodiles is one of the better 'new wave' vampire films. It actually seems to be taking more influence from George Romero's excellent 'Martin' than 'The Addiction' anyway. The Wisdom of Crocodiles great name by the way stars Jude Law in a tight performance as a man afflicted with some sort of curse that forces him to suck the blood of women while in the act of lovemaking. To say any more than that would mean spoiling it so I'll leave it there.The Wisdom of Crocodiles has gained itself something of a cult following and the channel I saw it on even introduced it as a 'cult classic'. I think this is an incorrect description of the film as although it's not bad and certainly has it's moments it hardly has the same qualities as true cult masterpieces such as the aforementioned 'Martin'. The film benefits from a brooding atmosphere that is created by a brooding musical score that plays through almost the entire running time. This never gets annoying however as the music is good and almost always adds to the images seen on screen. The film is slowly plotted which might annoy some people and it's littered with philosophical ideas that Jude Law utters for a lot of the running time. This will probably irritate people that tuned in expecting a vampire movie especially as there's little bloodletting but some of the ideas put forward are fairly interesting and keep the film alive.This film shouldn't really be in with the classic vampire films at all as it's a completely different animal I suppose they couldn't really put it in with 'brooding cursed people' though. Vampire fans should take note of this but even without the classic vampire thrills there is much to like about this British chiller.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Wisdom of Crocodiles is one of a new breed of vampire movies. Probably started by Abel Ferrera's The Addiction vampirism has turned into a sort of curse that turns it's afflicted into brooding philosophers. Gone are the vampire bats wooden stakes and crucifixes that once were the staples of the genre and the vampire genre has been changed into a commentary on disease. However I'm all for innovation even if it's not always advisable innovation and The Wisdom of Crocodiles is one of the better 'new wave' vampire films. It actually seems to be taking more influence from George Romero's excellent 'Martin' than 'The Addiction' anyway. The Wisdom of Crocodiles great name by the way stars Jude Law in a tight performance as a man afflicted with some sort of curse that forces him to suck the blood of women while in the act of lovemaking. To say any more than that would mean spoiling it so I'll leave it there.The Wisdom of Crocodiles has gained itself something of a cult following and the channel I saw it on even introduced it as a 'cult classic'. I think this is an incorrect description of the film as although it's not bad and certainly has it's moments it hardly has the same qualities as true cult masterpieces such as the aforementioned 'Martin'. The film benefits from a brooding atmosphere that is created by a brooding musical score that plays through almost the entire running time. This never gets annoying however as the music is good and almost always adds to the images seen on screen. The film is slowly plotted which might annoy some people and it's littered with philosophical ideas that Jude Law utters for a lot of the running time.

But his befriending her in a sense is a way of gaining her trust until she completely gives herself over emotionally..through complete love hopefully but as often as it has been this person wasn't.

He must feed on blood to remain alive and when he disposes of the body in a quicksanded marshland it is unfortunately discovered by fisherman using illegal netting.

It made the theme of the movie so real compared to like movies. The acting kept me glued to the movie and it was not predictable. Also the way the vampire became redeemed was very genuine. The behavior was not scary. It was true to life. My only wish is that the movie was longer than an hour and 39 minutes. I give the movie 7 stars.";

I enjoyed the tales that Anna the beautiful Elina Lwensohn told and her energy that just seemed to radiate through the screen that was until the end of the film whence her behaviour is incorrigible or stupid rather. I did enjoy the film there is no doubt about that. Having no expectations and the pure shock made the film much more real no intriguing.

Steven does drink the blood of his victims but it is not the blood which sustains him but the emotions of the victim  which show up as chemicals in their blood. He feeds specifically on the love of the victim for him so he must make the women love him before he can kill them.This leads to another twist and the title of the film. He must in part at least love the women also because love cannot be real unless it is shared by two people. Since he must love them before he kills them he ends up killing them with tears in his eyes like the crocodiles of the title. In the end it is this attachment which is his undoing.

Timothy Dunphy is the lovable high school screwup whose father sends him off to boarding school after he is involved in an accident with a parked police cruiser while smoking pot with his loser buddies. He develops an unlikely romantic relationship with the stunningly beautiful Jane Weston Amy Smart at the repressive school while fighting off the disciplinary excesses of the school faculty. This seems like the premise of the kind of ridiculous high school comedies that characterized the 80s Screwballs Ski School etc. but Outside Providence works well because it has heart. Timothy Dunphy is sent off unwillingly to this hellish school and it turns out to be a really eyeopening experience for him. He develops a lot of insight about himself his friends his romantic endeavors and his family. The story is not exactly something that is entirely original but the presentation of the film and the acting are extremely good and the end result is a great comedy. Alec Baldwin delivers a hilarious performance as the emotionally closedoff father regularly referring to his own son as dildo. He steals every scene he is in and he should be particularly noted for his ability to give such a convincing portrayal of an emotionless macho father and still be convincing in the emotionally tense scene between him and Timothy where he describes Tim's late mother. That scene in particular is unexpectedly intense.Outside Providence is a good comedy. It does not resort to tasteless sexual fourthgrade humor to pull it along which is one of the biggest problems with teen comedies lately  American Pie Scary Movie there was no hope for that one from the beginning There's Something About Mary and Road Trip which should have been a great movie. Instead Outside Providence focuses on character development and a good story and tops it all off with a healthy amount of comedy in the form of the cast the characters the script dialogue and pretty much everything else. Probably one of the best elements of this movie is that it is not a relentless comedy. It doesn't grab desperately for a laugh every second of the way but instead it rounds out the content with drama romance skillful comedy as well as good writing directing and acting. Outside Providence is badly underrated and should not be missed.".

	schema:headline " Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers Deliver";
	schema:reviewBody "The ambiguity of youth and the road to maturity are addressed in a somewhat stoically humorous manner by the Farrelly Brothers in the comedy Outside Providence' directed by Michael Corrente.  Set in New England in 1974 the story centers on Tim Dunphy Shawn Hatosy an irresponsible seventeenyearold who since the untimely death of his mother has lived with his gruff bluecollar father Alec Baldwin his crippled younger brother Jackie Tommy Bone and a oneeyed threelegged dog.  Life is less than idyllic for Tim but it doesn't seem to make much difference as long as he can live in the moment and get high with his friends.  In that respect in fact life is pretty good.  Tim's a senior in high school with nary a care in the world until a car accident involving drugs and alcohol lands him in big trouble and he avoids incarceration only by the grace and intervention of one of his father's connected' cronies.  Instead of jail time he is sent away to the prestigious prep school Cornhill whereupon graduation his offense will be expunged from his record.  All he has to do is toe the line and get through his senior year.  But that senior year can last a long time especially after he meets Jane Weston Amy Smart the girl of his and everybody else's dreams.  So what is a lad to do knuckle down follow the rules and put his life in order or follow his heart?  Or as Tim replies when a teacher asks him to name his favorite author Hamlet.'  To be or not to be.  And that is the question.While not terribly original by any means Corrente's film which he cowrote with Bobby and Peter Farrelly adapted from the novel by Peter Farrelly is funny and well presented and has that quirky recognizable Farrelly Brother's touch.  There's even a poignant moment or two and most importantly this isn't a silly' movie and though the characters are fairly stereotypical Corrente manages to give it something of a fresh face and allows the humor to evolve naturally never fishing for laughs or manipulating the situations purely for the sake of hilarity.  And it works well there are some genuinely funny scenes some sidesplitting lines and one signature Farrelly Brothers scene that involves a flashback of the traumatic hazing' of a freshman named Irving Jack Ferver.Shawn Hatosy gives a believable performance as Tim and though he's not overly charismatic or likable he does create a character with whom many peers and parents will be able to relate.  Tim is a very real person feeling his way through a very precarious period of his life.  And beyond the humorous aspects of the film there is actually some very credible character development evident in Tim's behavior and in the final analysis the overall picture not only aspires to a higher level because of it but succeeds in that regard.  Hatosy's Tim is very much the average kid who lives in your neighborhood and works at the local fast food joint while he figuring out what life is all about.  Without anything singular or remarkable about him he is entirely truetolife and honest.As Old Man Dunphy' Baldwin gives a solid performance and with limited screen time manages to establish his character with astute precision. Like Tim Baldwin's character is real and serves as a kind of core for the story and that realism of the characters is one of the strengths of the film.  The Old Man' maintains a gruff exterior a bravura by which to live if you will but you get a sense that there is something deeper to him while at the same time you realize that what you see is very much a true perspective of who he really is as well.  It's a matter of Baldwin's ability as an actor enabling him to infuse some complexity into a character that could easily have been one dimensional in less capable hands.The supporting cast includes Jon Abrahams Drugs Delaney Richard Jenkins Barney George Wendt Joey Adam LaVorgna Tommy the Wire Timothy Crowe Mr. Funderbeck George Martin Dean Mort Gabriel Mann Jack and Kristen Shorten Bunny Cote.  In a market veritably saturated for some time with comedies about teen angst most of which are silly insignificant devoid of real humor and not worth the film they're printed on with Outside Providence' Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers have to be given credit for delivering one that is truly funny while at the same time anchored in reality.  There is in fact more here than meets the eye upon the initial viewing.  Not only does it capture the essence of the era in which it takes place but a sense of reality that in the end is definitive of it as well. And it's done with humor and without taking it over the edge as the Farrelly Brothers are often wont to do.  Ultimately it's a satisfying experience and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

It sounds like a fairly redundant storyline but the emotional underpinnings and underlying angst of the young characters are subtly yet powerfully displayed.  910.".

It follows the mis adventures of a 1970's era RI kid who runs afoul of the law and is sent to a stuffy boarding school. It sounds like a fairly redundant storyline but the emotional underpinnings and underlying angst of the young characters are subtly yet powerfully displayed.  910.";

Their criteria for deciding revolve around the potential quality and quantity of drugs and sex.  Dunphy lives with his dad Alex Balwin and his younger brother Tommy Bone.  Dunphy gets in trouble. One of his dad's friends is connected and gets Dunphy's jail sentence deferred if he enrolls and successfully completes his senior year of high school at an exclusive prep school.  Dunphy moves from stoned fish in a small pond to fish out of water. His ensuing adventures are predictable but fun.  There is the geeky roommate stoner pals beautiful girl that's out of his league and the Dickensonian schoolmaster.  I enjoyed most every moment.  No scene ever got too melodramatic or silly.  The stoner jokes and other one liners are funny.  Outside Providence plays as a very good 70s comingofage movie.  The writing credits for OP goes to Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers There's Something About Mary Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber.  Given the Farrelly connection I was surprised by the restraint and tenderness of this movie.  Very much worth the rental.".

At first Timothy fights the rigid standards of the place. He doesn't like the atmosphere but he is completely won by a pretty coed Jane Weston a rich girl way out of his league. It's easy to see the combination will see trouble along the way.The best trait about Timothy Dunphy is his honesty that comes into play right after Jane is caught with some boys smoking pot and her ambition to go to Brown University is doubtful. Timothy does the right thing in going to the admissions dean at Brown to speak on behalf of the innocent Jane who didn't bring her fate upon herself.Shawn Hatosy an actor who is always effective no matter what part he is playing makes the most out of his Timothy.

The sound track of the film alone makes the movie worth watching.Any viewer from New England will be amazed to see Foxboro Stadium in the film. I think its safe to say that Outside Providence is the first and only film to shoot a scene at the not so famous stadium where the Patriots play.Overall This was a great film ! Shawn Hatosy hit the Rhode Island accent like it was his second nature. A new comer to the screen a lot of us will remember Shawn from the hit comedy   In and Out.

The film is told from the point of view of Timmothy Dunphy an underachiever whose main goal in life seems to be how much dope he can smoke. His mother committed suicide when he was just a small boy so it is just him his disabled little brother and his father. One night while high on dope Tim smashes his car into a parked cop car! His old man has to bail him out of jail. In an attempt to turn his life around old man Dunphy makes his son cut his hair and forces him to go to a strict boarding school in Connecticut. So here we have a poor kid at a rich prep school. While here he meets a rich smart preppy coed totally the opposite of himself but of course they fall in love! This film has many funny as well as serious parts. During periods without dialog we hear many great rock songs from the 60's and 70's. The film was set in 1974. The 'bad guy' in the film is Mr. Funderberk Timothy Crowethe strict resident adviser or whatever you want to call him. Although a comedy the film does have elements of drama. The scene with Tim talking to his old man about his mother is sad. His girlfriend Jane Amy Smart gets accepted to Brown but she gets accused of something she didn't do so her acceptance gets reversed as a result. Tim goes to Brown University and tries to see the Dean but the secretary told him he was booked the whole day and that he would have to make an appointment. Tim manages to get into the Dean's office through the window. He then proceeds to tell the Dean the truth about Jane.This movie was based on a semiautobiographical novel by Peter Farrelly. The Farrelly brothers are from Rhode Island and many of their movies are filmed there. I wonder how close this film parallels his real teenage years. It would be interesting to read the book.".

	schema:headline " I Was Expecting A Teen Comedy But This Is Much More Than That";
	schema:reviewBody "It turned out that there was a lot more to this movie than I was anticipating when I decided to watch it. I watched it largely on the basis of Alec Baldwin who's a pretty good actor. But at the same time I knew that the basic plot revolved around a kid from the wrong side of the tracks so to speak who gets sent to a snooty prep school after getting in some trouble at home. I figured this would turn out to be a pretty typical teenstyle comedy with the bad kid heading off to the good school and turning it upside down with the movie becoming little more than sex and drugs. It's true that there's a lot of weed in this but much to my surprise there's no sex and not even a hint of nudity. It actually turns out to be a fairly complex study of relationships and commitment and the importance of taking responsibility for your actions.Shawn Hatosy was Tim Dunphy  the kid who gets sent off to this school. We find out early on that he has a troubled home life loyally devoted to his wheelchair bound little brother Jackie Tommy Bone but with a distant relationship with his father who's played by Baldwin and who seems to have time to do little else but play poker with his buddies. As an aside dad's buddies are played by a pretty decent cast of actors including George Wendt and Richard Jenkins. For much of the movie we know nothing about Tim's mother except that she isn't there. When her absence finally gets explained it resolves some of the issues about what's going on between Tim and his dad and perhaps explains his dad's emotional emptiness.The prep school part of the story is also more interesting than expected at first glance. There's some teen clich stuff going on but really less than I expected. Yes as I noted there's a lot of weed smoked over the course of an hour and a half and there's the requisite evil adult character in this case represented by My. Funderburk played by Timothy Crowe but even Funderburke while a bit ridiculous at times is less over the top than most similar characters in teen movies. As I said there's neither sex nor nudity in this but there is a surprisingly well portrayed romance between Tim and Jane played by Amy Smart  a girl from the right side of the tracks. It's one of those unlikely and somewhat unbelievable romances that nevertheless worked in this case and I thought that Hatosy and Smart were good together. Ultimately of course what hijinks there were at the school leads to problems and Tim has to decide whether to take responsibility for his actions or not and the revelation of why Tim's mother is absent even leads ultimately to a sort of warming in the relationship between Tim and his dad.This actually turns out to be a much more interesting movie than one might anticipate. In fact although it's set in a prep school and is at times humorous I wouldn't really call this a teen comedy at all. It's got too much going on for that it raises too many issues to be dismissed as just that. It's surprisingly well done. 710".

I watched it largely on the basis of Alec Baldwin who's a pretty good actor. But at the same time I knew that the basic plot revolved around a kid from the wrong side of the tracks so to speak who gets sent to a snooty prep school after getting in some trouble at home. I figured this would turn out to be a pretty typical teenstyle comedy with the bad kid heading off to the good school and turning it upside down with the movie becoming little more than sex and drugs.

Supposedly Peter Farrelly also went to the same school as I and used it for the movie albeit with a name change.

	schema:reviewBody "In the nineties the Farrelly Brothers were dominating the comedydrama genres with their energetic screwball scenarios for their quirky genial subjects to fall into. From the charming goofiness of There's Something About Mary to their passably dopey Dumb and Dumber the Farrelly's seemed to pitch every possible idea to Miramax and they willingly committed to making it happen. The directors were the studio's biggest moneymaker so as a result we got all different kinds of films from the directors good and bad.And after watching both of the previously mentioned efforts and was met with marginal satisfaction my idea to venture into the Farrelly's lesserknown film Outside Providence which was critically underwhelming and financially disastrous compared to the previous films. The film is simple goodnatured and an easy watch but at no point does this become more than a methodical tiptoe through the woods of clichs.Our main character is Timothy Dildo Dunphy Shawn Hatosy an underachieving high school senior with a strict father Alec Baldwin and a handicapped brother Tommy Bone he treats like a regular person to avoid showing any resemblance of superiority or difference towards him. The small family resides in Pawtucket Road Island and after Timothy and friends crash into a parked police car with marijuana on their person his father tires from his blatant incompetence and sends him to Cornwall Academy a strict prep school in Connecticut.Upon arriving Timothy is placed in the lowerlevel classes and is mocked tormented and left a social pariah with the other more advanced men of the school. He quickly becomes acquainted with Amy Smart's Jane Weston an attractive blonde girl he believes is the nicest prettiest one there. At the same time while being harassed by a number of the kids Timothy finds that Cornwall's dorm master Mr. Funderburk Timothy Crowe is out to get him and continues to devise plans to avoid him or even pull the occasional prank or two.The film was based on a book written by Peter Farrelly a year before with Farrelly stating the film is a marginally fictionalized account of his real experiences at a prep school in Connecticut. I could already assume that the film is pretty fictional because I would expect quirkier more unique experiences from one of the most famous comedy directors in the business.Shawn Hatosy gives us a kindhearted but overall bland character to deal with proving that he has the charisma and screen presence but not the proper material to sustain a ninetyfive minute excursion. The most admirably compelling performance in the film is that of Alec Baldwin's whose cut throat eastcoast attitude is somewhat out of place but not the less welcoming in a film filled deadend material.Ultimately the highest regard I can pay to Outside Providence is its wonderful use of seventies songs all of which easily recognizable and wonderfully engaging. From All Right Now to Free Bird and don't forget the little nuanced things like a copy of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the Farrelly brothers and cowriter Michael Corrente clearly recall the seventies with vivid clarity. And to be fair as competent basic entertainment Outside Providence maybe just what some are looking for. It's a rather quick comedy over in the blink of an eye and you're left to either praise it for its simplicity or bash it for the same reason. For the comedy genre it won't be the straw that breaks the camel's back. For the Farrelly's it may have gotten Miramax to wake up.Starring Shawn Hatosy Alec Baldwin Amy Smart Timothy Crowe and Tommy Bone. Directed by Michael Corrente.".

This movie showed life from both sides of the track which you can relate to in any era. A great feel good movie in that even though you don't realize what your doing in life if you do what is good it will all work out. The soundtrack had everything takes you down memory lane! They put a little of something of everything from that era in the soundtrack. Movie is great! However the soundtrack you can buy is missing many songs i.e. Mountain's Mississippi Queen Grateful Dead Argent etc. and many other songs as well. They should have put all music on the CD soundtrack.

The premise of the film has been done before with a few twists but most movies are remakes in some way or another. Browsing through IMDB should show you that.

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen once said that whereas Scorsese had generated a host of imitators he had generated none. This may be true films like Manhattan certainly come along far too infrequently.That this is such a gorgeous film may strike those following the formulaic Hollywood approach to cinema as strange and heretical. The story is unexciting restless male in love triangle most of the characters are unsympathetic at least on the surface particularly Isaac Allen leaves lose ends lying around all over the place and there's certainly no action unless you count the carchasewithoutachasescene involving Diane Keaton Woody Allen and a VW Beetle.So why should any selfrespecting member of the MTV generation spend time on this film? Well here are a few reasons.The script is wit of the highest order. This is not gagaminute humour like Friends but an altogether more acute art form stemming from character some wonderful dialogue and a fair amount of darkness I love the bit about Isaac trying to run over his exwife's lover. Allen is also prepared to turn his biting satire to personal issues such as being Jewish. Just don't expect someone to look shrug their shoulders slap their forehead and with midrising intonation say d'uh! It's not that kind of comedy.Then there is the gorgeous cinematography. Woody loves Manhattan and you can certainly tell. If there is one criticism of the film it is that it leaves a rather picture postcard impression of the city but I suppose if it's love then it's love. Much of the film appears to have been shot at either sunrise or sunset to soften the light and there are spectacular views of the towers bridges and waterways of America's finest metropolis.Then I suppose there is the fact that Manhattan is probably the archetypal Woody Allen film. Other films may be better like Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters but in Manhattan all the elements of Allen's style are in perfect balance. There's the jazz the neurotic unsympathetic lead the choice between stable and highlystrung women the selfmocking humour hilariously done in the opening voiceover the railing against intellectual snobbery the deep unease with popular culture.And there are great performances. Allen is at his most difficult  and in some ways his least likable. As Isaac he's trying to do the right thing but is rarely selfless enough to follow through with it. Diane Keaton is great as Mary the lynchpin between the two love triangles  vain pretentious and yet you can see why Isaac falls for her. Well all the actors are great and very believable but special mention must go to Meryl Streep who manages to steal the show with her tiny cameo as Isaac's exwife writing a book about their breakup and living with their son and her lover. She is magnificent.Of course the film will also do nothing to dispel the popular rumour that New Yorkers are neurotic selfobsessed and selfindulgent  at least that narrow social circle Allen so often writes about. If you don't mind that though and I'm English so what do I care you're in for a treat. As with the city itself the memories of this film will stay with you forever.".

The fact that it is interwoven with a genuinely moving love story told with a subtlety and indirection that is unheard of in today's mainstream cinema only makes the laughs that much richer.Gordon Willis' cinematography is good enough for the Museum of Modern Art. Scene after scene leaves a grin on your face as his moving in both senses black and white photography floats across the screen.And finally underlying everything is the music of George Gershwin whose exubertant melodies propel the movie forward at every turn.This is Woody Allen's best movie a great movie and an American movie in the best sense.

	schema:reviewBody "After the phenomenal success of 'Annie Hall' the hilarious Oscarwinning comedy detailing the romantic exploits of neurotic Jewish comedian Alvey Singer Woody Allen had become of America's most respected filmmakers. In 1979 he released what is generally accepted as his second great masterpiece 'Manhattan' a poignant tribute to the city that Allen loves so dearly. Written by Allen and his 'Annie Hall'collaborator Marshall Brickman 'Manhattan' stars Allen as Isaac Davis a twicedivorced 42yearold comedy writer who is intimately involved with a 17yearold high school student Tracy an Oscarnominated Mariel Hemingway. Meanwhile Isaac begins to fall for Mary Diane Keaton who is the secret mistress of his best friend Michael Murphy. Adding to all of Isaac's troubles his former second wife Jill Meryl Streep who had originally left him for another woman has plans to write a tellall book on their failed marriage.If this all seems very confusing to you then you're not alone. Just as in 'Annie Hall' Allen plays the hopeless romantic who is struggling desperately to understand the maddening complexity of human relationships. Though Tracy is only seventeen years old she is arguably the most honest and mature of the women in Isaac's life nonetheless he doesn't treat her seriously. In his mind anything that she says is quite obviously influenced by the naivety and downright ignorance of the young. Their relationship was never meant to be anything more than a brief fling and so he feels no guilt for seeing another woman behind his back an act that makes him livid when it ultimately happens to him.'Manhattan' was shot in beautiful crisp blackandwhite by Gordon Willis who has also worked on among countless other films 'Annie Hall' and the three installments of 'The Godfather.' The cinematography offers New York City a romantic 1940s feel reminiscent of how Allen claims to remember the city as a child Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs films books and all that. But that's how I remember New York. I always heard Gershwin music with it too. In 'Manhattan' I really think that we  that's me and cinematographer Gordon Willis  succeeded in showing the city. When you see it there on that big screen it's really decadent.Mysteriously this film remains the leastliked by the director himself though at the same time it was also his most commercially successful. As you've no doubt already noticed from this review 'Manhattan' is often likened to 1977's 'Annie Hall' perhaps due to the repeated casting of Allen and Keaton a not uncommon occurrence or its similar attempt to uncover the elusive secrets behind love and relationships. In terms of filmmaking style however the films are quite dissimilar. Unlike the highlyenergetic 'Annie Hall'  which cut back and forward in time visited old memories broke the fourth wall and made conversations with passing extras  'Manhattan' boasts a more classical approach  quiet softlyspoken and accompanied by a wistfully slow jazzy soundtrack also relying heavily on the works of George Gershwin.".

It's not the plot that makes it singular  it's typical uppercrust New York Allen full of neurotic people in therapy cheating on one another and making mistake after mistake in their pursuit of what they think will make them happy. No what makes Manhattan so effective is its style. Filmed in black and white because as Allen's character says in an opening voice over New York is a city that has always and will always exist in black and white the film is a love letter to NYC and it suggests that the neuroses that fill its denizens are as much a part of the city's character as its architecture culture and diversity. I would instantly be annoyed by the people that populate Allen's films if I met them in any other context.

	schema:reviewBody "I won't rework the thorough comments which preceded mine here because all the accolades I would give this film are stated quite eloquently. It is his best film it does contain brilliant insights into human nature it is visually breathtaking. I just want to mention a few aspects from my point of view.It has been on my list of the five best movies ever made ever since I saw it in 1979 chiefly for its realistic dialogue and probing commentary on the desperate nature of human beings in search of love but I had never seen New York with my own eyes so I could only try to accept but not fully understand Woody's love for Manhattan which is firmly stated in the introductory narration.After my recent 4 day trip there I have a new perspective  the city itself is so charmingly and compactly laid out so full of history and culture and everything famous that you can't go to New York without falling in love with it. After only 3 days I felt I wanted to live there. It is the city of not only Woody Allen but Bob Dylan Tennessee Williams Edgar Allan Poe George Washington Paul Newman Jacqueline Onassis and hundreds of other illustrious and creative people of the past and present.  The tour guides can't possibly squeeze in the whole story of every district and every building the air just vibrates with this knowledge that you are in the greatest city in the world.The beauty of Manhattan that Woody conveys so perfectly in every camera shot and through the music of Gershwin  has new meaning for me because I was there. It's not so much a physical beauty but a feeling that all is right with the city that this is what a city is supposed to be. It puts other cities to shame.All I can say is he fully succeeded in conveying what New York City is like. Not to mention that I now understand the obsession with delis they have the best food in the world.I would also like to add my new perspective on the story itself  a very 70's plot of several people switching romantic partners back and forth at the drop of a hat. Diane Keaton's Mary remains the most perfect of the characterizations as the neurotic free spirit who despite her total selfabsorption inspires our sympathy and affection. The 17 year old played by Mariel Hemingway is more irritating with the passage of 20 years not because Woody's reallife obsession with young girls came to light but because Mariel is a truly vapid nonactress with no ability to convey any depth or feeling. The constant commentary about her stunning beauty falls flat because she merely has a strikingly angular face no personality and really possesses nothing except the bloom of youth and shiny hair. Mary rightly tells Isaac that his first wife becoming a lesbian explains the little girl.The denouement seems more unsatisfactory now than in previous viewings and I want to shake the characters awake. But it was the seventies and this is how people acted. It captures the times perfectly. I can't discuss who ends up with whom without spoiling the end for those who haven't seen it but the problem for me is that the characters seem to live for the moment and if they can't have the one they want they simply change partners without much strain.This attitude does not play quite so charmingly at the end of the 90's when fidelity is valued more highly than it was in the 70's.Nevertheless the beauty of the city stands alone no matter what the characters'  desperate machinations.And as a hilarious commentary on the human instinct to find someone to love no matter what the consequences there is nothing finer. Though I might not approve of Isaac's final choice his almost religious experience which brings him to that conclusion is a stunning climax to the film. Whether he changes his mind about who is the right one for him he has learned something crucial about what really is important to him in life.The true stars of the movie are Manhattan never more beautiful and Diane Keaton never more brilliant.".

She gave him a sense of relevance about himself as he fancied he could somehow pull off being a mentor and a lover all rolled into one. I think the point was that he deliberately chose a passive youngster that he could impose his tastes onto because at the end when she starts to assert her independence he isn't happy about it. The contradiction within those circumstances is that he can only wholly fall for someone who challenges him that person in this case is the older Diane Keaton character.Maybe I'm wrong... but I hated Woody's character from almost immediately into this and the last scenes made it all worthwhile to me and justified my caring about what happens to him because it's such a turnaround.All through the movie he is using her and telling her that their relationship will only ever be a reststop on the path of her life so when she finally assimilates that attitude the hapless man can only tell her that his previous philosophising was hollow. He pretends to base his decisions on what's best for both of them but really his choices are dictated only to afford himself an easier escape route in the future. I'm a guy I've had this done to me by a woman in the past and to see naivete parlayed as a tactic again by either sex was painful. Thus I was gratified to see that the tables are swiftly turned at the resolution and he is the member of the pair that is now suddenly finding themselves craving reassurance.It's a note of admittance to end on that will maybe help change his attitude to relationships in the future and it inspires a kind of hope in the watching audience by suggesting that perhaps we can all learn from our mistakes no matter how harsh they have to get.

Seemingly the film has influenced the younger generation of New York based filmmakers and even they have made homage to this film i.e. Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise similarly consists of wellcomposed medium shots and has a resembling scene of four persons sitting in a theatre. Also Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It features analogous landscape montages and has an akin scene of the protagonist running to meet his lover. Ironically these youngsters present the city in more genuine manners and give Allen's Manhattan an obsolete look.Though the portrait of immature middleaged people who can't deal with their relationships might be real who wants to see that? Especially Isaac Davis Woody Allen soliciting his former 17yearold lover Tracy Mariel Hemingway not to leave for London after discovering his other relationship doesn't work is unbearable to watch. All central characters maybe except 17yearold Tracy have the same typicalAllenlike personas in their ways of thinking and behavingAllen might have a dictatorship as a director and it causes the lack of the characters' diversity. The screenplay contains many cliches i.e. Allen's voiceover monologue on the opening montage to depict the city as a book's Chapter One several pseudointellectual lines such as Isaac's describing his friends as pseudointellectual garbage talking about existential reality Isaac's line Trouble is my middle name after his prospective lover says she's troublesome and so on. Cinematography by Gordon Willis is inappropriately beautiful the gap between the aesthetic visual and the halfgrown content generates an uncompelling halfway style.".

This film has no real reason for being...it's ultimately inconsequential. That makes me sad and now I have to watch my other favorites to see if they hold up. I still have hopes for Hannah Misdemeanors Purple Rose  Love  Death. This one isn't in the pantheon anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "You probably think I'm too cerebral Diane Keaton tells Woody Allen midway through this acclaimed film.  Had that remark been made to me I would have said No.  Just pretentious.  It's a verdict I would reach concerning all of Allen's overrated 1979 film the first in which he starred since the Oscar winning Annie Hall.  Here he continues the wearying pseudointellectual tone of that earlier film but while Annie Hall compensated for its pretentions with an abundance of humor much of it aimed at pseudointellectuals Allen apparently does not recognize himself as a member of this group the laughs in Manhattan and there are plenty of them are unintentional.  As usual Allen's characters speak in the vernacular of dime store psychologists and art critics repeatedly referring to hostility as well as Freud and BergmanIngmar of course not Ingrid although I doubt that any of these smug characters could say an intelligent word about The Bells of St. Mary's let alone The Seventh Seal.  I'm beautiful I'm bright and I deserve better Keaton says at one point but her selfassessment would be more accurately applied to Meryl Streep who as the wife who dumps Allen for another woman IS beautiful bright and certainly deserving of something better than this mess concocted by a man whose character is described as someone who longed to be an artist but balked at the necessary sacrifices.  In Manhattan Allen balks like never before dishing up superficially deep subject matter but lacking the insight and I suspect the experience to adequately probe it.  Allen the aloof and reclusive New Yorker has made an arty though not artistic vanity production that demonstrates a poor grasp on any life outside his own snobby circle.  And like a circle Manhattan doesn't end it merely stops dead in its tracks.  It is however his second funniest film. The funniest by a long shot is Interiors.".

Every character yes every character in the movie is fine with this...they even go out with Woody and the girl. The film is hailed as a work of art for its supposed insights into Americans and the struggles they encounter in the quest for love...we're supposed to be able to relate to the movie and its characters yet if you would take a moment to put the bong down and think you would discover that you've never met people that actually talk and exchange dialog remotely close to what goes on in the film. Seriously when was the last time you heard anything close to the pseudointellectual trash spewed by Keaton's character uttered by someone walking by you on the street. How about someone babbling incessantly over the most inane insights into the human condition? When is the last time you heard that nonsense raping your ears?

In Manhattan I've seen first of all the portrait of a generation the generation of those who lived their forties in Manhattan the symbol of everything that could be achieved in the 80s. And the portrait depicted is not softened at all since every single adult in this movie is a neurotic mess. There are adults afraid of cancer adults that plan to write books they will never end adults that put their life in the hands of LSDaddicted analysts adults that talk about orgasms adults devastated by dull mediocre men imagined as gods adults that waver between homo bi and heterosexuality adults that pretend to be intellectuals and try to judge Mozart Bergman and Scott Fitzgerald adults whose relationships are stable just as the weather is adults that act like they believe in the highest values but that in the end need a seventeenyearold girl to find their balance. And those are the same adults that despise the generation brought up by the TV and the pill. This show of absurdities is well hosted by Isaac Davis Woody Allen himself that unprejudiced as always hides all these paradoxical situations behind a good amount of irony. If I had to make a comparison with a more recent movie I would say that what Allen did with his generation has been done by Tony Servillo with the current fiftyyearold Roman VIPs in his latest work La Grande Bellezza. Irony good acting and a good soundtrack always make a movie worth watching. And this movie can boast the best of everything.".

	schema:reviewBody "Manhattan is an interesting film by Woody Allen The story and dialogue between the characters is more serious and believable than in the only other film I saw Annie Hall. The humor also didn't seem forced or written in just to make something funnier the jokes were naturally funny. I still don't like the fact that Woody Allen casts himself in the lead part when he could easily get someone much better to play the part. The supporting cast is also really good as it usually is in these kinds of Woody Allen films. The style of the film I also enjoyed with the black and white and great use of shadows gives it a old timey feel to it that helps the film in a way. Overall Manhattan isn't a bad film I enjoyed it more than I did Annie Hall but there were still some things I would've liked to see Woody Allen do differently along the lines of the story and cast. That is why Manhattan gets a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "The majestic buildings the gravitydefying bridges the beautiful imagery of New York City in blackandwhite pulsating to the rhythm of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue like fireworks of emotions this is Manhattan a town with a soul. Whether dangerous insomniac intellectual or streetwise New York is again the perfect arena for the eternal battle between brains and passions dreams and reality hope and disillusions indispensable for some minds in quest of inspiration.Woody Allen is one of these minds Isaac the character he plays too but Isaac mirrors more of Allen's personality than any other character he played. It's the medium of Woody's soul allowing him to say that Bergman is the only genius of Cinema and to express his contempt toward pseudointellectual stuff like an alibi against his detractors. But Woody doesn't deny his flaws his character represents the struggle of a soul trying to embody Manhattan's incarnation of the American Dream but as he stutters in the opening line unable to pass 'Chapter One' he can't find inspiration. His friend Yale Michael Murphy says he's got a Freudian relationship with New York it's more than that it's Oedipian because he knows he's in love with this city but is incapable to make himself worthy of that love. But Manhattan is more than a movie about love it's about the strange effect of love in mature people. And Isaac like Woody is mature  agewise of course. Isaac is 42 and he realizes it's an interesting age where his mind became his greatest asset and since he evolves in an artistic milieu he's clearly in his advantage. Through Manhattan and Gershwin's music it's the whole intellectual and artistic underground world of New York that lets its soul implode it's to New York what SaintGermain was to Paris in the existentialist 50's. But in the 70's New York became the center of the underground culture of sexual liberation of the whole questioning of the American heritage without the idealism of the late 60's or the pessimism of the postNixon era. Everything is debatable war marriage orgasms and nothing is to be taken for granted. The film was made in 1979 just before the 80's would provide their depressing cynicism and flamboyant superficiality not sure Isaac could have quited his job of screenwriter for TV programs to fulfill his dream of writing a book in the 80's a coincidence that he finally works on TV in Hannah and Her Sisters?Aware or not that the days of his sex appeal are numbered Isaac seems to have a way with women and to enjoy that too. He had two wives and now he's dating Tracy a 17year old high school girl Mariel Hemingway but he has a crush on Mary Diane Keaton Yale's mistress. The way he handles the two relationships is a masterstroke of clever writing and realism. In the beginning he finds Mary not only too pompous but calls her a pseudo intellectual unaware that he behaves the same way when he's with Tracy becoming the typical neurotic Allenguy. Love is a field of paradoxes Isaac embodies the hypocritical breakup excuse when the one who breaks says You deserve better meaning the opposite of course and Mary who doesn't want to wreck a marriage feels hurt when Yale breaks up with her. Allen's directing never 'accuses' we feel this strange chemistry going between Mary and Isaac in a romantic moment where they're in the dark planetarium they're about to kiss but Isaac retracts because he's still with Tracy what Mary understands. These subtle yet delicate moments elevate Manhattan above anything we saw before and even after.An on the top of these moments there's the image of Mariel Hemingway's eyes tearing when she realizes he didn't love her and he's making a whole pointless speech while her heart is broken. Hemingway who deserved her Oscar nomination for that role is genuinely sweet tender and natural in what probably is the most difficult role of the film because she has no monologues she's doesn't belong to that tormented world all she sees is that she cares for Isaac and she's in love with him something that Isaac fails to consider. Allen is a genius in the way he portrays sentimental relationships and how we're more eager to love people we idealize than those who idealize us and how we tend to lie to ourselves just to satisfy our egos more than our hearts. An interesting subplot involves a book written by Isaac's exwife played by Meryl Streep and in a scene where Mary Yale and his wife finally read some excerpts they all laugh at him. And as viewers we know that Tracy wouldn't have laughed.Manhattan's ending is as sweet and realistic as it could get people who lied to themselves reveal their true feelings and Isaac realized that his heart was kept as hostage of a sort of sentimental blackmail between his girlfriend and his best friend. Manhattan is the realization of a man who loved intellectuality and intellectualized love at the end when he's lost everything his job his girl out of false impulses. He finds himself the remedy for the pain in one of the most memorable scenes of Allen's filmography when he records all the things that makes life worth living Groucho Marx Flaubert's Sentimental Education Bergman Brando and as we expect it ends with  Tracy. The film's ending is a mix of Casablanca and City Lights and Allen tries to find the perfect note to convince Tracy to come back to him all it will take him is some patience and a little faith in people.Tracy's concluding lines confirm that brain is the most overrated organ and how ironic that it comes from Woody Allen in what remains one of his greatest films so sweet intelligent and witty that I guess I would nominate his scripts as one of the things that make my life worth living.".

Ted Hamilton's Pirate King is a delight to watch throughout but even his great performance cannot better the wonderful Bill Kerr as the Major General who's performance in the reworded version of 'I Am The Very Model Of A Modern Major General' is by far the funniest thing in the movie.On it's initial release this movie was universally slated and nearly destroyed Kristy McNichols career over the years It has become a bit of a cult movie and takes me on a nostalgia trip every time I watch it.thoroughly enjoyable but you're always left wondering who the target audience was for this film as the humour is an unstable mix of good clean family fun and risqu teen sexual innuendo. give it a go.".

	schema:headline " A cult sex comedy musical... for kids";
	schema:reviewBody "My summary line is sort of strange but gimme a chance to explain. As has been stated in a few of these comments The Pirate Movie is a big cult movie. In terms of cult status I'd certainly liken it to Rocky Horror or Donnie Darko  not that it shares many common factors with either of those just that there's this big audience that REALLY loves it. As with several other big flops from this era Midnight Madness Zapped! HBO is probably solely responsible for turning this into the cult phenomenon it is  after all they ran it endlessly in the early '80s.But the real reason I felt it necessary to leave a comment is something that's barely been touched upon here. While many people have said I loved this when I was a kid it's yet to be stated that this seems to be the key to loving the film. I saw it when I was a kid and loved it. I've shown it to kids and they've loved it. However the adults that I've shown it to including several who usually go in for this type of film hated it. My best friend watched it for the first time last night and even though he's usually open to a movie like this he griped all the way through it. His three year old son however was glued to the TV.The saving grace for this film is that while it IS technically a sex comedy it's surprisingly innocent. A song called Pumpin' and Blowin' could very easily have been lewd and vulgar but it's disguised as a bubblegum pop anthem complete with animated characters. And that's the case with a lot of the jokes. While they're not squeakyclean Disney fare from that era it's all mainly innuendo with nothing blatantly obvious You'll be hung Kristy McNichol says to which Ted Hamilton replies Oh I am  and very well thank you. How many kids are actually going to get that joke? If you loved it as a kid get the DVD and show it to your kids though I'd avoid the dull director's commentary. If you have kids show it to them. But if you're going into it for the first time as an adult chances are it's not for you.".

As with several other big flops from this era Midnight Madness Zapped! HBO is probably solely responsible for turning this into the cult phenomenon it is  after all they ran it endlessly in the early '80s.But the real reason I felt it necessary to leave a comment is something that's barely been touched upon here. While many people have said I loved this when I was a kid it's yet to be stated that this seems to be the key to loving the film. I saw it when I was a kid and loved it. I've shown it to kids and they've loved it. However the adults that I've shown it to including several who usually go in for this type of film hated it. My best friend watched it for the first time last night and even though he's usually open to a movie like this he griped all the way through it. His three year old son however was glued to the TV.The saving grace for this film is that while it IS technically a sex comedy it's surprisingly innocent. A song called Pumpin' and Blowin' could very easily have been lewd and vulgar but it's disguised as a bubblegum pop anthem complete with animated characters. And that's the case with a lot of the jokes. While they're not squeakyclean Disney fare from that era it's all mainly innuendo with nothing blatantly obvious You'll be hung Kristy McNichol says to which Ted Hamilton replies Oh I am  and very well thank you. How many kids are actually going to get that joke? If you loved it as a kid get the DVD and show it to your kids though I'd avoid the dull director's commentary. If you have kids show it to them. But if you're going into it for the first time as an adult chances are it's not for you.";

Until I saw this movie.The Pirate Movie without any exaggeration is the WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I was informed prior to watching that the movie was indeed awful but I did not believe the allegations. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film.It starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. The End splashes across the screen. Unfortunately it is not the actual end of the movie. The movie is about an unpopular awkwardly nerdy girl named Mabel who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to ambiguously homosexual pirate boys.

The direction is flat out awful and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene which isn't very well hidden at all.In conclusion if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie get rid of it.

In this film you'll get to hear some modern music together with such classics as the Model Of A Modern Major General.The film was shot in Australia and it sports an Aussie supporting cast behind the leads of Atkins and McNichol.

It is a funny and fairly faithful adaptation of the Gilbert and Sullivan original. It is a MUCH BETTER movie. The Pirate Movie was a spoof of the operetta. There was really no reason to parody the Pirates of Penzance since it is hilarious in the first place. In this version Kline steals the show as the Pirate King. He is fabulously funny!!! Angela Lansbury's Ruth adds to the fun. Linda Rondstat shows off her versatile voice and gets into the silly spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan. Rex Smith though not on a par with Kline Lanxbury and Ronstadt is an adequate Frederick certainly better than Christopher Atkins in this mutt.Parodies of classics can be excellent.  This one wasn't.

It is a quirky film and things don't make sense look in the scene where Mabel and Fredrick are kissing at the beach landing there is a Rock with graffiti on it. Much of the film is a Dream so allot of the things you see don't make sense but you just take the film not seriously and you will enjoy it. The Songs are catchy and from watching the film it has inspired me to visit Werribee Mansion in Victoria and Polly Woodside in Melbourne City. A Classic Movie leave reality at the door and just take in some great 1980's humour.".

This is a performance that runs the emotional gamut from A to B  as the brilliant Dorothy Parker once snipped about the equally brilliant Katharine Hepburn.Don't worry friends it goes downhill from there.The film in question goes by the title The Pirate Movie. The reason for the title is apparently that the people responsible have pirated some pieces of Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance  just enough to make you wish they had pirated the whole operetta and jettisoned the drek they added to the maimed remains they used.Appearing in this wanton travesty are a bunch of little and unknowns who couldn't have salvaged the production even if it was good. Which of course it isn't. So the whole baggage sinks under its own dead dead dead boring weight. Well it wasn't their fault really it was a job for a lot of people who judging by their credits on the IMDb didn't get many. The names are withheld to protect the presumed innocent.The story of The Pirate Movie follows the general and wellknown outline of Pirates of Penzance which is easy enough to look up if you don't know it  although with a number of rather stupid changes that sap it of its original vitality. To substitute for this vapidity a composer was hired to write some up music. His talent if any is scarcely on display. What we get meager quotations from some of Sullivan's Penzance tunes  although not always readily recognizable and usually not in the spirit of the original. Then there is a lot of stuff in a twobit modern idiom that is also wholly out of touch with Sullivan's originality and wittiness.This film is so awful on so many levels it's hard to find anything positive to say about it. The color is vibrant that is to say wasted on what it shows. The sound is at least too good for the material.Ah well. At least Atkins runs about in descamiado mode for most of the film which I suppose is some slight compensation. And not enough. Avoid this turkey.".

It doesn't necessarily have to be a good movie to make money. It just has to be the KIND of movie that people want to see at that time. Personally I think that more than anything else is what sank this film when it was released. Until Pirates of the Caribbean was released pirate movies ALWAYS bombed. Musicals were not big draws and the only hit parody released around that time was the original Airplane. Add to that a pair of leads with either unproven or miserable box office track records and you have a major flop on your hands. HOWEVER...after all that something miraculous happens. The few people who actually went to see that movie end up loving it. They tell their friends. Some of them see it. Slowly word begins to spread. Maybe not fast enough to save the movie at the box office but the film begins to take on a life of its' own. It hits on video cable and TV. It develops a following and years later more people than you'd expect say Oh yeah. I remember that movie. I love that one! That is what is known as a cult classic. Something about the movie sticks with people and they hold it dear to their hearts for years to come.Well that is EXACTLY what we have hear. The proof of that is the simple enough fact that people are sitting here writing about it nearly a quarter century after it's initial theatrical debut. Released in 1982 this movie was a flop of huge proportions. And yet the people who have seen it LOVE IT! Don't believe me? Check out the rest of the comments on this website. Out of 60 I found only 2 negative reviews. Everyone else RAVES about it. And why not? It's a fun movie with a lot of catchy songs good humor bright settings and a lot of heart. Now I may be biased because growing up I had a MAJOR crush on Kristy McNichol. I would've sat through anything she did back then. But the movie is still a lot of fun to watch today. I was lucky enough to tape it off cable a couple of years ago. Just recently I watched it with my two kids ages 8 and 5 and they LOVED IT!!! My daughter loves the music and the bright colors my son loves the fact that it has pirates and the spoofs especially the Star Wars and Indiana Jones bits and they both laughed like crazy. Sure some of the humor may be a bit on the sexual side but it's innocent rather than sleazy. The movie is so lighthearted cheerful and fast paced that I just don't see how anyone could not have a good time watching it. Sure some of the performances are not on the mark. However Ted Hamilton is BRILLIANT as the Pirate King. Talk about making a meal out of role. Plus Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins are so cute together that it's easy to overlook their acting shortcomings. And some of the songs are really catchy in and 80's nostalgia kind of way. How can I live without her and Hold on are proof positive of that. Give me a happy ending is delivered with so much joy by the entire cast that I DARE you not to find yourself either singing along or singing it to yourself later. Mark my words on this...when the movie is FINALLY released on DVD next month you're going to see surprisingly large number of people grabbing it off the shelf saying My God I remember this movie. I HAVE to buy it! And if you do the same well then consider yourself like me...part of the cult.".

Give me a happy ending is delivered with so much joy by the entire cast that I DARE you not to find yourself either singing along or singing it to yourself later. Mark my words on this...when the movie is FINALLY released on DVD next month you're going to see surprisingly large number of people grabbing it off the shelf saying My God I remember this movie. I HAVE to buy it! And if you do the same well then consider yourself like me...part of the cult.";

	schema:reviewBody "Traditional Gilbert  Sullivan music and '80's bubble gum pop blend uneasily in this Australianmade musical. McNichol plays a dweeby sorority girl who is treated like Cinderella by the other sisters. The sisters walk down the street in skimpy bathing suits and tacky high heels while the music blares Yo Ho! quite appropriately! When shirtless! Atkins uses her in a fencing demonstration during a pirate show she becomes enamored of him and soon after has an extended dream in which he is Frederic and she is Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance! Atkins with his leftover mop of hair from The Blue Lagoon tangles with his surrogate father The Pirate King Hamilton and meets up with McNichol in a dress that's slit to the waist and wearing a cocker spaniel puppy on the back of her head for a makeshift mullet and her sisters. The story follows the basic plot of Penzance with significant editing along with the insertion of modern dialogue and songs. There are also Airplane!like references to other movies like Jaws Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars along the way and a tribute to The Blue Lagoon with Atkins in a very loinclothlike pair of underwear. SPOILER McNichol then wakes up and idiotically since they don't even know each other Atkins kisses her and marries her immediately in real life. END OF SPOILER. This film has a very divisive effect on audiences. Some despise it while others are rabidly affectionate towards it. No matter whether one thinks it's good or bad it is at the very least watchable if not fascinating. A pet project of Hamilton who executive produced it assuring that he'd play the role he wanted! it was the most expensive film to be made in Australia to that date yet they picked two of the least musically inclined performers imaginable unless they'd have selected Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfieffer. McNichol is noticeably uncomfortable in the frilly feminine scenes but shows more spunk and personality when she's leading the men against the enemy. Her singing voice is synthesized to the point of hilarity. Atkins' speaking voice is earsplittingly annoying and his flat line readings are at times agonizing forget  fergit His singing is average at best. He often appears ridiculous though he does plant a David Gestlike openmouthed kiss on McNichol at one point. Hamilton provides a bit of zest as the swashbuckling King with a large jewelencrusted codpiece coming to life most when he's engaged in swordplay the ends of the swords have rounded safety edges by the way even in closeup. There's a fair amount of energy throughout the movie and a lovely mansion location which helps immeasurably. However fans of Gilbert  Sullivan may likely be annoyed at the truncation and even bastardization of the source material while fans of the electronic pop music may be bored by the traditional music. It's a combination that doesn't work particularly well. Also many of the jokes are extremely lame and tired especially the ones delivered by the token Black pirate. At least the thing is eyefilling and jawdroppingly cheesy to the point where most people can get through it one way or another. The ending is ridiculous alreadybut becomes even more so when two very uninteresting outtakes precede the closing credits. Why bother? Either run them all through the credits or shelve them completely. Fortunately a bit more respectful version of the musical Penzance was right around the corner. This one might have done better to just work from a wholly original score.".

	schema:headline " Horrific fun! Reece Shearsmith shines in excellent black comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Cottage' is an intriguing genre mixing film full of twists and turns  an exhilarating 90 minutes. Its gory and funny but one that anchors the splatter comedy to deftly drawn characters enduring a heightened reality one hell of a night.The nightmarish black comic horror is skillfully delivered with the gorefest conventions given a darkly comic twist. The film's tongueincheek exuberance humorously balances the grisly nature of the horrific injuries that are inflicted on screen.What makes 'The Cottage' so distinctive is the unusual approach it takes for a film where a gore infested climax is the pay off. At the heart of the film and what makes the film stand out for me is the emotional investment in the two main characters. You really do end up caring what happens to its key protagonists the brothers David and Peter.There is an emotional depth about them that made me wish even more time could have been spent with the pair their arguments and interplay exploring their relationship and its bickering background.The relationship between the brothers brilliantly played by Andy Serkis and Reece Shearsmith is a highlight of the film. Their fraught fraternal relationship has a believability about it which grabs you from the moment they appear on screen  the scenes between them crackle with tension humour and emotion.Serkis's character is one used to being in control but his tough hard streetwise nature is under pressure almost immediately as the kidnapping plan begins to unravel giving way to repressed anger and growing frustration. Although Andy Serkis's David is forced out of his comfort zone as the plot unfolds Reece Shearsmith's Peter is out of his depth from the start reluctantly brought into a world he knows nothing about and ill equipped to deal with it at any level. His timidity is accompanied by a moralising disapproval of his brother.Into this mix are thrown two more characters the kidnapped Tracey and her black sheep stepbrother Andrew nicely played by Jennifer Ellison and Steven O'Donnell They are the natural comic grotesques of the movie hindering and exasperating by extreme measures a contrasting comic counterpoint to the carefully delineated characters of David and Peter. Much of the comedy comes from the dynamics of their enforced relationship and how they react to the ever worsening situation they find themselves thrust into.Both the quarrelsome brothers are superbly played but Reece Shearsmith is truly outstanding. His performance is beautifully nuanced with great comic timing and skillful characterisation. Peter is by turns wimpish pernickety argumentative pathetic vulnerable. He's hilariously yet tragically out his depth. Shearsmith's performance really holds the film together  it's brilliantly subtle and multilayered. He brings so much to the role not only comedically but emotionally too. He gives the film its heart its pathos.The bloody battlefield climax at the farmhouse sees the gory finale delivered with aplomb  the comedy and horror unfold with beautiful pace and precision. Even here amid the bloodletting there is a moment of the unexpected and unusual which makes 'The Cottage' stand out. Its a low key almost poetic scene which seals a growing understanding between the brothers. The badly injured pair contemplate their demise as they look up at a star filled night sky. Its a moment of humanity amid the carnage sad and touching because its a hoped for reconciliation that will never happen.'The Cottage' is a very entertaining blending of comedy and horror with a depth not usually associated with the genre and its directed with real confidence and verve.There is a sense of sadness in the midst of the horrific fun of 'The Cottage' which lingers in the memory afterwards because its central characters matter and you care what happens to them  a rarity for the horror genre which marks the film out. Its original approach well evoked atmosphere at times comically and bloody surreal  the blackly ironic pitch and top notch performances by the two leads especially a brilliant Reece Shearsmith make 'The Cottage' a comedy horror whose genre blending works a memorable treat!".

The film's tongueincheek exuberance humorously balances the grisly nature of the horrific injuries that are inflicted on screen.What makes 'The Cottage' so distinctive is the unusual approach it takes for a film where a gore infested climax is the pay off. At the heart of the film and what makes the film stand out for me is the emotional investment in the two main characters. You really do end up caring what happens to its key protagonists the brothers David and Peter.There is an emotional depth about them that made me wish even more time could have been spent with the pair their arguments and interplay exploring their relationship and its bickering background.The relationship between the brothers brilliantly played by Andy Serkis and Reece Shearsmith is a highlight of the film. Their fraught fraternal relationship has a believability about it which grabs you from the moment they appear on screen  the scenes between them crackle with tension humour and emotion.Serkis's character is one used to being in control but his tough hard streetwise nature is under pressure almost immediately as the kidnapping plan begins to unravel giving way to repressed anger and growing frustration. Although Andy Serkis's David is forced out of his comfort zone as the plot unfolds Reece Shearsmith's Peter is out of his depth from the start reluctantly brought into a world he knows nothing about and ill equipped to deal with it at any level. His timidity is accompanied by a moralising disapproval of his brother.Into this mix are thrown two more characters the kidnapped Tracey and her black sheep stepbrother Andrew nicely played by Jennifer Ellison and Steven O'Donnell They are the natural comic grotesques of the movie hindering and exasperating by extreme measures a contrasting comic counterpoint to the carefully delineated characters of David and Peter. Much of the comedy comes from the dynamics of their enforced relationship and how they react to the ever worsening situation they find themselves thrust into.Both the quarrelsome brothers are superbly played but Reece Shearsmith is truly outstanding. His performance is beautifully nuanced with great comic timing and skillful characterisation. Peter is by turns wimpish pernickety argumentative pathetic vulnerable. He's hilariously yet tragically out his depth. Shearsmith's performance really holds the film together  it's brilliantly subtle and multilayered. He brings so much to the role not only comedically but emotionally too. He gives the film its heart its pathos.The bloody battlefield climax at the farmhouse sees the gory finale delivered with aplomb  the comedy and horror unfold with beautiful pace and precision. Even here amid the bloodletting there is a moment of the unexpected and unusual which makes 'The Cottage' stand out. Its a low key almost poetic scene which seals a growing understanding between the brothers. The badly injured pair contemplate their demise as they look up at a star filled night sky. Its a moment of humanity amid the carnage sad and touching because its a hoped for reconciliation that will never happen.'The Cottage' is a very entertaining blending of comedy and horror with a depth not usually associated with the genre and its directed with real confidence and verve.There is a sense of sadness in the midst of the horrific fun of 'The Cottage' which lingers in the memory afterwards because its central characters matter and you care what happens to them  a rarity for the horror genre which marks the film out. Its original approach well evoked atmosphere at times comically and bloody surreal  the blackly ironic pitch and top notch performances by the two leads especially a brilliant Reece Shearsmith make 'The Cottage' a comedy horror whose genre blending works a memorable treat!";

What they hadn't bargained into the equation is that Tracey is one tough feisty lady and that a turn of events will lead them to something far more scary than big bad gangster Arnie.This is the second feature from director Paul Andrew Williams and bearing in mind that his debut effort was the highly lauded gritty drama London To Brighton it's no surprise to find that some folk are a little bemused as to the genre splicing nature of The Cottage. The Cottage is far more in keeping with Christopher Smith's 2006 horror comedy Severance and certainly it wouldn't be out of place as a double bill with that criminally undervalued picture.Very much a film of two halves this picture is likely to prove a very divisive piece and it will has only find an audience based on word of mouth alone. You will be hard pressed to find any sort of press marketing that will prepare you for the type of genre fusion film you are getting. Already based on the comments written on this site thus far you can see that some people were confused or annoyed by the tonal shift for the second half of the film. The first half sees poles apart brothers David  Peter swapping comedy dialogue as they whisk through a number of exchanges and circumstances with the marvellously volatile Tracey. While the second part of the picture hits you over the head with a quick switch to horror formula that has catering fulfilment for the gore junkies amongst us.And this is where the problem lies with many why didn't the film stay as a kidnap farce? Why didn't it set its stall out to be a horror film from the off? There is no denying that the films' high points come with the horror moments but the film is first and foremost a comedy from the first reel to the cheeky end of credits sequence it is what it is. As deliciously sick as the gore shift is The Cottage never once takes its tongue out of its bloody cheek. It's obvious that Paul Andrew Williams is having fun here and he is clearly hoping his audience will as well. View it as an all encompassing comedyhorrorthriller in that order and you wont go far wrong.Andy Serkis plays David the tough brother of the two with Serkis doing a wonderful line in both visual and vocal comedy. This benefits Reece Shearsmith as Peter a character so far under the thumb he can barely be seen. Shearsmith feeds off of Serkis to seal the comedy deal for this odd brotherly couple. British tabloid fave Jennifer Ellison plays Tracey literally swearing for England to have the audience divided as to if they want her to survive or not! But it's a gutsy show from her and one hopes she ventures into this territory a bit more often. There is nothing new or fresh here and this wont win any awards even in its homeland of England but it is FUN and it shows a director intent on making films from different genres. 810".

The acting is absolutely superb and even I must admit Ellison was perfectly cast even if she did use the F word a few too many times. Andy serkis stole the show for me I didn't know he could act without making stupid noises Lord of the rings or being dressed as a 10ft ape king kong but in this he is very funny without the CGI.

Taking her to a cottage in the woods they wait for the ransom. But what they find out there is something worse than the wrath of a gangster...The Cottage is a horrorcomedy written and directed by Paul Andrew Williams. He's tried to make a movie that turns into something different around halfway through. It's a pity that it doesn't work.The first half of the movie at the Cottage isn't bad and has some nice humour in it for example the nerdier brother Shearsmith trying to be tough is quite amusing.As a fan of horror movies however I actually was a bit disappointed when the horror and gore side kicked in. Not that the gore and bloody violence isn't convincing but that for me part of the problem was that as none of the characters were that likable to begin with you don't really care about what happens to them.This is a pity. Williams directs his own script well staging the violence well but it's his own writing that lets it down. HorrorComedy movies are hard to pull off. Evil Dead 2 works. Shaun Of The Dead works. An American Werewolf In London works. Dog Soldiers worksI do find it very funny.Sadly though The Cottage doesn't.".

Simple enough story  two warring brothers Andy Serkis and Reece Shearsmith kidnap the mouthy attituderidden daughterJennifer Ellison of a dodgy gangster nightclub owner and demand a ransom in order to strike it rich. Her stepbrother Steven O'Donnell is also in on the plan. But to their misfortune things take a downward turn when said mouthy daughter totally unbelievably escapes and trudges off into the night with Shearsmith's pacifistic character in tow as her own hostage.The two stumble upon a farmhouse which doubles as the lair for a psychotic killer simply known as The Farmer. And murder literally ensues from there on and the brothers find themselves thrown back together in a fight for survival.The gem of this film mainly comes from the character setup which is in full swing the moment Serkis and Shearsmith appear on screen. You're privy to their terse relationship and individual quirks which are seen visually later in the film and are hysterical!. So later when slash mangle and chop occurs you feel it and for them and want them to get out of there alive.The performances by Andy and Reece are riveting too. Reece sweeps through the film with brilliant comic timing and very detailed characterisation and is simply wonderful. He was the sole reason for me as a TLoG fan going to see the film and he did not disappoint me  Andy is perfect as the hardened and cynical straight man coming across very volatile and stressed when things go wrong. There is a near homage to Now Voyager  with Reece seeming to light up a cigarette for himself but instead he passes it to Andy before lighting another one. Volumes are spoken about the two brothers in that one moment. The two Chinese hit men are brilliant too and pretty funny  they refer to Reece's character as one bald fk which had me in stitches. In Jennifer's case I thought she was OK the first time round but when I saw it again her character just really got on my nerves and frankly when she is silenced it's a bloody relief! This film is definitely worth seeing  a funny yet touching horrorfest.".

Volumes are spoken about the two brothers in that one moment. The two Chinese hit men are brilliant too and pretty funny  they refer to Reece's character as one bald fk which had me in stitches. In Jennifer's case I thought she was OK the first time round but when I saw it again her character just really got on my nerves and frankly when she is silenced it's a bloody relief! This film is definitely worth seeing  a funny yet touching horrorfest.";

Peter calls Tracey's father and asks a ransom of one hundred thousand pound to be delivered to her stepbrother Andrew Steve O'Donnell. When the bag is delivered to the moron Andrew he does not check the content and is followed to the remote location by two Chinese hitmen hired by Tracey's father. When the abductors discover that the bag has only paper David drives to a nearby village to make a phone call to demand the money. When he returns he finds Andrew fainted and later that Tracey had reverted the situation and escaped with his brother as hostage. Meanwhile an insane and deformed farmer has just killed the killers and Tracey and Peter are heading to his farmer seeking a phone to call her father. I had a great expectation with The Cottage but I found it disappointing. The blackhumor never works except in the two very last scenes in the end of the credits there is a last one. The characters Peter and Andrew are stupid and annoying and the psychopath serialkiller is a ripoff of Leatherface. In the end I found this movie only reasonable and my vote is six.Title Brazil Cabana Macabra Macabre Cottage".

	schema:reviewBody "Ventriliquism is an act of deception. The audience must believe that the puppets are actually talking instead of the puppeteer making voices. Unless the audience buys into it nothing works. And Jeff Dunham is so skilled that it is near impossible to believe that this is a ventriloquist.That being said Jeff Dunham Arguing with Myself is nothing short of hysterical. The first time I watched it I was nearly crying because I was laughing so hard. It may take up little more than an hour of time but you're laughing heartily the whole way through.The performance opens up with Jeff doing a small roughly 57 minute routine. The little story that he tells is pretty funny and sets up a running gag throughout the show. Dunham may be a ventriloquist but he's still funny without them.First up is what is arguably his funniest doll his most famous one Achmed the Dead Terrorist was created later Walter. Walter is a cantankerous foulmouthed wife hating old man who loves sarcasm and verbally abusing everyone including certain audience members.Next up is Jeff's new agent Sweet Daddy D who Jeff suddenly realizes is a pimp and considers Jeff to be his ho. He's present in a few backstage scenes offering commentary but on stage he's pretty funny.Unfortunately after Walter and Sweet Daddy D the level of hilarity decreases. There are still laughs to be had but his remaining characters are just not as funny.Jeff's third character is Bubba J a selfproclaimed redneck who married his cousin. A lot of the jokes revolve around this and his obviously low intelligence but the gags are just too broad to be truly hilarious.Next up is Peanut a creature from a Micronesean country that looks like some sort of bizarre minaret. He's like a hyperactive but less intelligent Walter including a similar voice. He's really only funny when he's paired up with Jose the Jalepeno...which is exactly what you'd think.Jeff Dunham is clearly talented. His jokes are hysterical and the voices are so different from his own that it's hard to believe that he's creating them...especially while barely moving his mouth. What I really like is the interaction between himself and his puppets. The rapport that they have is crucial and makes a lot of the jokes funnier than they normally would be. Next to his puppets Jeff acts meek and often embarrassed at the things his costars say. What's especially noteworthy about his puppets is that their faces are very versatile...their eyes and many of their facial features move which adds to the hilarity.The unsung hero is Manny Rodriguez. Taping a stand up routine seems easy but it's really not. Rodriguez is able to capture Jeff in the perfect frame we can clearly see him and his puppets and read their emotions but we can't see his lips move when he's voicing the puppets. He also knows the concept of comic timing such as when he switches to the audience members reactions and the scenes backstage.This is a raunchy obscene and hilarious performance the unbleeped version would definitely be rated R although in my opinion it should squeak by with a PG13 rating. If you want to laugh check Jeff Dunham out!".

This show was taped in Santa Ana California and the town takes a few hits courtesy of Dunham's opening bit with Walter the old curmudgeon. What's really quite good is when Dunham goes off script to engage members of the audience with Walter carrying on with someone who had to take a restroom break. Dunham's real talent shows through in the bit with Peanut and Jose Jalapeno on a stick. When all three argue back and forth with a bit of Spanish thrown in it's rather amazing that Dunham doesn't miss a beat. His other characters appearing here included Sweet Daddy Dee and redneck Bubba J and they're all hilarious. At times it almost seems like the dummies are really talking so engrossed one gets with the laugh lines. The only downside is some of the language Dunham employs making this particular show unsuitable for family viewing.".

There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers... and a closeup of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure it had audiences gasping. The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control... ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail's pace so it seems featurelength believe me! There really isn't much to recommend it... you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star wading through a swamp. The ending is interesting... so I'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 DVD compilation at WalMart for five bucks. Hey it's well worth the money...".

	schema:headline " Dean Jagger has a Zombie Hairpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "OK maybe thats Dean's real hair but thats about the coolest ? thing in this middle of the road 30's horror flick. The plot has been described a thousand times here as well as talking about Lugosi's eyes so lets move on. What made a movie made then cool to watch now was stuff like Tesla coils and lots of test tubes and if your going to do a zombie flick zombies that look scary. Actually if they had done this right the zombies here would have been scarier than normal zombies because these zombies can mix in well with the population. Imagine if Dean had taken his army of zombies to England and taken over the palace? That would have been really cool! But no Dean has to forfeit his power to show his love to a chick who screwed him over earlier in the flick so I'm like screw that Dean kill her take the zombie army to England and take over the palace!. Anyway what the hell did he see in her she was kind of average at best no Fay Wray thats for sure more like Martha Reye. My input on the settings was it just me or did that native dancing girl look totally non oriental and more like a Brooklyn girl with that hook nose? She danced pretty good though just amazes me that they couldn't get an oriental woman to do that part maybe take one of the dancers from the Laurel and Hardy flick Sons Of The Desert when they are dancing to Honolulu Baby remember that one? Those were some hotties hot cha cha! I give this lame zombie flick a 5 of 10 it had some real promise. Mask of Fu Manchu blows it away.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is something like a sequel of White Zombie since it is made by the same man Halperin and features zombies. Halperin the George A. Romero of his day fails to deliver with this one though.We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free. Also a love interest for the evil man.Where this film really excels is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on.I would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk but this film just did not deliver. And no strong villain like Bela Lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect but misleading as he is never in the film... why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes? Overall a film that could be a great one with a little script reworking and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same postwar time frame. Heck if they can fix up The Hills Have Eyes then this film has hope.".

An expedition sets out tor the longlost backprojected city of KennifAngor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands.It is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden. Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on 'How to Act'  Chapter Three Emotions How to express fear and loathing Female Clench both fists. Place fist of one hand on heart. Open mouth as it to scream. Place other fist palm out against mouth. Hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob.How to have difficult heavily emotionally charged scene with exfianc explaining your love for someone else. Do NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotion. Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall. To give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors. Thus 35 minute's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes.The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow! Released from mental bondage the armies of exzombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window. Yea... let's... oh I dunnno yeah. Let's get him grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed  manana. though I have just found a bit of hidden symbolism. Jagger is shot by a Native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the Natives being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick. see even downtrodden Natives don't want the end of the White Race! The chase it you can call it that through the backprojected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time camping it up but is totally wasted as Col. Mazovia.There is one interesting moment in this film. A nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell. face after face crossfade into one another. It works though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut. I guess these must be Neg Cutters' frames between the fades.Best watched with friends and in a silly mood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what you'd expect from a movie made today though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque an officer in the French Army of World War I who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons or zombies who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain. At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually French General Duval George Cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it.The story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving Louque Duval's daughter Claire Dorothy Stone and Clifford Grayson Robert Noland all a part of the expedition. When Louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve Grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power. That advice begins to transform Louque particularly after he's successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city. Having followed a temple priest into a swamp Louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though it's not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication. All it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control. This comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking Grayson's early advice as he comments to his servant Buna we're learning to be ruthless.Fans of early B horror flicks will recognize the use of Bela Lugosi's signature eye stare plucked from the 1932 film White Zombie also from director Victor Halperin. Of the two movies White Zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in it's depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening. In Revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor's commands. In fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when Louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for Claire they overrun his compound and kill him in the process.Not to be too harsh on the film it plays out decently within the parameters of it's story outline but if you're thinking zombies!!! within the traditional context you'll probably be disappointed. If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned White Zombie with Bela Lugosi is the way to go.".

When a successful demonstration frightens the French as much as the enemy the priest is locked up to save mankind from his power. While confined the priest is killed by someone looking to learn the secret. The French are frightened that someone else might learn the secret of zombies and sends an expedition to Cambodia to find any trace of the secret so it can be safeguarded. Unfortunately one of the men sent on the expedition discovers the secret just as his love life goes south and he begins to put his new found power to a dark purpose.If that sounds exciting you might want to try this clunky little film though be warned it turns dull for the middle stretch. Starting with a bang this movie hooks you with the premise of a zombie army fighting in the trenches of the western front and then crashes into a ditch as the plot shifts to Cambodia and becomes for a good chunk of its running time a soapy love story. Its not terrible but but doesn't belong in a horror movie. If you cut the love story out you'd have a great 30 minute horror film. The romance while a motivating factor for what follows ends up being more filler than vital plot material.Not the all time turkey that some people have labeled it this is a movie that has a great start and great end but clunky middle. If you can get past that middle you'll probably find yourself liking this movie if not you're in for a long night at the movies.".

This is the case with Revolt of the Zombies which supposedly 'follows' the far superior 'White Zombie' of 1932. The tenuous connections in this case are that both films were made by the Halperin Brothers and both feature zombies. An even more tenuous connection is that the great Bela Lugosi starred in the first film whilst here only his eyes intermittently appear on screen as the zombies of the title are created.The gist of the story is that a Cambodian priest has the power to turn men into zombies aptly demonstrated at the beginning by having them battle against the enemy in the First World War. Unfortunately the allied commanders are so appalled by the threat of zombies taking over the world that when he refuses to reveal his secrets they imprison him. After his murder an expedition is launched to Cambodia in order to find and destroy the means of zombification.The plot becomes more complicated with the development of a love triangle between our three main protagonists. Our hero Armand Lougue Dean Jagger is a man of honour and integrity his brash friend Clifford Grayson Robert Noland has a philosophy of taking what he wants at any cost and their love interest Claire Duval Dorothy Stone is a manipulative twotimer quite willing to play both men off against each other.Our hero and heroine become engaged only for her to break it off citing her love for his friend. Disillusioned he embarks on a lone but successful crusade to find the secret. As the story develops his metamorphosis into a madman intent on ruling the world with a zombie army is matched by the change in both his friend and the heroine who sacrifice their mutual love in order to ensure each others' survival.Amazingly this is all packed into slightly over one hour  and this would seem to be where the problem lies. The short running length does not justify the complicated plot structures nor does it give time for proper character development. Other cast members despite their importance to plot seem to be peripheral  Roy D'Arcy for instance as the villainous Mazovia. Whilst Dean Jagger had a long Hollywood history Claire Duval appeared in only six productions and this was Robert Noland's only film appearance. Stock footage and some rather shoddy sets along with rather inapt musical accompaniment certainly do not help. Despite this there are good moments to be had although anybody expecting a classic zombie film will feel disappointed which probably goes some way to explaining the low overall vote.Other than some rather oldfashioned  almost as if it were a silent film  acting I like other reviewers noted that there seemed to be some editing issues where scenes were cut almost before completion. Whilst there is no production information available it is possible that the original version of this film was cut down for some reason prior to release. We can but wait in expectation and hope...".

However I didn't get this one mostly because Lugosi wasn't in it.Finally after skipping this title nearly a hundred times year after year I finally decided to shell out the eight bucks and sit in horror of pure nonsense and honestly it wasn't that bad. In fact there are some redeeming qualities in this. It reminds me a bit of another good independent effort from the year before Condemned to Live. And the acting is certainly not any worse than in White Zombie minus of course the huge Lugosi charisma.Needless to say the Halperin brothers employed many of the same cinematic styles from their previous zombie hit. Gone though is the heavy music this time less influential stock music is used. Gone also are the split screen wipes that made some of the imagery in the previous film so memorable. But this is still a typicallooking low budget horror from 1936. No better but no worse.What the problem must be is reputation. This film seems to have some undeserving bullseye on its' head because it is the followup to White Zombie. The truth is another soontobe bankrupt studio produced this film and did as good a job on it as any other poverty row horror production up to that time.If you look up other EXTREMELY SIMILAR low budget horrors from the 30s many of which I have suffered through this one has by far the worst IMDb rating. It only proves that the weighted average is no safety against ballot stuffers  it is equally damaging when only 25 of the people vote below the weighted average and 75 is above. It feels like Bush Gore all over again.  610  2 12 stars.".

Zombies in this early movie are just people who are hypnotized to follow a person's commands  not the dead risenhow this trend started I'm not sure. Anyway this movie is about a gift that the Cambodians have of making their soldiers follow commands to kill relentlessly and how an American attains that power and uses it for his own purposes. This past statement and a love triangle are the core of the movie. Two friends are investigating this power when a woman steps in the way and mesmerizes one of them first then the other. The first man's jeolousy brings him to use the power he finds from the ruins to bring her back to him. The movie is slow at times and sometimes not acted well but it is captivating nonetheless because of it's story. I'm surprised the movie hasn't been remade because it would make the good basis for a modern redo. It's really a love story with kind of a monster movie sidestorysimilar to Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde except with a hypnotizing mad man.

This is about zombies in a more psychological sense where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will but who must instead follow the will of another. The zombies here as little as they are in the film are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general as in wartime. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.The film is set during World War I. A French Cambodian contingent had heard strange stories about zombificationsupposedly Angkor Wat was built by utilizing zombiesand there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. Armand Louque Dean Jagger brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification but he won't talk. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to wipe out the white race.One of the odd things about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems like maybe writerdirector Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The film begins as if it will explore the zombiemilitary metaphor and maybe even have adventure elements but after about 15 minutes it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.Halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power and a Nietzschean will to power. The film is interesting on that level but the script and the editing are very choppy. This is yet another older film for which I wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.Amidst the contrived romance story Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread but little of the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification but it doesn't mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusingHalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of Bela Lugosi's googlyeyes from his 1932 film White Zombie but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot including the love story. Promising interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. One potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much.If you're a big fan of old creaky B movies Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least oncethe acting isn't all that bad and if you've got a good imagination you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps. But this is the second time I've seen the film with the first only being about five years ago and I could barely recall anything about itso it's not exactly memorable.".

There was a court battle with the White Zombie film's rights owners who didn't want the Halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie' in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word 'Zombie' appear in the title.

This Revolt of the Zombies could have been another example but unfortunately it's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies I ever saw. Dreadful acting a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid lovestory intrigues and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots. The lead actress Dorothy Stone textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Unlucky again. If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes you'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Still this is far too little to give this film a positive rating let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else.".

First for old movie fans it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger no relation to Mick. While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair I never saw him this way before and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman whose first movie THE SILVER CHALICE is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all. The writing is bad the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus once they leave the water their costumes are 100 dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the filmso much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the filmsince both of them starred in many gradez horror films. In many ways this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.So while giving it a 3 is probably a bit overgenerous it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans.".

	schema:headline " A comedown from White Zombie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Made by the producing  directing team of Edward and Victor Halperin who'd previously made the landmark horror film White Zombie this followup rather than sequel concerns an expedition into the heart of Cambodia to find and destroy the process that can create zombies. One would think that an interested party would desire the process so that they could contrive a zombie army but one weak individual Armand Louque Dean Jagger just wants to be with the woman he loves Dorothy Stone. She desires another man Clifford Grayson Robert Noland.Revolt of the Zombies is a lot less interesting than its predecessor. White Zombie was far more atmospheric and stylish. This is a plodding affair that moves much too slowly for a film that only runs 63 minutes long in the first place. The love triangle takes up too much of the run time and horror elements are practically nonexistent. There ARE some effective visuals to be sure but the story gets bogged down in talk too often. Only the sequence in which Armand noses around on his own has any real juice. Even the finale is much less ethereal than the finish of the first film. Fans of White Zombie may appreciate the frequent use of the haunting image of Bela Lugosis' eyes which figured so prominently in that feature. And there is one amusing shot in which we see bullets penetrate a zombie chest in the days before squibs were commonplace.The performances are nothing special for the most part. Roy D'Arcy IS an entertainingly malevolent antagonist but Jagger is kind of dull. The presence of a villain as intense and charismatic as Lugosi is sorely missed. Teru Shimada You Only Live Twice earns some sympathy as the victimized Buna.Check out this movie if you must but you're better off just revisiting White Zombie instead.Four out of 10.".

	schema:headline " This is Not Really a Zombie Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not really a zombie film if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around. Here the protagonist Armand Louque played by an unbelievably young Dean Jagger gains control of a method to create zombies though in fact his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves. This is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of 'Dr. Mabuse' films including 'Dr. Mabuse the Gambler' 1922 and 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse' 1933. Here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiance Claire Duvall played by the Anne Heche look alike with a bad hairdo Dorothy Stone which is really the major theme.The movie has an intriguing beginning as Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there. At some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to Claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal Clifford Greyson Robert Noland. It's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact. This would have been a great movie for 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' if they hadn't already roasted it.It's never shown how Louque actually learns the 'zombification' secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards. We won't see such sheer force of will until John Agar in 'The Brain From Planet Arous' 1957.Finally Claire consents to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On their wedding night he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers.' To gain her love he does so causing the 'revolt' of the title in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him. Greyson embraces Claire and we seem to be at the end of a parable Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad. So really then it's not that bad of a film despite the low IMDb rating it currently has. On repeated viewings ? one can see the artistry in the well formed script! Dean Jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness  is that really his own hair? We remember him more for his bald old man roles in 'White Christmas' 1954 'X The Unknown' 1956 and 'King Creole' 1958. The story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better earlier film 'White Zombie' 1932 in which hapless Robert Frazier as Charles Beaumont uses 'zombification' to win the love of Madge Bellamy as Madeline Parker.If you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds! I'd start with 'White Zombie' 1932 'King of the Zombies' 1941 'I Walked with a Zombie' 1943 'Night of the Living Dead' 1968 'The Last Man on Earth' 1964 and its two remakes. In the modern era of classy films there are 'Horror Express' 1972 'The Serpent and the Rainbow' 1988 '28 Days Later' 2002 and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mention.This one is not really a zombie film. Judging this movie on its own terms it's more of a semiGothic romance. As such it ranks a little below some of Universal's bottom billed B horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s. So I'll give it a 5.".

A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker  maybe too much in this case.  And the plot isn't easy to follow  Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably.  Although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to archaeologically investigate.  The key to longdistance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots. To prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he shouldn't have done 'cause once they're all unzombiefied many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again. Below average even with precautionary forethought.  Recommended for only the extremely patient.".

How much longer? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development  especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously.That's staggering what could the Halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here? Their previous film White Zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films The Mummy Dracula etc. and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in North America would know from popular magazines.Revolt of the Zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war. This would not only explain the opening and the change of Dean Jagger's character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders  they're just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films.I am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics  but I think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational.

This is how I entertained myself throughout most of the movie.I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what it's worth I'll give it a 210. I won't go to 110 because believe it or not I've seen worse.".

This is how I entertained myself throughout most of the movie.I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what it's worth I'll give it a 210. I won't go to 110 because believe it or not I've seen worse.";

I saw this film for the first time recently and for years the little I knew about REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES came from an article by the then teenage Joe Dante jr. titled The Fifty Worst Horror Movies in a 1960's issue of Famous Monsters Of Film Land. While I would not consider it the worst horror movie ever made REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is pretty bad its dismal confusing and unconvincing. I was shocked to discover that this film was from the Halperin Brothers who had a few years before produced the creepy and stylish WHITE ZOMBIE with Bela Lugosi.The film opens up with a platoon of zombie French IndoChinese troops fighting the Austrians in World War One. The tale of the zombie squad interests former French WW1 vet turned archaeologist Armand Louque. There is some confusing discussions about keeping the secret of creating zombies from the world and some cloak and dagger stuff involving a sneaky oriental scientist and a Cambodian mystic. When the woman Louque loves decides to marry another man Louque searches to ruins of Angkor for the secret of creating Zombies. Discovering the secretthe method is never really made clear Louque turns his Cambodian servant several of his colleagues and an entire platoon of French IndoChinese troops into zombies. All this happens very quickly as to make the viewer wonder if something has been left out. Anyway creating zombies under his control is supposed to lure the woman he loves back into his arms. How creating a zombie army is supposed to help mend his love life is unclear  perhaps she goes for men with supernatural powers. Everyone seems only mildly annoyed with Louques new found skills  nobody seems to really consider the ramifications of Louque's new powers. Suddenly he gets pangs of guilt about what he is doing and releases the zombies from his control which results in the revolt of the title wrapping things up all to quickly and neatly.It's a shame that the Halperin brothers did not bring any of the flair or imagination they brought to WHITE ZOMBIE for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES. The film plods along and then speeds up with everything happening so fast without explanation leaving the viewer confused and with the impression things were left out. About the only interest REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES has is its French Colonial setting and the presence of a very young Dean Jagger. His performance here is perfunctory and gives no indication of the fine actor he would later become. The best one can say about REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is that it is undistinguished.".

	schema:reviewBody "IFrom the very first sequence this is a starkly shot film with a very unique visual signature to everything you see. A desolate exotic locale for a movie the North African desert. But this desert setting is perfectly in accord with the refreshing cinematic technique of Michelangelo Antonioni who always stressed economy. Just as in his other works there are no unnecessary ornaments or frills here. He introduces us to the strange existential story in this film and its odd solitary lead character in as clean pure and undiluted terms as possible. The principle here is that 'less is more'.Some people really dislike this about Antonioni. He uses his camera in such a quiet way and there is just this single very terse figureground relationship which is the focus of his attention. But I think he knows that character stands out with more relief when its set against a minimalist background. Here because characterization is channeled through Jack Nicholson far better even than in 'Blowup' with David Hemmings its more than enough. The brevity and scarcity in the film funnels you straight into Nicholson's awesome talent. We are along with him for the ride.The plot starts out cryptically and simply with very little explained about the man the camera spends so much time on. Jack Nicholson is a reporter named David Locke and he is covering an African civil war. But beyond this you must infer most everything else about him from just what you seejust by observing his behavior and nothing else. There is scant dialogue of any kind. The depth of Nicholson's character is conveyed in miniscule components parsed out after long intervals. His overall demeanor is weary frustrated sullen the typical traveler who cant get good service. But he is also dispirited with his mission and in a way despondent about his whole future and way of life.Then suddenly he sheds his persona and takes on someone elses'. He is staying in an isolated hotel and a man in the next room dies accidentallyand Nicholson decides to trade identities with the corpse leaving the hotel with this new identity and letting everyone think it is he who has died. It's the personal reasons for this act which Antonioni explores throughout the rest of the movie the consequences and responsibilities incurred when you gamble upon coincidence and invest in random chance.II'Passenger' follows the progress of a man through a personal crisis an identity transformation. The film is split with a Dopplershift down the meridian of the identity theft Nicholson commits. His problems after this act consist of trying to make sure his exwife and employers continue to assume he is dead and deciding how much of the false man's life and business to play at.With the plot as its laid out this way we might not ever really ever know the full reasons why Locke exchanged personality for that of another. But Antonioni adds some really clever flourishes since Locke was a news journalist the video interviews he conducted up to the point of his 'death' are available both to the people who begin to hunt him and to us. We actually see more of Locke revealed in these flashbacks than we do in realtime. It adds just the right note. We get a better idea of the reasoning behind this bold act why he casually gave up his whole history on a whim.In his assignments up to this side trip to North Africa we discern that Locke is dissatisfied with 'the rules' governing his profession. He is a talented observer and wants to be a good reporter. But he finds all the news he gathers is in a way preconstrained by cultural filters. Its not raw enough instead its already been processed for him. In other words he is never getting the real story as long as he is a reporter people frame their information for him as a reporter. As long as he is an Anglo people treat him as an Anglo.But after the identityshedding transformation he is free and he has the time of his life. Returning to London Locke amusedly begins playing the role of the dead man keeping his engagements carrying out business deals. Theres no accountability he is pretending to be someone else. Only one thing the dead man was an arms dealer and Nicholson is getting into deep trouble by masquerading this way. His philosophical pleasure may be cut short sooner than he expects. He doesnt see the trouble coming his way but we do. Its a sort of combination of film noir and roadtrip movie here and it works.IIIThings begin to unravel. Shady customers start to dog his footsteps. Growing increasingly edgy as he continues to follow the strange itinerary Nicholson hooks up by coincidence with a young architecture student backpacking through Spain wellplayed by petite dusky sensual Maria Schneider. They're an odd pair but their joining forces makes one of a most intriguing screen romances of the period. She isn't given much to do in the screenplay but makes a wonderful calming presence to the brittle Nicholson. Her character insists that Locke should in all rationality continue his journeyshe is rigorous about principles. Locke acquiesces and he continues on down along the coast of Spain towards Africa again on his fool's errands to meet his fate.I wont expose any more of the plot. But I will say the final sequence of this movie is extremely startling and powerful. I had never even heard about it in my opinion it should be talked about much much more. Totally daring and innovative. Antonioni really shows what he can do hereyou simply have to see it.There are some flaws yes a few of Antonioni's flashbacks come off lame and awkward too abrupt. They're really irksome. And there is a sloppy element in the final denoument which I still cant understand the drivers school vehicle. I yearn for the movie to be recut to remove these failings. But its still very satisfying as is.IVThe bottom line here is that Nicholson has in this film a showcase for his talents like few other projects I have seen him in. This film was made in 1975 just a year after 'Chinatown' and the same year as his cameo in The Who's Tommy' and his lead role in Milos Foreman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Jack is quite young fit and goodlooking when he made this film. Its rewarding to remember him as he was then before he both let himself go somewhat physically and also began playing so many 'sick horny focker' roles. This is one of the highlights of his entire life's work imho. Easily as memorable as Jake Gittes or MacMurphy.Jack is careful to do a good job in this movieperhaps at this point in his career he was still worried about major goofups. Its definitely prior to the point where he began to 'coast'. It looks like he took this film seriouslyand probably enjoyed it immensely. Anyway what other actor do you know today that could walk away with a difficult role like this one an actor who would be as supremely interesting to us as Nicholson is in many scenes in this film doing not much of anything for long moments at a time?I doubt even DeNiro could have succeededhe would have played it too 'toughguy' and added too much gesture. Its Nicholson's laconic dry twang his sardonic gestures and those bored squinty seenitall eyes that makes it work. There is a worldweariness about him in this performance that is quite special. The weight of past experiences exudes strongly from him and its just what Antonioni needed. This quality defined him for this role like no other contemporary actor of his time.Anyway in this flick you know he is doomed but you aren't really sure how Antonioni is going to do it. Antonioni creates massive tension with that very economical severe camera style and almost no music. There are many scenes where the only sounds are the background noises from the environment itself you can practically see Nicholson's sweat hear his breath and feel his pulse. Nicholson surely very aware of this tight focus on him maintains a rigid grip on his character throughout the film.He isn't at all cockyhis special trait is his vulnerability. Nicholson always seems tough on the outside but also as if he can still be hurt as we see here and in Chinatown as well. Its a vulnerability very like Bogart's in 'Casablanca'. In fact if this film had been made in a previous generation as Gene Siskel once claimed there would have been no there actor besides Bogart who could have even pulled it off. But no matter what its great to see Nicholson on his own competing with no other strong castmembers just cruising along as a lone insecure American among hostile and unfriendly foreigners.His characterization is superbly restrained and unshowy his gestures and expressions are as bland as possible and there are no wildly quotable lines or speeches any Nicholson fan should view this film for this reason alone. Anyway by the end of the flick you are positioned so closely alongside Nicholsonso wrapped up in his fatethat the brilliant lowkey finale can take you by surprise and it leaves a terrific poignancy.In short there are many reasons to like this film. I heartily recommend it. Its easily the best movie I have seen in some time. Its essential for appreciating both Nicholson and Antonioni. I encourage you to rent this movie on VHS as I am sure you will relish it as well.".

Because in these years the Italian director made his most accessible works Blow Up 1966 Zabryskie point 1969 and Professione reporter The Passenger 1974. These films contain more action and more situations. They are neither more commercial nor more mainstream but they talk about an adventure or a dream.A journalist in North Africa switches the identity with a dead man who looks like him. He does this to escape from his life and for living a more interesting one. But he'll pay for his choice...It's difficult to say but this Antonioni movie with his recurrent themes and in a smaller way times has a lot of suspense if I can say so. Once you begin to watch it you can't give up. The funny thing is that nothing really big or special happens sometimes it seems a road movie sometimes it is a typical Antonioni analysis of the society. Jack Nicholson how young he was at that time! fills the film his performance and his expressions are brilliant. It's also interesting the chemistry with Maria Schneider the lady of The last tango in Paris an actress who never got the fame and the recognition she deserved.Cinematography is fantastic. But above all the big surprise of the film is the final shot a 78 minutes take without cuts absolute amazing. It's not describable it's a must!".

It's also interesting the chemistry with Maria Schneider the lady of The last tango in Paris an actress who never got the fame and the recognition she deserved.Cinematography is fantastic. But above all the big surprise of the film is the final shot a 78 minutes take without cuts absolute amazing. It's not describable it's a must!";

	schema:reviewBody "One of Jack Nicholson's best but also least known films The Passenger' or Professione Reporter' is a haunting examination of the desire to escape and start afresh and is without doubt Antonioni's best English language film eclipsing both Blowup' and Zabriskie Point'. Nicholson's role as a worldweary television journalist David Locke isn't a particularly demanding one but it is fascinating to see him give a performance so different from anything else we have seen from him and one which is much better than the horny little devil efforts he has sadly specialised in since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.Some may find the opening twenty minutes of the film where there is virtually no dialogue hardgoing but this perfectly illustrates the sparse and confusing environment of the North African desert where the film begins. We are also treated to a  marvellous scene between Locke and the man whose identity he  later assumes where a tape recording and flashback are ingeniously merged into one and then separated again. Antonioni creates a mood that is almost indefinable throughout a kind of hollow detachment which is exactly the perspective that Locke has on the world which has gradually worn him down yet the director still manages to conjure up power and simple romance between Locke and the girl he meets who is played by Maria Schneider. The film was not a hit at the boxoffice which is not surprising considering it's uncommercial style but artistically and cinematically it is a triumph of innovation.".

	schema:reviewBody "We join David Locke Jack Nicholson at a particularly low point in his life. He is alone in the wilderness lost and frustrated. Unhappy with his life he discovers the corpse of a fellow hotel guest and promptly decides to take on the guy's identity.I'd like to enquire about flights Locke asks a hotel clerk. He seeks to escape his past. Later in the film as he rides a cable cart Locke spreads his arms and soars like a bird. He's flying finally enjoying a brief moment of freedom.The theme of identity and Locke's name itself immediately recalls the writings of English philosopher John Locke. Locke believed in the concept of the tabula rasa or blank slate. He believed that it was our experiences that defined us as people and that the only way to escape who we are is to effectively erase our history and cut ourselves off from experiences.Throughout his writings Locke emphasised the individual's freedom to author his or her own soul. Each individual was free to define his character but his basic identity as a member of the human species could not be altered. So Locke had two ideas at war. Firstly the belief that the individual was free to author his own life and secondly the belief that human nature is rigid and unchangeable. It is from this presumption of a free self authored mind combined with a sense of rigid human nature that the Lockean doctrine of natural rights is derived.In Antonioni's film Nicholson articulates these ideas himself. He is trapped between wanting to be free and having to fulfil dutiesrolestasks embedded in the new persona he has acquired. While responding to a comment that all PLACES are the same he even argues that it's actually the PEOPLE that are the same. That everyone conforms to specific cultural archetypes. The film's original title Profession Reporter highlights this point best.Nicholson's character is desperate to escape this. Like his character in Five Easy Pieces he wants some unmappable freedom. He wants to be an individual. Beyond this though he wants to stay blank. In what is perhaps the film's most joyous moment a female character asks Locke what he's running from. He tells her to turn her back to the front of the car. What occurs next is an instant of spontaneous elation and giddy happiness as she watches the road rush away behind them.But what people fail to notice during this scene is that she is in fact watching the past. By facing her previous experiences which Locke refuses to do she is happy. Happiness comes from her memories and past encounters while Locke is miserable simply because he refuses to acknowledge his past experiences.Throughout the film Locke is asked whether he thinks the landscape is beautiful. Once he answers no another time he absent mindedly answers yes but Antonioni stresses that Locke is really not paying attention. Locke intentionally avoids absorbing beauty or new experiences in an effort to remain in a constant state of rebirth.These themes are culminated in a brilliant blind man story towards the end of the film. Locke a journalist who specialises in seeing and recording the truth is painfully attuned to what he calls the dirt of the world. As such he chooses to remain blind. A blank slate.Antonioni is particularly good at endings and the final shot of The Passenger really elevates the whole film. Like the dead man whose identity he took on Locke dies alone and face down in a bed. His ex wife pops up and states that she never knew him but nobody seems to care.910 A great film worth two viewings. It captures a profound sense of isolation and sadness. Antonioni's camera seems to capture the immense tiredness of the body. Rather than portray experiences he shows what remains of past experiences. He shows what comes afterwards when everything has been said. The middle portion of the film is slow and seems to be lacking some sort of superficial drama but things build nicely and the final payoff well is worth the wait.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is from a feature I wrote 30 years ago when 30 myself on The Passenger for a now defunct London film magazine Films Illustrated where readers could discussanalysedeconstruct favourite movies before the age of video and DVD!. I am revisiting it now that The Passenger is available again after a 20 year disappearance. However as I am limited to 1000 words I have had to edit The Passenger will remain a film of the mid '70s as one of Antonioni's previous films BlowUp remains a film for and symbolises the '60s. It also contains one of Jack Nicholson's definitive performances along with Chinatown The Last Detail and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and has perhaps been a trifle overshadowed by these films all emerging within a short period of time of each other and the enormous publicity and wordofmouth they have generated. But The Passenger has proved itself a strangely durable film and like Chinatown one that will remain around for a long time both in the consciousness of its admirers and one hopes constant revivals.Antonioni's third Englishspeaking film The Passenger like BlowUp and Zabriskie Point centres around the oblique unresolved aspects of life. In Antonioni's films  as in life  there are no easy answers things are not tidied up explained sorted out.So it is with The Passenger. Jack Nicholson is Locke an outwardly successful television journalist but he also is being eaten away by his own disillusionment with the job and the value of his interviews and that general malaise that affects Antonioni's people. When the film begins we find him on location in Chad where his jeep breaks down and gets bogged in the sand. Locke breaks down and collapses on the sand as the camera pans away over the strange but beautiful desert panorama.We next see Locke in an advanced state of exhaustion struggling back to his hotel and a cool shower and discovering that the man in the next room who looks rather like him has died. We are very conscious of the stillness in the hotel  the blue walls a fly buzzing the noise of the fan Locke staring intently at the dead man on the bed. We hear their dialogue of the previous evening and the aural flashback changes to a visual one by some very neat editing. Locke changes rooms passport photos and luggage and finds it quite easy to take on a new identity. How desperate his need is can be judged by his conversations back in Europe with the free liberated girl Maria Schneider he meets up with. I used to be somebody else but I traded him in. She incidentally is freer than Locke could ever be.It transpires Locke has taken over the identity of a gunrunner Robertson. Perhaps it is best not to go into the plot in too much detail. Best all round just to pick out some of the marvellous moments along the way to the final breathtaking conceit. There's Locke back in London daringly visiting his old haunts  delighting in being someone else but of course he isn't. Later on he is suspended in a cable car high about the ocean his arms outstretched like a bird in flight. Later still the girl asks him what he is running from and he tells her to turn around and we see what she sees  the road behind them.By now we the audience are caught up in this mesmerising film and its deliberations of he mysteries of identity. We are now totally involved in Locke's plight. He has given up one identity for another and becomes more and more helpless as the situation gets out of his control. Finally in a remote Spanish hotel he can go no further either as himself or as his new identity as his wife and the gunrunners close in on him. One shouldn't spoil the last sequence for those still to see it but it shows the only real freedom from identity and self is in death. The final scene shows us the aftermath as the sun goes down the hotelkeeper comes out for a walk a woman sits in the doorway resting. For some people who do not question their existence the continuity of life goes on.Antonioni now in his sixties is one of the great Italian directors who like Fellini and Visconti burst upon the international film scene in the late '50s. His trilogy of Italian films L'Avventura La Notte and L'Eclisse and his first colour film The Red Desert all with Monica Vitti contributed to the renaissance of the European cinema. Then he switched to his Englishspeaking films of which BlowUp was the first. He is as much a master of landscape as John Ford was in his genre. He thinks nothing of painting whole streets or trees to get the effect he wants. BlowUp is the only film from the whole crazy period of Swinging London films that has not dated and which encapsulates what it was really all about. It remains one of the great films. Like Bergman Bunuel or Fellini you either respond to his vision or reject it totally. His images linger on in the mind his work never dates.That is what part of what I wrote in 1976 and The Passenger indeed remains endlessly fascinating and particularly so now that it is available again. Even at the Antonioni retrospective in 2005 it was not available to include in the season but we did have cast members Jenny Runacre and Steve Berkoff there to speak warmly of it's making and importance.Let's hope a new generation will discover its timeless appeal and amazingly Antonioni now in his 90s is still with us if rather frail. A 2005 short of his was shown last year on the great statue of Moses in Rome and was also in its own way fascinatingly mysterious.".

How desperate his need is can be judged by his conversations back in Europe with the free liberated girl Maria Schneider he meets up with. I used to be somebody else but I traded him in. She incidentally is freer than Locke could ever be.It transpires Locke has taken over the identity of a gunrunner Robertson. Perhaps it is best not to go into the plot in too much detail. Best all round just to pick out some of the marvellous moments along the way to the final breathtaking conceit. There's Locke back in London daringly visiting his old haunts  delighting in being someone else but of course he isn't. Later on he is suspended in a cable car high about the ocean his arms outstretched like a bird in flight. Later still the girl asks him what he is running from and he tells her to turn around and we see what she sees  the road behind them.By now we the audience are caught up in this mesmerising film and its deliberations of he mysteries of identity. We are now totally involved in Locke's plight. He has given up one identity for another and becomes more and more helpless as the situation gets out of his control. Finally in a remote Spanish hotel he can go no further either as himself or as his new identity as his wife and the gunrunners close in on him. One shouldn't spoil the last sequence for those still to see it but it shows the only real freedom from identity and self is in death. The final scene shows us the aftermath as the sun goes down the hotelkeeper comes out for a walk a woman sits in the doorway resting. For some people who do not question their existence the continuity of life goes on.Antonioni now in his sixties is one of the great Italian directors who like Fellini and Visconti burst upon the international film scene in the late '50s. His trilogy of Italian films L'Avventura La Notte and L'Eclisse and his first colour film The Red Desert all with Monica Vitti contributed to the renaissance of the European cinema. Then he switched to his Englishspeaking films of which BlowUp was the first. He is as much a master of landscape as John Ford was in his genre. He thinks nothing of painting whole streets or trees to get the effect he wants. BlowUp is the only film from the whole crazy period of Swinging London films that has not dated and which encapsulates what it was really all about. It remains one of the great films. Like Bergman Bunuel or Fellini you either respond to his vision or reject it totally. His images linger on in the mind his work never dates.That is what part of what I wrote in 1976 and The Passenger indeed remains endlessly fascinating and particularly so now that it is available again. Even at the Antonioni retrospective in 2005 it was not available to include in the season but we did have cast members Jenny Runacre and Steve Berkoff there to speak warmly of it's making and importance.Let's hope a new generation will discover its timeless appeal and amazingly Antonioni now in his 90s is still with us if rather frail. A 2005 short of his was shown last year on the great statue of Moses in Rome and was also in its own way fascinatingly mysterious.";

It is a fascinating plot with many twists and turns but most of all the cinematography is unsurpassed. It is shot in London Germany and Northern Africa and is a joy to watch evoking images from Lawrence of Arabia. I knew the director Michelangel Antonioni from film classics such as Blow Up and Zabriskie Point which attracted attention from 1960's cinema critics for interpreting the social scene of that period. The movie has minimal dialogue but is crafted scene by scene with great artistry. It is a movie that I can enjoy again quite easily.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Passenger Professione reporter is a tour de force of visual story telling. While there is more dialog and the plot makes more sense than many other Michelangelo Antonioni films it first and foremost uses filmmaking as a medium to tell its story. The camera is always our eye taking in sweeping panoramas of the North African desert to an architectural tour of European churches and an appreciation of the variegated urban and rural landscapes of Moorish Spain still showing relics of older invasions where it all comes together as we literally go from dust to dust. We are the passengers on this existential trip to try and change identities through someone else's travels logging almost as many locations as an outlandish Bond film .Because so much of the film is dispassionately observational about natural landscape and cityscape and windswept plazas that provide imitations of nature within a city it stands up through time even as the 1975 clothes hair TV journalist technology and somewhat malefemale relationships look a bit dated and we can no longer assume that African guerrilla fighters and gun dealers helping them are more noble than the corrupt inheritors of colonialism. The camera is constantly picking out culture contrasts  camels vs. jeeps horsedrawn carriages blocking Munich traffic Gaudi's serpentine architecture vs. Barcelona's modern skyline a cable car gliding over a shimmering body of water.And of course the very American Jack Nicholson in a very European film with the many layers of meaning as he plays an adventurous broadcast reporter who ironically tries to escape the truth about himself. His young sexy challenging self is surprisingly effective here as we believe both his ethical lapses and his obsession. Avoiding the narration that a film today would utilize Antonioni well takes advantage of what now looks fairly primitive tapings of the reporter's past and current interviews to convey background and flashbacks on characters through minimal explication with overlapping sound and gliding visuals. The intertwined story lines constantly reemphasize the point of not really knowing a person or a culture from the outside with a repeated refrain of What do you see?. Maria Schneider's character skirts just this side of a male fantasy clich though Antonioni helped to create the type and a few subtle plot points save her from total disingenuous sex kitten femme fatale even as her character shrugs that one plot point is unlikely. Nicholson's repeated refrain to her of What the f are you doing with me? takes on different meanings as we know more.I'm not sure if this 2005 rerelease of the director's cut with supposedly nine minutes that were not in the original U.S. release is notably pristine as it wasn't particularly sharp but the director's trademark crystalline blue sky is still breathtaking and is a mustsee in a full screen rather than on DVD. The views practically feel like the old Cinemascope.A climactic landscape shot brings all the violent sensual philosophical and narrative plot and thematic points together in a marvelous way that has been much imitated but is still powerful as the camera looks out a window at a cool distance in the heat key events culminate back and forth frantically in front of the camera in and out of frame and the camera moves through the bars and is free to roam in ever more closeups.".

When the people come out of the hotel and get in their car the camera makes a loop back into the room again.

Antonioni is incredibly assured behind the camera and lets the story play out in its own time.

	schema:reviewBody "To paraphrase a famous Orson Welles quote what is there to say about a movie? Obviously a lot in most cases and sometimes nothing at all but how much of what we say can hope to encapsulate a movie as it is? This is the problem of memory inherited by cinema. How can memory hope to recall the world as it were? I'm not just waxing here. What I mean is this how can we communicate what we like about a movie essentially? That is to give something back that we have gleamed rather than simply take from it something which is a true reflection of what we have seen a true perception of that reflection of the world seen by the artist's eye.Antonioni's movie brings me to this doublebind not because it's a blank canvas filled with the inscrutable and peremptory for that reason also the eternal but because it's filled with so much life as I know it to be true. The simple profound joy I get from it is the awakening of the senses sensing the world with the entire body. A draught from an open window the scorching heat reflecting from the stones of a dusty Andalusian village the echo of footsteps reverberating in a giant hall this is why the film enthralls me. Not the dazzling Gaudi rooftop in Barcelona which is spectacle but the ordinary rooftop across the street with laundry in a hangwire fluttering in the wind.In a few scattered instances Antonioni ruminates about life through his characters but it feel superfluous because what can the mind say that is true in the presence of the sensing body? The film closes with a famous long shot slowly tracking out of a window. Outside we can see life play out in all its quiet meaningful mundanity. This is the film for me the awareness of a sense of place and a sense of time. Meaning I am in this place and time passes and the simple solace that follows it. Or maybe this. A character standing in a verandah in a dusty forgotten part of Africa looks out at the vastness of desert and says it feels like it's waiting for something. The film waits but not for a god to make his presence felt like in a Bergman movie but rather waits come what may. Metaphysical questions are rather absent or mute. The world is then a playground of possibilities where new personalities and new guises can be adopted where exciting espionage games with arm traffickers can be enacted.Jack Nicholson is not up to this though he will have to do. He's not his crazy self but when he wearily ruminates or even walks he can't help but have that natural smirk of the smug bastard. The quiet dignity of an Alain Delon would elevate the movie.I make it seem like The Passenger only observes but that's not quite so. In the amazing opening Antonioni gives us a full character with just a few sketches of camera. How the American hopes to make his presence felt in this strange African land now offering cigarettes or trying to teach a boy the word left when that presence is barely acknowledged. An African in a camel passing him by doesn't even aknowledge his presence in the same desert.Back to the conundrum expressed above all this may be true for me but does it describe the movie you saw or are about to?By way of answer an anecdote which I believe resonates deeply inside the film it tells the story of a Confucian scholar who came up to Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism and asked him to pacify his soul. Produce it and I will pacify it was Bodhidharma's reply. The Confucian said That is my trouble I cannot find it. And Bodhidharma said Your wish is granted.Something to meditate upon while watching this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost ten years after the heady successes of BlowUp 1966 revered Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni found himself in the North African desert with Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider shooting a strange lyrical flawed yet beautiful loversontherun film. That film was The Passenger 1975.Before I talk about the film itself lets take a little time to look at one of the most interesting aspects of its recent history its almost total disappearance from our screens of any kind. Jack Nicholson bought the original negative from MGM in 1983. For many years following this the film was made available to the public for screenings only at which the director himself would be present. No television home video or any other kind of broadcast was permitted. With Antonioni being a frail elderly man rarely well enough to travel to global festivals this meant the film was all but lost for an eager audience. Luckily however a new print of The Passenger has recently been released prior to a longawaited DVD release.Antonioni has been almost unique in his determination to leave the cinematic frame sparse empty of any external distractions. Even in BlowUp set in the colourful London of the swinging 60s a time where the city was at its most alive and chaotic there is rarely anything on screen beyond the absolute necessary. The Passenger is perhaps the greatest marriage between the story and the director's reserved style.It begins in North Africa. Nicholson plays a journalist named Locke seeking out rebel fighters to interview somewhere in the dusty heat of North Africa. No dialogue is contained within the opening scenes Locke does not understand the local language and people are forced to gesticulate wildly with makeshift sign language. He returns to his hotel where there is only one other guest. Finding this man dead Nicholson swaps identity with the corpse. There is no discernible reason for this decision  trained by more standard Hollywood fare we might expect him to be on the run from the police or maybe he owes a huge sum of money to the mob? Here there is nothing. He simply takes the dead man's passport and wears his clothes.Along his journey he meets a young girl Schneider who accompanies him in the American convertible rolling through the desert. As their travels continue the girl she is given no name in the film becomes frustrated with Locke's lack of direction. Thinking he has assumed the identity of another to give his life some sense of purpose some meaning she does not understand Locke's seemingly passive drifting. They are always in motion but never going to or from anywhere in particular.The film ends with one of the most impressive crane shots in cinema. A sevenminute single take that lingers in the viewer's mind like a childhood memory of a skilled conjurer's cardtrick. Locke is in another seedy hotel bedroom he falls back on to the bed exhausted. There is a window the world outside separated by iron bars. The camera inches slowly forward. We see a vast dusty vista a few cracked houses an old man is left against a wall like an unused puppet a child throws a ball a dog sniffs the ground a Fiat 500 ambles in and out of shot perhaps it is a driving lesson we wonder and suddenly we realise we are now outside. We have passed through the window and its iron bars. Exactly when this feat took place is hard to pin down. Also outside is Schneider who watches as two men men we recognise emerge from another car. We continue forward taking in everything that is happening in the hotel. Eventually we found ourselves back outside Locke's room looking in at the now inert body. Murdered.The Passenger is a hard film to describe so reliant on images and themes and completely devoid of the usual plot and character motivations as it is. It is however not a hard film to recommend. The unfortunate quarterofacentury hiatus it has been placed under has left it reinvigorated for a new audience. A new audience it so richly deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I'd like to complain about this film's lack of availability. It has been on VHS before and in this format I rented it. It is not available now though. It deserves to be on DVD. And if its director is not a good enough reason Michelangelo Antonioni it contains a masterful performance by Jack Nicholson who has a very large fan base. He has done so much great work in his career and The Passenger is among his very best right up there with Chinatown and The Shining.Anyway to discuss the merits of this film well it is in a style much akin to Michelangelo Antonioni's more famous films especially Blowup. Thus the average viewer will find it about as interesting as staring at a blank screen. European art films often are not goaloriented i.e. there is not a goal set up near the beginning of the film that the characters are trying to achieve until the end. The Passenger is a perfect example. It actually teases those who are used to goaloriented films by setting up a very intriguing premise one that could have worked wonders for a Hitchcock film in fact it is somewhat reminiscent of North by Northwest in its plot a man Jack Nicholson bored with his own life decides to trade his in for the life of another man who has just died. Nicholson looks like the dead man and the dead man had told him that he was basically a loner. This turns out not to be true. The dead man was an illegal arms dealer selling weapons to rebels in Africa. The police spies and Nicholson's friends from his previous life are all after him.Wow exciting huh? Nope not exactly. Antonioni is a great artist and has bigger themes to strive for.I have been studying Antonioni for a while now although his films are so hard to find that my studies have not gotten all that far. Nevertheless let me share an observance or two. slight SPOILERS aheadCharacters in Antonioni films have a tendency to disappear. Anna from L'Avventura being the immediate example I believe that she vanished on purpose. Not that I believe she got on a boat or committed suicide. I think she simply willed herself into nonexistence. Her life was going nowhere and she wanted desperately to nullify her relationship with her boyfriend Sandro. Thomas the hotshot fashion photographer of Blowup also decides to disappear in my opinion see my review of that film. He felt that his life had no point also.Now here is David Locke Nicholson. He is a liberal perhaps fashionablyliberal British reporterdocumentarian although he speaks with an American accent for he was educated there certainly the most ridiculous part of the film was this adhoc explanation who is doing an exposedocumentary on Africa's political climate. He plays by the rules of reporting only dropping subtle hints about the goverment's corruption in his interviews while he certainly knows the truth of the situation. He proves himself a hypocrite in a couple of scenes also when he admits to Robertson the man who will die and trade places with Locke that he has no clue how to communicate with them Robertson an arms dealer says simply that he offers them goods and they understand that. There is also an amazing scene where we see Locke interview an African folk doctor who hadstudied in Europe. He asks the man if he does and how he can still believe in his folk remedies when he has studied in a more sophisticated area of the world. The man replies You know I believe your questions demonstrate more about you than my answers will demonstrate about me. Here give me your camera and I will record you asking those same questions. We see Nicholson's nervous face as his own camera is turned towards him but we do not see him do what the man asked.When he trades places with Robertson he becomes the arms dealer. His goal had been to just escape his own life and maybe exist indifferently towards the world but now he jumps into someone else's life whose role in life is actually to do something about these African situations that Locke was almost pretending to care about.It becomes more intriguing as it goes on. I don't want to say everything and alas I am not finished interpreting it in my mind as of yet. I am giving the film a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "For such an enigmatic movie Professione Reporter features a thematically welltreaded path. A young slim Jack Nicholson in an understated performance sans the familiar shark's grin plays David Locke a celebrated respected Britishborn Americaneducated international reporter whose life has lost all sense of purpose this is Antonioni after all!. On finding a British arms dealer he knew now freshly dead in his hotel room in an unnamed remote African location Locke decides to take on the other man's identity and make the world believe that David Locke the journalist is dead. Why he does this is never explained though one can easily intuit it. Ultimately it doesn't really matter though one can guess it may have something to do with selfloathing the bitter irony is that taking on an arms dealer's identity is hardly more honourable!. In one memorable sequence Locke's wife Rachel who now believes herself to be a widow is watching a piece of footage featuring Locke interviewing an unnamed African leader. It stands out as one of the most acerbic polemics on journalism ever filmed. In it the camera is turned back onto Locke by his African interviewee after the latter loses his patience with the reporter's narrowminded Eurocentric vision betrayed by his lazy formulaic questions. The artifice of Locke's profession which on the contrary ought to be a search for truth is fully exposed in this scene as well as Locke's increasing disillusionment with his purpose in life. Despite its power and polemic against journalism Professione Reporter is also an understated movie from start to finish made for a grownup audience. Nothing is spelt out for you. However the movie is strewn throughout with powerful and evocative visual clues so it's nonetheless up to you as an attentive viewer to pick up the early scene of Locke's Jeep getting stuck in the African desert sand anyone? or even soak them up unconsciously. As with all Antonioni every shot in this movie is worthy of analysis and admiration. Bergman once said about the Italian that he could create some arresting individual images but was incapable of stringing them all together in the sequence of a palatable movie sorry Ingmar old man  as much as I feel in awe of your craft you're talking nonsense here. However I can't believe Antonioni once had the cheek to say he improvises each scene as he goes along see his IMDb quotes page. There isn't a chance in hell these meticulously crafted immaculately framed and composed movies are not also carefully premeditated. Clearly Antonioni was trying to start a myth about himself along the lines of the one about Mozart composing his music straight onto the page as dictated by God. In Professione Reporter I was especially in awe of the sequence involving the single long take from the window of Locke's last hotel room in an unnamed dusty Spanish village. Regarding Maria Schneider it truly is a shame she wasn't the star in a greater number of successful movies. Her ambiguity makes it very difficult to keep one's eyes off her when she's on screen. She looks like a cross between a boy a girl and something cutely apelike I mean it in a good way!.I would like to warn viewers of the inclusion of footage of a real execution  again this was a film within the film. Personally I found it very disturbing which is why I'm mentioning it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Passenger is a fascinating movie a cinematic and philosophical masterpiece. I love Antonioni and this is one of his best. I have watched it several times through the years each time opening for myself a new moment or a new meaning. The acting is superb and so is the camera work. The final scene that lasts for seven minutes without anything really happening is sublime. There is also a deep philosophical theme in the movie uniquely different from other films of the time that also show dissatisfied lost or marginalized characters. Much has been written about the existential symbolism of the film and it certainly pervades it on a grand scale. However there is an interesting aspect of this movie which sets it apart from other existentialist works. In a Sartrelike view a man is alienated from reality and does not feel welcome in the world nor connected with mankind. But in The Passenger it is David Locke's own life that is actually hostile to him. Let me try to explain what I mean. Like many people he is trying to run away from mundane reality the job that has been making him jaded the marriage that's lost its flame. However instead of making piecemeal changes he tries to replace his life as a whole  reject it and become someone else. And now it is life itself that's after him ready to punish him for violating the rules of engagement. It's as if he is just a vessel owned by life which destroys him as soon as he tries to take matters in his own hands.At some point in the movie David says that he used to be somebody else but traded him in by the way what a fabulous line. He boasts  he thinks he is in control of his life choices but will soon find out otherwise. What crushes him in the end is not fate or circumstances or his past that catches up with him  it is life itself ejecting an unruly passenger. Such juxtaposition of life with a man as a separate allpowerful entity is unique in the artistic portrayal of existential struggle. The original title of the movie in Italian was Profession Reporter. This title would have made perfect sense if the character was an estranged observer of life. However Jack Nicholson's character is truly a passenger  he is not in the driver's seat and his privileges are pretty limited. His connection to life is neither cordial nor caring the same way as there is no human connection between a train passenger and the train operator. David Locke has violated the rules and his ticket is canceled. The train will continue forward without him. Captivating and mysterious Maria Schneider plays The Girl. As David jumps from one city to another he keeps running into her. She is quite an ephemeral character floating from place to place seemingly not attached to any mundane or conventional activity like work or family. Having no name in the movie suits her character perfectly  one less connection to real life. Perhaps this is the only kind of people who David can interact with now and who can deal with him. When the police ask David's wife to identify his dead body she says she doesn't know him. It is true  he has become a complete stranger to her. But when they ask the girl if she knows David she says yes. Even though they have met only recently they seem to be people of the same kind. Perhaps like him the girl is also a passenger? Perhaps we all are.".

I've never heard how he hooked up with Anonioni. The film is both lush and stark. The desert scenes are so cold and depressing. Nicholson's character comes back to the hotel after a battle with Saharan sand and finds another reporter dead. Coincidentally they are very close in appearance and Nicholson who is full of angst and ennui decides to trade places with the dead man taking on his identity. Going rogue he finds himself in league with some really bad people. With the help of Maria Schneider Last Tango in Paris he manages to stay ahead of both his wife who thought he was dead and those who would do him harm. At least for a while. The cinematography is quite astounding here. The movie makes one uncomfortable because there is the tension that occurs when possible identification is around every corner. To me this is quite an amazing product of one of Italy's most creative directors.".

I'm not saying the pace Antonionni places is entirely deliberate but there were moments when I wondered when the film would pick up some of the suspense considering the weight of the situations Nicholson's character was in. Of course this is not to downplay the overall effect that Antonionni and his crew give on a film like this a lot of times his style of the wandering camera or of a camera staying still on an object is entrancing even hypnotic and one shot towards the very end is one of the best in all of movie history. The slowness does feel slow but on a repeat viewing one gets the sense that there is tension almost in the vein of Melville where not much is said but there's a lot to be said about what's not being said. Sartre would be proud. He uses his skills to tell a story of a journalist in Africa Nicholson doing what he can naturally do who discovers a man he knew in a hotel is dead of a heart attack and for reasons that are or are not quite explained he takes his identity. What he doesn't realize at least until he leaves for Spain is that the man's persona was that of a gun runner. The Passenger gives much to watch for the avid and nonavid film goer a curious often sullen and downplayed performance by Mr. Nicholsonoutside of a outburst moment in the desert a side role that isn't as heavy but is as noteworthy for Ms. Sheider and a style that is unquestionably of tremendous skill and potency. And yet on a first viewing it's own selfimage gets distracting. Perhaps this is one of those films that requires more than one viewing to let it all sink in...and this being said it will be well worth it to seek out on DVD if not in the theaters where it's had a short rerelease run. It did make it more worth my while with Antonioni's shots laid up on a big screen. 910".

	schema:headline " Brilliant cinematic masterpiece worth all 8 hours";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning. This is not a movie for an evening of entertainment. Its is 8 hours of surreal images about mass media combining with trivialized pop culture versions of German romantic irrationalizm to create that phenomenon called Hitler which will never leave the dark corners of human nightmares and the strange world of pop mythology.I've seen this film twice in a cinema Berkeley CA when it came around. Obviously people willing to subject themselves to eight hours of surrealist images about Hitler as the Great Communicator the original for you Reagan fans are going to go in a bit prejudiced. I had not yet seen any other Syberberg films nor read anything about him or his films as I wanted to experience this for it's own sake without preconceived notions. After intermission my friend a warehouse manager and I couldn't wait to see the rest. The same was true when it returned a few years later and I saw it with an artist friend who was even more excited. We heard similar buzz from the people around us at intermission. This movie was something special and after all these years having reread the screenplay and amazed at the images I'd see it again for an all nighter. But I don't really have to because I can replay most of the scenes in my head at any time  they were that striking and memorable. I guess part of that may have to do with the fact that I am born German and was once a student of modern German literature theater art and lived in Munich when artists like Handke Thomas Bernhard Max Frish Fassbinder Herzog Wenders and Syberberg challenged the status quo and awoke Germans to the idea that there is something else besides Brecht Grass and sighing the Mea Culpa over the Third Reich.Syberberg had already done films that were hard to get shown this was before the Video Revolution and with Hitler he really went overboard. This film could never be a commercial success but it was worth the making and seeing. It creates images meant for someone who is steeped in German mythos while at the same time aware of the changes wrought on world media by Edison's invention of the moving pictures. Combine these with mass communication capability the capability to entrance the masses with the images they want to identify with is the history of both Hitler and Movies. So for eight hours Syberberg bombards the viewer with images of the Black Mary Edison's studio as a backdrop Hitler rising out of Wagners grave in a Roman toga Radio tranmissions of SS Troopers singing Silent Night direct from Stalingrad touching personal reminiscances by Hitler's butler of how he liked his underwear pressed his projectionist eating a sausage picknick at the old Eagle's Nest talking about what a nice regular guy his old boss was.In short this movie fills the viewer with indellible images of the capability of mass media to suck in the viewers give them a sense of intimacy and trivialize mass murder from a real life human perspective. No single scene or sermon or 90 minute expose of Auschwitz can ever hope to drive home the real insanity of the mass delusions which created the greatest tragedy of this century. And for Germans the constant cleansing and coping escapism of the post war era It wasn't us it was those few bad guys that are now dead needed a real response by the generation that was born afterwards. And the only way Syberberg could do that was to let all those images of the collective German memory of the great history of its irrationalism and romanticism fight against the attempt to rationalize it's rape by their own philestines.Memorable quotes include the famous Every time I hear the word Art I reach for my pistol.Particularly good are Andre Heller as the melancholy narrator the dialog between Himmler and his masseur Christmas stories and touching human stories about Hitler and his beloved doggies. Those skits are kind of like a news magazine story about the human side of John Wayne Gacey as Bunel and Dali might have filmed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how to begin to review this cinematic experience as I felt immersed in the film rather than trying to get my mind around it entirely. This work is neither an apologia for Hitler and the Third Reich nor a condemnation but a serious attempt by a true intellectual and film auteur Syberberg to look at it ALL from every side the horror and evil as well as the cultural historical and philosophical foundations of Hitler and the German people.The film is subtitled A Film From Germany because it is plumbs not only the depths of Nazism and World War II but the entire German psyche. It attempts to present through hard facts historical documents films and photographs and also through dream metaphor and stunningly haunting tableaux what Hitler really MEANT and what he continues to mean. There are many excellent actors portraying both wellknown figures like Himmler and lesser known individuals like Hitler's valet who relate what might seem like endless minutiae of Hitler's daily life but do add a great deal to the ultimate picture of the man about whom so much has been written. It seems that if you don't revile him completely even today you are suspected of being a neofascist yourself but this film attempts to offer a complete picture and by extension a baring of the German soul and what is referred to on several occasions as their happy guilt.One issue I have is with the English subtitles. There are so many typographical and spelling errors that one could only call it sloppy. I don't know why a film of this magnitude that took so long coming to home video shouldn't have had more scrupulous editing. Considering how many talking heads there are in the film and the volume of exposition it was hard enough to keep up with the subtitles without stumbling over the mistakes. On the plus side there is a lot of English voiceover that provides some breathing space for us Anglos.And one last comment on the historical context. Considering the film was made in 1977 34 years ago much has changed in the world in Europe and in the global culture that the film presciently hints at not the least of which is the continued emergence of Germany and Japan both economically and democratically. One important point Our Hitler made was that Hitler was probably the apotheosis of democracy rising as he did from the middle class and glorifying the common people and being democratically elected by them. What he did with that mandate was probably the most horrifying and endlessly fascinating stories of the 20th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "HansJrgen Syberberg's mammoth meditation of Hitler and the German people who brought him to power is something that is only possible to describe as a physical entity.One can not truly explain what effect that it will have on the viewer. Its a four part film who's total running time is close to seven hours Total almost anticinematic with static sets actors playing multiple roles puppets music audio and video of the 1930's and 40's narration and a dream logic that makes this more film as immersion tank rather than as narrative film. Its the sort of thing that one can not hope to grasp in a single viewing simple because there is too much to grasp and because things don't connect until you've gotten all the way to the end. As the Movie Habit website said ...much like a going to a Wagnerian opera. It's long loud and at any given moment it seems not to know where it's going. But when you get to the end you know you've been someplace special. Its a film that is clearly a work of art both pretentious and glorious. Actually this is a film that is all things at once good and bad riveting and sleep inducing masterful and amateurish. It is a film that is unlike any other that I've ever seen not only in style but in effect I was both bored by the film and utterly captivated.It is nothing so much as a head trip of the highest order. This is not a film of facts but of ideas.. Its an examination of what brought Hitler to power could the national view of a classically romantic Germany have been the cause? At the same time what does all of this say about ourselves? 30 years on with the change of American politics from a less then simple democracy into battles of cults of personality are we heading toward something similar with the idealized ways of seeing the world that our leaders ask us to believe blinding us to the road to ruin? Its something to consider.Is it a great film? yes I think it is. I don't know how many people will have the endurance to get to the end of the film owing to its often static nature and heady discussions but for those who are daring it is a unique experience once that will haunt you around the edges.I think the best way to describe the film is to answer the question how is it? Yes yes it is. Meaning however you think the film is thats what it is It is a masterpiece since its constantly provoking a reaction".

This really is an extraordinary film and I completely understand Sontag's adoration of it. This is a brilliant film one that has had me thinking for days about it. I watched it over 2 nights and there's so much in it and so much to take in that I'm planning on renting it again or perhaps purchasing it. Despite its 7 12 hour length there isn't one dull moment in it. I only watched it over 2 nights because I had to go to sleep. If I had had the time to watch the whole thing in one sitting I would have done so without thinking. I haven't felt this glued to the screen in I don't know how long.The film is absolutely mesmerizing. This film has been unavailable for many many years and this is the first time it's been offered on home video. The director Hans Jurgen Syberberg had posted the film on his website but watching it on a TV or projected is the best way to see it. The film is operatic theatrical mind bending sad haunting angry depressing and just about everything else you can think of. The 4th part is a little boring the first 30 minutes of part four is one long monologue but after this monologue is concluded the film takes off again to a stunning conclusion. Never does the film feel padded. Like in Wagner's great operas Wagner figures prominently here a film like this needs to be long to tell its story and that should be respected. The actors throughout the film give excellent performances and the film is one of the most thought provoking films that I've seen in recent memory. This is a filmic masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently I am noticing that a remarkably high percentage of those German films that are released on international dvds have as topic the Nazi time. But not enough with this newer productions one is even eager to rerelease older movies about this one and the same topic which seems to be of such great interest. What are the reasons? Is it the still bad conscience of the Germans themselves which cannot be made responsible for what their fathers or grandfathers did? Or do the sons and grandsons of the liberators of Nazi Germany have to indulge now in their past because the present does not look so glorious anymore? Syberberg's Hitler is grandly overrated in my opinion. It is a pseudointellectual work which is pretending much more than what it really is. In almost 8 hours the director scatters the undigested morsels out of textbooks in philosophy German literature and film history over his audience. Or do you know what Hegel has to do with the Third Reich? Do you know why Oskar Loerke Ernst Stadler August Stramm and the dadaists come to honor in this movie? Do you really believe that the Hollywood fascists ended the carrier of Erich von Stroheim leaded by Gloria Swanson? This film is crowded with poetic and metaphysical knowledge that is just picked up from encyclopedias mixed with pure nonsensical interpretations and randomly spread in the legion of massively overlong monologues. If you watch attentively the movie presents you a full contents of assumingly every experimental shot that you can find listed in the histories of film technique  of course randomly used the absence of any recognizable structure being blamed to the lack of understanding of an allegedly illiterate audience.Principally I like the idea of digging out classics of the German New Wave between the Oberhausener Manifest and its end with the dead of Fassbinder. But where where are the films of Alexander Kluge Peter Thomas and Viktor Schamoni Werner Schroeter Horst Bienek Peter Lilienthal JeanMarie Straub Ula Stckl Peter Fleischmann Hans W. Geissendrfer Ulrike Ottinger Walter Bockmayer? At the same time when dubious film companies are rereleasing the unrestored and horribly dubbed German preNew Wave movies the socalled Kriminalfilme and Lederhosenfilme and present them to a surprised American audience that cannot have any idea about the background on which these movies had been made at this very same time the films of the New Wave generation that purposely cleaned up with this socalled Papa's Cinema are simply not available on international dvds. And if you buy the German dvds than you will realize that practically all are not regionfree. Well understood we speak here about several hundreds of films which would be well worth seeing international distribution. However Syberberg's Hitler does definitely not belong to the pearls. Its director released Hitler for free on his own homepage and offers regionfree copies of his collected works for a dumping price.".

But not enough with this newer productions one is even eager to rerelease older movies about this one and the same topic which seems to be of such great interest. What are the reasons? Is it the still bad conscience of the Germans themselves which cannot be made responsible for what their fathers or grandfathers did? Or do the sons and grandsons of the liberators of Nazi Germany have to indulge now in their past because the present does not look so glorious anymore? Syberberg's Hitler is grandly overrated in my opinion. It is a pseudointellectual work which is pretending much more than what it really is. In almost 8 hours the director scatters the undigested morsels out of textbooks in philosophy German literature and film history over his audience. Or do you know what Hegel has to do with the Third Reich? Do you know why Oskar Loerke Ernst Stadler August Stramm and the dadaists come to honor in this movie? Do you really believe that the Hollywood fascists ended the carrier of Erich von Stroheim leaded by Gloria Swanson? This film is crowded with poetic and metaphysical knowledge that is just picked up from encyclopedias mixed with pure nonsensical interpretations and randomly spread in the legion of massively overlong monologues. If you watch attentively the movie presents you a full contents of assumingly every experimental shot that you can find listed in the histories of film technique  of course randomly used the absence of any recognizable structure being blamed to the lack of understanding of an allegedly illiterate audience.Principally I like the idea of digging out classics of the German New Wave between the Oberhausener Manifest and its end with the dead of Fassbinder. But where where are the films of Alexander Kluge Peter Thomas and Viktor Schamoni Werner Schroeter Horst Bienek Peter Lilienthal JeanMarie Straub Ula Stckl Peter Fleischmann Hans W. Geissendrfer Ulrike Ottinger Walter Bockmayer? At the same time when dubious film companies are rereleasing the unrestored and horribly dubbed German preNew Wave movies the socalled Kriminalfilme and Lederhosenfilme and present them to a surprised American audience that cannot have any idea about the background on which these movies had been made at this very same time the films of the New Wave generation that purposely cleaned up with this socalled Papa's Cinema are simply not available on international dvds. And if you buy the German dvds than you will realize that practically all are not regionfree. Well understood we speak here about several hundreds of films which would be well worth seeing international distribution. However Syberberg's Hitler does definitely not belong to the pearls. Its director released Hitler for free on his own homepage and offers regionfree copies of his collected works for a dumping price.";

The film was then a novelty in its structure and ways of communicating things I mean what in art theory is called the form. But I think that after all these years it is time to discuss the content of the film. Indeed the film is full of fuzzy situations texts read while another voice talks in the background and so on. The film is divided into four parts each 90120'. The two first parts have several good ideas as to display the sound of a real Hitler speech dealing about the greatness of Germany while he is working painstakingly painting a wall. Another good idea is to show an actor acting as the servant of Hitler and telling his everyday life or another one representing the private film projectionist of Hitler who tells his preferences. But the two last parts of the film are long monologues lists of arguments in favor of the Nazis. When you have these arguments presented in short passages and as deliberately cynical utterances it is OK. But when the arguments go on during two or three hours then it is too much and one starts to be suspicious about the author. He reaches the top of what can be bearable for me when near the end of the film and shortly after having mentioned the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs a puppet representing Hitler asks What have you done with the World after me?. And one of the last sentences shown in the screen is After the journey into the World who is nearer to God than the guilty?. I am sorry but what I passed over when I was young is unbearable for me and makes the author openly suspicious.".

The writer and director is HansJrgen Syberberg a filmmaker who turned 80 last year and he is known for his films being usually fairly long Parisfal Ludwig but with this one he takes runtime certainly to the next level. This movie runs for over 7 hours and it is among the longest films ever made I am sure. It consists of 4 acts 3 of them being roughly 1.5 hours long and the second act being the longest at almost 2.5 hours. The film features some wellknown German actors from the 1970s and it won Peter Kern also a German Film Award together with another movie. The strong thing about this film is that it is basically a great pretty unique lesson on German history and that includes culture music film and most of all politics. But even if I was always interested in German politics of the first half 20th century I must say this one dragged a lot on many occasions and I cannot say I enjoyed the watch a whole. I did enjoy the music for sure and my favorite sequence was probably everything that had directly to do with Hitler such as the brilliant ventriloquist sequence. But these are only exceptions taken from a film that is mediocrity all in all and I believe the film does not have even close to enough when it comes to such memorable sequences. Apart from that i also think a film should be seen on one day and this is almost impossible with this one we have here. I have to give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

When the trusty British Rail sign is replaced by one reading East Midland Infrastructure it is clear that there will be the inevitable winners and losers as downsizing and efficiency become the new buzzwords. A cheery camaraderie is soon replaced by uncertainty and turmoil when their depot manager fills them in on the details of the new arrangement. Privatization means that the customer now comes first something that is instilled into the men in new training sessions. But there are inconsistencies and shortsightedness to the new ways. Men used to working together now find themselves belonging to different competing companies. Some even have to tender for their old jobs. Others decide to take the redundancy packages offered by the firm. As always corners are cut in the interest of lowering costs leading to a series of misadventures.";

	schema:reviewBody "England. Mid 1990's. British Rail has been privatised and broken up into separate companies with all work put out to tender with the lowest bidder getting the job. This film follows a group of workers in a Yorkshire depot as the culture gradually changes from a world of union influence into a competitive business world.This is a very sobering film  it deals with the railtrack situation but is more generally about the selling out of the working man and the beginning of the culture that views people as commodities and expenses just like the rolling stock and the rails. The film opens with the boss of the depot announcing that the company has been privatised and that things will begin to change. It then follows the culture change over the course of time and concludes with a depressingly innocuous exchange that represents the shattering of previously unified spirits.The culture change beings with mission statements competing with work and setting levels for acceptable deaths and continues with an end to previous agreements and a range of different companies. It is very hard to watch without being angry at the treatment of previously proud men as they are reduced to being costs. Workers are offered voluntary redundancy and those that refuse are gradually forced out. Bosses and chief execs identify those workers that have union ties and work to push them out. Workers are encouraged to join temp agencies at higher wages but without benefits or a steady work load thus saving the company money. Those that make trouble with the crews by insisting on safe working conditions etc are blackballed by the agencies and no more work is put their way. The pressure to cut costs to win jobs continues until unskilled workers are used for rail maintenance because they are paid cash in hand while other crews are forced to use costeffective methods to work without a lookout and run the risk of severe accidents.For those who think that the experiences of the workers are exaggerated for effect Ken Loach received regular visits from railtrack workers taking holidays or sick days to advise on the film to make sure that it was representative of their experiences  they couldn't officially do it as they feared being blacklisted within the company. These things do go on  the rail companies are led by bosses who get huge bonuses from the shareholders as they drive down operating costs by compromising safety and reducing the workforce costs.If the film has a major flaw it is the onesided nature of the script. Workers are all represented as jovial hardworking types you know  salt of the earth put down by bosses who only care about money. The latter may well be true but the way the workers constantly joke etc makes them look too good and the film has far too much sympathy for them for it's own good. Even when a group of workers do something completely abhorrent the end of the film it is presented as something that they had no choice about whereas really they should have carried some of the blame.This film was released in Europe but only had a limited release in the UK as it was screened first on TV. It came shortly after the collapse of Railtrack as the Government put it into administration. It was screened days after the Government tried to cover up a report of failing train performances etc and it was screened as inquiries continue into serious derailments with significant loss of life.In the UK one major accident killed many passengers and was put down to badly maintained rails. The Chief Exec has thus far escaped charges of manslaughter despite the findings of the Health  Safety Executive and also left his job with his huge contractuallyobliged bonus before moving on to another job on another board. For those who think that this film is exaggerated you truly have no idea what's going on in the world of big business.As the Government continue plans for part privatisation of the London Underground and have further plans to privatise air traffic control this film is a very scary thing. Once we forget the people who make up workforces that only leave numbers. When shareholders become more important than the public and the workers then costs are all that matters and all corners are cut to boost the share price.This film has it's flaws and will not change Government policy one bit. But this is a very sobering film that will open you eyes to what is done to satisfy shareholders and earn bonuses for upper management.".

Perhaps the most ludicrous moment is when their supervisor in their newly created regional private company tells the workers to take equipment out to dump bins and smash it up because it isn't up to scratch we've got to have high standards now. But it's perfectly good can't we sell it?  they protest.  What sell it to the competition? is the response.  Later they are told that management's streamlining making staff redundant has been too successful they are now too small to be viable and the depot has to close the rest of the workers have to go.  Aside from the almost documentary of the plight of Britain's rail network there are personal interactions between the working class characters in their daily lives that viewers can empathise with.  In all it's well cast well scripted and well directed.".

As a result the lifetime employment system has collapsed and the power of the unions the members of which are employees only have been eroding. At the same time number of contract workers who do not have systematic training and skills building has increased. In this trend the gap between peoples of high wages and low wages are becoming wider. British society has been many years the forerunner in the world of winning the rights of workers.

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky to see during the festival of Venice in Milan this very recent film from the good social director Ken Loach. A group of friends in 1995 work in the Yorkshire for the exstate owned British Rail which meanwhile has been completely fragmented in a tremendous number of small private companies that compete one against the other in order to be more competitive and gain the different bids. This situation leads the whole structure of each private company to a very profitable organisation offering a very poor service that has to save money from any single item of the fixedvariable costs structure of the economic statement.Loach this time points out the lost of the social benefits of the labour class in a blackmail black and white situation where if they want to get the job they have to leave with these conditions which do not guarantee any type of social and physical safety to the worker. It is not by chance that England has been the frame of several train accidents during the last years. Unions are getting weaker and weaker and the so called trouble makers are led to leave the companies. The whole film is nicely viewed with some very fine pretty uncommon in previous Loach's films British humour. The scene where the supervisor has to read to the workers the message from the top management of productivity and their new rights is hilarious and superbly performed. Rating 610".

It prompted him to write to director Ken Loach about his experiences working on the railways for eighteen years in Sheffield. As a union rep he worked through privatisation until 1997. While the changes were being made concerns of safety and working conditions were being ignored and so the idea of dramatising the issues was born largely out of frustration. This is the story of a group of railtrack workers who are faced with voluntary redundancy' and all it's contradictions. The conditions they have to work within forces out an incongruous humour that naturally comes from oppressive and terrible situations but their situation also leads inevitably to disaster. Loach is not particularly renowned for his aesthetically pleasing images in some circles and the humour often comes with a callous edge. His films are just too near the knuckle for some people to be entertained by them. Those who do not want to be made aware of issues' are the most disdainful but they miss out if they are interested in film at all in terms of Loach's fantastic ability to inspire the most naturalistic performances by actors and non actors especially. Again some of these faces are entirely unknown other than the Full Monty's Steve Huison but because of this the characters are thoroughly believable. The interaction between them is awkward sometimes disjointed the dialogue does not run smoothly and you get an impression of real life friction as a result. As producer Rebecca O'Brien says It gives a real veracity to the story being told.' Similarly designer Martin Johnson says that the ultimate aim is to make it look so real that no one can see there has been any design'. In this sense Loach just becomes stronger the more he does.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Navigators' is a well made and moving TV drama. The largely unknown cast play their parts well. Set in 1995 during the privatization of British Rail 'The Navigators' depicts the change in working relationships between management and workforce amongst a group of trackside workers at a small depot near Sheffield. We see the men's jobs gradually being phased out as different shareholders buy up the business. The eventual closure of the depot and the offer of redundancy leads to the men working long hours on the trackside for agencies who will even cut corners on health and safety to get the 'best deal'. In the end this leads to a tragic event which puts the workmates in a terrible dilemma as it is they and not the agency or employers that would be held responsible for their colleague's accident.The drama is not all moribund and there are typical touches of Loach humour such as the men getting splashed by the flushing toilet of a passing train and a clever workplace wind up around a tin of sardines. The main character Paul Joe Duttine is well played and Loach slowly builds up our sympathies for the men and the difficulties that their precarious employment places on domestic and family life. At the end it would be easy to condemn the men's conspiracy to cover up the accident but Loach also points towards the bigger picture which leads to health and safety being criminally relegated to an inconvenience for employers rather than a priority.Perhaps this film was a little too long but Loach puts across well the suffering caused by job insecurity and how the awful euphemistic management 'double speak' has smothered industrial relations and taken us into a new era of lowrights and lowpaid work.".

	schema:reviewBody "The films of Ken Loach are always worth the investment in time and attention. Films like this can not be made in Hollywood where the dominating criterion for production is the financial profit. Even when a Hollywood producer has found a challenging theme it is usually garbled with sensational and primitive digressions. In the attempt to appeal to easily accessible animal instincts the average Hollywood films portray selfishness deceit aggression and even mass slaughter as desirable qualities. Such films foster a culture that actually hampers human progress. The films of Ken Loach always address the civilized side of human nature and allow for fertile selfreflexion. The Navigators is a masterpiece about railway labor although it appeals probably more to Europeans than to other nationalities. The European railways were socialized a century ago because the operational efficiency requires a monopoly situation and private monopolies are a natural source of abuse. Nevertheless in the eigthies the British Thatcher government decided to reprivatize British Rail. The film describes the effect of the privatization on the personnel of a maintenance depot. The personnel consists of rough workmen who find pleasure and pride in their profession. When British Rail is cut into pieces the depot is renamed into East Midland Company and has to canvass for commissions with Rail Track. Maintenance work comes in batches and the new management views permanent appointments as superfluous expenses. Perhaps more important the restructuring allows to eliminate the trade unions which were strong in the former structure although apparently not strong enough. New competition is introduced by private firms who employ temporary personnel and compete for commissions. They pay more on an hourly basis but spare the costs of training and holiday allowances. Thus the entrepreneurial risks are transferred to the workers. Most important they dramatically reduce the quality and safety standards. The decent work of the railway depot once more renamed this time into Gilchrist Engineering is no longer appreciated by Rail Track and Gilchrist runs out of work. Employees are made redundant and are stimulated by means of bonuses to resign. Subsequently they are hired by the new cowboy firms through temporary employment agencies flexible contracts. In the end one of the railway workers dies in an accident during a job where he is hit by a passing train because the lookout man has been omitted. In this film I like in particular the excellent portrayal of the workman's' culture. You can so to say smell the sweat. The essence is probably the complete bewilderment caused by the privatization which hits the workers well like a train. They lose control over their working environment and income. They land in a world of flexcontracts where fate is an unknown even on the short term. Of course they manage to adapt in time but their lives sink to a lower level of human existence. It is a striking story which is closely related to this other Ken Loach film Bread and Roses about the working poor.".

That is because of the mostly fantastic acting.The Navigators are about five railway workers who after the privatisation of the British Rail are deformed in their class consciousness.

This short gives a good impression of the Cotton Club scene at the time this club was run by gangsters and although the entertainers were black no black people were allowed in. This was not a gangster thing but a common American racist practice. Still even if this clip is a racist stereotype it's not nearly as bad as say the average hip hop clip nowadays which is something to worry about. Now this movie is of enormous historical interest and features an early version of the most significant jazz orchestra of the 20th century! So please don't listen to the puritan reviews and check this out. Then try to see maybe Cotton tail with Ben Webster on tenor or basically anything by Ellington. It's great music!

	schema:headline " There must be some Ellington fans out there!";
	schema:reviewBody "Whilst I agree entirely with thedoge and simuland  especially regarding the incredibly unfunny racist treatment of the two piano removers at the beginning I presume it WAS meant to be funny! I thought I'd point out a few things to any possible Ellington fans who may seek out this movie just to see the 1929 band in action. Be warned the sound quality is awful. The band performs less well than on any of the studio recordings of the period and every number is tailored to the various dance routines. Black Beauty is particularly horrendously butchered and with a cheesy coda added for no apparent reason except to underline the fact that it has thankfully come to an end. The Duke Steps Out  a marvellous recording from the Victor studios is taken at snail's pace  again to accommodate the socalled dancing I would imagine. What on the studio recording is a brilliant passage for the three trumpets here is taken down an octave and they don't even make it together! Nanton's trombone sounds way off mike and although he is perhaps the major soloist he doesn't even get properly in any of the shots  all of which are dominated by the oddly unsexy dancing of the seminaked chorus girls. The opening has Ellington at the piano and Artie Whetsol with his trumpet 'learning' the intro to Black and Tan Fantasy. It doesn't have much to do with anything but Ellington buffs might like to note that Whetsol does not use the rubber plunger and pear pixie mute in the manner of Bubber Miley but an ordinary Harmon mute. Odd  Whetsol was quite adept with the plunger check out the Vocalion recording of Take it Easy where he has to play Bubber Miley's part because the latter didn't show up for the session! so why not use it in the movie? This brings me to the final number Black and Tan Fantasy. Ellington had already recorded this several times by the time this film was made and it was one of his most well known compositions. It was cowritten by the aforementioned Bubber Miley who was also the featured soloist. What a shame he had left the band shortly before the film was made. I remember being extremely disappointed to discover that he was not in the film when I first saw it back in the 70s. For some reason its not dancers this time! the arrangement is altered quite drastically from all the previous recordings with a clarinet solo from Barney Bigard added in place of Miley's 2nd chorus. Maybe Duke felt Whetsol wasn't up to two choruses but I doubt it. Once again Whetsol uses the Harmon mute instead of the plunger and even more interestingly Joe Nanton the trombonist does not use the trumpet straight mute inside the bell underneath his plunger as he does on all of the studio recordings. The result is an outoftune muffled sound that hardly sounds like Nanton at all! This is capped off by a ridiculously overrecorded bass Wellman Braud which detracts from everything else. There's also a weird organ coda tagged on the end which has nothing to do with anything and the obligatory negro gospel type choir making a meal of it. I'd love to know how much say Ellington had in all of this  not a lot me thinks! But having said all that its still the band and its a worthy historic document. Thedoge and simuland have said everything else. What a shame its nowhere near as good as it COULD have been!".

	onyx:emotionText "Whilst I agree entirely with thedoge and simuland  especially regarding the incredibly unfunny racist treatment of the two piano removers at the beginning I presume it WAS meant to be funny! I thought I'd point out a few things to any possible Ellington fans who may seek out this movie just to see the 1929 band in action. Be warned the sound quality is awful. The band performs less well than on any of the studio recordings of the period and every number is tailored to the various dance routines. Black Beauty is particularly horrendously butchered and with a cheesy coda added for no apparent reason except to underline the fact that it has thankfully come to an end. The Duke Steps Out  a marvellous recording from the Victor studios is taken at snail's pace  again to accommodate the socalled dancing I would imagine. What on the studio recording is a brilliant passage for the three trumpets here is taken down an octave and they don't even make it together! Nanton's trombone sounds way off mike and although he is perhaps the major soloist he doesn't even get properly in any of the shots  all of which are dominated by the oddly unsexy dancing of the seminaked chorus girls. The opening has Ellington at the piano and Artie Whetsol with his trumpet 'learning' the intro to Black and Tan Fantasy. It doesn't have much to do with anything but Ellington buffs might like to note that Whetsol does not use the rubber plunger and pear pixie mute in the manner of Bubber Miley but an ordinary Harmon mute. Odd  Whetsol was quite adept with the plunger check out the Vocalion recording of Take it Easy where he has to play Bubber Miley's part because the latter didn't show up for the session! so why not use it in the movie? This brings me to the final number Black and Tan Fantasy. Ellington had already recorded this several times by the time this film was made and it was one of his most well known compositions. It was cowritten by the aforementioned Bubber Miley who was also the featured soloist. What a shame he had left the band shortly before the film was made. I remember being extremely disappointed to discover that he was not in the film when I first saw it back in the 70s.

Dudley Murphy wrote and directed this one and it stars the very talented Duke Ellington in his first performance even if he plays himself. Well what can I say. the music is really fun to listen to but sadly this little film aspires to be more than that. As a music documentary in style of a concert recording it may have worked but as a dramatic little story it does not I have to say. That is why my general verdict for this one is negative. Luckily far more than half of the film is really just music and that's why it is not a complete failure. Should have done without the plot though.".

Ellington's girlfriend Fredi Washington then enters the room of bribes the movers with a bottle of alcohol and then we go to the Cotton Club where Ellington and Washington perform their act. This isn't a good film but it's certainly worth viewing at least once for a few reasons. It's interesting to note that many of the supporting players especially the movers are negative stereotypes dumb and drunk but Ellington plays it straight. One wonders if he refused to act down for the material or if the studio was just smart enough to treat him with some respect. Another fascinating thing is some of the shots that happen throughout the picture. I liked some of the style like the first dance group who we get to see through their reflection on the floor. Another nice shot has Washington dancing on a glass floor and the camera is underneath and looking up to capture her. There's some more bizarre editing which doesn't work as well but it's at least something different than we're use to seeing. I must admit that the ending somewhat took me by surprise and it's interesting to see it end the way it did. I certainly won't ruin anything but where this all comes from is somewhat of a mystery.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov made in 1929 is a silent film that clams to break away from the use of film cards actors and all other theatrical aspects that the film industry had been using as it has been developing. To capture this break from the set standards Vertov filmed life over the course of five to six years then edited down the film and added a score. There is no specific cast nor a specific narrative them that the film follows. From the very first sequence of images of this film the viewer is brought into a world that focuses on the association of man and machine how man not only controls the machine it's out put and maintenance but also how man is like a machine. Man is the driving force of modern society man is the backbone behind production and advances. Vertov expresses this idea without words but instead shows a city waking up and dependent on the labor force. The pace of the images flows this slower morning pace to more of a flowing fast pace where images fly past the viewers at such a high rate it is almost impossible to see all action that has taken place. He interlays people and machines in both paces to show not only the technological advances of that time but to also show how production machines and people enjoymentfascination never stop. There is always this sense of progress. He shows that there is always two sides to every part of life. He shows images of life and death marriage and divorce young and old age as well as work and recreation. To offset the impact of all the images of only a workforce life Vertov shows how society also has sports games pubs and the beach to entertain the masses. The main theme of The Man with a Movie Camera is political. The film shows a Proletariat dominated society under the rule of Lenin. It is a propaganda tool of the time. All scenes show people in mass enjoying and partaking in the same action whether it be working travel or recreation. The film tries to express a feeling of grandeur and delight with a society that shares everything and one that is based on a large working class. The repetitious images of machines and lower class individuals expresses the idea of a structured society that must function properly like a machine that each person must carry their weight due to the whole nation's as well as society's prosperity being dependent on them. There is no difference of the sexes in this work force. That all individuals work and all do similar jobs. This idea is a complete opposite from Hollywood films and America's mindset of the same era. Vertov created a film where the view felt as if they were being shown a special side of society that not all individuals see. Tricks in editing and in photography allow him to interlay images of the camera and the human eye which in turn implies the camera is a window into a different world. He wanted to create a film that showed society at the time. A film that broke away from the theatrical mindset that all films of that era followed. He wanted to show how all aspects of society are intertwined and that there is an over all happiness and contentment within Russia under Lenin. This propaganda film was used to invoke emotion as well as a feeling of awe for the association of man and machine.".

	schema:reviewBody "A cameraman Mikhail Kaufman travels around a city with a camera slung over his shoulder documenting urban life with dazzling inventiveness.This film is said to be a document of Soviet life with Vertov working within a Marxist ideology striving to create a futuristic city but I think that is just too narrow a view. While there are aspects of Soviet Russia here since that is where it was filmed this is really just life in general. The scenes of the Lenin Club and the bust of Karl Marx make it clear we are viewing a Communist society but the scenes of life in a working class country basically look the same in all industrial countries at this time regardless of political ideology. The film is a time capsule of the human race at this point in history and it is beautiful.The camera shots and angles and movements are to be commended and I think if I were to list all the creative uses of the camera I would be going on for a few pages. While we have to give credit for the unchained camera to the German Karl Freund my cinematic hero we can see here that the Russians or at least one Russian had some thoughts of his own on the camera's limitless potential. I am told that although Berlin Symphony of a Great City came first the techniques used in this film had already had their prototype in Russian film reels.We could debate the idea of cinema truth and whether or not what was shown is an accurate portrayal of unscripted life. I think that debate is largely based on exaggerated criticisms however. Yes a few scenes were staged. And yes some clever editing made certain scenes not strictly real. But the bulk of the film had people doing what people do without acting and in many cases not even knowing they were being filmed. This is about as real as film gets aside from say a tape retrieved from a security camera  but is that a film?.The New York Times review written by Mordaunt Hall lamented that the film does not take into consideration the fact that the human eye fixes for a certain space of time that which holds the attention. Indeed the average shot length of the film is 2.3 seconds compared to the contemporary standard of 11.2 seconds. Yet this is a key component in what sets the film apart from its peers. The film works by interspersing several sequences together cycling through them. A longer shot length could have happened but would not have forced the viewer to meld the various scenarios together in her mind. Whether Vertov knew it or not he was creating new thoughts through juxtaposition.Absolutely crucial to this film is the score. While there are any number of scores out there and your preference may vary from mine I can say that watching this film with any music is better than watching it without. There is no dialogue there are no characters and there are no intertitles with is a gross departure from his previous film OneSixth Part of the World which had excessive intertitles. Trying to stay focused without words or sound is a feat and one I advise against.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dziga Vertov's The Man with the Movie Camera' begins with a prologue that explains that the director is attempting to stretch the boundaries of the cinematic medium trying to achieve a total separation from the language of literature and theater.' It accomplishes this by throwing out conventional storytelling and taking a nonnarrative approach. Basically the entire film consists of different series of shots that illuminate daytoday life in Moscow and Odessa. The periods of the day dawn working hours and resting hours are represented by the activities of the ordinary people that make up the cast' of the film while the activities of certain citizens are contrasted with activities of others to create a panorama of Russian urban life in 1929.The first thing we see is a projectionist threading film through the spools of a projector. An audience pours into the movie theater as the seats magically flip out this stylized movement establishes a sense of choreography that will frequently reoccur. The projector comes to life and images appear on the movie screen.Now we see the details of a woman's bedroom. The camera starts by focusing on her window then moving inside and examining her belongings such as pictures that hang on the wall and items scattered on her dresser. The woman herself rests in her bed. Then we gradually move outside to see the world in a seemingly frozen state streets are empty the parks and benches are unpopulated telephones are silent and the wheels and gears of the factory remain still. More people are seen resting in their beds. Then a solitary car moves out onto the street with a cameraman perched in it and as if the filmmaker was signaling the start of the day the city comes alive. The woman wakes up begins washing herself and attending to her appearance and flickers the shades to her window. Intercut with this are the images of trolley cars leaving their stations and moving about in synchronized motion as well as people arriving at factories to begin labor. The gears that were previously silent begin to shift and churn and they grow more and more rapid in movement as the film progresses. Similarly there are images of a train moving at high speed quickly intercut with images of crowds in parks cars streaming through the streets and telephones buzzing with activity. They make the working hours of the day seem all the more hectic.Another interesting aspect of Vertov's editing is the way he contrasts the upperclass members of society with the lowerclass. One scenario involves the residents of a barber shop women get their hair primped while men sharpen razor blades for shaving. This is intercut with images of workers in a factory women get their hair dirtied as they shovel coal while men sharpen axes for chopping. Shots of trolleys moving about in various directions are placed in almost every sequence to convey the idea of people moving constantly anywhere at anytime.When the working hours end and the resting hours begin the gears come to a sudden halt and moments later we see people's bodies at rest this time on the beach. Athletic events are photographed in a way that makes them seem energetic but still allows for slowmoving photography to show that such activities are intended to be relaxing. We see a buff athlete jumping a hurdle his expression is very animated but his body moves with slowness and ease. We see families on a merrygoround intercut with bikers on a motorcycle track. Eventually we are back in the movie theater where the audience watches joyfully as stopmotion animation shows a tripod and camera moving about on their own.There is no actual story' to Vertov's film. It is an attempt to use the camera to capture things other mediums of entertainment such as books and plays cannot. It is fascinating for its dazzling technical skill and noteworthy for its movement towards a new cinematic direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remarkable movie. I saw the version with music by The Alloy Orchestra and commentary by Yuri Tsivian and I recommend that version highly. The Alloy Orchestra has captured the spirit of the movie with great fidelity and virtuosity. The Man with a Movie Camera was directed by Denis Kaufman who took the name Dziga Vertof which means spinning top a nom de film which is entirely appropriate in this movie. The movie was edited by Vertof's wife Yelizaveta Svilova and for the most part the man with the camera was Vertof's brother Mikhail Kaufman.The Man with a Movie Camera is the Koyaanisqatsi of 1929 and certain of the music reminds me of Philip Glasses music in that film. Other times the music reminds me of Edvard Grieg. The movie starts with the beginning of a day in several Soviet cities including Odessa and progresses to the end of a day. However the unimaginably swift cuts and editing make it a swirling montage of work play sports and rest. Vertof Svilova and Kaufman take us on the whirlwind of Oz and we realize we're not in Odessa anymore.I don't know whom to credit so I'll refer to the trio. They took serious risks in putting the camera in places it wasn't meant to go. They show us Kaufman on the side of a train at full speed standing on the doors of a convertible speeding down the street on a motorcycle in a race as he steers the motorcycle and hand cranks the camera climbing a tall chimney and much much more. We see him in a firetruck filming an ambulance then we see the ambulance from his point of view and it cuts back and forth showing him filming showing what he's filming. We see the theater where this film is being shown watch it being projected on the screen watch the audience watching the film watch it with them. We see many scenes of Svilova in the process of editing the movie with some scenes ending in a freeze frame then pulling back to see her hand on the film as she cuts and splices it. Several scenes show her selecting scenes to insert into the film then we see the scenes.For some reason I find the right word to be metajuxtaposition we see The Man with a Movie Camera from so many points of view that it's almost like watching Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods we don't know where the movie starts or ends where watching the movie starts or ends where making the movie starts or ends. We don't know if the audience we see watching the film is us or them. Are they the audience or are we? We watch the cameraman filming the movie we see what he's filming we see the film he shot.The trio used jump cuts some as short as one frame double exposures freeze frames extreme close ups extreme long lens shots tracking shots stopmotion animation split screens and much more. The movie was an incredible work of considerable brilliance by the trio all the more impressive for being produced in 1929.It's a short movie of about an hour and I recommend watching it with the music then turning on the commentary and listening to Tsivian describe the film for the ultimate metajuxtaposition. Dr. Tsivian is a professor at the University of Chicago.".

We watch the cameraman filming the movie we see what he's filming we see the film he shot.The trio used jump cuts some as short as one frame double exposures freeze frames extreme close ups extreme long lens shots tracking shots stopmotion animation split screens and much more. The movie was an incredible work of considerable brilliance by the trio all the more impressive for being produced in 1929.It's a short movie of about an hour and I recommend watching it with the music then turning on the commentary and listening to Tsivian describe the film for the ultimate metajuxtaposition. Dr. Tsivian is a professor at the University of Chicago.";

	schema:reviewBody "After watching The Man with a Movie Camera I was not only confused but terrified at the same time.  Experiencing many images in the span of an hour made this movie mindboggling and creepy.  What caught my attention right off the bat was how the director's camera and editing techniques were amazing for being made in the 1920's.  Throughout the film there were many camera shots of a town but in a unique way.  Some angles were shot from above below and even on objects that were constantly moving around the town.  A great editing technique used was a split screen showing a different movement on top of the screen then from the bottom.  The town could be moving at a regular pace at one point where the next time the film is sped up conveying trauma and fast motion through the actual film.  At one point in the movie a camera was setup to show a train coming right at the lens. I thought the train was going to hit the camera and the person shooting the film.  Right as the train gets to the camera it lowers into a bunker under the train as it passes.  Great camera techniques were used to give powerful feeling to that particular scene.  Later in the movie many images of eyes would appear very fast and then disappear.  This occurred frequently throughout the movie and struck me as being weird and disturbing.  Showing women work and pack cigarettes and then flashing to a pair of eyes seems very odd to me.  What I do find interesting is how Vertov was able to edit these scenes so quickly together.  Over the whole movie he muse have taken so many random camera angles and shots that when he edited them together he loved it.  Overall I thought this movie was educational in the history of film.  It shows how talented directors were back in the 20's and how history has played a big role in camera and editing techniques.".

It is a silent experiment in cinematography and editing or as Vertov put it  a film without a script without any inter titles etc. His wife Yelizaveta Svilova edited the film and his brother Mikhail Kaufman photographed it. Kaufman is actually the man with the movie camera in it. When Kaufman saw the edited film he wasn't happy at all. Two brothers had a fight and never worked together again. Kaufman didn't agree with Vertov's style and his statement against cinema that was too dependent on literature and theater. Vertov's aim was to create a different language and he certainly succeeded. Cheloveks Kino Apparatom is a delightful work and it is too incredible for 1929 when it was made. I saw it with many different soundtracks and one of the most interesting ones is by Alloy Orchestra.

But Man with a Movie Camera avoids the cardinal sin of experimental filmmaking in that it is almost never boring there is no story as such but the overlapping montage of events from a single day contains both cinematic beauty and human interest plus a saving dash of humour I loved the moment where the car passengers being filmed react to the camera's intrusion by making cranking gestures in return. And it does very effectively convey the sense of a city waking up and progressing throughout the day to the golden leisure of a summer's evening. It is at the very end that it becomes overtly experimental breaking down altogether into whizzing images instead of winding down its citycharacter back into sleep and it was at this stage that it began to lose my interest and some of my enthusiasm.To the modern eye of course the film is also a fascinating document of 1920s Russia or at least Russia as she wished herself to be portrayed. History books are full of plots and counterplots coups and massacres and ideals but they tell us nothing of motorbuses trundling down streets of the sun slanting through blinds of everyday detail that was worth noone's while to censor or to preserve. Ironically the decidedly graphic sequence of a woman giving birth would probably be censored for modern sensibilities! Like any silent film this one relies on 'found titles'  the text on a shop window the caption on a form  and I suspect that a basic knowledge of RussianCyrillic probably helps to render the picture both more interesting and easier to follow. It helps if one can at least manage the Russian for 'bus' or 'beer' knowledge which the original audience naturally took for granted.At its best the film reminded me of the city sequences in Sunrise as a dazzling symphony of images beauty in the ordinary and a kaleidoscope of everyday perception. There is no conscious plotline just the gradually perceived shift of time in the quality of the sunlight and the rituals of the day. The intermittent presence of the camera whether made manifest in trick shots as an animated creature brought to our attention in split shots or sudden freezeframes or interspersed in 'candid' sequences showing the filming going on keeps the deliberately artificial nature of the whole enterprise to the forefront this is Art not a documentary. But oddly enough those glimpses of the cameraman at work  very ordinary perceived and accepted by the people around him  also seem to humanise what could have been a sterile experiment and give us the sense that we are indeed seeing what he is seeing perceiving the world through his camera's eye.".

This must be a statement to the highly poetic nature of the film. I had seen the movie before with a different score and it didn't have the same effect. Blame it on the score I guess.The fact is everything we see in this film will be annihilated in the following turbulent years. It's all done with a handcranked camera and is very powerful indeed.I disagree with the other reviewer who compares Dziga Vertov to Leni Reifenstall and calls for his branding as a war criminal. TRIUMPH OF THE WILL was exalting the virtues of the Nazi party itself while this film is more about the communist way of life in general. Even if Stalin turned out to be a war criminal afterward in my opinion this is different. This film is a major achievement for it's time and is still relevant.".

Vertov alleged that the machine would be the corner stone for the progress of industrialization. He thought that industrialization and service of people would liberate their society.The Man with a Movie Camera was a silent film that was created in black and white. Vertov did not use a script for the beginning of the film because he did not want the audience to believe it was fictional. He used many different scenic shots in his film. There were clips of benches land buildings water and windows. He was able to capture everyday life among humans in Russia. He was able to capture all emotions as well as important events in their lives. He captured weddings funerals injuries salon appointments divorce business and birth. His film was very kinetic. He was very concerned with making the subject and the camera movement perfect. The pace of the film was created to simulate the reality of what people are doing. The pace was also effected by the pace and direction of the Soviet Union in the 1920's. He was able to capture the vibrancy of life by showing the humans going about their everyday life. Vertov used still frames for many of the athletes in his film. He would freeze frame the competitors one by one while they were performing. After he freeze framed each individual athlete he would show them engaging fully in their activity. I thought this was very useful to keep the audiences attention. Dziga was able to create a distinction between classes. There were scenes with the upper class out at the salons and other prestige's places among the city. He was able to create scenes where many of the humans were struggling for survival. Vertov's film is one that I will need to see again to have a full appreciation of his talent. I was confused through out several scenes. I was not able to completely understand why he would change the pace of the film when he did. I really liked how he was able to capture humans during their everyday activities. Not once did I believe that any of the scenes in his film were staged. He is a very creative director who is worth learning more about.".

It is an excellent example of the genre with some beautiful camerawork but in no wise groundbreaking.The distinction if any lies in the use of the eponymous Man With a Movie Camera as a character in the film. People stop to gawk at movie cameras in operation at first sight and Vertov must have been frustrated at some of the excellent footage he would have to throw away. Then it probably occurred to him that if he made the camera itself a character the gawking could be explained. To Americans this might be strange but silent European films often had the camera clearly comment on the action of the film  check out Feuillade's serials such as LES VAMPIRES for examples.This leaves open of course the issue of why in several of the crowd scenes in which we see the actorcameraman from the rear people are looking at the movie camera actually in use to take the shot. Could it be it is not the man with the movie camera they are looking at but the operating camera?This being Soviet cinema we are also supposed to gawk over the editing technique which the Soviets invented  or actually reported on as they had been in use for up to thirty years by the time. The Soviet academicians got their stuff into print first  elsewhere people learned by experimentation or going to work for someone who knew what he was doing.Finally although Soviet film in this period is vibrant and interesting and does have a lot of editing techniques that were influential they were making good films in Russia before the Revolution. I urge anyone who is interested in Russian films to look up the works of Yevgeny Bauer or Starewicz. And take a look at this movie by all means. It's very good. I apologize if anyone thinks I am complaining but I worry that other commenters may have oversold it. Why not see it and make up your own mind?".

Could it be it is not the man with the movie camera they are looking at but the operating camera?This being Soviet cinema we are also supposed to gawk over the editing technique which the Soviets invented  or actually reported on as they had been in use for up to thirty years by the time. The Soviet academicians got their stuff into print first  elsewhere people learned by experimentation or going to work for someone who knew what he was doing.Finally although Soviet film in this period is vibrant and interesting and does have a lot of editing techniques that were influential they were making good films in Russia before the Revolution. I urge anyone who is interested in Russian films to look up the works of Yevgeny Bauer or Starewicz. And take a look at this movie by all means. It's very good. I apologize if anyone thinks I am complaining but I worry that other commenters may have oversold it. Why not see it and make up your own mind?";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not for those who demand story or characters  although from the silent era it is basically a feature length slice of life film done in what would have passed for documentary style at the time of its release. There is much to be appreciated here. The style of the photography and editing are both excellent. It's fascinating to gain sort of a window into the world of Moscow in the 20s. The man with the camera himself could easily have been a cheap gimmick but the film's creators seem to intend for us to see him as a sort of everyman who by witnessing and recording all the events that he comes across becomes the chronicler not so much of his own day or his own journeys as the lives of others and the life of the city as a whole. This like so many aspects of the film dovetails the artistic goals of the filmmakers with the propagandistic goals of the communist state for which this film was created. In that ideology the needs of the individual are always subsumed by the needs of the many. Indeed this film strives with some success to portray the lives of each of the city's inhabitants as a sort of microcosm of the entire city's life. As such the film is also designed to show off Russian innovation in the sciences and the arts and this is where the film becomes overly crude for my tastes dwelling for too long on overhead shots of labrythlike railway tracks slithering through the city in what appear almost to be geometric or artistic patterns we see the industrial machines at times it is almost reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis except in this case it is basically portraying Moscow as the city of the future..... today! and that for me is where the film goes too far in the direction of propaganda although being silent it's certainly fair to say that's just my interpretation.".

Dick Bo Diddly Sergio Leone.KEVIN Dziga Vertov's The Man with the Movie Camera is certainly an extraordinary experiment that I enjoyed very much. Can motion pictures be compelling and alive without being literary booklike or theatrical stagey? Without a story actors or sets can the film medium sustain by only the imagery? Of course it can. This film captures 70 minutes of oneofakind energy randomness and spontaneity that could never be duplicated. Through the use of clever camera work and editing Vertov takes a fascinating tongueincheek tapestry of life in his native Russia. People often worry about society becoming more mechanized but in the film that mechanization is romanticized with rhythmic repetition and music. Although I've viewed this movie approximately three times I can't immediately recall a specific set of images or ideas and I have a feeling that watching it again wouldn't make very much difference. That may be the film's strongest failing that it is only memorable in a broad sense not a specific sense.DOUG 1928 was the last great year for silent film. By 1930 nearly every major film had synchronized sound. In the grand tapestry of motion picture history the year 1929 is something of a black hole trapped between changing eras. So what came out that year that is worth seeing? What's the best film from this vacuous year? The answer is easy if you know where to look. We watched Dziga Vertov's documentary in Silent Film History class and I found it one of the best films we watched in the entire class not to mention the most entertaining examples I've ever seen of Soviet Montage sorry Eisenstein. It was so good we had to go back and watch it again for this odyssey. The film is Vertov's tribute to movies motion montage and modernism a documentary about everything if you will. It has a pulse. It starts off slow then moves fast then slows down again then picks up speed again. There's a lot of clever juxtaposition throughout the film like when one couple applies for a marriage certificate while another applies for a divorce certificate. The first fast section seems to focus on locomotion industry factories and machinery like watching the cigarette factory at work. The second fast section focuses more on people in motion walking to work exercising showing the body as a machine and the population as an industry. The main character taking all this in is the roaming cameraman and his relationship with the camera is a display of man and machine as one. As he weaves in and out of the city the scenes he witnesses come together to celebrate the everyday things and the modern world. The camera is practically a character itself there's a stopmotion sequence where we see the camera dancing on its tripod. There are also tributes to the great filmmakers laced throughout a scene of a galloping horse is obviously an homage to Edward Muybridge's famous experiment tributes to George Melies are noticeable with several composite shots the cameraman in the glass of beer is a winner. See if you can spot nods to D.W. Griffith and Sergei Eisenstein. Every time you watch you catch something new. This is an absolute mustsee for anyone interested in classic films silent films Russian montage or just plain good movies.Last film viewed It 1927. Last film chronologically The Wind 1928. Next film viewed Stella Maris 1918. Next film chronologically The Broadway Melody 1929.The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through year by year one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period the films of the era and each film in context while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies most of which we never would have watched otherwise.".

He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the kinoks or kinokis who often declared their intentions to abolish all nondocumentary styles of filmmaking. Whilst this  thankfully  never happened Vertov proved the effectiveness of his film theories in 1929 when he enthralled the world with 'The Man With a Movie Camera.' An hourlong documentary journal of typical Soviet life Vertov's film employed the use of various revolutionary editing techniques that would not be matched for more than half a century with the release of Godfrey Reggio's 'Koyaanisqatsi 1982.' The Man With a Movie Camera of the title is Mikhail Kaufman the film's cinematographer and also the director's brother and we follow him on his photographic exploits around Ukraine and some other Soviet cities from dawn to dusk. Throughout the day we watch the Soviet citizens at work and at play interacting with their essential modern machinery or simply living their natural lives. Vertov and Kaufman take us through everything in life  we witness the birth of a baby children at play a cheerful couple signing their marriage certificate a lesscheerful couple finalising their divorce the elderly going about their day a passing funeral procession By the end of the 68 minutes we feel as though we have experienced everything that life has to offer and despite not containing a single intertitle barring of course Vertov's introductory statement at the beginning the film flows beautifully and never appears to drag.Whilst Vertov's documentary often receives most of the acclaim it must be mentioned that the director was more than likely heavily inspired by Walter Ruttmann's 'Berlin Die Sinfonie der Grostadt  Berlin Symphony of a Great City' of two years earlier. Though I am yet to see that film 'The Man With a Movie Camera' allegedly borrows several ideas from it including the quick editing the closeups of machinery the store window displays even the shots of a typewriter keyboard.Adding a new and exciting dimension to the typical documentary style of the time Vertov made clever use of multiple revolutionary editing processes including split screens dissolves slow motion fast motion reverse motion double exposure Dutch angles freeze frames and stopmotion animation using each effect sparingly so that it remains exceptionally effective each time. The end result is that we really do feel as though we are witnessing something decades ahead of its time and each montage sequence is endlessly fascinating sometimes almost surreal and always beautiful to watch.Though it's not really typical to judge a silent film by a musical composition that has been added years later I must make mention of Michael Nyman's wonderful classical score performed by the Michael Nyman orchestra that accompanied the film on the 'Director's Suite' DVD. In a word stunning!".

Would such an international language be truly proletarian then? It is interesting that later Vertov fell foul of the Communist Regime as they became suspicious of his 'formal' style seeing it as possibly stemming from a bourgeois false consciousness.The erroneous as I see it philosophical arguments don't spoil it for me but certainly make it a product of its time cultural context rather than transcending it.

He also shows the editing process of the film being done during the film.".

There are LOTS of images of just about everything the city waking up people going to work streetcars trains carriages mineworkers factory workers homeless people peasants old people young people married people divorced people dead people during a funeral procession newborns I mean newthere is a graphic birthing scene canals damns buildings telephones elevators beaurocracyalmost anything that is found in a city and everything that you can imagine happening in a city in a single day in 1929 is on this film.Another interesting aspect is that the director breaks the fourth wall of cinema by taping the theater in which this film later was premiered and using this theater in the film.  He also shows the editing process of the film being done during the film.";

Koyaanisqatsi definitely has a moral to it portraying our spedup society as spinning out of control.  Hint  its title is a Hopi Indian word meaning life out of balance.While the older Russian film isn't as preachy at times I got the same sensation as conveyed by Koyaanisqatsi that the individual is lost in the masses and we are but cogs in a larger societal machine.  It's ironic that the Soviet Union government loved the Westernmade Koyaanisqatsi they felt it showed the folly of the decadent West.  Ironic because I got the same vibe from the Stalinera Man with a Movie Camera!Yet I don't think this was intended by the filmmaker.  He just enjoys showing that the camera can go ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE.  It shows a Day in the Life of a Big City.  Some of the images are interspersed with shots of the cameraman capturing the image.  Other images are shown projected on a theater movie screen with fast cuts between the audience and those citizens on the screen.  It got kinda surrealistic almost like you'd expect to see the theatergoers showing up on the screen.  They should've shown the cameraman outside of the theater taking their pictures as they were exiting!The updated soundtrack and wild editing was fantastic.  Similarly the music of Koyaanisqatsi scored by Philip Glass wonderfully matches its entrancing images.For their day both films were wonderfully innovative in technology and technique and are still eminently watchable.  Well Man with a Movie Camera is a tad hokey at times by modern tastes but nevertheless it's a recommendable film overall.".

Meeting nearby in an ornate domed room some wealthy industrialists decide that the savages are impeding progress and must be exterminated. After successfully bribing the head of the army General Custer is brought in to lead the effort. A portrait of their President Richard Nixon seems to watch over them from everywhere.Made in the early 1970s this surreal black comedy is usually interpreted as a scathing commentary on America's involvement in Vietnam but I didn't see it that way. There is nothing in the film which significantly corresponds to the Vietnam conflict and the few American symbols which show up are so awkwardly out of place and the characters exaggerated in such a ludicrous manner that it had the effect of constantly reminding me that this wasn't really about Americans. I can't claim to know how the European audience for which it was intended would have viewed it but I saw it as a satirical look at European racism and colonialism which of course would ultimately include both the genocide of Native Americans and the conflict in Vietnam and a leftwing allegory of capitalism in which the Native Americans represent the oppressed working classes.As a socialpolitical satire it achieves it's greatest success in depicting an absolute and brutal racism without being didactic or calling unnecessary attention to it. The most interesting character is Custer's Indian scout. Moving freely among both European and Native American societies he is detested by both groups and detests both of them in return. The title of the film comes from Custer's constant reminders of the many things which the scout being an Indian is not allowed to do. When asked by another Native American why he hates Custer so much the scout replies because he treats me like... an Indian. The pause in delivering the line and the comic reaction of both characters afterward is handled exceptionally well.All in all the film's success as a leftwing critique of capitalismcolonialism is limited because so many of its clever subtleties get lost in the comedic noise. As a satire on American imperialism it fares much more poorly coming dangerously close to being little more than a partisan screed. It does however achieve moderate success at being an entertaining absurdist farce with excellent comedic performances by the lead actors.".

It portrays the US government's crusade to exterminate the Indians reenacted in 1970s Paris complete with references to Pres. Nixon and even Watergate. Marcello Mastroianni makes a chilling Gen. Custer but Michel Piccoli is quite funny as Buffalo Bill he sounded as though he was trying to put on an American accent while speaking French! I read about how Marco Ferreri played a major role in the changing Italian cinema of the '60s and '70s. Certainly this film shows that. Specifically as the United States had been taking a different look at its own history  our own glasnost and perestroika you might say  Europe was also challenging the American cultural myth no surprise there.

I enjoyed the movie immensely. All the actors wear the same deadpan expressions as if they really are blind to the fact that they are acting out a traditional western story in a modern setting. Unlike in Les Visiteurs no jokes about the confrontation with modernity. The characters just do not seem to see it as if they live in another dimension. It creates many brilliant moments such as when a cannon is fired and a building collapses. Or if Custer points to a CocaCola advertisement and says My wife.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much like its titular subject Marie Antoinette seemed to have run out of money in its final stages and suffers from a terrible ending. Coppola continues her exploration of beautiful bored girls and to her credit no one does boredom like Sophia Coppola. I like how she compares the opulence of 18th century France to 1980s USUK. But the film doesn't have the zippy pacing necessary to pull off what was intended to be a fun and frivolous ride. Instead we are left with a tedious and frivolous ride...a disappointing combination considering the wealth of talent involved in the production. On top of that I will never understand the decision to end the story with Marie's exile and not her execution. We're not even given a HINT of what's to come! No arrest no explanation of her treason. Sure many of us know what happened in the end we don't need to see the guillotine drop. But honestly if you came into this film without any knowledge of the full story you would probably leave thinking How sad! Paris Hil I mean Marie Antoinette had to leave behind her pretty palace and all those cakes and shoes!".

Her performance came off as very artificial not realistic at all. The movie's blatant disregard for historical accuracy was pretty disturbing. It didn't focus on the French Revolution at all.

The film traces the life of the last Queen of France from her introduction to the French court until her departure from Versailles. If you're looking for serious history though you're better off sticking to Antonia Fraser's source novel. Wigs footmen and finery are more often than not filmed to the strains of 80s pop and punk and a pair of Converse shoes even sneaks onto the screen though viewers will have to be sharpeyed to spot them. It's the 18th century Jim but not as we know it. Marie Antoinette the film shares the obsessions of Marie Antoinette the character  shoes cakes finery and having fun. It even finishes before the dark conclusion to Marie Antoinette's tale  her arrest and subsequent death by guillotine for treason. Sophia Coppola's last film Lost in Translation won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay but it's safe to say she won't be receiving any such plaudits for this script. There's barely any dialogue for the first twenty minutes and most exchanges thereafter are pithy and shallow. Great actors  Rip Torn Danny Huston Shirley Henderson  are given nothing much more to do than push the narrative along its slow path. Dunst's role is mainly to giggle roll her eyes and run around in period costume. O.C. characters have more depth. Visually however the film is stunning. No better than that it's luscious. Coppola was given special dispensation to film in Versailles and all the extravagant finery of the palace's rooms unfolds across your screens. When Dunst has a shopping spree  to the anachronistic sounds of I Want Candy by Bow Bow Bow  you go with her feasting on creamstuffed cakes delicately stitched shoes and beautiful patterned fabrics. The film is an orgy of materialism filmed with the sharp editing and honed soundtrack of a television advert. All of which makes it difficult to see what point Coppola's making. The camera's fetishises the spoils of wealth and yet we're encouraged to feel sympathy for her as the revolutionaries close in on the palace at the film's end. She wants us to think Marie Antoinette's character was misrepresented  'I never said that!' she claims of the famous 'Let them eat cake!' reports  but shows us enough debauchery to reinforce the common perception. In fact it's difficult not to see the director herself mirrored in her central character as it was in Lost in Translation  the spoiled Hollywood royalty reaping the benefit of her connections to stuff herself and her film with profligate confectionery. Your enjoyment of Marie Antoinette will depend on how you go in. If you're expecting Dangerous Liaisons you'll hate it. If you think you'd enjoy an 18th century hybrid of A Knight's Tale with Clueless kick off your Converse stock up on fairy cakes and indulge.".

	schema:headline " A sensory delight";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the recent MarieAntoinette biography by Antonia Fraser Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of MarieAntoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter a loving mother a patient wife who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film The Affair of the Necklace for example which show her as superficial selfish and vain.The visuals and auditory elements which evoke a powerful image of 18thcentury Versailles are the movie's forte. And their effects linger in one's mind or at least they did in mine long after one's exit from the theater. As a budding art historian I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18thcentury Versailles. The semiprivate world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailles's codified quasitotalitarian atmosphere is evoked through a sequence of fastmoving images of champagneguzzling beautifullydecorated cakeeating and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinette's fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18thcentury Europe MarieAntoinette's secret Versailles would certainly have been as hip as this and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.The story zooms in on the character of MarieAntoinette played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14 to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner something that made her a scapegoat for all of France's problems during the 1780's. Her powerlessness to fit in is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her sociallyawkward husband played by Jason Schwartzmann her mother's chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne and thereby has not secured Austria's political place in Europe and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.MarieAntoinette is depicted as an intensely personable friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a MarieAntoinette who is a dutiful daughter a patient wife to Louis who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble two qualities which had quasimiraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments.Equipped with these essential personal qualities the charges traditionally made against MarieAntoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinette's illfated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of playing shepherdess in her pleasurehouse of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette as a refuge from the backbiting totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary let them eat cake statement allegedly made by MarieAntoinette is discarded as fiction.There is almost no place in the film for the 18thcentury reality as it existed outside the bubblelike world of Versailles. This is not the movie's purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere which again can seem surprising but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.".

Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter a loving mother a patient wife who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film The Affair of the Necklace for example which show her as superficial selfish and vain.The visuals and auditory elements which evoke a powerful image of 18thcentury Versailles are the movie's forte. And their effects linger in one's mind or at least they did in mine long after one's exit from the theater. As a budding art historian I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18thcentury Versailles. The semiprivate world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailles's codified quasitotalitarian atmosphere is evoked through a sequence of fastmoving images of champagneguzzling beautifullydecorated cakeeating and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinette's fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18thcentury Europe MarieAntoinette's secret Versailles would certainly have been as hip as this and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.The story zooms in on the character of MarieAntoinette played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14 to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner something that made her a scapegoat for all of France's problems during the 1780's. Her powerlessness to fit in is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her sociallyawkward husband played by Jason Schwartzmann her mother's chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne and thereby has not secured Austria's political place in Europe and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.MarieAntoinette is depicted as an intensely personable friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a MarieAntoinette who is a dutiful daughter a patient wife to Louis who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble two qualities which had quasimiraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments.Equipped with these essential personal qualities the charges traditionally made against MarieAntoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinette's illfated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of playing shepherdess in her pleasurehouse of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette as a refuge from the backbiting totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary let them eat cake statement allegedly made by MarieAntoinette is discarded as fiction.There is almost no place in the film for the 18thcentury reality as it existed outside the bubblelike world of Versailles. This is not the movie's purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere which again can seem surprising but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.";

Marie Antoinette is a fascinating figure in European history and one would expect the movie to account for at least a few interesting things that happened when she came to France to live with the prince. What we see is another sugarcoated Hollywood movie which is pretty much exactly like those teen highschool movies where rich young girls gossip obsess with fashion and popularity etc. The only difference here are the costumes and the fact that not all the women in this movie are as young.To top it off the soundtrack...well let me first put it this way as a stand alone compilation it's terrific to listen to but the way the modern tunes and songs have been incorporated in the sequences looks ill fit. It looks like a the characters have gone to a current day costume party rather than a movie of the period. Moreover Coppola fails to draw the body language and nuances of the French culture from her actors. Not once does one get the impression that this is a story about France. As a result of bad direction and terrible writing the performances of the actors suffer even though Kirsten Dunst does the best she could with the given material.The director portrays Antoinette as naive and frivolous. There is no mention of her historical accomplishments or failures. Now it isn't an easy task to convincingly tell the story of a historical figure in two hours but Coppola focuses the entire two hours on Antoinette being fascinated by her riches and partying around. A competent director and writer could have done so much more with the storytelling. In the current case only near the very end things start to move along but here too the story speeds up at such a superfast pace that the ending is extremely abrupt and contrived.'Marie Antoinette' is like a bad birthday present that is wrapped beautifully but once unwrapped the gift itself is far from satisfactory.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film yesterday after a lot of hype up and waiting since in my little town everything comes out a month after the release date. I was looking forward to seeing this movie..a lot. But I must say that the trailers I had seen and the film have a completely different feeling. This isn't a bad film but I think that it well get a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate not serious enough being too long being 'unfinished'... but those are not he bad points of this movie. The style is original and Sofia Coppola succeeds at showing Marie Antoinette's personal side. Her suffering through gossip and humiliation by her husbands lack of 'interest' in her etc. She succeeds in showing Marie Antoinette as a naive girl in the beginning..who hugs her first lady cries at parting with her dog and announcing that the morning ceremonials are ridiculous. We see Marie Antoinette at the beginning trying to fit in with the strict life at Versailles but further on it's clear that with the gossip following her she stops caring and starts to have fun her own way which leads to her ruin. The negative points of the film is that Sofia Coppola uses the same techniques the same scenes through out the movie. The trying on of shoes the hairdressing the patisserie dishes and the champagne. We see Marie Antoinette frolicking around in the grass too many times. Sofia Coppola apparently tried to show a girl out of touch with reality who lives just to have fun..to escape the wagging tongues of Versailles. But if that was her point the film should've ended long before. This is a biography of Marie Antoinette...even though not a completely serious or historically accurate one...but if Sofia Coppola is trying to show this French queens personality and human side then I can assure you there was more to her than the frilly lace the satin shoe the bakery department and the champagne. MarieAntoinette was a mother who cared about her children and was involved with them..though we hardly we see this in the film except the sequence of her and her daughter on the farm. The relationship and the feelings she had for her husband aren't very clear and his for her aren't very much elucidated. This is a visually beautiful film but I think Sofia Coppola could've delved deeper into this rich personality. In the end you're left with the impression of stepping out from a hazy rose petal fragile dream that from someones tumultuous life. But a dream that's still worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen this film yesterday after a lot of hype up and waiting since in my little town everything comes out a month after the release date. I was looking forward to seeing this movie..a lot. But I must say that the trailers I had seen and the film have a completely different feeling. This isn't a bad film but I think that it well get a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate not serious enough being too long being 'unfinished'... but those are not he bad points of this movie. The style is original and Sofia Coppola succeeds at showing Marie Antoinette's personal side. Her suffering through gossip and humiliation by her husbands lack of 'interest' in her etc. She succeeds in showing Marie Antoinette as a naive girl in the beginning..who hugs her first lady cries at parting with her dog and announcing that the morning ceremonials are ridiculous. We see Marie Antoinette at the beginning trying to fit in with the strict life at Versailles but further on it's clear that with the gossip following her she stops caring and starts to have fun her own way which leads to her ruin. The negative points of the film is that Sofia Coppola uses the same techniques the same scenes through out the movie. The trying on of shoes the hairdressing the patisserie dishes and the champagne. We see Marie Antoinette frolicking around in the grass too many times. Sofia Coppola apparently tried to show a girl out of touch with reality who lives just to have fun..to escape the wagging tongues of Versailles. But if that was her point the film should've ended long before. This is a biography of Marie Antoinette...even though not a completely serious or historically accurate one...but if Sofia Coppola is trying to show this French queens personality and human side then I can assure you there was more to her than the frilly lace the satin shoe the bakery department and the champagne.

What a strange mixture! Kirsten Dunst is excellent and Jason Schwartzman too as Louis XVI but what a pity for the rest of the crew this mixture of accents American English French fake French... doesn't help. Coppola tried to give a modern twist to MA's story with Rock'n Roll music and Dogmastyle filming but I found certain things quite... surprising like the masked ball at the Garnier Opera which was only built in 1874 80 years after MA's tragic death... But I thought Why not? Let's be openminded... Actually my main problem was not with this aspect of the film but more with the fact that it lacks rhythm and that it's much too long almost 2 hours!. And there are huge gaps on the historical level which Coppola tried to fill up with paintings like the death of one of her children who's erased from a painting. Could have been 'funny' but alas!... it isn't. But let's stop complaining for a moment. I gave this film a 7 because I still think that some moments are of pure magic like the part about nature when MA seems to find peace in her little 'farm' next to Versailles. In those moments I had the feeling of seeing Lux Lisbon from The Virgin Suicides also played by Kristen Dunst... evolving in a sort of timeless parallel world. Pure beauty! In those moments I thought What a queen!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having trashed two of the three movies Sofia Coppola has directed I didn't see Lick the Star yuck! what made me think I'd enjoy Marie Antoinette? I'm old and worse yet a male. Certainly not the demographic Marie Antoinette is aimed at so I found when I ventured out to my local Cineplex to check out Ms. Coppola's 4th go at directing. I figured to use the theater as my personal screeningroom on a Friday at noon. Oops! It was a school holiday and I entered one of the smaller of the 14 theaters into a crowd of a dozen or so chatting high school girls. I had mistakenly arrived 20 minutes early so I had an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussion concerning the ethics paper they were required to write and what they were considering giving up for a week as required by their class. These must have been students at the nearby parochial high school. What public high school has ethic courses? They seemed a perfect audience for a film on Marie Antoinette. The theater continued to fill as film time approached. It filled to approximately  capacity and I was as best as I could determine the only male person of my gender.So why did I think I'd enjoy a film by a director whose films seemed directed by a person with a spoiled child's view of the world? Well what I'd read about Marie Antoinette resonated close enough with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge which blew me away. Lavish imagery and a daring soundtrack set this film apart from most period dramas in fact style complete takes precedence over plot and character development in Coppola's vision of the doomed queen should sound familiar to Moulin Rouge fans.Well as soon as the black and shocking pink credits showed up to the sound of The Gang of Four's Natural's Not In It I knew I was in the right place. Kirsten Dunst was in my opinion a perfect choice. She's beautiful but not too beautiful. She has an aura of mischievousness which worked from start to finish. Ms. Dunst at the young age of 24 or so already has a long career in Hollywood. And she was only one of many. From Marianne Faithful to Judy Davis to Rip Torn to Jason Schwartzman to Asia Argento to many others perfectly cast. For me the film never dragged or bogged down. The sets were beautiful. What can you say about Versailles and the French countryside? The food was reminiscent to me of Wayne Thiebaud paintings but more colorful. The costumes the music added to the sense of decadence I think the film aimed for. Yet Marie Antoinette's character never seemed decadent. Ms. Dunst's openness and delight in all presented to her came across. Despite her loss of freedom and the difficulty in eventually becoming the Queen of France she was able to Party On! What made the film for me exceptional was how Sofia Coppola was able to make both Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI living breathing human beings rather than grotesqueries. I was moved several times by their connection or lack of the same. There is a lot to see hear and experience in Marie Antoinette. It is an accomplished and stimulating cinematic experience. I shall view it as much as I am able. This film has prompted me to review both The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation. The world is certainly in need of feminine perspective and Sofia Coppola has made a statement that she has the potential to be a very Great talent.Pardon my verbosity.".

And I state for the record that this film is truly beautiful to look at with some of the finest costuming and set design I have ever seen. Indeed Sophia seems to have more than made up for the understated tones and look of her first film and gone in completely the opposite direction in as far as Art Direction is concerned. But here the grandeur and wonder stops.In EVERY OTHER way this film not only fails but seems to revel in failure like a fat inbred hillbilly on the Jerry Springer Show. Casting is atrocious the acting worse and the direction is abysmal rick music in the last days of the French Monarchy? Really?. Miss Dunst who is usually a talented and charming actress is in so far above her head that she can no longer see daylight in fact it seems to this reviewer that her performance hit rock bottom and started digging for China. Indeed her French accent was that of a girl raised in New Jersey the rumor that she found the French accent too taxing seems to be correct as she plows bravely through if foolishly through dialog clearly written for an actress of greater depth. It could be said that she does not so much recite her lines and stumbles blindly through them.Jason Schwartzman is equally illcast of the future King Louis XVI. Again no French accent appearently it was either beyond the two leads or they simply felt that playing French aristocracy with east coast accent was more patriotic. And again no acting to be found on the screen what so ever.In fact I am hard pressed to find even one high note in the entire cast. Molly Shannon? Are you kidding? At times it was hard to differentiate her scenes in this travesty of art from any number of foolish but wholly more entertaining vignettes on Saturday Night Live. And yet with only half the cast speaking with French accents the film DOES take place in France after all the other half speaking in British accents for no apparent reason I kid you not and the two leads speaking accents that did not actually exist at this time and place Miss Shannon is spared being the worst thing in this flaming bus wreck of a film.Add in the modern day rock music yes rock music and an illearned sense of epic story telling and one can easily imagine other films playing in the same multiplex as Marie Antoinette bursting into flames just from being in the general area of this bomb.In Hollywood the saying goes you are only as good as your last picture. For the sake of the many talented people who worked hard on this picture I pray to God Above that they find meaningful work on a truly wonderful project and soon because lest that occur they may end up smelling like this rancid piece of french pastry for the rest of their lives.In closing I feel justified in saying that this film may be the feelgood movie of the year... if the year is 1945 and you are living through the firebombing of Dresden. Otherwise steer clear at all costs. Who knows the I.Q. points you save could be your own.".

	schema:headline " What a waste of time";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to see Marie Antionette ever since I learned it was being made and Kirsten Dunst was starring and being a broke college student I just now gained my opportunity and I have to say that I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a movie.There are only 3 short bits of dialogue that further the story in the first 29 minutes. Those 29 minute can be summed up in 3 sentences. Fance and Ausria want to be allies so Marie Antionette is to be married to the Dauphin. She travels to France and meets her fianc and his grandfather Louis XV  who makes a historical comment about her breasts. She and the Dauphin are married and nothing happens on their wedding night. There's the first half hour of the movie minus the fluff of explaining French Court protocol.Oh and RIP TORN as Louis XV!?!?! WHAT was she thinking? Don't get me wrong it's not that I dislike Rip Torn but in a costume drama? As a king? What a terrible choice.I'm not going into the music anymore than to say  if you're going to use rock music for a period piece at least use it through the whole movie. Don't use classical sounding if not period accurate music for the first 45 minutes give or take then use distracting 80s rock for 20 minutes and go back to the classical for the rest of it.So after wasting 2 hours of my life she doesn't even finish the story! Just a final shot of the royal bedchamber in careful ruin so they didn't do any actual damage to the room only the furniture they brought in. What was that shot about anyway? Is that how Sofia Coppola shows that the woman she wasted my time over died a terrible death along with her husband and children? The only redeemable characteristics were Dunst's and occasionally Schartzman's performances.It's unfortunate that once a story has been done it usually doesn't get retold for many many years. This was such a waste of a story that has the potential to be a good film. Not to mention what it must take to be able to film in Versailles  that's not likely to be done again for a long time.This movie reminded me of whipped cream  lots of pretty fluff to look at but no real substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had reached the point in my life where I could not bare the idea of seeing another historicalcostumedrama. The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mellodrama gives me a headache BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama with her lovely and offbeat MARIEANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar thinking Wow life sure was hard back then but you never really can relate to the characters but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate other than a miscast Rip Torn who's a little too overthetop. If you've enjoyed her other movies THE VIRGIN SUICIDES  LOST IN TRANSLATION then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIEANTIONETTE though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American but that is not the point she has created an accessible historical biopic that people of MARIEANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.".

While the film is beautiful looking and witty with its pop punk soundtrack I was ultimately disappointed. I couldn't understand what Coppola was trying to say about Antoinette showing what felt like a hundred scenes of her trying on shoes wigs and frolicking in the grass. Are we suppose to pity her like her or hate her? Kirsten Dunst performance while strong in Coppola's first film The Virgin Suicides is incredibly weak here as she herself seems to have no idea how she's suppose to play the queen. And while I love Jason Schwartzman in wacky indie movies like Rushmore and I heart Huckabees I just didn't feel like he had the acting chops required to pull off this pretty serious role. I think that Coppola should avoid big flashy films like this in the future small personal pieces are definitely what she's best at.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sofia Coppola's MarieAntoinette is one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. She tries to make MarieAntoinette out to be some innocent and lighthearted woman who was forced into becoming a queen. Coppola does not make the fact that she loved to spend millions on her material possessions while the masses starved no less a bad thing at allit's what any 20something year old spoiled monarch does so it's probably easily justifiable especially coming from the eyes of someone who grew up on her father's laurels. Only could someone like Sofia Coppola make such a selfindulgent film that tries to empathize with a queen so completely out of touch with her own subjects. I sympathize with MarieAntoinette that yes she was incredibly young when she became queen. I don't know how much of a monster she was or wasn't but I know she was excessive in everything and did not do the best that she could have. An attempt to humanize her isn't an evil attempt but to make her out to be a martyr is ridiculous. I know a lot of accounts describing her negatively are exaggerated but this is no better..People have been praising the film for its aesthetic merits. Wouldn't it be arguable that it's all too easy to create a pretty movie when the film takes place in extravagant parties in 18th Century Versailles? I found all the soft pinks greens and blues to be a bit too much by the end of the film. Half the shots weren't even necessary..Being an American film the actors were American. That's a given. But then parts of the French Court had English accents others American MarieAntoinette's daughter spoke English and perfect French but MarieAntoinette Kirsten Dunst that is herself couldn't pronounce a French word if her life depended on it. Regardless of accents the limited dialogue and acting was generally bad. Not to mention that there were whole conversations that went unheard because of overpowering music.Is anyone else tired of hip directors basing the soundtracks of their movies off their Top 25 songs on iTunes?Kirstin Dunst is a mediocre actress I've always thought that. Jason Schwartzman another son of surprise? not who I'd imagine as Louis XVI. Molly Shannon?The movie isn't about politics it's about MarieAntoinette. However when the film did decide to discuss politics it always talked about funding the American Revolution. Why not spend those few minutes discussing something more pertinent to the film and subject at handmaybe the fact that the Estates General was going to meet for the first time in 175 years? That was one of the biggest events that led to the French Revolution...With the amount of money spent on rights obtained to film throughout Versailles and all the lavish costumes you'd think they could spend some money to make Kirstin Dunst look like she actually ages.If Coppola wanted to create a portrait of a courageous MarieAntoinette maybe she should have followed her to the Conciergerie until her execution in 1793. Coppola crafted a film that loosely follows 19 years of partying she might as well show the last and most important 4 years of her protagonist's life. The ending Coppola provided is just a copout.There were just too many bad things and inaccuracies in this movie to list. l'Opra Garnier wasn't built until the 1860s under Napoleon III's Second Empire. Converses?The movie was also incredibly slow and tedious. The narrative structure was all over the place. To have 34 of the movie be a gigantic party and then nonchalantly throw in the fact that the masses were angry and calling for change is just bad story telling.Lame.".

While on a vacation trip to France to visit a cousin we decided to go see the film since it had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival just three days before I got there. My cousin had told me that while the reviews over there had been ecstatic and raves some of the french press booed at the press screening. To be honest from that reaction I immediately thought the movie was going to suck but then I remembered whatever the critics hate I end up loving so I gave it a shot. This movie blew me away! I of course had found out before hand that this film has nothing to do with the revolution or the beheading of the last king and queen of France. So I went in there with knowledge that I wasn't expecting a boring period BBC dramatization of Marie Antoinette. The film is glorious to look at! The costumes are simply the the greatest costumes ever constructed. We are used to seeing 18th century costumes with wild plooms and explosive beading and diamonds every where adorned but these costumes were much more simpler but had a dramatic effect to the eyes  this is so winning best costumes at next years Oscars. The actors were tremendous particularly Dunst who whenever I would read threads about Antoinette on here would be bashed because some people said that she cant act or she could never pull off this role. Believe me she does if campaigned right she could so get an Oscar nomination for this! She excels as the doomed Queen of France in every way imaginable! She is a frightened teenager in the beginning of the film trying to please everyone even her overbearing mother played by the wonderful Marianne Faithful and you automatically identify with her. Here is a girl who has no friends no close companions and while she tries to please her husband he jason Swarchtzman great as always just blows her off because he feels that he is not the kind who likes to have sex! So she grows up in the palace of Versailles's and gets her reputation as a bit of party girl who loves parties clothes jewelery company of women who wouldn't want that if at 19 become ruler of a powerful decadent country till finally when she has her children you see her mature and become a loving mother and a devoted wife. Sofia has made an excellent movie. Sure the script does lack a certain depth to some characters but remember this isn't your mother's Marie Antoinette. This a new wave Marie Antoinette and Sofia excels in her vision! But this film isn't for everybody. If you have a problem with rock music used in a period film then you may cringe at some of the moments when the songs are used. Also if you expect to see a full blown bio of the Queen then you are dead wrong because this film explores how one minute Antoinette was the toast of France to the last where she finally accepts her fate as the last and doomed Queen of France. It is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possession' has all the intricacy mystery and suspense of a classic piece of detective fiction.  What sets this film apart however is that the object of the mystery does not involve a dead body a piece of stolen treasure or a missing person but rather the hitherto secret love affair between two wellknown 19th Century English poets.   The clues come in the form of journal entries love letters and snippets of enigmatic poetry that when pieced together afford a glimpse into the inner yearnings of these two young but essentially unrequited lovers.As a narrative Possession' runs on two parallel tracks one set in modern times that's where the detective story aspect comes in and the other set in 1859 as we learn the details of the romance that took place between the writers.  In the contemporary plot strand Aaron Eckhart stars as Roland Michell a handsome young American research assistant who has come to England to study the work of famed poet Randolph Henry Ash a writer with a certain misogynistic strain who nevertheless enjoys the rather unique reputation among poets of having been utterly faithful to his wife.  As the story begins Ash has become something of a cause celebre within British literary circles because the year 2000 happens to mark the centenary of the discovery of his work.  While poring over a first edition copy of one of Ash's volumes Roland stumbles across some original letters of Ash's that hint at the possibility that Ash contrary to the public impression of his marital fidelity may actually have had an affair with another famed poet of the time a Miss Christabel La Motte a woman believed by her biographers to have been a lesbian.  Confronted with this startling revolutionary and perhaps priceless piece of information Roland sets out to unravel the mystery accompanied by Maud Bailey Gwyneth Paltrow an expert on the life and work of Miss LaMotte and a distant descendant of that famed poet in the bargain.Possession' earns points automatically simply by providing us with a unique storyline and a fascinating glimpse into a world we have rarely if ever seen portrayed on screen  the world of literary investigation.  We are fascinated by all the behindthescene details showing not merely the investigative footwork that goes into unearthing the biographical details of a writer's life but also the sometimescutthroat nature that propels rival investigators to both make and publish their discoveries even if that means utilizing tactics that can be described as at best unethical and at worst illegal.But Possession' offers more than just that.  It also manages to provide not merely one but two complex romances occurring at the same time though a full century apart in the context of the story.  Randolph and Christabel are both products  and victims  of their Victorian Era morality yet at the same time their struggles are universal in nature and neatly correspond to those experienced by Roland and Maud who literally follow in the footsteps of the earlier couple.  As our modern day investigators travel the same route through England that Randolph and Christabel took a century previous Roland and Maud reveal much about their own inability to make commitments in the face of possible true love.  As they tentatively grope towards one another then back away out of fear of pain and rejection Roland and Maud define in many ways the mtier of modern romantic coupling.  Yet we discover through Randolph and Christabel that life in the past really wasn't much different from what it is today.Based on the novel by A.S. Byatt the David Henry HwangLaura JonesNeil LaBute screenplay provides highly charged scenes between our two romantic couples particular those involving Roland and Maud.  The dialogue in these encounters is often sharp intelligent incisive.  The romantic moments between Raymond and Christabel have a slightly more conventional feel to them but they too often ring true in a way that is both deeply moving and strangely exciting.  Director LaBute has drawn wonderful performances out of his quartet of firstrate actors.  Aaron Eckhart as Roland and Jennifer Ehle as Christabel are particularly effective in their roles.It's refreshing to see a romantic drama that manages to generate some actual chemistry between its two onscreen lovers.  In the case of Possession' our pleasure is thereby doubled since the film accomplishes this with not merely one couple but two.   Possession' may not provide the blood gore corpses and hairraising thrills one usually associates with detective fiction but its devotion to the drama found in words poetry language and romance makes for no less an engrossing experience.".

Sadly the filmmakers have missed out on most of the central themes of the novel without substituting a sufficiently interesting interpretation of their own.A.S. Byatt's novel examines the shifting relationships between men and women a century and a half apart  to that end the characters in the two storylines the Victorian and the contemporary mirror each other deliberately. For some unfathomable reason the screenwriters have decided to cut out completely two crucial characters from the moderntime storyline  Val Roland's girlfriend and the feminist and Lesbian researcher friend of Maud's whose name I forget   their equivalents in the Victorian period are Ash's wife and Christabel's lover Blanche.One of the main interests of the original story lies in the ways in which the relationships between those characters have changed because of the changes in society that the 20th century has brought  particularly the way the main characters relate to each other significantly Maud is the stronger and more successful person in the moderntime relationship  but also with respect to all the other characters involved Roland and Val's relationship which is based almost exclusively on sex as contrasted with Ash's and his wife's relationship which is entirely sexless  the point here being that in a truly fulfilled relationship these two things must be in balance.Also the characters particularly that of Roland are bent and twisted beyond recognition  I have nothing against Aaron Eckhard or his performance but he simply plays a completely different character from the Roland Mitchell of the novel  who is not brash nor is he celibate but has a certain mousyness about him that is quite essential to the plot. Also he is British for a reason so making him into an American adds a completely wrong dimension to his and Maud's differences. Judging from the director's commentary the main reason for casting Eckhard was that he's a buddie of director Neil La Bute's  it's a sad thing that the filmmakers decided to twist the character and plot to accomodate the actor rather than making a more informed casting choice as I am sure there are plenty of suitable British actors out there that would have fitted the part admirably.Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing enough performance and is wellcast as Maud Bailey  a woman whose physical attractiveness stands in the way of her being taken seriously as the bright academic she is. But she is not being given enough scope to be the reserved intellectual she is supposed to be because her relationship with Roland developes far too quickly and with not enough plausibility particularly given a certain lack of chemistry between the two actors  thereby missing another of the main themes and contrasts in the novel.Having said that the film is worth watching for its final five minutes alone  and incidentally this is the one scene that catches most accurately the spirit and the point of the original novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to watch the movie with a little trepidation...after all I've had images of these characters in my head for years...but I also went with much excitement as I have been waiting for this movie to come for some time now. First of all Neil LaBute captured the snobbery of the whole academic scene very well albeit very briefly.  However the British characters make so much comment about the fact that he's an American that it borders on the ridiculous.  Most of the actual British people I've met actually like Americans and although they make the occasional joke about them they don't carry on like the academicians in the movie.  The point I am making is that the other characters seem to emphasize Roland's brashness so much that Roland doesn't even have a chance to show what he's truly made of why he's there working with Professor Blackadder over any dozens of other graduate students British or not who could have had his place. Much has been said about making the character of Roland an American. Actually I think that the choice of bringing an American into the academic mix not only changes this from something more suited to Masterpiece Theatre TV to something worthy of the big screen.  Roland is the outsider in the book a lowerclass Brit but he is also someone who harbors poetic aspirations and more passion for his chosen subject Ash than any of his colleagues.  The fact that he is an American in the movie helps to emphasize his outsider identity.  But the audience is never truly shown this at all in the movie. This is the true misstep of the movie and I have a feeling that perhaps some of it is on the cutting room floor  Roland's character is so underdeveloped in the movie that anyone coming to the movie without having read the book cannot help but feel he is a fishoutofwater. Sure they have scenes of Roland reading a book of Ash poetry and a brief flash of Roland writing poetry in a notebook.  But the latter scene seemed to exist only for Gwyneth Paltrow's character Maud Bailey to have another opportunity to make fun of Roland and not to help reveal any sort of depth to his character. As a fan of the book I did enjoy the movie after all.  The Victorian scenes were especially beautiful and I loved the seamless cutting between past and present in the same spaces the same rooms.  Since my only misgiving is that it was too short I feel that LaBute was successful in his adaptation...I guess I will have to look to the DVD to see if he had intended to flesh out Roland's character more.  Unfortunately Roland is never even given a chance to show what he's made of except for the fact that he steals a letter from a book  the catalyst of both the movie and the book.  His Americanness in this case  his boldness and his guile  is a good thing.  It's just too bad that we don't see more of why he likes Ash so much and what really motivates him to take up the literary chase with Maud...and this is why I would recommend to anyone who's enjoyed the movie that they should read the book...it will amaze you how much LaBute managed to keep in and it will astound you to become more acquainted with the quadrangle of characters and their individual passions and motivations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow whom I regard as an actress of rare talent and beauty so in spite of many reviewers being parsimonious in their praise for this film I ventured out to London's Leicester Square to make my own judgement and did not regret it. Following her performances in Emma Sliding Doors and Shakespeare In Love for the fourth time Paltrow adopts an impeccable English accent.This time she plays an academic specialising in the work of an obscure 19th century poet called Christabel LaMotte Jennifer Ehle whom I enjoyed in This Year's Love. She is approached by an American researcher Roland Michell played by a permanently unshaven Aaron Eckhart who has discovered a possible romantic connection between LaMotte and fellow poet Randolph Henry Ash Jeremy Northam last seen in that other costume drama Gosford Park. It turns out that Ash's marriage has no physical side for reasons which are not explained while LaMotte's lesbian relationship may not be as exclusive as was thought.All this sounds more raunchy that it is. There is in fact little sex and no nudity at all on show yet director Neil LaBute ensures that sensuality imbues scene after scene. Set against the unusual locations of Lincoln and Whiteby the modernday academics retrace the steps of the two poets both physically and romantically in crosscutting scenes that reminded me of the structure of The French Lieutenant's Woman. If you're a pubescent popcornguzzler you'll hate this movie and find it terribly slow and literary it is based on the Booker Prizewinning novel by A S Byatt on the other hand if you'd like something different from the usual mindless blockbuster fare you'll probably find this a refreshing change.".

Following her performances in Emma Sliding Doors and Shakespeare In Love for the fourth time Paltrow adopts an impeccable English accent.This time she plays an academic specialising in the work of an obscure 19th century poet called Christabel LaMotte Jennifer Ehle whom I enjoyed in This Year's Love. She is approached by an American researcher Roland Michell played by a permanently unshaven Aaron Eckhart who has discovered a possible romantic connection between LaMotte and fellow poet Randolph Henry Ash Jeremy Northam last seen in that other costume drama Gosford Park. It turns out that Ash's marriage has no physical side for reasons which are not explained while LaMotte's lesbian relationship may not be as exclusive as was thought.All this sounds more raunchy that it is. There is in fact little sex and no nudity at all on show yet director Neil LaBute ensures that sensuality imbues scene after scene. Set against the unusual locations of Lincoln and Whiteby the modernday academics retrace the steps of the two poets both physically and romantically in crosscutting scenes that reminded me of the structure of The French Lieutenant's Woman. If you're a pubescent popcornguzzler you'll hate this movie and find it terribly slow and literary it is based on the Booker Prizewinning novel by A S Byatt on the other hand if you'd like something different from the usual mindless blockbuster fare you'll probably find this a refreshing change.";

	schema:headline " A Totally New Perspective from Neil LaBute";
	schema:reviewBody "A rose by any other name is still a rose and so it is with love.  And whether or not history reflects any of the great love stories of the past accordingly andor contextually correct it does not alter the fact of it. The rose of the romance four generations later for example may become known as the lily neither does that alter the fact of what was nor of what is all of these decades later indelibly etched upon the mind's eye of eternity.  Possession' directed by Neil LaBute is just such a story within a story one the actual passion of which may have been inadvertently diminished however through the misinterpretation of the chroniclers who years before set it all down in annals made figuratively of stone and which once set forever after endured.  A romantic film of an even more romantic notion it's a twofold tale of love the stories of which though separated by generations are in the end in nature one and the same. Because as this film so richly reveals love indeed lives eternal and is borne on the very same flame throughout the ages.Roland Michell Aaron Eckhart an American is in London on a fellowship researching the life and work of 19th Century poet Randolph Henry Ash Jeremy Northam poet laureate to Queen Victoria.  History recognizes Ash as a dedicated and faithful husband and his love poems purportedly written to or about his wife are considered to be among his most noteworthy accomplishments.  In the course of his studies however Michell happens across some passionate letters written by Ash to a woman a woman who is without question not his wife.  And all evidence points to poetess Christabel LaMotte Jennifer Ehle as being the receiver of the letters and of Ash's affections.  Galvanized by the thought that he may have discovered something that would change history he seeks out Dr. Maud Bailey Gwyneth Paltrow currently doing research of her own on LaMotte in hopes that she will assist him in his quest to uncover the truth about Ash.  Initially skeptical Bailey acquiesces and together they set out across England following what appears to be the trail of Ash and LaMotte's movements during what Michell and Bailey calculate to have been the period of the romantic interlude between the poets.  And what follows is a journey of discovery for Michell and Bailey about the tenets of truth history and most importantly about love.LaBute Laura Jones and David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay for this film adapted from the novel by A.S. Byatt.  And for LaBute known for such films as Your Friends and Neighbors' Nurse Betty' and the scathing In the Company of Men' it's an artistic turn of 180 degrees.  Absent are the misogynists and narcissists who typically populate his landscapes replaced by characters the audience can warm to if not embrace entirely.  First and foremost this is an enthralling love story made all the more so by LaBute's sensitive and sensible presentation.  Visually it is stunning as well JeanYves Escoffier's masterful cinematography fully captures the exquisite beauty of the setting which complements the romance and makes for an entirely transporting experience.  What makes this film altogether satisfying however is that LaBute via Byatt manages to transcend the dominant romantic aspects of it interjecting a very subtle consideration of established social precepts and principles as well.  There is a decided sense of Ibsen about it in attitude outlook and especially in the suggestion of the roles' men and women are assigned according to the dictates of Society' both then and now.  And there is an obvious parallel drawn between the characters of LaMotte and Bailey.  Generations later Bailey has become the person LaMotte aspired to be and would have been except for the constraints of the times exemplified by the direction LaMotte's life necessarily had to take as compared with the options Bailey would enjoy in the same situation today.The casting of this film could not have been better beginning with LaBute stalwart Eckhart who perfectly realizes the character of Michell.  Through his performance he manages to carry the pivotal role of the film without making his character the focus.  Michell is central to the story but it is not about' him though Eckhart does give him something of an enigmatic presence revealing just enough about him to maintain interest but no more. Eckhart directs attention to what Michell is doing rather than who he is which successfully effects the desired results and makes the film work.From the moment she appears on screen Gwyneth Paltrow is a commanding presence.  Her initial entrance is fairly inauspicious and yet when she steps into the room the eye is automatically drawn to her it's one of those cinematic  moments' destined to remain suspended in time.  She imbues Maud with a confident reserve which enables her to dominate the scenes she shares with Eckhart pointing up not only her considerable ability as an actor but Eckhart's generosity.  Beyond all of which Paltrow has eyes that draw you in like tractor beams.The players who make this film so emotionally engaging however are Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam.  With acting souls seemingly tempered for period piece drama Ehle Pride and Prejudice' and Northam Wuthering Heights' Carrington' make the perfect LaMotte and Ash.  In Ehle's Christabel we discern a character of independence and strength beneath which lies the romantic nature of the poet in Northam's Ash we find gentleness and charm a dreamer who seeks out and finds that which is beautiful and good about the world the spirit of which he manifests in his work.  Their respective performances are elegant and there is a definite chemistry between them that renders the romance viable and convincing.The supporting cast includes Trevor Eve Cropper Toby Stephens Fergus Tom Hickey Blackadder and Lena Headey Christabel's friend.  Possession' is an excursion into new territory for LaBute and the result is a memorable transfixing experience for his audience.  1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "It needs to be said this is not a very good film but it does keep up the appearance of one fairly well carrying a facade of mystery romance and great literature. The director navigates two parallel story lines  one taking place between two secret lovers in the mid1800s and one taking place between two soontobelovers in the 21st century  the latter couple finding their romance as they are unlocking the lovestory of the former... through letters. The bad news is that the director only put his heart into one of the story lines namely the costume one and as a result the modern day lovestory between Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart as literary sleuths suffers greatly. Nevertheless Possession makes for an OK diversion into quasiromance.Starting in the positive end then periodjunkies Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are breathtaking to watch as poets during the Richmond period in England. They are two people who cannot be together for one has chosen a wife and the other has chosen a life of 'shared solitude' which is a euphemism for a lesbian relationship. Yet they begin a correspondence of love letters which blossoms into a fullyfletched romance embroidered in intrigue and quiet passion. Ehle's beautiful reassuring smiles conveying the latter. At times their story is achingly romantic so I think this aspect is very nicely tended to in the film. The graceful words in their letters even invests the film in a lyrical flow of sorts.For our modern day story Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy literary expert Maud Bailey who is also a descendant of Ehle's character but clearly lacking in her passion. The film offers no satisfying explanation as to why the chilly Maud suddenly warms up and falls for Roland Eckhart other than they they are researching the lost letters together. I love Eckhart but truly believe he is all wrong for this part. He ends up clumsy and flat and underdeveloped in the film the novel probably offered more insight into his character I don't know and again Maud's attraction to him seems farfetched. I really can't stress how bad their storyline is no description will do it justice.Otherwise Possession does a fair job of melting themes of love and love lost as it progresses and it occasionally manages thrilling. In order to get events unfolding Maud and Roland unlock the mystery of the ancient lovestory by conveniently appearing clues hidden hatches and notes. It's into Da Vinci Code territory with this approach to plot but it works to a point. There is also seamless fluent intercutting of the two parallel stories in the editing process. Neither a very solid nor very interesting template here but Possession does make for a fine pastime. 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been any number of films where time shifting back and forth is the plot device to tell a story.  Mostly the results are mediocre or even abysmal Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure it was nothing of the kind. One of my old and rarely seen favorites is The Yellow RollsRoyce.More recently The Red Violin based on Ann Rice's novel took viewers through several epochs as the impending auction of a magnificent violin loomed.  That movie worked.  And so does Possession also based on a novel and beautifully realized by  Neil LaBute  a sensitive director with an outstanding leading cast.Set in England with a side trip to France Possession follows the path of laconic American scholar Roland Mitchell Aaron Eckhardt as he works for an eccentric Irish academic.  Both specialize in nineteenth century British literature.  Apparently Mitchell is still working on his Ph.D  his duties for his employer are largely of a research assistant nature.At his master's command he goes to the British Museum to verify some data about the great poet Randolph Henry Ash come to life through Jeremy Northam.

Mostly the results are mediocre or even abysmal Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure it was nothing of the kind. One of my old and rarely seen favorites is The Yellow RollsRoyce.More recently The Red Violin based on Ann Rice's novel took viewers through several epochs as the impending auction of a magnificent violin loomed.  That movie worked.  And so does Possession also based on a novel and beautifully realized by  Neil LaBute  a sensitive director with an outstanding leading cast.Set in England with a side trip to France Possession follows the path of laconic American scholar Roland Mitchell Aaron Eckhardt as he works for an eccentric Irish academic.  Both specialize in nineteenth century British literature.  Apparently Mitchell is still working on his Ph.D  his duties for his employer are largely of a research assistant nature.At his master's command he goes to the British Museum to verify some data about the great poet Randolph Henry Ash come to life through Jeremy Northam.

	schema:reviewBody "The real question is this If a director infamous for making bad films finally makes one that's sorta OK does he deserve rich praise? My answer is no. Possession was meant to be two movies which it is. Unfortunately director Neil LaBute managed to only make only one of those movies worth watching. Set in the present with flashbacks to the 19th century the film is about two literary experts with a love of Victorian poetry who discover a shocking secret about a revered 19th century poet. The period portion of the film is excellent mainly due to some uncharacteristically good directing by LaBute and excellent acting by Jennifer Ehle and the always great Jeremy Northham if there was any justice this guy would be a major star.Sadly the modern day characters are not played by actors of such caliber. Gwyneth Paltrow I suppose should be given credit for being occasionally OK but Neil LaBute cohort Aaron Eckhart was a positively disastrous choice to play the lead. He clearly had no insight into a character who is supposed to be this sophisticated and instead played him as a stereotypically cartoonish American male slob who inexplicably loves English poetry and is a scholar to boot! Add in some truly bad writing dialogue and a screenplay that suffers from logic gaps and you've got a frustrating movie that might have been good but ultimately isn't. You'll be laughing at all the wrong parts.".

	schema:reviewBody "The supremely literary and ambitious novel by A.S. Byatt has been streamlined into a more conventional love story for two beautiful Hollywood actors in this screen adaptation directed by of all people! Neil LaBute.Aaron Eckhart and Gwyneth Paltrow play scholars of a Victorian poet and poetess respectively who discover that their two subjects were romantically involved and find themselves in a race with rival scholars to prove it and change the face of scholarship forever. The film intercuts modernday scenes of Eckhart and Paltrow falling cautiously in love with flashbacks to the two poets played by Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. I found this literal and conventional approach to be the film's biggest failing and couldn't help but think how much more interesting the film might have been if we had never seen actual reconstructions of the past and were left to visualize it along with the two scholars. However to be fair I don't know how that could have been done cinematically so it seems churlish to hold the writer and director of the film to task for not doing it.Lovers of the book will undoubtedly find much to criticize in the film as it leaves much plot and several characters out entirely and is more interested in intrigues romantic than literary but I thought it was decent. Eckhart is an extremely likable actor and Paltrow is well cast if a bit too conventionally beautiful for the role and the two have quite a bit of chemistry. If one insists on holding the film to the same standards as the novel it's bound to pale in comparison but taken on its own terms the movie is quite enjoyable.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "The ending made up for any flaws this movie had. It made me smile as a viewer.  Overall it's a good movie.  This is a fine cast. The chemistry between Northam and Ehle was magnificent to say the least. You wanted the movie to just remain with them.  Eckhart and Paltrow are fine in their roles. Eckhart is effective in his role although I do understand some people's ire that his character was made into an American. If the intent was to convey that he was an outsider who goes against convention and dares to think of things differently then I think he was still effective and convincing.  Presenting him a foreigner would only reinforce this intention. Paltrow is not bad in her role but I think this is where there is an argument that an actual British actress would have been more effective i.e. someone like Kate Beckinsale Rachel Weisz Catherine Keener or Emily Mortimer who all have the distinction of having attended prestigious British universities like Oxford and Cambridge in making the character more complex so we could truly understand the psychology of an ice cold British female academic.  Besides having a British accent which Paltrow seems to do well the part required an understanding of the woman's psyche that I'm not sure I fully understood. Despite being an American from Texas Renee Zellweger did this well in Bridget Jones' Diary although her accent was a bit posh for the character. This is my only criticism of a movie that was still good overall.".

	schema:headline " One of the worst film adaptations I've seen in a long time";
	schema:reviewBody "Words cannot capture the sadness I feel that this film has robbed me of two hours of my life.It is almost impossible to say which part of the film is the worst since screenplay direction and performances are all so reprehensibly bad. There are so many laughable plot turns that I'm not sure if this screenplay was even proofread by someone with any distance.  The catalyst for the film's intrigue a couple of stolen letters that one of our protagonists pilfers from a rare books library is only the first of many weak moments that in the transition from text to screen lose any plausibility.  Someone should have bothered to go into a manuscript and rare book archive to see what stealing from one of these institutions would really be like.I'm actually quite a fan of A.S. Byatt whose novel is the original source material for this drivel.  Possession as a novel is fun but seriously flawedWhen transferred to the screen by an underwhelming cast and crew though those flaws become insurmountable obstacles.  Any subtleties in the novel's juxtaposition of the two relationships disappear replaced by the lumbering cliches that permeate the dialogue.David Henry Hwang is a fine writer for the stage but forays into film have more often than not proven that he has not quite mastered the celluloidit just isn't his medium.  Rather than transferring the novel's richness to the screen he has attached himself religiously to it's rickety frame certainly not its most successful characteristic. Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent is as usual just shy of being believable. Both Paltrow's Maude and Aaron Eckhart's Roland are barely cardboard cutouts rather than characters and the actors do little to flesh them out. Poor Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle two fine actors are squandered in the Victorian scenes where they barely have enough material to establish mood.As for the representation of academic life it's more than a little absurd which is actually fine with me since academic life is even more absurd than this film could hope to capture.Overall I was terribly disappointed since I was hoping this would be good candy for the academic set.".

	onyx:emotionText "Words cannot capture the sadness I feel that this film has robbed me of two hours of my life.It is almost impossible to say which part of the film is the worst since screenplay direction and performances are all so reprehensibly bad. There are so many laughable plot turns that I'm not sure if this screenplay was even proofread by someone with any distance.  The catalyst for the film's intrigue a couple of stolen letters that one of our protagonists pilfers from a rare books library is only the first of many weak moments that in the transition from text to screen lose any plausibility.  Someone should have bothered to go into a manuscript and rare book archive to see what stealing from one of these institutions would really be like.I'm actually quite a fan of A.S. Byatt whose novel is the original source material for this drivel.  Possession as a novel is fun but seriously flawedWhen transferred to the screen by an underwhelming cast and crew though those flaws become insurmountable obstacles.  Any subtleties in the novel's juxtaposition of the two relationships disappear replaced by the lumbering cliches that permeate the dialogue.David Henry Hwang is a fine writer for the stage but forays into film have more often than not proven that he has not quite mastered the celluloidit just isn't his medium.  Rather than transferring the novel's richness to the screen he has attached himself religiously to it's rickety frame certainly not its most successful characteristic.

Now Roland along with another expert Dr. Maude Bailey Gwyneth Paltrow are on their trail. Along the way they are developing a romance between themselves.Posession does more things wrong than it does right. The biggest problem is the underlying story. I haven't read the novel by A.S.

Either that or the screenplay is worse than it already is. Plot holes abound subplots are started and left unfinished and more importantly there's no balance between the dual tales.The performances by the actors don't help much. Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart are the biggest names in the cast but unfortunately they're the ones we have to spend the most time with. Both are good actors Paltrow won an Oscar though undeservedly and judging by Eckhart's climb to fame and versatility it's only a matter of time before he gets a statue but they have no chemistry. At least Eckhart a Neil LaBute regular makes a game try. That's more than can be said for his costar Gwyneth Paltrow. I've never been a big fan of Paltrow she's always a little whiny and seems off. She can muster a decent British accent but that's only the surface. As Maude she's pretty boring and for someone whose sudden romance is the unofficial beating heart of the film she has no chemistry with Eckhart. The 1850's lovers Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle aren't exactly better but they have chemistry which makes them more appealing.The film isn't a total loss it looks great and I always have a special place in my heart for historical mysteries even poorly done ones.

There was plenty of spark between Roland Michell  the research assistant so immersed in Randolph Ash and subsequently in the romance between Ash and Cristabel LaMotte and so tentative about asserting his own self  and Bailey the established professor ensconced in a literary and gender studies post and formidably arrayed in poststructuralist feminist semiotics.  First Roland and then Maud are swept up in the romance of Ash and LaMotte's liaisons and it brings the former out of the shadows of his studies and the latter out from behind the protections of her analyses.  Roland does not crack the shell of an ivorytower Maud with a stiff back and a crisp demeanor with his raunchy worldliness that's somebody else's story.  Maud comes out lured into a less safe and more vulnerable position by the intoxication of passion and possibility and precisely because Roland is not abrasive and full of himself and inclined to be a threat in her space as his colleage and her former lover Fergus Wolff had been.  And Roland comes out himself daring to express to reach out lured by the fascinating combination of Maud's carefully maintained selfsufficiency and the possibility of touching her nevertheless.The movie on the other hand... well it's not entirely a bad story I suppose it's just so totally not the same story.  Nor is it anywhere near as interesting as stories of its ilk brash male whatever gets to and loosens up crisp and somewhat uptight female whatever have been done so many times before and better.".

Roland explains his singledom as he is simply off relationships but never gives any kind of convincing back story to the motivation for this. Strange gaps like this make the main characters seem onedimensional and adrift in a plot that has to rattle through events which are barely explained by what we see on the screen.I have to admit I was bored rigid and couldn't wait for the film to finish.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a delightful and touching film about a very talented musician the eldest son of Sebastian Bach. Along with Amadeus I'd call this film the best portrait of a musician on the screen. In the leading role we see Gustav Gruendgens who is playing piano quite skillful though we don't see his fingers. One can believe he is really playing piano as well as Friedemann Bach did himself. Gruendgens had those radiant eyes in this film which made him to a great impersonator of an artist in general. Yet the talented musician was not successful and died at the end in a bitter poverty. The reason was as it's shown in the film his unstable unsecure character. So he gave up his positions as a church organist and as a composer in Dresden and the ladies who loved him. There is at least one important question asked in this film how likable should make the artist his creation? How much should he think of the benevolence of his audience? It's a vital question for every creative worker. There is also some puzzle about this film which I could not solve on my own. It's about the movement of Gruendgens during his last talk to his former fianc. He moved his arms as a marionette which could be a link to some other film or stage play unknown to me. So please watch him very attentively he definitely deserves your attention. I always love to watch this film and can highly recommend it to you.".

There is at least one important question asked in this film how likable should make the artist his creation? How much should he think of the benevolence of his audience? It's a vital question for every creative worker. There is also some puzzle about this film which I could not solve on my own. It's about the movement of Gruendgens during his last talk to his former fianc. He moved his arms as a marionette which could be a link to some other film or stage play unknown to me. So please watch him very attentively he definitely deserves your attention. I always love to watch this film and can highly recommend it to you.";

	schema:reviewBody "In approaching this film one must bear in mind that despite the historical setting it is not a source of reliable biographical information on Wilhelm Friedemann Bach not is it intended to be. In fact practically all episodes shown in the film are fictitious which makes it no worse than 'Amadeus' 'Immortal Beloved' or 'Copying Beethoven'. Nevertheless this is a very compelling drama exploring the loneliness of the gifted and highly original creative genius struggling with the contradiction between the absolute demands of his artistic calling and the compromises required to please an audience and secure employment.Although the plot is not strictly historical the film creates a very authentic mood and is free of glaring anachronisms such as found in 'Amadeus' or far worse 'Copying Beethoven' not only the costumes and props but also the character's attitudes fit the period. Moreover considering the time of production this film is enjoyably free of propaganda.In summary this is a little known gem which lovers of mid18th century music will find entertaining. Highly recommended.".
