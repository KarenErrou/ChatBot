The second time Dadaodeng a Time for Freedom is 1911 and to evoke the period Hou shoots the film as a silent with piano music and intertitles and the subject of a brothel and buying courtesans as concubines  complicated by a story of going off to fight for freedom  resembles Hou's cumulatively richer fulllength brothel saga Flowers of Shanghai which is easier to follow. Time three is now and Hou lays on the contemporaneity with a trowel you've got tattoos and cell phones and text messaging and motorcycles and epilepsy and lesbian lovers and smog and nightclub singing... and it all ends chaotically... like contemporary life I guess. Each period segment has a composedly different style but number three 2005 Taipei A Time for Youth seems the least uniquely Hou of the three. It takes off from Hou's Millennium Mambo but the material has been dealt with in more original fashion by Wong Kar Wai and Olivier Assayas and many others.What justifies the three segments and makes them interact with each other is the use of the same two actors the tough but tender Chang Chen and the impossibly glamorous Shu Qi as the man and woman for each period. Seeing how they are transformed each time conveys Hou's essential message that we are entirely formed by the period we live in. Everything in the film is ravishing to look at but it's the shyness of the couple in time one 1966 Kaosiung A Time for Love that stole my heart. The final scene where the girl and boy just sip tea and look at each other and smile and nervously laugh and fall in love seemed more authentic and present and fresh than probably anything else in the whole film festival at Lincoln Center this year.

	schema:headline " A masterpiece from Hou Hsiao Hsien";
	schema:reviewBody "Interestingly enough two elites of contemporary Chinese directors have presented their latest nostalgic works between 2004 and 2005. Compared to Wong Karwai's hybrid style and inscrutable cinematic codes in last year's 2046 Hou Hsiao Hsien's new masterpiece Three times in this year's Cannes is distinctly built on a threeepisode structure and simply reminiscent of his chefsd'oeuvre from his different golden ages.The first episode A time for love is obviously associated with Hou's earlier works in 1980s. Set in Taiwan's snooker parlor in 1960s a nostalgic aura infused with youthful vigor and adolescent impulse successfully recurred in Hou's stylish experienced longshots. The subtle relationship between the two main characters was getting clear with repetition of the Taiwanese old songs and western pops Smoke gets in your eyes The Beatles' Rain and tears. This episode contains Director's real experiences and was rendered the most accessible of the three stories. The second episode A time for freedom reminds me of his acclaimed classic Flower of Shanghai. Similar backgrounds characters chamber settings fastidious costume designs refer to the identical tragic theme Historically and emotionally lost. The surprise comes from the narration which is dealt with in the form of silent movies. What struck me more is Shu Qi's weepy performance of those ancient elegies in an incomprehensible language. The last episode A time for youth drew me back to the contemporary Taiwan in 2005. This episode is shockingly flooded with a variety of GenerationX's stuff such as emails blog cellar messages trance music digital camera drugs epilepsy etc. and also focused upon a group of aimless and hopeless younger animals center of whom is a premature girl played by Shu Qi. Reminiscent of Millennium Mambo also starring amazing Shu Qi as the key character this story is loosely predicted on a girl whose relationship between her homosexual lover and a young male camera is morbidly and unapologetically intertwined. It's hard to conjecture why the director chose such an extraordinary story here as a representation of the contemporary society. Utilization of all kinds of most updated symbols has however proved his master touch in exactly presenting the loneliness aimlessness and helplessness of the XGeneration living in the new century.As the best actress in 2005's Golden Horse Award Shu Qi's portrait of three women from different times is so convincing and laudable that she is totally competent for more difficult characters.".

	schema:headline " Flashes of Hou's brilliance";
	schema:reviewBody "Three Times the latest film from Taiwanese master Hou Hsiaohsien is a lyrical sensuous but disappointing collection of three love stories set in 1911 1966 and 2005. Marvelously performed by Shu Qi Millennium Mambo and Chang Chen the film is both a retrospective of Hou's earlier work a historical study of a culture and a cogent statement about how social limitations affect each person's ability to relate. The message however that social restraints and modern technology hampers our ability to connect with one another is hardly new and though depicted via Hou's gorgeous minimalism was not enough to allow me to become emotionally involved with the characters.Utilizing a traditional threeact structure the mood of the film shifts from one time period to the other but the position of the women remains significant. The first segment is set in 1966 and is titled A Time for Love. Uncharacteristically Hou uses pop songs as background to the episode involving a chance encounter between Chen an onleave soldier and May a young woman who works at various pool halls in different Taiwanese towns. The songs repeated throughout the segment in the style of Hong Kong director Wong Karwai are the Platters 1959 version of the thirties love song Smoke Gets in your Eyes and the 1968 hit by Aphrodite's Child Rain and Tears. Chen becomes attracted to May after returning to visit a previous pool girl to whom he had written love letters while away in service.Both watch each other carefully across smoky pool tables but are forced to leave and the remainder of the segment follows Chen as he attempts to track May in local pool halls across Taiwan. Though the first act contains some poetic moments of mutual attraction it is mostly teasing in its elusiveness. May and Chen rarely speak and when they do it is mostly about snooker. Nonetheless Hou creates an atmosphere of tension as the lovers perhaps like Taiwan itself at this time must choose between remaining comfortable in their status quo or taking risks to engender more intriguing possibilities.Set in 1911 act two A Time for Freedom takes place in a concubine reminiscent of Hou's beautiful but claustrophobic Flowers of Shanghai. This 35minute segment contains no dialogue simply intertitles as in silent films and a tinkling piano in the background. Hou's ostensible reason for using this device is that he was unable to recreate the Taiwanese spoken language of the period. Though this is understandable I doubt if many would have noticed and the absence of dialogue for that long a period of time comes across as an affectation. In this section the two lovers from the first segment are now reprieved as master and concubine. The master is a political activist who writes articles promoting independence and provides financial help to a concubine pupil to allow her to achieve the status of companion.Unfortunately he does not address the issue his concubine is most concerned about  her own personal freedom and he remains indifferent as she expresses her longings again perhaps reflecting the political idea that Taiwan was not capable of independence at this time. The final chapter brings us to the modern world of freeways cellphones and text messaging. Named A Time for Youth the title of this segment is steeped in irony. No longer a subtext the lack of communication fostered by modern technology reminds us of previous films by the director that eloquently conveyed the apathetic selfindulgence of modern Taiwanese youth Goodbye South Goodbye and Millennium Mambo. Unlike Goodbye South Goodbye which employed colored filters to highlight the garishness of modern Taipei however the city in the current film is now dark and foreboding.The characters are a photographer his girlfriend a rock singer and her own female lover. The singer is torn between these two lovers and I was frustrated by the intrusion of the female lover who acts as a brake on a fulfilling possibility between the two main protagonists promised in the opening two segments. Though most likely true to the director's intentions the final section feels artificial and cold and Three Times while bearing flashes of Hou's brilliance comes across as a cinematic exercise an appealing concept that is ultimately unsatisfying.".

The opening segment takes place in the Sixties followed by a trip into the past in the next segment and into the future i.e. the present in the last. Because the same actors appear as lovers in all three the movie invites us to compare historical interpretations of love and life as well as see what is continuous in all three. Nothing much happens in any of the three though there are small stories in each the meaning of the movie lies in the sensibility and sensuous effects of each historical section. The beauty and dignity of the 1911 section is contrasted with the repulsiveness of the contemporary urban industrialized and technological landscape yet the modern women have a freedom that the heroine of the 1911 section could not dream about. The treatment of love is serious yet also playful love songs love letters and smoking tea a century ago are all customs and codes of romance movies that are used ironically here.

	schema:reviewBody "Just like recent Eros 2004and About love 2005 HOU HsiaoHsien's Three Times is another threeinone movie. The Chinese title The best of times is however taken right out of Dickens and is more meaningful but I'll come to that later.The three unrelated stories all played by CHANG Chen and SHU Qi do not come in chronological order  Love in 1966  Freedom in 1911 and Youth in 2500. Truly retro is Love starting with languid Smoke gets in your eyes which however came from a decade earlier tracing a simple encounter between two simple young people not unlike the first segment of About Love. Freedom set during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan depicts the futile relationship between an affluent writer and a popular courtesan. The protagonists are at the dawn of an age of liberation but not quite there. Instead of freedom they only have frustration. Youth is about generationz pardon the coining the lost cyber generation pardon the pessimism.Among the three there is no question that the best of times is Love when the first generation of post WWII baby boomers with innocence intact and curiosity unimpaired faces a world of possibilities and opportunities. The relationship between the protagonists is shown with sweet simplicity. Freedom is an exquisite piece of artwork filmed as a traditional silent film using intertitles an interesting reminder of something someone once said that true movies died with the invention of sound. In this segment the oppression of hundreds of years of feudal tradition is felt in every inch of the film. Youth is director HOU's attempt to complete the temporal map but the cyber generation is really not his forte.SHU proves with convincing finality that her responsibility in a movie is not just to look pretty. She is particularly impressive in Freedom but shooting that segment as a silent movie also helps in creating an authentic period feeling. Since his debut to the world in Crouching Tiger CHANG has grown and matured into difference roles most noticeably as the tailor in The Hand segment of Eros playing opposite GONG Li.After disappointed some of his faithful followers with Qianxi manbo 2001 director HOU brought to the audience an excellent Japanese film Caf Lumiere 2003. His fans should be happy to see him back in shape with Three times set at his native Taiwan.".

Not one for simple linear filmmaking director Hsiaohsien Hou instead opts for mood and suggestion and leaves the paucity of dialog to make room for emotional involvement and response. Three periods  1966 A Time for Love 1911 A Time for Freedom and 2005 A Time for Youth  are depicted with the same main characters Qi Shu and Chen Chang who prove to be exceptionally sensitive to the concept from the director with each new tale these fine actors mold new characters and questions and yet allow us to see a line of similarity in the couples as the director has suggested.The film wisely opens with the most successful of the three 'Times'  1966 A Time for Love   tracing the emergence of timid passion between a lad headed for the military and a young girl who works in a pool hall. They communicate by letters after their first brief introductory encounter and circumstances interfere with the progress of their relationship in 1966 Taiwan. The middle section 1911 A Time for Freedom is gorgeous visually and conceptually the director has elected to use the cinematic form of the period silent movie to tell his story about the freeing of a young girl from the grip of a brothel madam and surveys the political tensions between Japan and China as the quietly lighted story of love and yearning unfolds. The film ends with 2005 A Time for Youth and here our lovers are caught up in the pollution of smog cellphones emails nightclubs and infidelities for same sex affairs that speak loudly about the tenor of the times.Hsiaohsien Hou's films are an acquired taste and many will find the choppy editing the fragmentary scenes that are not always well focused for the story line and the overlong length 130 minutes too much to endure. But the ideas are fresh and the characters and vignettes are memorable and most of the major critics in the media have lavished praise on this film. It is an interesting work but for this viewer there are enough flaws to keep it grounded. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Like so many foreign and independent films these days Hsiaohsien Hou's Three Times is less concerned with telling a story than with observing the rituals of everyday life. The movie is sotitled because it uses the same set of actors to tell three different tales of love spanning nearly a century of Chinese history.The first segment A Time for Love set in 1966 is a sweet and tender tale of an arm'slength romance between a pool hall hostess and the soldier who pursues her. The second A Time for Youth in which a singer yearns for a life outside the brothel in which she works takes place in 1911 and borrows its style from silent films using title cards rather than voices to convey the dialogue. The final part A Time for Freedom is a contemporary tale of a bisexual woman caught between her male and female lovers.All three episodes are more mood pieces than narratives with emotions and meanings hinted at rather than externalized and dramatized. This is fine up to a point but eventually as a trilogy Three Times becomes a case of diminishing returns the longer it goes on. The first section is a work of tremendous charm and beauty the second considerably less so and the third is so inscrutable in content and desultory in tone that the viewer winds up virtually pulling his hair out in frustration and boredom by the time it's over. There are some distinct parallels between the first and second story and I'm sure that one could come up with some grand thematic scheme connecting the three works but frankly none of it really holds together all that well apart from the use of letters or in the case of the third installment text messages as a key plot device in each section.Qi Shu and Chen Chang have charisma and rapport as the two timehopping lovers but even they are not enough to keep Three Times from being much less than the sum of its parts.".

For instance when a woman opens a letter she's shot from exactly the same vantage point every time regardless of the origins of the letter or herself. Its just too idiosyncratic to not be meaningful.Also a lot of this film is playfully back lit as characters are reduced almost to shadows for much of the action however as they move through the frame light finds them and its really quite incredible.If you are a true film fan or a fan or Ozu Haneke Bresson or Antonioni you'll love this.".

Well I can't talk that much about the second one but the 1966 one and the 2005 story are clear examples of this. The light in the first time is a warm light an innocent one...the colors are soft and confident under that light. Like their love. On the other hand the light from the final part is cold blue distant...it doesn't invite us to join the experiences the characters are living as the one in the first part does. I guess the director becomes the light in this movie...it's the point of view the subjective eye in the film.There is another thing I liked a lot in Three times the role of communication. In the first time 1966 there are a lot of handwritten letters few facetoface words and delicate skintoskin and eyetoeye contacts. In the Second part it's mainly conversations. And in the 2005 when the characters are provided with a wide range of communication gadgets communication seems even more difficult...the scene with her crying in the motorbike and him asking if she's OK is extremely good in expressing this contradiction of the nowadays world fast motorbikes sms emails pictures...and still we are not able to express our most important feelings! All in all and in spite of the fact that the second part of Three Times might be too slow there are a couple of interesting things to see in this film.

My first thought of Three Times was that it was an experiment of beautiful cinema driven by a masterful director Hou HsiaoHsien.

Although the stories work on their own they also compliment one another so much so that the last story A Time for Youth seems less like an ending than a beginning.Perhaps the most beautiful one of them all is the first one A Time for Love.

Dreamers like Chen making his own motorbike sounds when he's on his bicycle on his way to the pool bar where he always hangs out. He writes romantic letters to the girl who works there and comes to see her one last time before joining the army. The young lady who works there tells him she's sorry the girl isn't there she's on her way to the station. A long silence follows. But what is your name Chen asks her. Her name is May.Chen writes romantic letters to May and comes back to the pool bar to meet her on his one day leave. May isn't here the new young lady who works there tells him. A long silence follows. But. do you know where I can find her Chen asks her.1966 is the time of true love and real romance director Hou Hsiao Hsien tells us. With the Platters playing their soulful jukebox romance in the background Chen and May slowly and carefully approach each other in little words and subtle movements. The way May puts an ashtray on the side of the pool table while Chen is aiming for his shot with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth and the way Chen moves it away for May when it's her turn it's just the little things that show the power of understanding in a language without words. Romance under high voltage where every moment they almost physically touch raises the intensity higher and higher.How different is the Taiwan occupied by Japan in 1911. A time for freedom? Surely not for the courtesan whose fate seems to be controlled by everyone but her. By the madam who rules the brothel where she works. By Ah Mei who would replace her as the top courtesan in time but who gets pregnant and gets bought away by the father of her child to become one of his concubines. And by Mr Chang who goes against his principles against keeping concubines and closes the financial gap in the deal about Ah Mei's becoming one. He seems to do this out of love for the top courtesan but all it achieves is that he prevents her liberty. Did he even think about that? A question that remains unanswered. All feelings remain unspoken in the Taiwan of 1911 which is stressed by the way this part is filmed as a silent movie with intertext pages for the dialogue. The only voice we hear is that of the musician pointing out with her classical Asian songs that there is reality to this world.There isn't much reality to the Taipei of 2005. A time for youth? There's not a moment of piece for the youth in this rushed capital of Taiwan where everyone is communicating like mad and where you need a damn good explanation if your cell phone remained unanswered for a couple of hours. This world is as exhibitionist as it is rushed every emotion is out on the streets and larger than life. Here shyness only begins after intercourse. A world gone insane ending on the back of the motorbike of your one week boyfriend because your girlfriend just text messaged you about killing herself. A passionless choice for a temporary boyfriend for lack of better options. At the moment.It is clear that Hou Hsiao Hsien sees true love in 1966 romanticizing it as much as possible. This way the sixties are not only the time for love but also the time for freedom where people aren't ruled by traditions and formalities aren't choked by time stress and friends. And it also seems to be the time for youth because back then they could listen to their true feelings and go after their real passion. The youth of today? They show a flood of feelings and emotions but were born with a hole in their hearts. Unspoken or flooded emotions both lack true meaning. Between those two there's a subtle world of difference.".

However one finds after the passionate first segment that the majority of the film does not quite live up to it's vast promise. Starting with it's most emotionally concrete and acutely observed segment Hsiaohsien Hou shows why he has earned the respect of his cinematic peers worldwide by beautifully and subtly capturing the heartfelt story. While the other two segments remain interesting emotional connections begin to slide throughout the tones of the remaining segments. Hou's decision to film the second segment as a silent film while breaking up the three contrasting styles nicely ultimately plays as detached and leaves the viewer unconcerned with the characters involved. Returning to modern times the third segment regains a little vibrancy but also comes across as distant and underdeveloped. This would all be a lot more tedious to watch had it not been for Hou's esteemed composition and the natural graces of the two main leads exemplified at it's finest unfortunately far too early in the film.".

The first A Time for Love hinges on the meeting of soldier boy Chen with pool hall hostess May and his subsequent search for her. The second episode A Time for Freedom deals with a courtesan tending to a Mr. Chang during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. And the third episode A Time for Youth centers on epileptic singer Jing who casually takes up with photographer Zhen while increasingly ignoring her female lover.'Neither of us left the film understanding what the commotion could have been about. We both reasonably enjoyed the episode taking place in 1966  it is sweet and innocent and all the characters seemed happy. In the 1911 episode the characters were all imprisoned by dutybound roles and happiness was not readily apparent. In the gritty modern 2005 final episode all trace of innocence and happiness seemed to be whisked away in the detritus of the modern anonymous city.The best scene for me was in the first part in the sweet romance blooming between our two protagonists Chen played by Chen Chang reaches his hand down slowly to clasp the hand of May Qi Shu. But rather than enjoy many such touching scenes I was left a bit puzzled by the dearth of interest to me in the rest of the film.I had expected that Hsiahsien Hou cited as filming subtle scenes of beauty would have cleverly used the three parallel histories perhaps weaving them and interchanging them nonlinearly or somehow relating them. All I saw was the coincidental use of two characters in love stories of three different eras. The film was slow if it were entirely to have taken place in the 1960s I could have described slow with more positive phrases such as perhaps subtly engaging or innocently unwinding or maybe even softly touching.

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Dickens once began a novel with 'It was the best of times it was the worst of times' and to these Western eyes the latter obtains here. It's a nice touch  though not exactly revolutionary  to have three sets of lovers in three time zones played by the same two actors Chang Chen and Shu Qi but the third episode is SO out of kilter with the other two and they don't exactly complement each other that it totally negates all that has gone before and almost brutalizes the eye. In their different ways the first episode 1966 and the second 19ll have lots going for them stylistically. The first episode is almost a definition of oriental inscrutability and it is very difficult for a Western eye to comprehend that ANYTHING at all is going on between the man and the girl. Of course the very concept of a girl both working and participating in a snooker hall is alien to Europenas  or at least the English  especially in 1966 which was smack dab in the centre of the 'swinging sixties' when girls were far more preoccupied with the pill sexual freedom and the drug culture than something as 'old fashioned' as snooker  but if we go along with it as normal in Taiwan there still remains the problem of the allbutinvisible nuances between the couple. The second part is much more stately and comes complete with the equivalent of Title Cards and an offscreen piano accompaniment and has been shot in a manner suggesting an old daguerrotype. By contrast the last segment is inyerface and seems to wallow in the worst excesses of modern culture where it is almost impossible to find even one character with whom we can empathize let alone SYMpathize. Those guys and gals who 'teach' film at universities will be creaming in their pants but the rest of us will wonder what all the fuss is about.".

Of course the very concept of a girl both working and participating in a snooker hall is alien to Europenas  or at least the English  especially in 1966 which was smack dab in the centre of the 'swinging sixties' when girls were far more preoccupied with the pill sexual freedom and the drug culture than something as 'old fashioned' as snooker  but if we go along with it as normal in Taiwan there still remains the problem of the allbutinvisible nuances between the couple. The second part is much more stately and comes complete with the equivalent of Title Cards and an offscreen piano accompaniment and has been shot in a manner suggesting an old daguerrotype. By contrast the last segment is inyerface and seems to wallow in the worst excesses of modern culture where it is almost impossible to find even one character with whom we can empathize let alone SYMpathize. Those guys and gals who 'teach' film at universities will be creaming in their pants but the rest of us will wonder what all the fuss is about.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this last night watching it backtoback with A Wayward Cloud and just have a these commentsquestions I like the overall somewhat mutedfaded cinematography not drab as the uses of colorlighting still stand out strongly  but it's as if a gossamer fog suffuses a perpetually overcast lukewarm environment  does anyone know whatif anything was done to treat the film itself to achieve this effect? I also like how sound is used to bridge the mimetic and diegetic aspects of the narrative the addition of white noise in the first 2 segments esp the second for example  i had thought something was wrong w my stereo and tried to adjust it!. Diegetic sounds become expressive and expressive music becomes also a product of their times.The second segment is probably my favorite. In the first one I think Hou is the most selfassured and the studied yet natural shots of the pool halls and the trajectories of the balls are simply amazing but the 'story' I feel is just a little too saccharin for me on second thought it IS a Time for Love and nostalgia. The panTaiwan shots of the blackandwhite town signs as they're traveled to are also great.The third segment is very slick and captures the selfinvolvement yet directionlessness of contemporary Youth well and the final scene of the moped descending below the bridge yet the tracking camera stays absolutely level and we simply get a shot of just the bridge the traffic the people the river the buildings and the island itself until the moped ascends  appears again  is sublime.The middle segment I feel has the most emotional as well as historical weight. There is humor the silentmovie format  Hou lightly 'experimenting' Shu Qi lipsynching the old Chinese song performance gorgeous but not obscene sets more characterization and resonance. The scene where she walks alongside the Mother down the foyer is great. The repeated lighting of the oil lamp I like how even when the caption reads Wuchang Uprising the man goes about the lighting like it's any other day and then the final injection of 'real' sound yet it's more silent than before...there are too many 'moments' to describe.The triplex structure also extends to the three actresses including Shu Qi in each segment in different roles. The lines 'A Yen sign tattooed on my back Come on Name a price I want to sell my soul No past No future Just the hungry present' are great! Chu Tienwen is a brilliant writer. Is there a soundtrack made from the movie?".

	schema:reviewBody "The cinema of helmer Hou HsiaoHsien is sometimes criticized for thin or truncated plots and lack of character development. Perhaps these criticisms are barking up the wrong tree as I suspect it works on another plane his movies are neither narrative nor character driven but atmospheredriven for want of a better term. Three Times is certainly better appreciated if viewed in this light.Hou tells three love stories set at different times hence the English title over a period of about 100 years hence the Japanese title which translates HundredYear Linked Verse. In each tale the starcrossed lovers are diligently played by Chang Chen and Shu Qi. The setting is Taiwan for all. The first is set mainly in billiard halls in 1966 which however looks and feels more like what would be 1959 if the location were the States. This impression is reinforced by the apt choice of music the dominant track is the Platters immortal rendition of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes which was released in 1958. We also hear Rain and Tears which constitutes a temporal anomaly because it was released in 1968 after the purported time of the story. This is also before the sexual revolution and the lovers for all their posturing are perfectly hesitant awkward and unsure. The thirst for love culminates in a tentative reach for the other's hand merely to hold at a bus stop.The second tale is set in an upscale house of pleasure in 1911 and toward the end comes the news of the outbreak of the Xinhai revolution that eventually overthrew the Qing dynasty. It is told silently any dialogue being presented in intertitles. It pairs a refined courtesan with a revolutionaryminded man of letters whose limits end up breaking her heart as well as dashing her dream of freedom as the piece is actually titled in Chinese the dreams are rendered times in English. Despite the absence of spoken dialogue music is present in the form of old Chinese songs lipsynched by Shu while accompanying herself on a stringed instrument possibly a yueqin and exquisite improvisation by Taiwanese pianist Constance Lee.Coming on the heels of the second the third tale seems like a slap in the face as we find ourselves abruptly speeding down an expressway in the bustling and gray Taipei of the present. Life is fast too. Shu is Jing a jaggededged newage bisexual chanteuse who projects an icy persona on stage but is fragile unstable and subject to epileptic seizures in reality. Chang plays a biker suitor with whom she eventually finds respite at least for a while one hopes. In this time the two appropriately waste no time getting into the sack no questions asked and the music is appropriately techno and hard.While most reviewers prefer the first Dream of Love the second dream is clearly the best in my mind. Despite its sluggish pace and what might be taken as temps mort there is not a single superfluous moment in it. It grinds ever so slowly but inexorably to an emotionally crushing conclusion. The frames are literally pretty as pictures  the comparison by one reviewer here to Vermeer is no exaggeration especially for one vignette in which the courtesan helps her Mr. Chang dress before a mirror. This is also the extent of physical contact we see between the two but such restraint only seems to underscore the depth of her love for him.Running through all three dreams is the leitmotif of text written with a ballpoint pen in the first brush and ink in the second and mobile phone in the third. In the first Chang's character whiles away his hours at the billiard hall with the hostess right beside him but when he wants to bare his heart he writes her a letter. In the last the web and teletext are where the principals go to get key information and deliver messages of real substance. And in the second the most poignant scene comes when the courtesan after reading a letter from the delinquent Mr. Chang is moved to actually stroke the characters on the paper with her fingers as if they were the hand that had written them and could give solace for her unrequited love.A 10 for the middle piece which could be likened to a single perfectly executed episode from Hou's Flowers of Shanghai and 6 or 7 for the two bookending it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three Times is not just your average movie and it definitely is not the type of movie that will broadly appeal to just anyone in the audience.The movie is roughly two hours long and is divided into three segments each telling a different love story in a different place time and environment. But they are set around the same two leads  Shu Qi and Chen Chang.The first segment is titled A time for love and it is set in 1966 taking place in a pool hall where a military enlisted man falls in love with a woman working there. This is my personal favorite of the three segments.The second segment is titled A time for freedom and it is set in 1911. This segment is the strangest and perhaps the most artful of the three as it is shot mostly without audible dialog. There is a piano playing constantly and whatever dialogue is there is shown as written text on the screen like in the old silent movies. The story in this is about a courtesan who falls in love with a political activist. This was the toughest to get through as it was amazingly slow paced and nothing much happened.The third and final segment is titled A time for youth and it is set in 2005. The story in this segment is about a bisexual singer who is in a relationship with two people a man and a woman but things are not all well. This last segment was fairly blend in my opinion.I enjoy Asian movies a lot and had to check out this movie as Shu Qi was in it and also was intrigued as the movie had received fairly well reviews and ratings. Having seen it now I will say that the movie is entertaining but it is hardly the type of movie that you will put into the DVD player a second time as it just doesn't have that much entertainment value to support more than a single watching.The people in the movie did good jobs with their given roles and that goes for all three segments and the director Hou HsiaoHsien does actually have quite a knack for capturing raw emotions and good imagery on film.".

A constant movement. It symbolizes the relationship or lack of between the 2 leads and how one typical day between 2 strangers resulted in a journey across countrysides for the army boy Chang Chen in search of the elusive love Shu Qi who got away.The second part was indeed baffling and I think the director got a little carried away by the constant stylish shots of the beautiful era. However you can see once again how love is wandering and roving as Shu Qi's character pines for the scholarly  businessman Chang Chen as he travels around and decides to walk away in the end.In the last feature I'm sure you notice how carefree the 2 lovers mount on a traveling bike across the highway. The loves are constantly on the move between houses and lovers. It shows again how the heart moves beyond its comfort zone and towards a newer space.I hope this helps you to tie down what's the recurring themeimage that binds the 3 vignettes together.

	schema:reviewBody "Island on Fire 1990 was released in three different version the Hong Kong theatrical run the badly dubbed nonsensical U.S. version and the original two hour plus Taiwan cut. The best one out of the three is the Taiwanese print. This film was a charity film that was made to help the director who was in some real financial trouble with some shady characters.The director's best friend Jimmy Wang Yu called up some actors who owed him some favors. The top flight actors did the work for little or no pay. They were making a movie that was going to make some money not a classic or anything like that. Just a quick film that'll make some fast bucks. Let's take a look at the different prints shall we?1. The Hong Kong cut is a fast paced action film. Only the bare bones are left. Little plot is left in the way of seeing some of the actors on the screen. The story is simple someone is hiring dead criminals to whack important people. Tony Leung Ka Fai get's involved when his fiance's father get's whacked by the dead assassin. After snooping around he finds out that they're coming from a Taiwanese prison. So old Tony gets himself arrested and his buddy pulls a few strings to get him inside the big house.2. The United States print redubs a lot of the scenes making many of them nonsensical. The dialog is drastically changed and some scenes are just redubbed i.e. Jackie Chan is thrown in prison for accidentally killing Andy Lau's brother. Whilst in prison Andy Lau tries to have some of his inside men try and kill Jackie. Wang Yu doesn't want the prisoners killing each other or stupid things like that. He wants it civil inside. So to placate Lau's men he slices his arm and squeezes out some blood whilst telling them Let Lau know that I have bled for his brother there will be no violence in my prison. Well to that effect any way.In the U.S. version he just cuts his arm to show the two how crazy he can get. You wanna see crazy! I'll show you crazy!! he tells the two as he cut's his arm?! Doesn't make any sense. It goes on like this for ninety minutes! The DVD is horrible not only is it badly dubbed but the commentary is worthless. Hell I know more about the movie than the guy they put on it.3. The Taiwanese cut is over two hours long and it fleshes out the characters. Unlike the Hong Kong version the film is fully subtitled in English the subs disappear during the last eight minuted in the Hong Kong print. What I like about the Taiwan version is that the true motives of the characters are revealed. The movie makes a lot more sense and you call feel for them. It's also not as jumpy and confusing.The rest of the movie is real interesting. You'll be in for a surprise by the wild ending and the shocking conclusion!Highly recommended!Taiwan print AH.K. print BU.S. print F".

Who the true culprit is and what twist in the plot there is at the end must be seen.It's one of few movie where Jackie is not the star.

However fans of the other big stars should get their money's worth Prison on Fire may be no classic but it is entertaining enough to be worth a go.Anyone who has seen their fair share of prison movies will know what to expect from this kind of affair nice guy prisoners who we are supposed to root for bad guys who make our hero's life a living hell prison escapes and riots and the occasional 'funny' scene to lift the mood in this case Sammo's ogling of a big breasted woman whose car breaks down near to his work detail. This one has it all!It also has a rather enjoyably silly ending which features loads of gunfire and some slowmotion squib effects and more disturbingly a shocking scene which features an Alsatian being kicked in the head the poor mutt flies through the air and lands awkwardly on its back!.If you wish to check out this movie find either the Taiwanese version or the Hong Kong Legends DVD the Taiwanese cut features several scenes missing from the US release whilst the HK Legends disc includes them as an extra.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good film yes IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NORMAL CHAN FILM YOU CHAN FANS i am a chan fan but you have to give way to a change every now and then and this is deffinately one. Yes the film is what you heard brutal violent everything a jackie chan film is not. But this is not a jackie chan film. If you put this in order of screen time Tong Leung Ka Fai would edge it then possibly Sammo Hung or maybe even ChungHua Tao as Charlie even though he is not billed as a main character. Andy Lau And Jackie Chan have a relatively small part in the film but they do make an impact.To talk about the plot the film takes place in a prison mostly. Borrowing largely from Prison On Fire directed by Ringo Lam also starring tony leung ka fai. To Run through the characters tony leung is a cop and has placed himself quite randomly undercover into this prison that he believes to be corrupt. Unfortunately the writers seem to forget that he is a cop for most of the movie and finally realise 45 the way through the film again but i dont want to spoil anything. Sammo Hung is well already in jail and the touching part of the story is the fact that he wants to get out to see his son about 5 years old i guess. Jackie Chan is some innocent guy that gets caught up in a killing and is also sent to the prison Andy Lau happens to be the brother of the person killed by Jackie Chan so he basically wants revenge. Sammo hung's character is involved in the touching parts of the film when he for instance escapes to see his son. This is early on in the film and i do not want to ruin it for you. ChungHua Tao plays Charlie he is the roommate of Leung ka fai there is a very interesting Sub Plot only avaliabe on the Taiwan release and the superb hong kong legends print of the dvd that has 30 mins of delete footage as a extra not in the film as the quailty was VHS quality the sub plot is about how ChungHua Tao's character is trying to be freed by his grandmother and how she dies and then he hangs himself but is saved by leung ka fai's character. That is just a brief overview but it is horrific that they took this all out of the movie as it adds another level seeing that ChungHua Tao's character who seems so innocent was basically brought up not knowing the difference between right and wrong.Tony Leung Ka Fai carries this movie very well he proved to me that he is a very good actor unfortunately he got arrested this was the first film that i saw him in. Sammo Hung plays his part well and it is different from normal as he uses his acting ability and not his fighting ability. Jackie chan is basically there to showcase his fighting ability he is there in all the hand to hand combat scenes and is used well seeming as he only gave up 3 to 4 days of his time to the production and the director Andy Lau gets a chance to play a bad guy as they all do really it is good to see the different and how they can act as the opposite from normality. ChungHua Tao plays his character very well and adds the level of supposed innocence to the film and there is an emotional scene towards the end that i do not want to mention involving him. The acting is very good overall in this film.To give my opinion on the film i find it hard to see why everyone hates this it is a good film in its own right so what if it borrowed from another film its what your watching at the time that matters. I can understand why Jackie Chan disowned the film as it is nothing like his films with the Exception of Crime Story but why did he give up his time? i think most of it has to do with the end scene which is very emotional possibly the most emotional scene from a hong kong action movie i have seen the actors are used well regardless of what a lot of people think. If a lot of people had given their time to the film they would have seen it from a different direction and realised that it is in fact a very good film on many levels. Action Drama whatever you wanna call it it has achieved a different level to most films i see and i think that is why a lot of fans also disregard this film as a waste of time.i would highly recommend this There are scenes of graphic violence one scene of animal cruelty however you never see the human kick the animal and the film is quiet harrowing.I would like to give the soundtrack a credit as it added terrific atmosphere to the film and also i would like to mention the great release from Hong Kong Legends they did us proud again. With one of the worst prints that they have had to work with they made it look like a new movies. Well done.".

	schema:headline " Explosive action with all star cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Film maker Chu YinPing's Island of Fire 1990 Hong Kong stars Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Andy Lau and Tony Leung and they're all great. Tony plays a cop who goes undercover into one infamous prison in order to search for the truth behind one criminal who was supposed to be dead but seems not to be that way. Jackie plays a sort of lowlife who kills a man and is sent to the prison. Andy plays a violent triad boss who seeks revenge for the man who killed his brother. Sammo is a man who misses his son and occasionally breaks free from the prison in order to see him and is always badly beaten as a punishment. Living in that prison is dangerous and so are the wardens and once violence finally reaches a horrific climax mostly because of Leung's character some new aspects about the prison death sentences and those killed are revealed.Director Chu has made many films which include a violent and gritty triad film Requital 1992 and Island has some familiar elements from that film too. Fortunately Island omits all the possible comic situations which too often destroy many otherwise great or noteworthy HK films and make them more than irritating to watch. Island is serious and pretty dark film and that is a great thing. There are couple of great and also emotional scenes which include the rice eating scene and Sammo meeting his son scene but they remain a little separate as they don't after all give too much to the whole story characters and film content and they just serve to give those scenes themselves some touching and dramatic elements without adding anything which would mean something important for the whole film. So this film is pretty shallow and misses any message or themes it may had been able to have. It has some heroic bloodshed scenes and scenes depicting the friendship and loyalty between the prisoners and those scenes are among the greatest things this film can give but they are never handled as far as John Woo does for example. Also the ending is pretty nonbelievable but still great and gritty action scene which also could have meant something more than it now does. The gratuitous final image is there just to make the film look nicer and leave sweeter taste to the mouth and thus it is pretty commercial and unnecessary I think.The film concentrates on to give us fierce martial arts fights and equally fierce gun battles and as a pure action film this film succeeds and should please the junkies of HK action cinema but if one prefers films with something more than just action then Island of Fire isn't among the greatest recommendations. I can appreciate this due to its high impact action and mayhem on screen again something neverrarely equaled by Western cinema but still I give this just 610. The British DVD by Hong Kong Legends includes the rare deleted scenes approx. 30 minutes which were included only in the Taiwanese version of the film. They give many new aspects to the film character's and in a way improve the film. Also the interview with the director is among the most interesting albeit brief extras I've seen in any DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually enjoyed this strangelyedited meandering prison drama movie which has about five different subplots involving a number of leading characters which weave in and out and develop in unexpected ways. This is a very unpredictable movie instead where you never quite know what's going to happen next and there are a fair amount of twists and shocks along the way. Unfortunately all the companies who released this film marketed it as a Jackie Chan movie. This is a lie Jackie is in the film as a supporting character only. It's really more of an ensemble piece with popular Chinese actor Tony Leung having the most screen time. The film shows the gritty side of prison life without resorting to the typical clichs although many notable sequences are stolen from Cool Hand Luke particularly the riceeating scene and the girl with no bra.This is a violent film with a ton of action in it. The martial arts content is pretty low. Chan appeared in the movie as a favour to producer Jimmy Wang Yu and spent about four days filming it thus he is used in nearly all of the action sequences which are fast and frenetic although not as well choreographed as in his own movies. There are some likable and surprisingly sympathetic characters here from the nerdy guy with the pet hamster to Sammo Hung as a father desperate to escape and see his son. Comedy is mixed in uneasily with the violence as Hung keeps escaping there are the usual slimy villain types and corrupt and evil guards to keep things moving as well. Tony Leung is excellent as the lead an undercover cop in prison pushed over the edge and Andy Lau is also fine as a villain.Onetime martial arts legend Jimmy Wang Yu who once had a career that nearly equalled the popularity of Bruce Lee's appears here as a prison boss with a tattoo all across his back. Although he doesn't get to fight and is in the film all too little must have been busy producing it as well it's nice to see the guy can still play a tough character with ease. Keep watching through the slow spots for the incredible conclusion which comes out of nowhere and offers a ton of violence and gunplay it had me reeling and is something to be seen. Overall I enjoyed this movie what with its ton of action subplots drama suspense and intrigue. Give it a go and you might be surprised.".

As it doesn't appear to be the former he agrees to go undercover in the prison to uncover the truth. The prison is a brutal place and Andy has nobody to go to if he gets in trouble. In the prison we are introduced to other key characters John 'Fatty' Liu who keeps escaping to visit his son Steve who is marked for death because he accidentally killed a crime boss's brother and Lucas the unofficial leader of the convicts.I don't know if it was just the version of the film I watched but it certainly seemed rather lacking. The most obvious weakness is that once in prison Andy barely bothers to investigate he asked a few questions about the late assassin got in trouble with Lucas then he was just another prisoner who gets caught up in a few scrapes. Jackie Chan is sold as the lead actor but in reality he plays a secondary character we do get to see some of his trademark action which is rather fun at least. Sammo Hung provides some of the film's more amusing moments as John. There is a reasonable amount of action the regular fight scenes are pretty good but the shootouts are a bit unrealistic to say the least. The acting looked good enough but the dub is pretty poor none of the voices really went well with their characters making them hard to believe in. Overall I'd only recommend watching this version of the film if you are desperate to see it and can't find a Chinese version with subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I liked this movie when I was a kid. However after rewatching it as an adult. I can now say this 1990 movie doesn't hold up! Its plot is all over the place. The film never chooses whether it wants to be a comedy escapism movie life in a prison gritty melodrama film a smooth and cool hustle  con movie or a over the top hitman film. You know that your movie is all directionless when there is three different versions of this film!! That's pretty sad! First off you got a 93minute Hong Kong version a 96minute American version and then 125minute Taiwanese version which focuses more on character development and plot detail. The best one out of the three is the Taiwanese print. Yet the version I watch as a kid was the American version released by Columbia Tristar Home Video in 2000 under the title 'Jackie Chan is The Prisoner'. Everything about this version was a big fat lie. Directed by YenPing Chu as Lawrence Full the films tells the story of an undercover cop Wei Wang Andy Lau Tony Leung Ka Fai who goes into a deadly prison to infiltrate the establishment because somebody in a prison is faking the deaths of convicts to later use them as expendable hit men for political targets. Without spoiling the movie too much though Jackie Chan is billed as the star of this film he's actually part of a stellar ensemble cast along some others including Sammo Hung  Andy Lau. The title is quite misleading as Jackie Chan doesn't come into the film until after the 15 minute mark and only stays for 30 minutes after that. It's pretty clear that Chan is just appearing as a favor to the director who was in dire financial trouble with some 'dodgy types' as his character clearly serves absolutely no purpose as his story as a pool hustler turn prisoner named Steve Tong really goes nowhere. Even his feud with Mob Boss LeeIron BallLau Andy Lau whom brother is accidentally killed by Steve is forgotten during the middle part of the film. Nor does any of his story get resolve even in the end. Does his girlfriend ever get the liver transplant?? Who Knows!? The movie never tells us. Also what is with the out of place 1986's 'Platoon' downer ending!? After all I was rooting for comedy relief Fatty Liu Hsi Chia  John Liu Sammo Hung to see his son again. It's felt like if 1963's 'The Great Escape' kill off Steven McQueen's character. It's a big mistake even if the fat jokes don't mesh well with the rest of the film. I kinda like his character. Nevertheless I also hate that the focus of the film keeps shifting from one character to another sometimes even focusing too much on minor characters like prison leader Lucas Ki Yu Wang or Chiu Charlie TsungHua Tuo It took nearly half of the movie to establish why each character was in prison. It really ate a lot of screen time. No wonder why this movie has pacing issues. Added to the fact that most of their substories doesn't add much with the overall plot. It's pretty serve as filler. Another thing why was this movie even called 'Island of Fire' in Taiwan and Hong Kong and now U.S!?! Yes I know it was filmed in island nations of Taiwan  Philippines but it has little to do with nationality patriotism themes. Even the film's theme song 'The Last Gunshot' by Cui Jian has nothing to do with the plot. As it was written as a response to the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing China. Honestly if this movie was a political thriller maybe that title and song would be logical but here it makes no sense. Even the brutal action and escape attempts scenes are a bit too unrealistic. Jackie Chan  Sammo Hung's silly scarce elaborate martial arts stunts don't mesh well with the grittiness this movie is trying to pull. Surprising it's was very jarring to see Chan  Hung with guns later in the film fighting in an alloutgun battle. I really don't see them having to resort to armed weapons before. It's also odd that they take out a large amount of heavily armed soldiers with a few handguns while the police and military oddly mostly miss them. This mindless scene was really unnecessary. Even the prison scenes don't make much sense. After all what type of prison allows a known escapeattempt convict so much access to material that would help him escape!? It doesn't add up! Also what type of prison allows the brother of a murder victim to hang out with his brother's murderer!? Add to the fact that this movie thinks that every inmate is a ballsy assassin in the making. Another problem this movie has is the English dubbing. Unfortunately the film does no attempt or effort in matching the actor's lip action. Sometimes I wasn't even sure which character was even speaking since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor! Overall 'Island of Fire' is highly clichs lost and dated. I really can't believe there is a loosely basedsequel to this film 1997's 'Burning Island 2'. It's also not the best prison movie out there nor martial art film. I really can't recommended watching both of these movies. It's capital punishment.".

Nevertheless I also hate that the focus of the film keeps shifting from one character to another sometimes even focusing too much on minor characters like prison leader Lucas Ki Yu Wang or Chiu Charlie TsungHua Tuo It took nearly half of the movie to establish why each character was in prison. It really ate a lot of screen time. No wonder why this movie has pacing issues. Added to the fact that most of their substories doesn't add much with the overall plot. It's pretty serve as filler. Another thing why was this movie even called 'Island of Fire' in Taiwan and Hong Kong and now U.S!?! Yes I know it was filmed in island nations of Taiwan  Philippines but it has little to do with nationality patriotism themes. Even the film's theme song 'The Last Gunshot' by Cui Jian has nothing to do with the plot. As it was written as a response to the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing China. Honestly if this movie was a political thriller maybe that title and song would be logical but here it makes no sense. Even the brutal action and escape attempts scenes are a bit too unrealistic. Jackie Chan  Sammo Hung's silly scarce elaborate martial arts stunts don't mesh well with the grittiness this movie is trying to pull. Surprising it's was very jarring to see Chan  Hung with guns later in the film fighting in an alloutgun battle. I really don't see them having to resort to armed weapons before. It's also odd that they take out a large amount of heavily armed soldiers with a few handguns while the police and military oddly mostly miss them. This mindless scene was really unnecessary. Even the prison scenes don't make much sense. After all what type of prison allows a known escapeattempt convict so much access to material that would help him escape!? It doesn't add up! Also what type of prison allows the brother of a murder victim to hang out with his brother's murderer!? Add to the fact that this movie thinks that every inmate is a ballsy assassin in the making. Another problem this movie has is the English dubbing. Unfortunately the film does no attempt or effort in matching the actor's lip action. Sometimes I wasn't even sure which character was even speaking since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor! Overall 'Island of Fire' is highly clichs lost and dated. I really can't believe there is a loosely basedsequel to this film 1997's 'Burning Island 2'. It's also not the best prison movie out there nor martial art film. I really can't recommended watching both of these movies. It's capital punishment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler describes my comments on this movie.  If you haven't seen it don't read this review.Jackie Chan is The Prisoner.  Usually when a title has the name of an actor in it that actor is the main character.Not in The Prisoner.  Jackie Chan plays a tiny role hardly showing his face in a fadein fadeout movie.Here's the plotline as far as I can tell most of it is clouded by unnecessary dialogue and boring scenes  a policeman needs to reveal the plans of some guy who is in charge of a prison.  In order to do that he gets himself into trouble and ends up in the prison to go undercover. First of all why did he need to get in trouble?  Couldn't the police department just stick him in there?  Maybe not but we never find out.He makes a friend and the movie goes on in a humdrum fashion having little to do with helping the plot.Somehow Jackie Chan gets into a fight with a guy because he is the best pool player around.  This man wanted him to lose a billiards game but Jackie Chan didn't so the guy tries to kill him and his girlfriend.  His girlfriend gets stabbed in the back and needs a liver transplant ???.  We never hear about her again with the exception of one line toward the end. He plays one long game of poker or other card game with someone and wins a ton of money but this guy wants the money back and tries to fight him. Jackie accidentally kills him and ends up in the same prison.  What are the chances of that happening?The plot moves on unsteadily.  One guy constantly tries to escape to see his son and another loves his pet mouse which we see only once.Soon the card gamer's brother gets in trouble and ends up in the same prison what are the chances of THAT happening? so he can kill Jackie Chan.  They fight and Jackie ends up killing the head commissioner or somebody like that.  Like I said everything is clouded and foggy.Jackie and three others undergo a fake execution and must now kill some guy who we've never heard of before.  There are a lot of guys in this movie.And then they turn invincible.  They take on practically an army of guards and military personnel armed with semiautomatic and automatic weapons while they have only handguns.  They never miss yet the military personnel can never hit.  Suddenly mass killing ensues.At one point they are all running on a runway while fifty or sixty men are all firing at them.  They aren't hit once until they almost reach their plane.  Then they all die except the main character who blows open the big bad guy's plot.The plot has as many holes as swiss cheese and the storyline to go with it is lacking exciting events.  Nothing fits together and the viewer is left behind to wonder what exactly is going on.  Don't get me wrong.  Most Jackie Chan movies have shallow plotlines but they make it up with the excellently choreographed fight sequences.  This one just puts guns to use to make mindless killing and boring fight scenes very unoriginal and useless.Nothing you'd expect to see in a Jackie Chan movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not a Jackie Chan movie despite his name plastered all over the cover.But that's the least of it's problems.If you want to watch a somewhat nostalgic 90's movie featuring ridiculous Jackie Chan hair this movie is for you. If you want to watch something coherent stay far far away.Basically what we have here is a poor attempt at a prison movie. The plot focuses around a cop who goes undercover in a prison in an attempt to find out details about an inmate who's believed to have faked his own death.Simple enough plot. Problem why in the hell did he have to beat the crap out of someone in order to get thrown in the prison? Couldn't the police just have made arrangements for him rather than him serving a 2 year sentence to get some basic information? Jackie Chan's character is even worse. He gets thrown in the prison for what was clearly a manslaughter in self defense and hardly appears in the movie at all. His character serves absolutely no purpose.There are some other characters along the way like Sammo Hung but ultimately the result is a shoddy movie that constantly features innocent men purposely committing crimes to get thrown in prison to fulfill a personal vendetta.Of course that's not all. The last 15 minutes the four male leads all have their executions faked and are suddenly now killing machines on an assassination mission.I don't use the term killing machines lightly  they take out numerous heavily armed soldiers through the use of a few handguns.The most comical part comes in the last scene of the movie when the undercover cop now free reunites with his girlfriend  the same girlfriend from two years ago when the movie began. The film clearly states that she had no idea he was undercover in prison so basically he screwed her over and she's happy to see him.To end it all we have a small blooper reel during the credits which ultimately ends with a freeze frame of Jackie's smiling face despite the fact he only gets a whopping 20 minutes of screen time.In short avoid. This movie will leave you with more questions than answers and it's not worth your time to ponder them. I don't want to get hung up on the whole this isn't a Jackie Chan movie thing but the reality is that he only appeared in this movie as a favor to the director who helped Jackie get out of some trouble with triads in the early 80's.In fact Jackie hates this movie so much that he bought it's rights to ensure it's never distributed again if you look around you'll notice that it is no longer produced on DVD in any country.".

All the characters are great and it had a couple of great fight sequences plus Jackie Is simply amazing in his screen time!. The story can get very emotional at times and since i love Prison films i was really looking forward to this one however it actually surpassed my expectations due to the great acting an engrossing and emotional story!. The only thing that disappointed me was Jackie's lack of screen time however he was amazing as usual when he was on screen and i thought the finale was very intense plus the ending was great!.I found it very moving when Sammo Hung's character escaped the prison just to see his son. This is a very good Prison film that's quite intense with great performances all around however if your expecting Jackie to be the star in the film you will be very disappointed still i highly recommend it!. The Direction is very good. YinPing Chu does a very good job here keeping things intense great camera work and keeping the film at a pretty fast pace!. The Acting is great!. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always however he does not have much screen time still i really liked his character and was tons of fun to watch! too bad he only owed the director a favor! Jackie Rules!.Sammo Hung KamBo is fantastic here he gave a great acting performanceand he was involved in one of the most emotional scenes in the movie! he was fantastic!. Sammo rules. Andy LauBarry Wong and Chung Hua Tou all do well in there roles. Tony Leung Ka Fai is excellent in his role i liked him lots. Yu Wang is good with what he had to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall highly recommended!. 12 out of 5".

The story can get very emotional at times and since i love Prison films i was really looking forward to this one however it actually surpassed my expectations due to the great acting an engrossing and emotional story!. The only thing that disappointed me was Jackie's lack of screen time however he was amazing as usual when he was on screen and i thought the finale was very intense plus the ending was great!.I found it very moving when Sammo Hung's character escaped the prison just to see his son. This is a very good Prison film that's quite intense with great performances all around however if your expecting Jackie to be the star in the film you will be very disappointed still i highly recommend it!. The Direction is very good. YinPing Chu does a very good job here keeping things intense great camera work and keeping the film at a pretty fast pace!. The Acting is great!. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always however he does not have much screen time still i really liked his character and was tons of fun to watch! too bad he only owed the director a favor! Jackie Rules!.Sammo Hung KamBo is fantastic here he gave a great acting performanceand he was involved in one of the most emotional scenes in the movie! he was fantastic!. Sammo rules. Andy LauBarry Wong and Chung Hua Tou all do well in there roles. Tony Leung Ka Fai is excellent in his role i liked him lots. Yu Wang is good with what he had to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall highly recommended!. 12 out of 5";

	schema:reviewBody "First let me state that Jackie Chan is NOT the star of this film.  Nor are Andy Lau or Sammo Hung.Tony Leung Kar Fai IS the star and plays a policeman who is put in prison to find out why a vicious gangster was freed to wreak havoc on the world. In prison he finds a rats' nest of corruption and violence.He is soon thinking of ways to avoid andor alter the volatile atmosphere he finds there by befriending one of the Kingpins and by becoming a cheerleader for more wholesome ways to let off steam i.e. a race to see who can finish building a road first.Jackie Chan has a tiny role as a man who accidentally kills the brother of mobster Andy Lau and is seen in sporadic bursts throughout the remainder of the film trying to avoid death.  In general a forgettable role...and I'm such a Jackie fan that I even own most of the dogs he has done. I include this film in that category.Andy Lau is seen so seldom you almost forget he is in the film.All of this is just fine with me as I watch the film for Tony Leung who is a real babe!  He is a terrific and versatile actor who shines even in losers like this film.  He is kind of like an Asian male Bette Davis.  His performance does not disappoint.Nor does Sammo Hung who is touching in his performance of a man who will do and risk anything to visit his young son.The end of this film is a confusing gore fest which will thrill some and disgust others.All in all I gave the film a 5.  It was worth seeing but I may not revisit for some time.".

It was a time when the island was governed by a dictatorship in which all political parties other than the Kuomintang were outlawed and political opponents were persecuted jailed and executed a continuation of the White Terror campaign launched after the 228 incident. Uncertain about their future and shaken by the weakening of family traditions immigrant teenagers joined street gangs like the Little Park Gang and fought against indigenous island groups such as the 217 to strengthen their sense of security.There have been many great films about the teenage years but few capture the roller coaster emotions the sudden shifts of friendships and loyalties the insularity and the need to belong as authentically as Edward Yang's epic fourhour masterpiece A Brighter Summer Day. The film about Taiwanese youth looking for their place in the world takes place in 1960 eleven years after the defeat of Chiang Kaishek in the Communist Revolution of 1949 and is based on an actual incident that occurred in Taipei in which a 14 yearold boy killed his 13year old girlfriend the first juvenile homicide in Taiwan's history.Shot mostly in darkness much of the action takes place at night or inside houses schools or dance clubs producing a feeling of growing anxiety. As detailed as a novel the film lasts almost four hours but nothing seems superfluous and the darkness and uncertainty build slowly towards a powerful and inevitable climax. Young actors were recruited from Taiwan schools and trained for the film over a period of years by Edward Yang then a teacher in the drama department of the National Institute for the Arts and the performances are impeccable. There are 100 speaking parts in the film though we get to know the characters only by their gang names such as Airplane Sly Cat Worm Animal Underpants Honey Elephant Tiger and Ma.Xiao S'ir is one of five children and is considered a top prospect to enter college. Chen Chang who went on to star in such films as Happy Together 2046 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon portrays S'ir as a bright and sensitive 14year old but lacking in respect for authority. Drawn into the culture of gangs he is ultimately driven to defend what he conceives to be his honor without considering the consequences. His father Guozhu Zang is a civil servant who sees his influence waning and his pleas to school officials to forgive S'ir's transgressions often fall on deaf ears. The father is arrested by the police and badgered to reveal his associates in China which brings an added strain to the already vulnerable family.The influence of other cultures also creates confusion. Both the use of Japanese swords as murder weapons and American music including an Elvis Presley song play a major role in the film and the family's complaint that they fought against the Japanese for years and now are living in a Japanese house listening to Japanese songs is revealing. As the teens struggle to come to terms with an increasingly chaotic world an offhand remark often leads to unverifiable conclusions and a chain of events that veers out of control. S'ir's world begins to unravel when he falls for a wouldbe actress named Ming Lisa Yang who is the girlfriend of Honey Lin Hongming a soulful gang leader who had killed one of Ming's suitors and gone into exile.When Honey is murdered by Shandong Alex Yang a rival gang leader an allout confrontation between gangs takes place in a driving rainstorm. As a result of Honey's death Ming becomes all too available to S'ir's friends a circumstance that leads to tragedy and the loss of a once promising future perhaps a metaphor for the island itself. Like Hou Hsiaohsien's City of Sadness A Brighter Summer Day is not a political film but a work of art that shows how individual experience is impacted by the flow of time and history.Interweaving social and political events into a very personal experience the film touches us with its lyricism the authenticity of its awareness and its genuine caring for its characters. Though sweeping in scope it is full of touchingly intimate moments and for all the tough talk of the gang members the characters have an endearing sweetness and innocence sadly lost forever in an unthinking moment.".

	schema:headline " Incredible epic of Taiwan street gangs";
	schema:reviewBody "Edward Yang's massive four hour epic A Brighter Summer Day is one of the true masterpieces of the 1990s and of the New Taiwan cinema. It's ostensibly the story of a few rival street gangs in '60s Taiwan but the film is about a single young man's rites of passage in an era in which his country was experiencing a major upheaval. The film is so meticulous in its construction and its feeling of community its preparation filming and postproduction took several years that at the same time its length automatically gives it an epic quality it is a remarkably intimate film that is about as far from an epic in the traditional Hollywood sense as possible. There are over a hundred speaking parts in the film and it is necessary to stay focused in order to keep track of what's going on and to whom which is a good trick to make sure your audience is always paying attention. A Brighter Summer Day is a very personal vision that recalls both Yang's own childhood and an actual street murder that shook the nation. The film itself slowly builds towards this singular act of violence that when it finally arrives is both shocking and inevitable. A Brighter Summer Day keeps with the trend among the finest films to emerge from Taiwan in that it is very pared down  the cast are all nonactors and there is no nondiagetic music. It is beautifully shot moving from the interiors of houses schools and cheap dance clubs to the open fields of the countryside in summertime. Alternating between violence and serenity the film is a rhythmic and poetic evocation of a particular era. Its ironic title in that there is no brighter summer day for these characters is taken from an Elvis song that one of the kids sings at a nightclub. It is a truly exemplary modern masterpiece that got no distribution in the West but deserves to be hunted out at all costs by those who love and cherish the film art.".

Alternating between violence and serenity the film is a rhythmic and poetic evocation of a particular era. Its ironic title in that there is no brighter summer day for these characters is taken from an Elvis song that one of the kids sings at a nightclub. It is a truly exemplary modern masterpiece that got no distribution in the West but deserves to be hunted out at all costs by those who love and cherish the film art.";

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Yang's A Brighter Summer Day is an enormous film not only in length but in its ambitious attempt through homing in on a particular group of people in a specific time and place to define the attitudes of a nation undergoing an identity crisis. The time is the early '60's the place a suburb of Taipei the characters mostly groups of adolescents. Like his great fellow compatriot Hou Xiaoxian Yang hurls happenings at you without explaining who is who. He makes an enormous demand on his audience in forcing us to make all the connections. As his cast here runs into dozens and many scenes take place in semidarkness it is far from easy particularly for a Western viewer to whom so many Orientals look alike to make these connections on a first viewing. Indeed I would say that after four viewings I am still working out who is who. That I have not given up and am still in the process of unravelling can only be ascribed to a gut reaction from the first that this is a work of tremendous integrity and skill. The film deals mainly with gang warfare between rival groups of youngsters which it is suggested reflects their search for identity at a time when their parents have lost theirs after years of Japanese occupation followed by the postrevolutionary separation from their Chinese mainland roots. As a diversion from gang warfare some of the youngsters find an outlet in American music particularly the songs of Elvis. The film mainly follows the course of one boy S'ir as he moves from early to late adolescence. There are others who are presented as having a stronger sense of character Ma the General's son for instance who lives in a household a cut above the rest and Honey a young man in a sailor suit who exudes a sense of honesty and authority that holds the others in thrall. But it is S'ir whom the film doggedly follows S'ir who seems to possess nothing much more than a bad temper and a developing desire perhaps mainly through peer pressure to have a young girl who will be faithful to him. It is his frustration in trying to achieve this that leads the film towards a climax that is as ugly as it is tragic. However not before we have lived through a number of scenes that are wholly remarkable none more so that a savage attack between rival gangs some resorting to samurai swords  a reaction perhaps to their parents' detestation of all thing Japanese  which takes place in semidarkness in a powercut during a tropical storm the very stuff of late Goya merciless and unblinking.".

I would not recommend that you read anything of the story before you watch the film because several of the reviews above have spoilers in them. All I'll say is that it is about street gangs but like nothing you've ever seen. It about lost childhood and children growing up so fast that its scary. The fact that all of this really happened makes it chilling.I'm surprised that not many people have seen this film yet because it certainly deserves a classic status. The direction is probably one of the best I've ever experienced and I will definitely seek out other Edward Yang movies to watch.The acting by all the teenage actors and children is nothing short of brilliant and I can see that some of the key actors never acted in another movie again which I believe is a waste.I don't think its out on video as yet however I would highly recommend that you seek it out.

Based on a true story one that shook the nation it is set in the early 1960s taking place over four years in Taiwan. It centre around the gradual unyielding fall of a young boy Xiao Si'r Chen Chang going from innocent teenager to juvenile delinquent. The film is primarily about the conflict between two youth gangs the gang leader and girlfriend are involved in the conflict between gangs of children of formerlymainland families and those of Taiwanese families it conflict culminates in an act of violence where the girlfriend is murdered. Also starring Lisa Yang as Ming KuoChu Chang as the Father Elaine Jin as the Mother Chuan Wang as the Eldest Sister Han Chang as the Elder Brother HsiuChiung Chiang as the Middle Sister and Stephanie Lai as the Youngest Sister. I don't think it is just me that would struggle to remember everything that happens in the film it is almost exactly 4 hours long it is mainly about youth and social issues of the time with some rock and roll and political turmoil in the backdrop the gang war stuff is less interesting it has some interesting moments it is certainly not the sort of thing I watch more than once unless it was shorter but I do remember liking this drama.

	schema:reviewBody "I am absolutely amazed by this film. A Brighter Summer Day is arguably the greatest of Edward Yang's films a masterpiece of Taiwanese cinema and a treasure for all cineastes to behold. Running at an uncompromising four hours in length this ambitious epic dissects 1960s Taiwanese society through the eyes of its youths many of whom were embroiled in street gangs as they attempted to search for a collective identity and find individual meaning in a new land besieged by the ramifications of major social and political changes caused by the civil war defeat by the Chinese Communists in 1949.Based on a true incident in which a teenage son of a civil servant murdered his girlfriend A Brighter Summer Day makes use of that incident not as a stepping stone to explore the ills of Taiwanese society but as a powerful exemplification of the culmination of all the social unrest and civil strife till that point that releases itself in one fatal inevitable swing of a knife an action that becomes immortalized in Yang's deeply affecting picture about the comingofage of an entire generation of rebels that defined Taiwan in the 1960s.A Brighter Summer Day stars Chang Chen in his acting debut playing the teenage son in question. Flanked by tens of young nonprofessional actors he gives a composed performance that portrays his character Xiao Si'r as a quiet and innocent night school student forced into circumstances that slowly erode his worldview into one of perpetual darkness. Ironically the English title of the film sounds optimistic and to some extent idealistically utopian. But really it is a strong juxtaposition to what occurs in the film of which Yang's provocative visuals successfully reveal to us the violence and crime that plague the streets of Taiwan.Yang's strong attention to detail and perfectionist style make A Brighter Summer Day a joy to watch. He uses the camera creatively employing unorthodox angles shot from for instance the pointofview of characters under a bed or looking down onto a stage. Occasionally he would pan the camera to a plain wall as characters converse nearby letting viewers imagine their facial expressions. The use of light or lack of it is also superb most evidently in the violent confrontation between separate gangs shot in almost complete darkness.The film's cinematography switches effortlessly from being gritty in portraying the rough nightlife of youth troublemakers to poetic when Xiao Si'r and his girlfriend Ming Lisa Yang spend time together. One particular scene is etched in my memory  that of Xiao Si'r and Ming enjoying each other's company in the countryside as soldiers in the distance practice their drills. An old bicycle with a rusty metallic bell is placed prominently in the frame  a subtle reminiscent of Ozu's Late Spring 1949 if you will  suggesting a blissful romance that may or may not blossom.Despite its length A Brighter Summer Day engages tremendously through Yang's darkly comic dialogue that not only pulls in a fair share of laughs but also and more importantly showcases his astute observation of human interaction be it in a family setting or in a wider social environment. While Yi Yi 2000 remains to be Yang's most lasting legacy well at least in the eyes of those who know this surprisingly underappreciated director it is this rare fourhour director's cut that is his masterpiece. A film of such breathtaking scope that is still unmatched in contemporary Asian cinema A Brighter Summer Day is one of the greatest films that you would probably never get a chance to see.GRADE A www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.".

Occasionally he would pan the camera to a plain wall as characters converse nearby letting viewers imagine their facial expressions. The use of light or lack of it is also superb most evidently in the violent confrontation between separate gangs shot in almost complete darkness.The film's cinematography switches effortlessly from being gritty in portraying the rough nightlife of youth troublemakers to poetic when Xiao Si'r and his girlfriend Ming Lisa Yang spend time together. One particular scene is etched in my memory  that of Xiao Si'r and Ming enjoying each other's company in the countryside as soldiers in the distance practice their drills. An old bicycle with a rusty metallic bell is placed prominently in the frame  a subtle reminiscent of Ozu's Late Spring 1949 if you will  suggesting a blissful romance that may or may not blossom.Despite its length A Brighter Summer Day engages tremendously through Yang's darkly comic dialogue that not only pulls in a fair share of laughs but also and more importantly showcases his astute observation of human interaction be it in a family setting or in a wider social environment. While Yi Yi 2000 remains to be Yang's most lasting legacy well at least in the eyes of those who know this surprisingly underappreciated director it is this rare fourhour director's cut that is his masterpiece. A film of such breathtaking scope that is still unmatched in contemporary Asian cinema A Brighter Summer Day is one of the greatest films that you would probably never get a chance to see.GRADE A www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.";

Xiao Si'r Chen Chang in his film debut is a high school boy the fourth child out of 5 in the family his parents played by KuoChu Chang and Elaine Jin are the first generation of immigrants from mainland China. Significantly introduced by the intertitles at the beginning for those who are oblivious of the political context it is a generation of uncertainty and insecurity they oscillate between kicking off their new life in an unfamiliar island e.g. the Japanese house they live in and wallowing in their past homeland therefore as their children the future is more up in the air the only viable way is to gang up and act out their adolescent hormone and hotblooded rebellion by trite brawls loafing around and merrymaking. The film is an onerous undertaking for the Taiwan cinema not only at that time it encompasses more than one hundred amateur actors with multifarious locations the epic of its narrative progression is patiently and elegantly drawn out by Yang's dispassionate camera angle sometimes tilted and long takes the flux of emotions is gradual but ample one memorable example is the killing spree in the pitchblack during the outage overtly pays the homage of Bushido's code of vengeance the cruelty of survival stands out markedly. Before Xiao Si'r meets Ming Lisa Yang her oneandonly screen role to date he is a top student in the class irrelevant to any gangster behaviors afterward he falls in love with her in the most implicit and Asian fashion but she has a boyfriend Honey Hongming Lin who is the leader of the Little Park gang. When Xiao Si'r finally meets Honey there is no hard feeling Honey's idealistic lonelyhero ambition magnetizes him and after Honey's death he follows his suit to be the guardian angel of Ming and involuntarily is involved in the payback carnage. Ming is the most complicated character in the film firstly we watch her go back to a big house presumably think she is from a wellheeled family then we realize she lives with her single mother who is the maid of the house and soon is laid off because of her aggravated illness. Ming is much more mature and worldly than her age and her innocuous looks can easily deceive audience and the infatuated Xiao Si'r. During the pivotal stabbing sequences she determinedly hollers the world will not change for you! it sharply counters Xiao Si'r's indoctrinated belief my destiny is in my own hands two worlds collide and casualty ensues. Here comes the act of passion and its grim consequences. It is a cridecur from a disillusioned youth to the adult promiscuity to the ubiquitous bureaucracy to the unjust world! Yang presents an ultrarich fodder among numerous supporting characters each one brings about a certain empathy in the societal furnace Xiao Si'r's family in particular five children are all imbued with their distinct dispositions and the tenable relationships among siblings are by turns heartmelting and heartilyunderstanding. Their father undergoes a sea change when being excruciatingly investigated by the national security officials KuoChu Chang and Elaine Jin are professional thespians among the large cast both are strikingly captivating without any incongruous histrionics with the rest firsttime youngsters. A BRIGHTER SUMMER DAY is one of the most important contemporary masterpiece of Taiwan cinema and should be recommended to cinephiles from all over the world with Yang's other legacies I can write a lengthy essay parsing every single role and contextualizing their incisive bonds under that particular societal backdrop but first of all it is in urgent need of BluRay restoration the DVD version I watched is way too inferior.".

	schema:reviewBody "This bleak Taiwanese epic based on a true story exposes the dark side of growing up in a harsh environment at a young age. I know what you're thinking Wow so original. But even though it's far from being the first film of its kind let alone the best it manages to stay unpredictable throughout and packs plenty of surprises think of the grand sweep of The Godfather flicks and that's similar to what you get here. Visually it doesn't really stand out in any significant way  at least from the print I saw. Instead going for a more downtoearth gritty approach which I liked because it suited the material. With that said Director Edward Yang makes great use of long shots and keeps things very subtle and I honestly can't think of a single bad or outofplace angle in the film. The cast consisting almost entirely of nonprofessionals is very natural in their roles even eerily believable at times when the film reaches disturbing moments  and there's a lot of those. It's a noholds barred film that refuses to compromise itself for the sake of making the viewer feel safe or comfortable.As a comingofage film it's one of the very best. As a tragic romance it delivers due to its Shakespearean quality. As a crime film it can stand toetotoe with some of the very best of them. Even more impressive is that the film is able to cover so many important and still relevant issues and effectively explore the human condition without any heavyhanded morals or messages. The film is as straightforward and honest as they come making it that much more engaging. And yet despite all its qualities it's not a film with universal appeal. Most would frown at its bleak approach and wonder where all the praise comes from. Others would skip it entirely due to it being a slow 4 hour film with no exploitative elements. Others would be wishing everyone were killed off andor there was more action and pretentious imagery they could easily gravitate towards. Others.....well I think you get the picture. Ultimately those who would get the most out of this film are those who are willing to acknowledge that the world is a messed up place and some movies are going to reflect that. So if you're easily offended go back to watching safe Hollywood pictures because you won't be able to appreciate this underrated gem. And yeah that's me being a condescending prick. Sue me what I say is true and those who have seen the film know I'm right.I'm going to go ahead and admit right off the bat that what I just wrote does not do justice to the film's level of substance and depth. This is merely a description. Others have gone far more indepth into what makes the film so good than I'm capable of doing from a single viewing so I recommend reading what they've wrote as well.".

	schema:headline " A 4Hour Long Journey Into the Soul of a Generation";
	schema:reviewBody "A Brighter Summer Day is a remarkable cinematic masterpiece like no other that has ever been created. Director and cowriter Edward Yang manages to somehow perfectly summate the alienation of an entire generation of Taiwanese youths while juggling sociopolitical tensions love triangles gangwars and Elvis. Even more significantly Yang pulls this off through the subtlest of details. The military vehicles that become a natural part of the environments. Kids threaten each other with bats used for the everAmerican sport of baseball and they wear matching uniforms mandated by a system that has no regard for their wellbeing. A young boy becomes obsessed with a picture of a Japanese girl and the idea she committed a lovedriven suicide and he then murders his romantic obsession with a Japanese blade while scolding his victim with the same words he heard his father use while beating his olderbrother. There is also the mirrorlike narrative structure that is employed with many scenes echoing eachother with dramatically enriching effects. Yang lets every piece of this story play out in the most objective ways possible yet also not making the audience feel as if they are being kept at arm's length. Using beautiful and carefully composed wideshots sometimes with takes that last for minutes at a time the film is a joy to look at while using visuals in a thematicallydriven way. At no point in the film does Yang grab the viewer by their neck and force them to look and see. Not to mention the incredible production design that anyone could get sucked into. The only way that 1960's Taipei could feel more real is if we stood there ourselves. This is a horribly clich thing to say but the environment itself is truly the film's main character. And what could be more appropriate for the story of people who are totally estranged from it?A Brighter Summer Day is a 4hour long movie and somehow every part of it is so necessary for its perfection. The sum is a sprawling novelistic complex and totally complete cinematic experience that we should all feel lucky to be able to experience.. What I have written above is a fraction of everything this movie has to offer. A Brighter Summer Day is the pinnacle of what the medium of film is capable of. What it can make us feel and know and give us experiences that are totally foreign but strangely familiar.".

Alongside Hou HsiaoHsien one of the best filmmakers to emerge from the Taiwanese New Wave was Edward Yang. Yang's 1991 film A Brighter Summer Day about a boy's coming of age in Taiwan shortly after the revolutionary uprising in mainland China endures as one of the movement's greatest works.A Brighter Summer Day takes place in Taipei during the early 1960's when the communist uprising that caused many Chinese mainlanders to flee to Taiwan was still a recent memory. The film chiefly concerns Xiao S'ir Chang Chen a sensitive boy going through a rebellious period amidst the ferment of the time and his youthful romance with a schoolgirl named Ming Lisa Yang. As Xiao and Ming's flirtations move forward the film also gradually moves forward towards its tragic conclusion.With its epic four hour runtime and Yang's predilection for long shots the film is a commitment. However for viewers willing to engage with the film it is also a masterwork. Yang achieves a subtle grace in the way he frames shots while the performances by leads Chang Chen and Lisa Yang are delicate and beautiful. Most of all in recounting Xiao's story the film promotes a heightened understanding of the historical political conflict in China and Taiwan while also highlighting the up's and down's of adolescence as a universal experience which transcends culture.".

A No we didn't see Russian prisoners of war trying to flee for their lives and drowning. We didn't in fact see anybody drowning. But this is war and people die in wars it's the nature of the beast. B Seen in its current setting especially in North America the use of the name Nigger for the Black Labrador may seem upsetting and racist explaining why that section of the movie is left out sometimes. But back in Britain in those days it would not have been regarded as so nasty and derogatory as it now seems here. It was actually a fair common name for Black Labs at the time  though not any more of course. C Nope the movie isn't entirely accurate in all aspects  many years after I first saw it back in the UK a bomber pilot from those days told me that they used not a Lancaster but I think a Halifax to plough into the ground. D Maybe it did glorify Guy Gibson but he earned that Victoria Cross if I recall for all his diversionary flights to draw off the flak from the other aircraft who must have felt like sitting ducks the way they had to drop every bomb at precisely the same spot and height very low over the water. If the movie gives him credit for thinking up the overlapping spotlights we can take that as artistic licence. Finally anything which slowed down the German war machine was crucial to Britain. This movie did its best with hardlydeveloped special effects and produced an exciting and fine picture made still during the days of rationing in England. I know because I was there at the time. I was just six when this movie was made in 1954 but it's still a real favorite of mine not least because we were living on the shores of Lake Windermere England's largest lake in the English Lake District at the time and they flew right in over our house for about six weeks that summer to film some parts of it. Remember the scene where after one of the practice runs they were picking bits of tree out of the undercarriage of one of the aircraft? My father always used to remind that they clipped one of our trees in the filming one day and he used to claim that those bits of branch and foliage actually came from our tree. I guess they probably didn't really and they faked it a bit for the movie adding that bit of dialogue into the script after the incident because it showed how low they flew. Quite why they showed it in the landing gear I'm not sure because of course they wouldn't have been flying with their landing gear down but it is effective in showing how low they flew both in the raid and in the filming. I've always loved this movie though  it's a beaut as they say  not least because I grew up with Black Labradors. I wept like a baby when Nigger died. Have just watched it for about the zillionth time  have literally lost count. It's still a fine and fitting tribute to the men who gave their lives in the raid all those years ago.".

Guy should not have been flying at all but he was so desperate to get back in the air that Bomber Harris gave in and let him. A tragedy.

But even before the war ended area or carpet bombing had been denounced within Britain as well as by Dr Goebbels as a callous terrorisation of civilians. Thousands had burned or suffocated in Hamburg and Dresden. How to make celluloid heroics out of that?The solution was to depict a strategic shift from blanket to pinpoint bombing the raid on the three key Ruhr dams. Historians have disagreed about its effects on Nazi Germany's war effort after all Albert Speer's astonishing improvisations kept industry churning out weapons until 1945. However the heavy new Lancasters which breached the dams using Dr Barnes Wallis's revolutionary bouncing bombs struck an almighty blow against Germany's prestige and morale comparable only with the Abombs on Japan impressing the rest of the world and encouraging the British while we waited for America to augment our land and sea forces for the liberation of Europe.The film's screenplay by RC Journey's End Sheriff is a model of direct purposeful exposition. We go from A to Z with no sidetracks no balancing subplots or obtruded light relief. When posters complain that today's big budget films are let down by inept storytelling this is the skill they are missing. Special effects are sometimes hokey more suited to a cartoon than liveaction but it matters little the film is not for little boys playing video games.

Some American viewers may well feel exasperated by its downbeat quality. Nothing about the girls the pilots left behind. No evil Spielbergian Nazis the enemy is barely mentioned and hardly seen except for a few figures fleeing the floods. It is as if the Royal Air Force is fighting Nature. No big speeches about saving Democracy no invocations of service tradition the RAF was barely 20 years old though it was the world's first independent air force. Not even much jolly banter in the mess and no dogfights in the skies either. Just a bunch of  types thrown together by the need to get a tough mission over and done with. There is even a moment where Bomber Command's chief Sir Arthur Harris Basil Sydney who was still very much alive and kicking is implicitly criticised. Wallis recalls how the Luftwaffe wrongly thought London could be blitzed into ruins hinting that the British are now making the same blunder about Germany.Typical of Anderson's throwaway approach is the scuffle in the mess between 617's members and other pilots who jovially accuse them of shirking. As soon as the fight breaks out he cuts away to Gibson saying that he must get his boys settled down. After the raid the camera roams round the deserted sleeping quarters of the men who didn't come back. It is more cinematic to show symbols of fear and loss than to chatter about these emotions here the British stiff upper lip the equivalent of the grace under pressure which the anglophile Hemingway looked for in Americans works in the service of visual communication.Redgrave likewise shows his character more than he talks. His body language evokes the boffin who is better at thought than speech. He fiddles with his spectacles shambles around with an unmartial gait bunched up with his arms pressed to his sides as if pinioned by frustration. When the bomb finally bounces he says nothing but flings his arms aloft for once. He utters mildly donnishly and at moments of maximum feeling he cannot speak at all. His performance is all of a piece the best movie work by one who in other roles often looked unsuitably stiff on screen.The airplanes are posted missing on a blackboard a BBC radio announcer with only a hint of triumph tells of the raid's success and cost. Wallis and Gibson exchange awkward congratulations tinged with remorse in the justly famous final scene. The flak was bad worse than I expected says Gibson beginning to apologise for his triumph as soon as he lands. Perhaps only a Brit soaked in the mythology of honourable defeats such as Dunkirk and Coruna can understand such understatement. We are superstitiously afraid to gloat over victories as Orwell noted.Eric Coates's splendid march is played in full only at this finale as if to reward the audience for understanding why the chief protagonists' hearts are too full for rhetoric. And even then the stringbased orchestration sounds sober and slightly plaintive not jaunty like Sousa or Miller or bombastic like a German brass band.In the spirit of economy which guides The Dam Busters no real life sequelae are given over the credits.

Harris was also refused permission to issue a final despatch on his campaign. For the rest of his days he resented the slight on my bomber boys of whom 50000 died. Like Wallis he lived into his tenth decade old enough to see Speer confirm in his autobiography that area bombing had indeed devastated the Nazi war effort. War can be cruel even after it is over.

	schema:reviewBody "In the spring of 1942 the English design engineer Barnes Wallis is working on a revolutionary new bomb capable of breaching Germany's hydroelectric dams.  This film with its unforgettable Dam Busters March by Eric Coates recounts the story of the development of the bomb and the devising of special tactics for attacking Germany's industrial heartland. It is also a tribute to the genius of Wallis and the courage and skill of the men who made the concept work.The great dams of western Germany harnessing the energy of the rivers Moehne Eder and Sorbe were an important power source for the Nazi war effort.  If the dams could be breached then the loss of electrical energy and the collateral flooding would it was hoped cripple German industry and shorten the war.As the film opens Wallis is pondering the one central problem associated with bombing a dam.  Any explosion in the water and direct hits on the dam wall are too much to expect is cushioned by the fluidity and no structural damage results.We see Wallis eagerly experimenting in his back yard surrounded and assisted by his adoring children.  His brilliant idea is this  if a bomb can be delivered at the correct shallow trajectory and the right high speed it will 'skip' along the lake's surface like a pebble on a pond strike the dam and slide down the wall.  A depthsensitive trigger could then detonate the bomb where it would do maximum damage.The idea is a daring and imaginative one and predictably enough the various government departments are slow to see its merit.  Wallis spends many disheartening hours waiting to speak to unsympathetic civil servants. In a lovely piece of ironic humour a Whitehall mandarin points out to Wallis the difficulties inherent in obtaining a Wellington bomber for tests and Wallis quietly suggests that his own role as the creator of the Wellington might be of some assistance.Wallis is constantly being told that resources are scarce that the communal effort requires sacrifices and so forth.  There is he is told a very thin dividing line between inspiration and obsession.  However the eccentric genius persists and eventually Churchill gets to hear of the idea.  From that moment on the project gathers momentum.  'Bomber' Harris the chief of Britain's Bomber Command sets up trials.  The 'bouncing bomb' is at last a reality.Major disappointments accompany the trials.  The casing of the bomb has to be drastically redesigned and it transpires that the aircraft will need to approach the dam considerably lower and faster than had been envisaged. The RAF's standard altimeters are useless at heights of 50 feet and the resulting danger to crews of flying blind at almost zero altitude are unacceptable.At this point Commander Guy Gibson the pilot who will lead the raid has his own flash of inspiration.  The spotlights in a variety theatre give him the idea of two converging light beams shining downwards from aircraft to water which will fix the plane's altitude precisely.  If this all sounds a little 'Heath Robinson' it is nothing compared to the viewing gadget which is cobbled together to enable crews to align on the twin towers of the dam.The climax of the film the actual attack on the German dams is rather a disappointment.  Antiaircraft tracer coming up from the German defenders is superimposed on the photographic matrix in the most amateurish of ways. The sound of the ground batteries is unrealistic staying at a constant pitch and volume however the aircraft manoeuvre.  The explosions are the poorest efforts of all being no more than scraps of film and drawings patched unconvincingly onto shots of a model dam.Michael Redgrave does a commendable job of 'creating' Barnes Wallis for the screen quintessentially English and understated  with his runner beans and his cricket jokes.  The man's boyish enthusiasm comes across.  In this respect the bathtub in the yard the setting for his primitive experiments serves two cinematic purposes showing us the simple unprepossessing genius of the English people and explaining in visual terms exactly how the bomb will work.Good use is made of genuine Air Ministry film of the bouncing bomb tests.  If the ultimate effect on Germany's war capacity is exaggerated this can be forgiven.Richard Todd is terrific as Gibson the tough little leader of the mission the emotional man who is able through intense selfdiscipline to keep his feelings in check and do his duty.  The powerful ending is almost too much to take with the empty seats in the officers' mess and Todd striding off in stiffupperlip fashion to 'write a few letters'.  No English heart can fail to be stirred by that marvellous theme tune.".

	schema:reviewBody "I personally went to school in the town where the Raids were monitored from Grantham by Wallis and Harris. There is hardly any memorabilia recording this local fact and noone would ever know. I know of RAF Scampton too which I believe has closed down some years ago. For Lincolnshire the Dams Raid is remembered poignantly as the 617 Squadron who now fly Tornadosin Scotland was formed and trained there. They practised on the Derwent Reservoir near Sheffield and the Eyebrook Reservoir in Leicestershire.Sir Barnes Wallis thought in innovative ways and the fact that this 'far out' idea of bouncing bombs on a lake actually breached two dams is an engineering marvel. To do so under heavy flak is beating the odds. Wallis and 617 Squadron collaborated again with the Tallboy and Grand Slam 'earthquake' bombs which destroyed many important railway viaducts and tunnels as well as sinking the Tirpitz.Richard Todd after the film moved 3 miles from Grantham. Maybe the film was the reason for this. The film is one of few about RAF Bomber Command and is a good portrayal of the danger involved. 41 of crew were killed 55000. After early 1944 the loss rate rapidly decreased as the Luftwaffe had been destroyed so from 19403 I would guess 6070 of crew were killed for the whole campaign. It may be higher. The RAF didn't even know the Germans had excellent radar until early 1942. The film is about team work and working under stress  your immediate future depended on 6 other people. Many things could go wrong along the way. It is also about strong resilience to new ideas. i.e. The RAF could have had jet planes before 1939 if they'd have developed Whittle's ideas in the 1930s instead of foolishly waiting 10 whole years until 1941. Whittle was then humiliated after the war by forcing him to give all his designs to the Americans who didn't waste any time in treating the idea as their own.When I first saw the film I thought the special effects were weak and I was astonished a bomb bounced in the first place. When older and seeing it again you can empathise more with the RAF crews and the skill and daring they would need. It focuses on one story line and does not have American accents mysteriously appearing from nowhere. I think at the time Guy Gibson was about 25. Imagine yourself having that responsibility at 25.Many of the 'Upkeep' mines that were bounced completely missed the targets. Certainly for the Eder dam there was just one mine left and was dropped in the right place and destroyed the dam in 'one go'. The film gives the impression many were exploded to breach the dam but actually a single one did the 'job'. The Germans are never shown and I would love to have known what they thought seeing this strange sight of bombs skimming the water's surface. I think Spielberg would have enjoyed making this film but half of it would have been about the Germans. If the dams had been breached six months earlier when a water pumping system had not been installed the Germans would have been seriously up the creek with no paddles. The Ruhr Industry would have been unable to function at all. Do not underestimate what hypothetical difference the dams breach could have made to the Germans in their biggest industrial area.Do women enjoy the film too or is all the technical wizardry just for the male audience? Why did Pink Floyd use it in their film 'The Wall'? Carling Black Label used the lake scenes many times in notorious adverts.".

	onyx:emotionText "I personally went to school in the town where the Raids were monitored from Grantham by Wallis and Harris. There is hardly any memorabilia recording this local fact and noone would ever know. I know of RAF Scampton too which I believe has closed down some years ago. For Lincolnshire the Dams Raid is remembered poignantly as the 617 Squadron who now fly Tornadosin Scotland was formed and trained there. They practised on the Derwent Reservoir near Sheffield and the Eyebrook Reservoir in Leicestershire.Sir Barnes Wallis thought in innovative ways and the fact that this 'far out' idea of bouncing bombs on a lake actually breached two dams is an engineering marvel. To do so under heavy flak is beating the odds. Wallis and 617 Squadron collaborated again with the Tallboy and Grand Slam 'earthquake' bombs which destroyed many important railway viaducts and tunnels as well as sinking the Tirpitz.Richard Todd after the film moved 3 miles from Grantham.

	schema:headline " Effective and exciting British war movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film recounts an historical incident in which about two dozen British Lancasters delivered specially designed bombs that destroyed two important dams supplying water and hydroelectric power to the industrial area of the Ruhr. It sticks fairly close to the facts and it doesn't meander about. No rivalries over women in the pub. No women at all practically. There is one brawl between fliers but it's a goodnatured freeforall in which everyone wrestles and laughs and no one throws a punch. The whole film is constructed around that cheerful exuberance. Everyone is anxious to take on this dangerous job. Nobody weeps. And when the bomb's designer hears of the mission's success he grins widely and flaps his arms against his side as others congratulate him. And that's it.The film is really divided into two parts. In the first we follow the man who designed the plan and the bomb to go with it Barnes Wallace played as an abstracted but determined boffin. He also designed a couple of bombers. In order to hit the dam and sink to the proper depth before exploding the bomb must be dropped from 60 feet at a designated speed and a specified distance from the target  and at night too. The film tells us that much but leaves out the fact that the bomb had to have a reverse spin of 500 rpm at the time of release so the project was still more challenging. It's almost inconceivable that such a mission could be pulled off.In the second part of the film Guy Gibson Richard Todd and his fliers train to the point of exhaustion before undertaking the mission which is about as deadly as can be imagined. Fiftysix men failed to return. Gibson was killed on a later mission. The climactic action scenes are well done if the events themselves are a little turgid. At times it's a little difficult to follow what's happening and who exactly is involved though the general sense gets through. Two of the three target dams were destroyed flooding the valleys downstream but the dams were up and running again about five weeks later. More than 1200 people were killed on the ground mainly allied POWs. Spectacular raids often make for good drama but the results if the missions are successful are often temporary. Eg. Ploesti. The enemy has a habit of fixing things that are damaged. It seems depending on the particular targets that you either have to pulverize them or attack them repeatedly and even then the enemy adapts.None of this these nettles of realism can possibly reflect on the courage of Gibson and his colleagues. The decorations they earned were more than deserved. And none of this should make a viewer hesitate before seeing the movie. It's done in a grand style though to be sure the special effects are of the period.The Avro Lancaster by the way may have been the finest heavy bomber of the war. It wasn't particularly fast it was lightly armed and it was as ugly as sin but it carried an enormous bomb load was versatile and handled like a fighter. A test pilot managed to put one through a barrel roll.The acting doesn't really need too much comment. Michael Redgrave is very good. Richard Todd marches around and makes upbeat comments like a military man which he was. A good war movie and recommended.".

All depictions of the Lancasters are live footage with the exception of the few crash scenes which are done using miniatures. Legend has it that George Lucas used footage and even duologue from this film for his Star Wars movies.Warning Todd's character Wing Commander Gibson has a black Labrador Retriever named Nigger. In fact they use the dog's name as a code word indicating success. Obviously the word means something much different in the US today.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a fundamental difference between British and American war movies of the 1950's and 60's. Where as Hollywoods output tends to have gungho heroes gun in each hand knife in the teeth winning the war for Uncle Sam and getting the girl to boot the British war movie tended towards a more factual almost documentary style. Almost as if British cinema was saying 'something of great importance has recently happened so lets document the facts for future generations lest we forget.' Hence we have films like Dunkirk Sink The Bismark Battle of The River Plate and most famously of all The Damn Busters.Coming back to this movie 54 years after it was made and over 60 since the events portrayed this movie can at time seam rather odd. The acting is stilted and dialogue clipped but this is a stylistic thing rather than bad acting after all the same style of acting can be witnessed in Ealling Comedies the protohammer horror films and any number of 'The Blue Lamp' type police films. The bulk of the cinematography is also nothing special being straightforward 'one' or 'two' shots with lighting that can be described as bog standard.However this film really scores on two fronts. Firstly the use of real true to era aircraft Leased from the RAF who still used Lancasters as trainers at the time flown by genuine RAF bomber crews and filmed using the various lakes around Cumberland and West Yorkshire where the real 617 squadron trained for the real mission. And secondly it's dogged sticking to historical detail or at least as much that could be adhered to without breaking the official secrets act!! There is no Pearl Harbour rewriting of history here. What you see is as near as damn it what really happened. Even now the a comparison of the attack as portrayed on film and the most recently published accounts of the raid as released by the British ministry of defence show very few factual flaws.Also it must be born in mind that the early 1950's were not a pleasant time for the UK populous. The nation was still crippled by US war debt many items were still rationed and the teething pains of the change that would lead to the welfare state and the cultural and economic boom of the 1960's were still cutting deep. So it is hardly surprising that a film showing a heroic and resourceful Britian would strike such a strong chord with its viewers.I must be said some aspects of this film haven't aged well compared to some of the other Brit war flicks of the time 'Battle Of The River Plate' springs to mind but as a historical document and comment on Britian in the immediate post war era it stands tall as one of the most important films of its time.".

This was unfortunate because parts of the plot became unintelligible  the dog's name was one of the codewords used during the attack.";

Wallis is appalled by the loss of so many men on this mission and he regrets his decision to have even advocated the plan in the first place.Gibson assures him differently and says his men would have gone anyway regardless of their outcome. The loss of his beloved black Labrador dog hit by a car on the eve of his mission adds a very personal touch to this story.Great musical score so thoroughly and magically composed for this WW2 drama by Eric Coates gives this film the thumbs up.Just watch it and see.

I feel I should mention that those people I knew who went through the realities of WW1 and WW2 actually never ever watched war movies I always had to immediately switch the TV over whenever a war film came on for both granddads far too many bad memories.For those who criticise the special effects sweets were rationed until 1953 Britain of the early 1950s was struggling with post WW2 austerity. Rationing finally ended in 1954 a year before this film was made. In the early 1950s people were more concerned with things like Tuberculosis and polio not special effects.This film is stirring stuff portraying an uphill battle and a race against time to complete an almost impossible task. I've watched Dambusters many times and find it hugely enjoyable the music in particular really pumps you up and sucks the viewer in while the acting performances are all good particularly Redgrave as Barnes Wallis.Gibsons dog ni99er is a bone of contention nowadays amongst those who are concerned with irrelevant minutiae but that's because there's actually not very much else to worry about nowadays. This I feel would actually be hugely reassuring for those people who fought in the war.What really struck me when I watched Dambusters recently was that the 19 planes on that mission were actually the only planes over the whole of Europe on that particular clear moonlit night. It was almost a suicide mission because those guys were up against the entire German night defence system who were very very capable by 1943. Normal bombing operations were considered far too dangerous for that night and the film skips over this pretty smartly during the briefing.All in all a fitting tribute to a group of very brave men.".

	schema:reviewBody "I frankly do not understand the low rating of this movie. How could it be bettered? Certainly the explosions at the dams are phony as indeed are many of the 'landscape' shots. But budgets were budgets in that decade of austerity and effects were limited by the technology of the day. It was as good as it could have been.This is a movie that takes you through the whole story. We begin with Barnes Wallis grappling over an idea in the garden firing marbles and employing his children as fielders. Despite the fact that there's a war on it's so civilised and sublimely innocent. A homely GP pays a housecall and stops for a cup of tea. A woman is content to be a wife and mother and make it her career. Children call their father 'daddy' and go to bed when told. Honest decent middleclass England when playing well was more important than winning does anyone else remember it? Next we see Wallis bouncing off the even bigger dam of official scepticism and bureaucracy. Again there are wonderful performances and excellent script. When told he wants a Wellington bomber to play with he is asked something to the effect 'What possible justification could I give to get a bomber allocated to you?' Wallis replies 'Would it help if you told them I designed it?' Evidently it would.In fact the plane we mostly see is a mosquito but let's not dwell on that.Right up until the critical time Wallis's design struggles against the prohibitive schedule. It's touch and go and it's nerveracking.On the other side of the equation we see the development of the special squadron. A handpicked team is led by Guy Gibson  perfectly played by Richard Todd. They begin lowlevel flight training. It's worth the price of the movie alone to see those huge bulldogmuzzled Lancasters cartwheeling around hills at hedgeclipping altitudes with their four Merlins roaring fit to pop your eardrums. You definitely need a subwoofer with this one.Gradually the two elements are married together and the fateful night arrives. The huge warplanes stand like sentinels on the airfield. Incidental music is pensive. It's the calm before the storm.We only ever see 3 bombers at any one time and that's probably because even just 10 years after the war they were woefully obsolescent and mostly scrapped.The lowlevel flights from the pilot and bombaimer perspective seem to be entirely authentic. AA guns open up from time to time. 150 or so men coolly set forth to do their duty knowing that not all will return. We glimpse the tension at bomber command. Hits are scored but the dams remain intact. It looks as if Wallis may have got his sums wrong. Maybe he's a fruitcake after all.Finally we see him encounter Guy Gibson on return. He is griefstricken at the number of aircrews who have been lost despite 2 of the 3 dams being destroyed. Gibson walks resolutely back to his billet. He has a lot of letters to write.There's nothing missing from either the story or the drama. It's a 2hour movie that doesn't waste a second. It's also a history lesson because it accurately portrays all of the social nuances of the day by people who  one way and another  lived through them. This movie simply could not be made in the third millennium. Ohyes the bombers and the bangs and the rushing waters could easily be computergenerated and mighty fine they'd look too. But all of the subtle mannerisms of that age could never be authentically replicated by modern actors no matter how hard they tried. To this extent at least Redgrave and Todd didn't have to act at all. They were from that age.Every kid should be shown this movie today. It ought to be required viewing at school. It shows what real men and women are and what they did. The theme music should be our national anthem. It's a genuine historical classic like 'Zulu' or 'A Night To Remember'. And like them it's a mustsee.".

It is told in a straightforward semidocumentary manner that keeps the viewer interested until the final credits roll. Yes the special effects pale when compared to today's computergenerated efforts but when viewed in the context of the technology available they still make the point and come as close to reality as possible.The two leads Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave really carry the film Todd is superb as Wing Commander Guy Gibson. Straight to to the issue no frills and let's get the job done. He immediately takes on the assignment when asked without being told of the nature of the mission the nature of the target or when it will take place. He gathers his crews and begins the grueling and at times terrifying training for a job in which no one has been fully briefed.Michael Redgrave as Barnes Wallace is if I can use the term absolutely delightful. There is a naivet about him that at times seems childlike. His character comes across as the brilliant but at times absentminded professor. When we first encounter him in the film he is doing some experiments at home with the skipbombing technique that will be used. He is doing this in his backyard with his children and it is almost like a game to all of them. They are just having the most delightful time trying to come with something that will prove quite deadly when perfected. Often talking to himself and seemingly wandering around lost in thought one of his best lines in the film comes when he tells a representative from the Aircraft Ministry that he will need a Wellington bomber for the early tests. The Ministry official asks him What can I possibly tell them that will let them justify you getting a Wellington bomber? With a perfectly straight face and and air of ingenuousness Redgrave as Barnes replies Perhpas if you told them I designed it? Priceless!! Eventually solving one seemingly insurmountable problem after another the film moves on to the night of the raids. We are waiting as dusk falls with the bomber crews out by their planes for the takeoff signal. We see them thunder in at terrifyingly low level over the enemy coast. We are waiting in the communications center with Barnes Wallace and the others for any word over the wireless.We face the tension as the big Lancasters swing out over the dams and start their bomb runs one at time being fired on by heavy antiaircraft fire along the tops of the dams. The excitement when the bombs perform as designed. The ecstatic shouts radioed back to HQ. Then the initial dismay as one bomb after another seemingly fails to breach the dams. Gibson's and Barnes Wallace's disappointment when the dams are still intact. Finally we see the first rivulet of water and then the torrent as the dams burst wide open and water floods the valleys below.Barnes Wallace's initial reaction is quiet joy and then grief as he realizes the number of planes shot down and men lost to this mission. His comment that he wouldn't have done this if he realized that so many lives would be lost. This is in stark reaction to the military men who realize the price that must be paid for victory.The 617 Squadron went on to carry out other special missions in WWII. The book The Dam Busters points out that 617 Squadron had the highest loss rate of men and planes of any RAF bomber squadron. Not surprising when looking at their missions such as attacking rail bridges docks tunnels etc. Quite often they used other types of bombs that were also developed by Barnes Wallace.I enjoy this film every time I see it. It is my favorite British WW II film. Certainly much better than Sink the Bismark. It shows the emotional as well as the combat side of war. How people think how they interact how they feel. Something that is lacking in many war films that rely strictly on great battle scenes to carry the day. The Dam Busters still stands today as a great and fitting tribute to the men and machines that destroyed the German dams.".

I have the DVD and have watched it several times and will probably watch it again over the coming years. I'm looking forward to the remake due for release next year in 2010. I hope the makers of the new movie don't go overboard and over do the special effects. What clicked for me when I first saw The Dam Busters was the story of a genius Dr. B. N. Wallis C. B. E. F. R. S. who devised the idea to blow up dams and how to do it. I love the story and hope in the new version that the makers keep it intact. Also the bravery of the fliers who took on the very dangerous task of destroying the dams must be retold. This is a wonderful film and it holds up very well 55 years later. Three cheers for the maker of the original movie and the brave and clever people portrayed in it. And if you want to see another British war time move telling another true story get The Man Who Never Was 1956. Also very good and holds up very well.".

I hope the makers of the new movie don't go overboard and over do the special effects. What clicked for me when I first saw The Dam Busters was the story of a genius Dr. B. N. Wallis C. B. E. F. R. S. who devised the idea to blow up dams and how to do it. I love the story and hope in the new version that the makers keep it intact. Also the bravery of the fliers who took on the very dangerous task of destroying the dams must be retold. This is a wonderful film and it holds up very well 55 years later. Three cheers for the maker of the original movie and the brave and clever people portrayed in it. And if you want to see another British war time move telling another true story get The Man Who Never Was 1956. Also very good and holds up very well.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dam Busters tells the mostly true story of the men who developed and delivered the bouncing bomb used against German dams to cripple their industrial output.I've seen my share of WWII films and while this one has many of the standard features it has one thing that makes it unique it shows the critical importance played by the engineers in this  as in any  war effort. I guess being an engineer myself I found the character of Barnes Wallis the developer of the unique bomb particularly endearing his singleminded pursuit of an idea his refusal to accept defeat the tension and anxiety while watching trials go bad one after another. I've been through all that but not during a shooting war so I can only imagine how much of a pressure cooker he was in.OK nerds aside the rest of the cast is also splendidly real and believable. The effects are well let's face it this was 1954 and it looks worse than a Godzilla movie but somehow that doesn't detract from the impact of the movie. You still get that tense seatofthepants feeling as the Lancasters fly straight into the gauntlet of machine gun fire just praying they won't get hit and be able to deliver their payload. Just the footage of the flying Lancasters alone is enough reason to watch if you are into WWII aircraft. There seem to be 5 or 6 in use during the shooting and their appearance even on the small TV screen is impressive. One can only imagine what it would have been like on the big screen.Another fine touch is the final denouement mission accomplished but there is no crowing or highfiving just the sober realization that 56 men did not return from the raid. The victors are tired weary simply sink into their beds for sleep. To me this seems like a much more realistic ending than the backslapping good cheer that a typical shallower movie would have ended with.It's long maybe could have been trimmed here and there but not without losing the effect of what it's like to be down at the base waiting for news no way to communicate except to just wait. Or the pilots training and training for a mission whose objective they don't know. It's a bit demanding of the viewer as there seems to be not quite enough tension to spread over the 2 hour running time.Overall 7 out of 10 for a truly classic wartime film.".

They have amazing chemistry and shows the sweet puppy love which does not fade with time. Their blossoming relationship is bound to evoke much memories taking viewers into a treasure of sweetness which is stacked away somewhere deep in the brain. Aside from the sweetness this subplot is also full of if only which brings reality back into the fairytale. It invites people to take a nostalgic trip to fill in what the if only is for them.The film culminates into a great emotional zenith at the end.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review You Are the Apple of My Eye";
	schema:reviewBody "You Are the Apple of My Eye had successfully reached out and grabbed me by the throat with its many identifiable similar moments mirroring personal experiences at a time where school and education played a big part and what more with coed schools having friends and facing competition in going after the girl of our dreams then who almost always turns out to be the popular school flower. Sad but true facts of life and with game theory anyone would have been better off with the friends of the object of our affection such as Hu ChiaWei Wan Wan who turned out really well despite her less than stellar looks and knowledge though things always change in the future for the better like fine wine rather than the primary unattainable target herself whose bookish behaviour came off very prim and proper with an unrelenting focus on school results.But Fate always possess a hand at springing up surprises and in Gidden's chief protagonist Ko ChingTeng Ko ChenTung who of course is his avatar in the film this comes in the form of the popular schoolgirl Shen JiaYi Michelle Chan from Hear Me who inexplicably takes a strong liking for someone she initially detests for being too childish but an episode of standing up for her became a catalyst for a budding relationship to grow stemming from the desire to help ChingTeng improve his grades as well as the implicit result of having a studying companion to spur her on friendly competition and a protector of sorts in her late nights spent in school. Then there is the keen competition from ChingTeng's own clique of likable though onedimensional buddies from the nerd Boner Yen ShengYu the obligatory fatty AHo Steven Hao the bragger Owodog and the weirdo Groin Tsai Chang Hsien with his repertoire of strange tricks up his sleeves who each have their own way at courtship to varying degrees of failure trying as hard as they can to try and win her affections.Broadly split into three areas in a young adult's life with the time spent in school between two friends who share an unwritten and unsaid declaration of their mutual affection to post high school graduation into higher learning and the long distance put between them as the test of their relationship and the period of the present Giddens firmly helmed all aspects of the film and orchestrated a flowing and slick ensemble successfully merging many different genres together from wacky comedy to romance and having the natural flair to pull off some of the most absurd though not far fetched in real life of situations especially those involving body parts and those containing plenty of innuendos to bring out the laughs seriously the soap bar is not an urban myth it seems and at times presenting them for the keen eyed viewer whose eyes wander to the background of a scene and being rewarded with sight gags.Since the narrative unravels itself during the 90s those like me who grew up during the era will find a lot of strong nostalgia from the production design right down to a walk down memory lane given a backdrop of historical events or in a period of time where the mobile phone hardly has the proliferation and pervasiveness of today. Those long snaking queues of people waiting for a payphone bring back fond memories in really sweating it out to want to speak to a loved one until being goaded to let go or when the coins run out and of course with advancement in phone technology being able to butt in just to hear a loved one at the end of the line postdisaster is nothing more than comforting though only when there is adequate signal strength.Being a Taiwanese film language plays a key role here especially when Hokkien gets into play with the very colourful familiar swear words used that will undoubtedly provide a certain kick to movie audiences here. The rich use of the language also helps to flavour the film especially with the very authentic natural lines of dialogue making the characters believable. Also the rating for the film at NC16 is something of an indication of a loosening up of classification perhaps where once sustained use of vulgarities male on male lip locks regardless of context and the many scenes of sex and masturbation stylized for comedy will likely get nothing less than an M18 but I suppose given the context of the film's setting dealing with hot blooded male characters as well as the film being so well received in its home country that it will be silly to try and artificially restrict its pool of audience from enjoying what is essentially a simple yet effect story being translated for the big screen.In some ways Giddeon's film is like Ah Niu's directorial debut effort Ice Kacang Puppy Love which is also a story about first love and peppered with quirky characters but if the story comes from a sincere heart recounting one's own experience despite a very universal theme I truly believe everyone's first love story will be something worth recounting given its bittersweet moments and the lessons to be learn from it. You Are the Apple of My Eye will warm your heart and wring it with regret at the same time especially if you're able to identify with the story. It made me ponder over my own similar What If scenario in the way parallel universes worked itself into the story and its reconciliatory tone was something cutting very close to home of how people change and when we look back we're probably seeing very different persons from that point in time when compared with who we are today.Highly recommended and it goes into my shortlist as one of the best this year has to offer.".

How else would  you explain the sudden emergence of movies Smurfs and Transformers  come to mind which remind us of the good ol' days?  Ed's note Michael Bay's pompous 'bots simply serves as a stark  reminder of how good things from the past should be left alone.  Closer to home Taiwanese novelist Giddens Ko capitalises on this  innate human nature and turns his creative talent into boxoffice gold  by directing his first feature film. The prolific and popular author  has translated one of his well loved works into an accessible movie you  will find no problems falling in love with. How else would you explain  the phenomenal success of the 110 minute production back in Taiwan  where it beat Monga 2010 and Cape No. 7 2008 to become the local  film with the biggest ever opening day and weekend box office earnings?   The story may have been a chapter of your younger days The school  prankster and the perfect student become the most unlikely friends. A  relationship blossoms between the two and before one realises it  years past and what's left are bittersweet memories of what could have  been. Along the way you also get introduced to the protagonists'  friends who are familiar characters from your past  the loyal  sidekick the overweight but studious goodie two shoes and the goofy  and unassuming dude amongst others.  We are also introduced to thematic memories which seem to have flown  past us during these hurried years of growing up. Be it the pursuit of  the perfect future the hopelessly romantic crush on a fellow  classmate or the steadfast allegiance between friends there will be  many sequences in the movie that will strike a chord with you.  Producer Angie Chai sure knows her audiences well  the experiences on  successful TV series like 2001's Meteor Garden the show that launched  boyband F4's career and 2003's Love Storm have made this movie an  unabashedly likable idol drama. It has all the ingredients of a crowd  pleaser Besides the nostalgic storyline the stars are pleasing and  charismatic. Good lookers Ko Chen Tung and Michelle Chen take on the  lead roles in this adolescent tale and relatively unknown artistes are  now stars in their own rights. Other unfamiliar but pleasant stars like  Ao Chuan Steven Hao you may recognise him as the butt baring kid in  many infamous Kung Fu slapstick movies from the yesteryears Tsai  Chang Hsien Wan Wan and Yen Sheng Yu make up the ensemble cast.  Complement the young actors' decent performances with a refreshing  touch of humour watch out for a hilarious scene which involves  synchronised masturbation eye pleasing cinematography a soothing  piano score and some recognisably retro songs. The emotionally  fulfilling theme song Na Xie Nian literal translation Those Years  performed by Hu Xia deserves a place in your music device.   The film has earned several nominations at the 48thGolden Horse Awards  and this is further proof that viewers are lapping this shamelessly  nostalgic movie up. Yes this increasingly cynical columnist is a fan  of this affectingly moving movie as well  simply because nostalgia's a  feeling no one can shake off.".

	schema:headline " Heartwarming comingofage movie for youths";
	schema:reviewBody "There has been a clamour for this Taiwanese comingofage film among  Chinese youth ever since it opened at the Hong Kong Summer  International Film Festival in August this year. Indeed Giddens Ko's  directorial debut is based on his semiautobiographical novel The  Girl We Chased Together in Those Years its Mandarin title which was  a bestseller among online readers.  Needless to say Apple reigned at the Taiwan box office for more than  a month landing at second place on the nation's chart of alltime box  office hits. For viewers young and old it is a nostalgia trip to their  carefree school days when hormones rage and hope abounds.  The narration by Ko ChenTung who plays Giddens or ChingTeng  starts off in 2005 when protagonist ChingTeng is dressing up for a  wedding. Next it takes us back 10 years earlier 1995 to ChingTeng's  school days when he and his buddies Boner Yen Shengyu Cock Groin  Tsai Changhsien and AHo Steven Hao are students of ChingCheng  High a backwater school in Changhua in central Taiwan.  All these boys admire ace student Shen ChiaYi Michelle Chen and many  of them even have a crush on her. However ChiaYi is closest to  ChingTeng because she has been instructed by a teacher to tutor  ChingTeng in his studies and help him stay out of trouble. The two  gradually fall in love but have to separate when they go to college.  Staying apart the couple face many challenges and temptations which  threaten to tear them from each other...  The school pranks and events are seen from ChingTeng's pointofview  and he pulls no punches to show us what it is like during those heady  and crazy days. We see the boys masturbating disturbing girls and  handling heartbreak and separation. One college scene explains why the  boys jerk off with their left hand while watching online porn  the  right is needed to move the mouse. We see how the girls have to put up  with these pranks and crass jokes and somehow manage to hold their own.  The best part of Giddens' direction is that we can easily identify with  the protagonist and the lead cast. In any coed class there will  always be a beautiful bookworm like ChiaYi whom all the boys will  admire and even try to court and there will be the resident sex  maniac the fat slob and other weirdos. All these characters are  credibly developed although there are some sequences like ChingTeng  and his dad going naked in his house that are not satisfactorily  explained or rationalised. Another is ChingTeng's refrain from  intimacy with ChiaYi even at intimate moments.  And just as the boys have a crush on Michele Chen's ChiaYi we too are  charmed by her. Chen is such a natural that her ChiaYi reminds us of  the girlnextdoor captivating our hearts especially in the scene  where she is summarily punished with the boys for being disrespectful  of the teacher. This is one movie from which you will leave the  cineplex with a smile on your face and feeling warm in your heart.".

	onyx:emotionText "There has been a clamour for this Taiwanese comingofage film among  Chinese youth ever since it opened at the Hong Kong Summer  International Film Festival in August this year. Indeed Giddens Ko's  directorial debut is based on his semiautobiographical novel The  Girl We Chased Together in Those Years its Mandarin title which was  a bestseller among online readers.  Needless to say Apple reigned at the Taiwan box office for more than  a month landing at second place on the nation's chart of alltime box  office hits. For viewers young and old it is a nostalgia trip to their  carefree school days when hormones rage and hope abounds.  The narration by Ko ChenTung who plays Giddens or ChingTeng  starts off in 2005 when protagonist ChingTeng is dressing up for a  wedding. Next it takes us back 10 years earlier 1995 to ChingTeng's  school days when he and his buddies Boner Yen Shengyu Cock Groin  Tsai Changhsien and AHo Steven Hao are students of ChingCheng  High a backwater school in Changhua in central Taiwan.

	schema:reviewBody "You are the apple of my eye is a very popular film from Taiwan in China and its story used to become a trend in 2011. This is a real story came from a very popular authorKe Jingteng who is also the director of this film. The story includes his friends and the girl who he liked and chased. He decided to use readme way to show the whole story line and a special way to retell the story through screen in order to commemorating the good times and unforgettable experience during this special period in his life.First of all the style of this film which we call small fresh is still very popular today and become a trend in China. No matter small fresh is as an ideal of life or as personal vision of a better mood small fresh is always exiting with the characteristics of natural simple quiet freedom and happy. The name of film is You are the apple of my eye which give information that Ke Jingteng and Shen Jiayi regarding each other as the most lovely and important person in life. Apple is sweet but could be sour it is just like the youth. There are many regrettable things of youth but they are still the precious person for each other. We cannot deny that friendship is an important clue linked this film. For Ke Jingteng Shen Jiayi is the positive energy for him helped him to improve his studies and also encouraged him to became a real man. They seemed like good friends but inside their bottom of hearts there are emotions beyond friendship.Actually friend is a fantastic word it will always tie people with their intellect and emotions when they face some problem in life. Ke knew that three of his friends have also like Shen maybe once he expresses the true feelings their friendship will be destroyed. In our society between love and friendship it is often difficult to make a choice and we are not allowed to get both at the same time in many special situations. There are only four results at last no love but friendship or no friendship but love both or neither. Ke took care of Shen and finally told her his feelings but he did not want to get the answer from her. He wanted to keep the relationship with his friends but he also really afraid of being rejected by Shen. On the contrary for Shen Jiayi first love is fantastic. She has also liked Ke but in her opinion this first love between them will become the most precious things in life she wanted to keep it in memory and hope it will not be changed by time. Nowadays when two people really be together many initial emotion will disappear. First love is like the blooming flowers even as beautiful as the rising sun it is unforgettable and pure. Shen felt happy enough about the time they spent together she did not say Yes to Ke but told him instead In the parallel time and space we have already being together.Secondly from the aspect about cinematic technique each image is taken pastel colors and all the colors are fresh bright and beautiful in order to adding up the lightness for the whole film. In particular sunny day is the basic environment of the whole film which means in this story most of the time is very happy for Ke. Sunshine can always represent the best period of age in people's life especially the age of eighteen people own pure friendship and pure love the color of sunlight is yellow or orange which gives us the feeling of warm and happiness. For example when all of the characters went to the beach and had a great fun in a summer time sunlight irradiated on their smiling face every image can be a good picture in our mind Also when Ke Jingteng imagined that he is the bridegroom in Sheng Jiayi's wedding and kissed the bride the sunlight is filled up with the room. There is a image which i still remember both Ke and Shen wrote down their wishes on the lantern and flied it to the sky the background was dim which brought out the only color of bright orange from the flying lantern. This is a perfect part to give deep impression to audiences. We can understand that each of these scenes is precious memory for Ko sunlight represents the first love and it can always give the warm feelings for everyone. So whenever we see every scene with sunshine it is beautiful and we will receive cheerful mood along with them.To my mind it is a very simple and funny story but easy to remain us those special and interesting times in our life which make this film successful. I really enjoy watching it and also moved from it. Youth is like a heavy rain even though it is easy to get cold we still looking forward to going back and poured by it again. Finally Ke has the friendship forever and most importantly he owns a pure love from a girl and those wonderful memories.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best comingofage films that I've watched! Set in Changhua county in Taiwan it's full of local flavour yet contains themes that most of us can identify with. Perhaps not Westerners but Asians certainly. There's the smart and pretty girl whom all the guys have a crush on. One of them gets her attention by lending her his English textbook and accepts punishment for having forgotten to bring it. A friendship springs up from there to return the favour she helps him with his schoolwork and he studies hard to prove his capability. After high school they all go to separate universities and he continues pursuing her. A silly quarrel ends things and heartache ensues. I love how the film captures all the ups and downs of adolescent love and from the perspectives of both sides too. Its charm lies in the details  from splashing around in the sea and talking about their aspirations as a group to the young couple walking the railway tracks and releasing a sky lantern with their wishes written on it. There are sad moments too but the movie ends on a high note with the friends reminiscing on the past but also celebrating the present. This is nicely captured in the Mandarin title  which roughly translates as the girl we pursued together in bygone days. So much better than You are the Apple of My Eye!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the best comingofage films that I've watched! Set in Changhua county in Taiwan it's full of local flavour yet contains themes that most of us can identify with. Perhaps not Westerners but Asians certainly. There's the smart and pretty girl whom all the guys have a crush on. One of them gets her attention by lending her his English textbook and accepts punishment for having forgotten to bring it. A friendship springs up from there to return the favour she helps him with his schoolwork and he studies hard to prove his capability. After high school they all go to separate universities and he continues pursuing her. A silly quarrel ends things and heartache ensues. I love how the film captures all the ups and downs of adolescent love and from the perspectives of both sides too. Its charm lies in the details  from splashing around in the sea and talking about their aspirations as a group to the young couple walking the railway tracks and releasing a sky lantern with their wishes written on it. There are sad moments too but the movie ends on a high note with the friends reminiscing on the past but also celebrating the present. This is nicely captured in the Mandarin title  which roughly translates as the girl we pursued together in bygone days. So much better than You are the Apple of My Eye!";

This movie is pretty much a love story where nothing happens. Also it wasn't funny. The movie has a lot of male nude scenes and masturbation jokes which sadly was confusing as to why it was put in the movie. I often found myself looking at my girlfriend asking is that suppose to be funny??The only things I enjoyed about this movie were the camera angles. I felt the film did have a great cinematographer also the music was fairly good. The story was just not compelling enough.I would pass on this movie save yourself 1hr 40 minutes and watch something else.".

A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience. Check out if you can.".

Director Osamu Dezaki can be applauded for combining the involving story and the stunning visuals without letting one element drown out the other. If a few of the shots look familiar it's because the film was showcased in Matthew Sweet's video for his song Girlfriend. You can also look for quite a few references to 'Star Wars' 'Star Trek' '2001' and a rip off of the 'Superman' theme during a heated battle scene. 'Space Adventure Cobra' is best recommended for those already familiar with this genre as it provides an excellent example of the beginnings of modern Anime.On a scale of 1 to 11 11 being an example of taking it up a notch 'Cobra' gets a 7.".

Most scifi stories only take place on one or on a few planets and each only seems to have one environment and one city. Not much more is shown in Cobra but there are constant references as to how there is an entire known and inhabited universe out there.

For whatever reasons they didn't and their license expired. Perhaps the rights got tied up and they were unable to do so. The original VHS release in the US was around 1996 and goes for silly money and I was never going to pay second hand sellers hundreds of dollars even though this valuable movie warrants it.Fans will be glad to know that Space Adventure Cobra includes the fan favorite Streamline Dub in Stereo as well as the choice between a Japanese 5.1 or 2.0 depending on your audio equipment and preferences.The video quality is literally stunning and probably the best anime remastering I've ever seen on DVD. Apparently Discotek got Bluray masters from the Japanese domestic release and used these rather than doing a port of the Japanese DVD release. Also the video is progressive scan like all Discotek releases and is in Anamorphic Widescreen.Considering this came out in 1982 it transcends most contemporary anime in detail and color literally jumping off the screen. This motion picture can be considered a standalone entry since it's nothing like the TV series. The Cobra motion picture is a serious space opera sci fi there's almost no comedy in this at all. Instead there are genuine moments of sadness and emotion as you become attached to characters with a less than happy fate. The whole movie is wrapped up in mystery and you'll be completely mystified and engaged all throughout this 99 minute story Considering the VHS sellers are still trying to make a bundle of this property I think the DVD is a steal. Get this before it goes out of print. This is a must see for newcomers and experienced fans. Every person deserves to see this movie at least once in their life.Grade  A".

The original VHS release in the US was around 1996 and goes for silly money and I was never going to pay second hand sellers hundreds of dollars even though this valuable movie warrants it.Fans will be glad to know that Space Adventure Cobra includes the fan favorite Streamline Dub in Stereo as well as the choice between a Japanese 5.1 or 2.0 depending on your audio equipment and preferences.The video quality is literally stunning and probably the best anime remastering I've ever seen on DVD. Apparently Discotek got Bluray masters from the Japanese domestic release and used these rather than doing a port of the Japanese DVD release. Also the video is progressive scan like all Discotek releases and is in Anamorphic Widescreen.Considering this came out in 1982 it transcends most contemporary anime in detail and color literally jumping off the screen. This motion picture can be considered a standalone entry since it's nothing like the TV series. The Cobra motion picture is a serious space opera sci fi there's almost no comedy in this at all. Instead there are genuine moments of sadness and emotion as you become attached to characters with a less than happy fate. The whole movie is wrapped up in mystery and you'll be completely mystified and engaged all throughout this 99 minute story Considering the VHS sellers are still trying to make a bundle of this property I think the DVD is a steal. Get this before it goes out of print. This is a must see for newcomers and experienced fans. Every person deserves to see this movie at least once in their life.Grade  A";

The story is nuts like Star Wars meets James Bond meets metaphysical weirdness. And breasts lots of breasts. Feminists like myself will no doubt find issue with the way the love interests center their existences around obeying and serving their one true love but the whole thing comes across as clueless rather than malignant in whatever intent it was going for in that regard at least I hope so.Ah but who cares about the plot?

The film is from the viewpoint of a family with a Chinese father and Japanese mother which proves ironic. The Japanese army swarms into the city and begins indiscriminate slaughter torture and rape of the civilians and surrendered soldiers. After ruining the city they turn their attention to the Safety Zone of Nanjing which was set up by the Red Cross and other international organizations that was supposed to be a safe area for civilians and go on a rampage. The film also depicts the foreigners that were there to help the civilians and their desperate efforts to stop the savagery. Most of this film is historically based and the film captures just some of the atrocities that actually occurred. This film is excellent for those wanting to understand what happened in Nanjing at the hands of the Japanese military told through one fictional family's experience.".

Notably the panoramic scenes use hundreds of extras to portray the magnitude of this human disaster.Nanking 1937 is not for the squeamish... know what you are getting into. The Rape of Nanking is one of the lowest points of humanity in the 20th century and this film shows it all from the men marched out of the city for mass executions to wholesale rape of women. It is as disturbing to watch as Schindler's List.The film succeeds in portraying the scale of this atrocity demonstrating the insanity of war and even shows there can be moments when humanity is uplifted in the midst of it all.

The macabre competition between 2 Japanese officers betting for the highest count of beheaded Chinese. Shows the senseless and illegal! killings of POW's. Killings of civilians... Shows taiwanese men fighting in the Japanese army. Movie pictures out the takeover of the great Nanking CityWalls by jap soldiers. Some Japanese Officers chatting about the Chinese origins of Japanese culture in front of a huge temple. Shows mass graves. ... and some details you'd capture here and there but surprisingly thats it. The Movie doesn't show any bigger picture of the war nor does it give a clear picture of the city's and its inhabitants condition in a general way. So you see the little family being hunt rotational by Japanese soldiers because of the Chinese husband and by Chinese civilians because of the Japanese wife and in between many atrocitys committed. But disappointingly thats it.The Movie has its highs for example when the Japanese Soldiers catch the family and the wife talks them nearly out of trouble but the little kid didn't understand that he shouldn't speak Chinese in front of jap soldiers.And its lows for example when you see plasticTanks rumbling through a little nankingdummy well i give it 7 out of 10. because its one of few movies dealing with that subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a film detailing a period of history through the experiences of a family THE PUPPETMASTER is very similar to HEIMAT.  By using an acting troupe as the narrative and thematic focus of this history it resembles THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS and FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE.  Stylistically though it couldn't be further apart.  Unlike the character drama of the first the elegant complicated camerawork of the second or the intense emotionalism of the last THE PUPPETMASTER is a rigidly formal work breathtaking to look at baffling to understand eventually oppressive to watch.The main narrative concerns the life story of the title character up until the end of World War II  his story parallels the occupation of his country Taiwan by Japan.  Interspersed between highly stylised and composed dramatisations of his life are interviews with the man himself as an old man.Although Hao's other films share a similar aesthetic including the marvellous A CITY OF SADNESS it is the puppetmaster's profession that shape the look of the film.  He puts on elaborate puppet shows and in the same way his little theatre looks like a cinema screen Hao's film is less a fluid narrative than a series of tableaux vivants.  I think there are only two camera movements in the entire film.  Each scene is elaborately composed  decor overwhelms the characters with masses of pillars frames and characters dwarfing any individuality.  There are hardly any closeups and such is the visual clutter and the sombre lighting it is often shot through that it's often hard to make out which character is which.  The direction is highly distanced and artificial letting these characters like rats in a trap blindly blunder unable to find an exit.Any perceived objectivity in this style is deliberately illusory and it is clear that the protagonist is not the only puppetmaster.  Hao's strings are rarely unfelt and behind the domestic traumas and bildungsroman narrative is a bitter denunciation of the effects of colonialism and rigid hierarchical societies.  Much of the entrapment of environment is linked to the traditional repressions of Taiwanese family life with its absurd rituals of family nomenclature masculine honour and arranged marriages which allow free rein to domestic brutality and the corruption of decency.It is no wonder therefore that the Taiwanese become such willing quislings deference and anonymity being a familiar part of everyday life. The puupetmaster is deeply implicated in this being a prominent and officially valued member of cultural propagandist groups.  Much of the local and symbolic detail was shamefully alien to me so I obviously lost much and maybe Li's plays  generous enthralling excerpts of which appear at crucial points of the film  have a hidden subversion lost to the ignorant viewer.What isn't lost is a remarkable visual sensibility which often speaks for characters who can't.  The historical saga is compelling and the puppetmaster's life is often moving.  The recourse to storytelling and an almost scientific faith in superstition and magic gives the film a feel of magic realism.  It's just that by the second half of the film you're throwing things at your TV just to get the blasted screen to move.".

I don't want to declare that he's untalented. I did truly like Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness no matter how flawed I found them to be. The Puppetmaster is an enormous step in the wrong direction more like the atrocious A Time to Live a Time to Die than the two I actually tolerated. Hou's just not especially talented. People praise him to high heaven claiming that his style is incredibly unique. Let me diagram his directorial technique 1. Static long shots with few movements and few close ups. 2. His shots are often framed by doorways and the like. 3. Many landscape shots. 4. Characters in a scene often remain out of sight for a long time at the beginning of a scene which confounds the audience when a visible character is talking to or interacting with them. 5. Loose narrative structure. 6. The subject of his films is most often Taiwanese history often radiating from the tumultuous period of the WWII era. That's it. There is not one thing on this list that hasn't been done before and much better whether Asian or Western well maybe the thing about Taiwanese history but plenty of great filmmakers have illuminated their own country's history. The combination of several of these factors and no more is a recipe for insomnia medication. His cinema is about as limiting as cinema can get reminscent of preGriffith cinema where filmmakers never thought to move their camera or give a closeup of anything. The effects are all dedramatizing which is extraordinarily pointless. As Pauline Kael once said if films aren't supposed to be entertaining then what are they supposed to be? Torture? I know what Hou's answer would be.Sorry. I went a bit too far with that last paragraph. The Puppetmaster does have its great moments mostly coming in two forms theatrical performances puppet plays and opera and oneonone interviews with the Puppetmaster himself Li Tienlu where he tells long and rambling stories  long and rambling but very interesting and entertaining  about his life. The rest of the film is made up of accounts of the events he's talking about acted out on screen. Some are good some are bad but none of them are inherently interesting. Since these episodes are only tenuously connected to the past and the future there is absolutely no weight to these scenes. This is particularly pathetic because the real Li Tienlu was the best part of both Dust in the Wind and City of Sadness. I would have been infinitely more contented to just watch the interviews without the sketches because Li is a beautiful human being not to mention a marvelous actor whose face body movements and tone of voice communicate infinitely more than the motionless actors and actresses who are insultingly acting out his life experiences.And people who would like to deify this director and consequently want to crucify me check out my other tastes if you want to jump to the conclusion that I'm a brainless American who needs his movies fast chew on a few of my favorite films that 99 of the population would find as slow as molasses 2001 anything by Andrei Tarkovsky anything by Antonioni most things by Bergman My Dinner with Andre Dreyer's sound films Ordet Day of Wrath and Gertrud Rhapsody in August The Decalogue and The Dreamlife of Angels for starters. How about those who would criticize me for not liking loose narratives? Godard is one of my very favorite filmmakers. And seeing that The Puppetmaster was supposedly improvised at least in the editing room I happen to love Pierrot le fou Godard's film where he JeanPaul Belmondo and Anna Karina grabbed a camera and went out on the road improvising an entire film as rumor has it. And if this is all Hou could come up with if he came into this film not having an idea what he was going to make Fellini did the same thing with 8 12 and that is one of the ten best films ever made in my opinion. Now how come I don't love this master's films? The answer is simple methinks he's no master.I have very stubbornly stuck with a different Hou film every Friday for a month now and he has revealed little or nothing to me about the human condition or the nature of filmmaking. Seeing that the showings are free I'm not going to skip them. However I can breathe a huge sigh of relief that there is a two week break in this particular series. 510 for The Puppetmaster.".

From the music which consists mainly of drums to the lack of any visual appealing elements. There is absolutely nothing appealing about this movie. Most of the movie is a series of characters having long monologues. These speeches last anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes usually. They add plot details but the way they do it is so incredibly dull and boring. Once again AVOID watching this movie at ALL costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 25th Anniversary DVD of Nezha Nao Hai Nezha Conquers the Dragon King is REALLY a wellremastered DVD with Chinese  English subtitles! It totally wipes the floor with Disney's Mulan just my personal fanatical opinion in terms of Chinese fantasy art and of course kungfu animation.In my opinion this is REAL Peak Achievement of traditional Chinese animation because Shanghai Animation Film Studio built on the achievements of Uproar in Heaven Da Hao Tian Gong 1965 and threw in every visual and musical trick available to the studio in 1979.And the English subtitles are quite well done except in places where the translation is a bit too literal i.e. doesn't flow in modern English. Of course the English subs simplify the story in the sense that some nuances of the Chinese dialogue doesn't come through e.g when the red black and white Dragon King greets the bluegreen Dragon King as Sire the point that the bluegreen Dragon King is the eldest brother is lost in translation.But then the story is already simplified from the book and Nezha's mother  2 elder brothers never appear so the film is only around 1 hour and is easy enough to follow without subs. But be warned! Unlike Uproar in Heaven which a happy ending to fit a film format the Monkey King's adventures actually goes on for another 90 chapters or so all the cruel elements of Nezha's story has been retained....".

	schema:headline " The Second Chinese animated film I had watched online";
	schema:reviewBody "Like I said again animation is an art form and I saw that in a few countries in the world there are some excellent animation. After watching online the 2004 Chinese animated film The Butterfly Lovers though it was originally made in Taiwan in December 31 of 2003 I had gotten curious about Chinese animation. So on YouTube and on another video site I had watched the dubbed version and the original version of the film Nezha Conquers the Dragon King and I love it  both versions. And like I said the world has lots of wonderful stories to love and to share with other people and the character of Nezha has frequently appeared in Chinese Mythology ancient Chinese Literature and this animated film tells the story of one of these Chinese legends.The story begins with Li Jing a military leader of the Chentangguan Pass who is informed that after a three and half year pregnancy his wife has given birth to something that looks like a cross between an egg and a lotus flower. Before Li could strike the eggflower with his sword as he consider to be something unnatural the bud open and reveal a small boy. Not long after a sage named Taiyi Zhenren comes to express congratulations. He names the boy Nezha and gives him the Firmament Ring and the Armillary Damask Silk and accept Nezha as his disciple. When Nezha is seven years old the Chentangguan Pass is afflicted with a severe drought and Ao Guang the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea turns a blind eye to the offerings he received from the people that are suffering from the drought. And worse he orders Li Gen his Yaksha guard an evil ogrelike spirit in Buddhist religion to hunt and kidnap the town's children so he could eat them. Li Gen manage to kidnap one of the children which were Nezha's two friends that were riding Nezha's deer friend along the beach. Of course Nezha defeat the Yaksha and in a rage over Nezha's defiance to his authority the Dragon King send his third and probably favorite son Prince Ao Bing to capture and kill Nezha. I won't get you anymore details you'll have to see the film for yourself.So overall one of the best animated movies ever made. With plenty of fantasy adventure humor shocking surprises and beautiful animation...I loved it!".

What is it with anime and feminine looking males? his fight against the dragons the sacrifices that he made and his resurrection into godhood.However avoid the English dubbed version of this movie like a virus. The dubbing is awful. Nezha sounds stuffy the fake Chinese accents were grating and worse yet the authentic Chinese soundtrack was replaced with cheesy synthesizer music. Worst Americanization of an Anime besides Lensman another victim of bad Americanization back in the 1980's. No wonder China has been angry at the western world.Luckily it looks like the subtitled version is more widely available. I recommend you seeing this.

In those films almost all Chinese young or old men or women were all warriors fighting against the Japanese invaders. We all know that it wasn't true. From this film we can see how ignorant and stupid those Chinese peasants were. It gives us a chance to review what was really going on during that time. It is a history we cannot deny. As a matter of fact this film was banned in mainland China by some kind of a censorship mainly because it revealed so much truth.The director of the film Jiangwen is my only favorite director from China. You can say he is ambitious a genius or whatever. But i say that he is a director with a sense of responsibility to our nation to our people to those heroes and civilians died in the war. He is not afraid to dig up the lessbright side of the history and present it to us to those younger generation who never go through the war. It reminds us never to forget history.".

This movie is a tragicomedy about the Japanese invasion of China which of course is no laughing matter but this movie is genuinely funny and never falls into the bad taste category because it shows you the brutality of war and how it affects the Chinese people albeit from a different angle than one would expect. The ending which I am not going to give away is excellent and I think it is the most courageous war movie ending I have ever seen.

This is all obvious to anyone who has had an unbiased detailed education of that dreadful time period. On the surface Jiang Wen's film touches on these acts to illuminate what it must have been like for the Chinese to cope with the Japanese devils. But a thorough viewing of the film reveals so many more questions not just about the Chinese and Japanese but about the universal relationship between war and humans. Wen directs this film in a peculiar way. He uses comedy that forces us to laugh at things that we shouldn't. You find yourself smirking or smiling in moments until you catch yourself and remember that the whole scene in which you were laughing at was where character's lives were at stake. Most people will read this and not see what is so masterful about this approach. What makes Wen's quirkiness work is that it illuminates the naivety of human beings while at the same time brings these characters to life which in the end leaves us trembling with emotion. It is a film that transcends common conceptions about war. A masterpiece.".

This film was never released in mainland China. Is that government that afraid? Why do the Chinese filmmakers have no freedom? Those great Chinese directors actors can not live on forever. When will the Chinese filmmakers have the freedom to make films that they want so those films can be forever treasured by the generations forever.This film reminded me of the other film called Life is beautiful. They are both funny and about world war II. So few people in the West knew about the Japanese invasion of China during world war II and millions of Chinese were brutally killed. Who could have thought that this kind of war movie can be super funny and meaningful? If they can give Oscar to Life is beautiful and Schindler's List they should also give Oscar's Best Foreign Film of the year or maybe Best film of the year to this film. This is just a rare epic coming from China. I have seen quite a few socalled best foreign film of the year given by the Academy they were not great at all.Most of the Chinese and Japanese actors were pretty good. However David Wu as Major Gao did not perform well. When he first appeared he actually was speaking Cantonese instead of the standard Mandarin Chinese. Then when he was delivering his speech he also said a few words in Cantonese. Overall he doesn't look like a Chinese nationalist army major at all.Comparing to Life is Beautiful this film lacks of the beautiful music. I can laugh and cry when I watch Life is beautiful. I can only laugh and feel sad when I watch this one.".

His vision of war has many ties to US cinema with delirious often hauntingly surreal images of people trying to reconcile their own individual nature with that of being part of a collective.I can see why Chinese censors would take offense to the film. China is painted as the victim that it is so often stereotyped as. However with the country's continued objections against the Japanese glossing over wartime indiscretions it could be seen as having nationalist overtones. I don't see the film as necessarily sympathetic to the Japanese at the end of the movie they are still the devils.

For those who has not seen his debut In the Heat of the Sun you really should not miss it. I read this movie as a song for humanity. The fate of characters are so dramatic but at the same time so real. Hanaya Japanese prisoner after being held and fed by Chinese villagers is on the edge of being lifted from a Japanese militarism twisted spirit and turning back into a human. However when he returns to Japanese troops camp the humanity is ripped off by reality again. Dasan Chinese peasant after the villagers being slaughtered and Japanese surrender turns into a revenging killer of Japanese prisoners and finally end up with being executed as a criminal by Hanaya. The fate of both reveals the weakness of individual in front of the war. The war is a machine and it eats up the humanity. The acting is great. I heard two Japanese actors don't want to be in the movie when they know the plot.  But finally they did a good job in this movie. The performance the set the local dialect are all giving an authentic touch. Plus it's full of humor. Highly recommended!".

The film mixes war violence comedy fear and tragedy in a careful manner making sure that the sometimes opposing styles never clash. The only problem I have with the film is its somewhat uneven and oddly paced structure which unfortunately does hinder an otherwise perfect and very well made feature.Perhaps one my favourite aspects of 'Devils' is its photography which is mostly shot in black and white save for a scene near the end. The whole film looks marvellous and the lighting is used appropriately to cast dramatic shadows where needed helping to create very memorable and inspiring scenes. The actors themselves do a brilliant job bringing their characters to life being animated at all times never once giving a dull or dry performance. When taken in addition to the fantastic direction from Wen these details make 'Devils' an absolute joy to look at and it's images and characters will not be easily forgotten.The films also displays intelligent and thought provoking themes throughout focusing on war survival revenge the human spirit and many others. The themes are perhaps not as focused as they could have been and this admittedly does bring the uneven structure of the plot to the attention more however I say this only because with a film as well made as this you have to include even the tiniest of mishaps to form a conclusive and informative review.

The way it lulls the audience into a false sense of security is very skillful and I was genuinely speechless and rooted in place when the climactic but not final scene came along. This is something that despite watching countless films I am not accustomed to.HOWEVER I am absolutely astounded that nobody else has read this as a horribly dehumanising account of the Japanese. Before anybody starts saying that the Japanese army in WWII committed some horrific atrocities I know this full well. However it is the way that this film goes about portraying this message will truly disturbs me in a fashion that is cinematically brilliant and all the more worrying for that reason.The Japanese soldier who is captured by the villagers is wellcrafted. To begin with he is understandably somewhat uncooperative with his captors. However over time his human side comes out in often comic fashion and we begin to develop some kind of sympathy for him and feel that he has come to develop sympathy for his captors. Unfortunately this is all utterly shattered later. Likewise the Japanese general initially impresses us with his sense of honour despite his fierce nature. Again he is set up as somebody who has developed some kind of sympathy for the villagers and has acted honourably. But without spoiling the latter part of the film he then completely derails any such thoughts and proves that deep down he is a completely evil swine. His logic for his acts is utterly ludicrous and demonises the Japanese. This film is let down by the fact that it portrays the Japanese as pure evil. It suggests that even when they seem nice on the outside they are still backstabbing devils.I understand that the Chinese are very bitter and rightfully so for the atrocities committed against them by the Japanese during WWII. And I don't blame them whatsoever for showing this side of the Japanese army. After all our own cinema has repeatedly and rightly depicted the Nazis as evil. However what concerns me is the total lack of any of the Japanese characters coming out as in any way good people. They all to a man come out as barbarians. The biggest missed opportunity was for the captured soldier to refuse his order near the end and die honourably. But no. Even films about the Nazis that are as harrowing as Schindler's List have Germans we can be sympathetic with. Devils on the Doorstep sadly only creates a veneer of decency around some of the Japanese characters whilst using this as an effective tool to deride their 'true nature'.I found this film very disturbing and disappointing for this reason. But as I say it is very wellmade and well worth watching. I just hope that viewers don't fall prey to the message beneath and that the film has not done too much damage to already tense race relations between the Chinese and Japanese. If I had not found the film so inherently racist I would have awarded it 8 out of 10 I'm a harsh marker perhaps even nine. But it will have to be a 7.Oh and I'm confused by a previous review which claims the film is too long for the subject matter. Too long for a story about a war?!? I personally never felt it was too long.".

Western audiences may be unfamiliar with the SinoJapanese conflict but elements of the story transcend that. I will rewatch it carefully but on first viewing I could not figure out who me the kidnapper was. There is a possible clue however. me points a Mauser pistol at Ma Dasan in the opening scene. Mausers were en vogue with many Chinese warlords of that era. Was this a coincidence or a subtle hint? Was me therefore Chinese? Why would a fellow Chinese person saddle Ma Dasan and his village with such a disastrous assignment?".

Western audiences may be unfamiliar with the SinoJapanese conflict but elements of the story transcend that. I will rewatch it carefully but on first viewing I could not figure out who me the kidnapper was. There is a possible clue however. me points a Mauser pistol at Ma Dasan in the opening scene. Mausers were en vogue with many Chinese warlords of that era. Was this a coincidence or a subtle hint? Was me therefore Chinese? Why would a fellow Chinese person saddle Ma Dasan and his village with such a disastrous assignment?";

	schema:headline " Sudden shift from black comedy to tragic drama doesn't work that well at all";
	schema:reviewBody "When 'Devils on the Doorstep' was released in 2000 it was banned in China and its director Jiang Wen prohibited from directing any more movies for an unstated period of time. As it turned out Jiang didn't direct another film until 2007. The film is set in a North Chinese town toward the end of the Japanese occupation in 1945. Apparently the Chinese censors felt the film didn't cast the Japanese occupiers in a negative enough light as well as failing to depict the Chinese villagers as heroes.'Devils' is an unusual in that most of the film is a black comedy. The way Jiang depicts the Japanese occupation is quite different than the 'Rape of Nanking'. Here the Japanese have occupied the small town of 'RackArmor Terrace' and have already settled in for eight years. There's no reign of terror here as the Japanese soldiers spend most of their time parading their musicallyinept Navy band around town who only happen to know one tune. Despite their contempt for the village they're in charge of they basically leave the villagers to their own devices. The villagers are more upset about the lack of grain than the conduct of the Japanese soldiers.All that changes when an apparent partisan leaves a Japanese soldier and his Chinese collaboratorinterpreter on the doorstep of our villager protagonist Ma Dasan tied up in gunny sacks with orders to interrogate them and wait for his return five days later when presumably he'll return and take custody of them again. The partisan threatens both Dasan and his fellow villagers with death if he doesn't cooperate.The captured Japanese soldier Hanaya is a caricature of the fanatical type of World War II Japanese soldier often depicted in American propaganda movies during World War II. The Chinese interpreter Hanchen fearing that the villagers will kill both of them intentionally mistranslates Hanaya's belligerent words so that his captors will get the impression that he's actually benign the joke of the villagers misinterpreting Hanaya's intentions goes on for way too long. Ma Dasan informs his fellow villagers of his quandary and they agree that Ma Dasan should keep the captured soldiers in his cellar.After six months goes by and the partisan fails to return the villagers agree to cast lots to determine who amongst them should execute the prisoners. Ma Dasan ends up being chosen but doesn't have the gumption to kill his captives so he hides them in a watchtower along the Great Wall of China and brings them food and water. The villagers discover Ma Dasan's ruse when the prisoners fail in an escape attempt so they decide to hire an assassin a bumbling retired executioner by the name of 'One Stoke Liu'. Liu is completely incompetent and misses when he tries to slice off the prisoners' heads. At this point one can hardly take the film seriously at all as the characters exemplified by such a buffoon appear to be a bunch of bumbling fools. The same goes for two Japanese soldiers who fail in their obsessive quest to capture a chicken as well as Ma Dasan's fellow villagers who are constantly engaged in one petty argument after another.After Hanaya miraculously transforms himself from fanatic to grateful fan of his captors he proposes that if the villagers release him he'll approach the Japanese commander Sakatsuka and ask for two wagons of grain for the town. The ensuing scenario fails as satire since it's too detached from reality. I can see why the Chinese censors took Jiang to task as no Chinese villager would be stupid enough to bring a captured Japanese prisoner back to a commanding officer expecting not to be punished and worse hope that said Commander ends up rewarding them for their actions.Hanaya ends up as the one who's punished as his death has already been reported to his hometown where a memorial has been erected and to now reveal that he's still alive and was a prisoner of the Chinese to boot would be a great humiliation for Sakatsuka and his unit. In a most unlikely reversal Sakatsuka agrees to keep the agreement Hanaya made with the villagers and ends up giving them not just two wagons of grain but an additional four.If all this seems unbelievable Jiang decides to shift gears at film's end dispensing with the overall comic tone. The jarring transition between black comedy and serious drama would have been much more effective had he had a little more empathy for his characters to begin with. So when things get 'serious' and the stakes are raised we don't care much for what happens to characters who end up as tragic victims.As the plot unfolds Sakatsuka turns on the villagers when they fail to produce the man who captured Hanaya to begin with and believes Ma Dasan has gone off to fetch some partisans. The paranoid outburst leads to the villagers being massacred including a Japanese soldier murdering a young child despite the fact that Sakatsuka already knows that Japan has surrendered.The coda is just as gruesome. Hanchen is executed by the Nationalists and Ma Dasan cracks up and attacks Japanese POWs. Soldiers prevent him from hacking Hanaya to death and in a cruel twist Major Gao the Chinese Nationalist in charge has Hanaya behead Ma Dasan as punishment for his crimes.Jiang pulls out all the stops at irony when a transformed Hanaya is forced to execute Ma Dasan the good man who saved him but who went mad due to the cruelties of war. Jiang did well not to show the Chinese as completely heroic as the censors wanted but went too far by turning them along with the Japanese occupiers into buffoons. When death finally came to the characters whom Jiang wanted us to laugh at earlier their sudden demise hardly seemed tragic at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Taipei a middleaged real estate agent May Lin Yangkuei Mei goes about her daily routine of putting up signs inviting potential customers to an open house then sitting and waiting for them in empty apartments as the hours drag by. Tsai Mingliang's Vive L'Amour is an honest and beautiful film about three lonely people whose lives become inextricably bound in a chance encounter. Dialogue is minimal and no one speaks for the first twentyfive minutes creating a pervasive tone of emotional numbness. Hsiaokang Kangsheng Lee a young gay man who sells wall space for burials soon finds the key to an apartment being shown by May Lin and moves in taking a bath getting dressed then almost matter of factly cutting his wrists with a pocket knife. When May Lin meets Ahjung Chaojung Chen a slick street vendor of women's clothes during a lunch break they coyly size each other up then use the apartment for casual sex. Ahjung unaware of HsiaoKang's presence takes the key from May Lin and also moves in. The characters live an existence surrounded by silence unwilling or unable to reach out to each other living in the empty spaces. They spend their time aimlessly drinking beers smoking cigarettes and just watching the time pass without any apparent connection to the teeming city they live in. Mingliang's camera views the characters from a distance at times simply watching them for minutes at a time go through a period of silent suffering. One of the most heartbreaking scenes is when HsiaoKang hugs and kisses a watermelon as if it were the responsive companion he so desperately needs. When May Lin comes to the apartment to rest the two clandestine guests forge an alliance to avoid being seen. In an unforgettable sequence HsiaoKang hides under the bed masturbating while May and Ahjung make love directly on top. After May leaves the young man crawls into bed with the sleeping Ahjung and creeps his way inch by inch toward the sleeping man in a scene of heartbreaking loneliness and conflicted emotions. The film ends in a fiveminute close up of one of the characters sitting alone in a newlyopened park that made me reflect on similar periods of loneliness in my own life. It also caused me to wonder if our modern cities have become little more than sanctuaries for the walking dead where everyone is a stranger crossing paths in silence without a hint of recognition of a common humanity.".

	schema:headline " An antifilm that pulls a cinematic rabbit out of its hat";
	schema:reviewBody "First the video box is very deceptive.  This film is NOT about intense erotic encounters with some hidden gay voyeur taking it all in.Somewhere in Taipei is a nice apartment. A young gay guy who is lonely as hell and sells cremation urns gets the key by bolding plucking it out of the lock while no one is looking.  An attractive young female real estate agent who while trying to sell or rent the place also uses it checks up on it stops in to take a crap or a lie down or take a guy there for hot but causal sex.  The guy she takes up there is a well off street vendor.  He gets his key by swiping it from her after the sex.  It is more of a situation than a story.Vive L'Amour takes a studied hypernaturalistic approach that is a strong style statement in itself an effect partly due to turning up the 'natural' sounds accompanying an action a notch or two and by not using music.  And despite her good looks and movie actress head of hair the real estate agent is presented again and again as completely nonglamourous.  She is always behaving in slightly exaggerated ways that show she is just a woman like any other.  This is epitomized in the crap taking scene in the apartment but there is also the scene where she cries beautiful women in the movies usually cry with just their eyes but here we get rich rolling mucal snorts that come straight from the nose.  A lot of the film is spent following her completely unromanticized daily routine trying to sell or rent properties.  As counterpoint and equally deliberately we there are little movie touches the big hair all the actors are attractive little bits of romanticcomedic chatter the comedybuddy goings on between the guys who of course run into each other in the apartmentmore movie comedy stuff and so on.In the end Tsai manages to masterfully blend these contradictory forces into a climax that interweaves three one per character magical cinematic moments Tenderness Innocence and Sadness. Vive L'Amour is fine intelligent and moving film making.".

	onyx:emotionText "First the video box is very deceptive.  This film is NOT about intense erotic encounters with some hidden gay voyeur taking it all in.Somewhere in Taipei is a nice apartment. A young gay guy who is lonely as hell and sells cremation urns gets the key by bolding plucking it out of the lock while no one is looking.  An attractive young female real estate agent who while trying to sell or rent the place also uses it checks up on it stops in to take a crap or a lie down or take a guy there for hot but causal sex.  The guy she takes up there is a well off street vendor.  He gets his key by swiping it from her after the sex.  It is more of a situation than a story.Vive L'Amour takes a studied hypernaturalistic approach that is a strong style statement in itself an effect partly due to turning up the 'natural' sounds accompanying an action a notch or two and by not using music.  And despite her good looks and movie actress head of hair the real estate agent is presented again and again as completely nonglamourous.  She is always behaving in slightly exaggerated ways that show she is just a woman like any other.  This is epitomized in the crap taking scene in the apartment but there is also the scene where she cries beautiful women in the movies usually cry with just their eyes but here we get rich rolling mucal snorts that come straight from the nose.  A lot of the film is spent following her completely unromanticized daily routine trying to sell or rent properties.  As counterpoint and equally deliberately we there are little movie touches the big hair all the actors are attractive little bits of romanticcomedic chatter the comedybuddy goings on between the guys who of course run into each other in the apartmentmore movie comedy stuff and so on.In the end Tsai manages to masterfully blend these contradictory forces into a climax that interweaves three one per character magical cinematic moments Tenderness Innocence and Sadness. Vive L'Amour is fine intelligent and moving film making.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't even know where to begin on Vive L'Amour. It is the second Tsai Mingliang film I've seen after The Hole. I doubted that it could be as good as The Hole but it turned out to be an even better film. In fact I'd say it's pretty close to perfect. The only thing I don't like about it is its American title  Vive L'Amour makes it sound like a romantic comedy starring Gerard Depardieu. This film is about love but not in any conventional way.I'd love to relate the plot of the film but I think that'd ruin it quite a bit. Part of the fun of it is figuring out exactly what's going on. Those who like puzzle films will find the initial puzzle of Vive L'Amour very intriguing. Those who don't like slowmoving films should avoid it though. A good benchmark if you like Antonioni's films especially L'Avventura which is directly referenced in this film you'll probably like it. Here's an intriguing fact about Vie L'Amour there is not one piece of audible dialogue spoken until 21 minutes have gone by. One of the main characters does not speak until 49 minutes have passed. If you were to write out all the dialogue of the film you could probably fit it on a single page. Tsai is simply audacious in his paucity of dialogue. And it could have easily seemed like little more than a stunt but the characters still come off as fully developed and interesting people. The drama works wonders and there is a lot of comedy too. The film is also very erotic.I really don't want to say another word about this film. I hope that any reader will have enjoyed or agreed with the numerous other reviews I have written to take my recommendation at face value. I have seen hundreds of great films and Vive L'Amour is one of the best I have seen. Also make sure to check out The Hole which is also on Fox Lorber DVD. Fox Lorber has gotten a lot of undeserved criticism in the past. Their DVDs aren't always the best they're no Criterion but they're usually of great visual quality. They may have few extras but extras are not always necessary. I would even suggest that Criterion sometimes stuffs their DVDs with unnecessary and lowquality material.".

Unbeknownst to both of them guy 2 a suicidally lonely gay man has already crashed the place.

The acting was good the directing was frank.  But throughout most of the film I kept asking myself where it was going.  There was very little development or dialogue. However while I didn't particularly like watching the seemingly infinite shots at the same time I appreciated the way that they developed the mood perspective and bleak tone of the film.  Mind you this didn't don on me until near the end.  These 3 people were each very much alone especially the girl and the gay guy.  Alone and yet living in a large metropolis and surrounded by people.  The climax of the film where the girl is walking through the park the most barren dead and desolate public park I've ever seen. made perfect sense.  The surroundings were an achingly appropriate reflection of the girl's emotional state in life and the starkness of what her outlook must have been.  When she sat down on the bench and started to sob everything just clicked.  I thought to myself My god I know exactly how she feels.  That was my big revelation with this movie when I related to her character.  And because of this the film held a special poignance to me.  While I can't say that I was entertained by this film I can say that I was impacted.  It reminded me that the point of a movie can serve a more dignified purpose than just appealing to an audience as entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I timed it. It's exactly six minutes and 25 seconds of a closeup stationary camera of a woman crying. She pauses once to light a new cigarette and then she resumes crying.This example is designed to illustrate how tedious the movie can be. Don't get me wrong slow is good sometimes. Ketchup mango sorbet a sunrise... yes these things are best enjoyed slowly. But now imagine a spoonful of mango sorbet that just refuses to leave your spoon. You shake it you bite at it you pry it with your tongue but it just won't budge.That's when slow crosses into annoying.Before you dismiss me as some MTVgeneration ADHD kid let me mention that two of my favourite movies are Werckmeister Harmoniak camera shots that last up to 13 minutes and Kieslowsky's Trois Couleurs where we watch an old woman struggling with a rubbish bin for 2 minutes repeated 3 times. 2001 A Space Odyssey is another winner. And I wish Russian Ark could've been an hour longer. Those are all painfully slow films. But this film makes them look like the Indy 500.Mingliang Tsai's later work The Hole is much more substantial. It's just as slow but with one important difference The Hole keeps us interested with it's cryptic plot and imaginative setting. Here we have no such incentive to stay awake. The plot is banal colours are drab acting is concrete deliberately I'm sure and the camera is as lethargic as a kid on dope only without the potato chips.In my opinion the movie reaches its only high point halfway through when we are shown a very clever and poignant analogy which I won't ruin for you. It was absolutely brilliant and it's the only reason why I'm rating this movie a 6 instead of a 3.I think the director just pushed it one step too far with the slow pace. At first it works but after a whilejust like an old jokeit fails to carry any more punch and it seems gratuitous and gimmicky.My suggestion is for you to watch The Hole first. Even though it's done in the same slow style it's much more challenging and intriguing see my review of The Hole. If you really like that movie and I mean REALLY like it...rating it an 8 or better then try Vive l'Amour. Otherwise you might want to think twice. This movie just sucks the life out of you. And the crying scene freaked out my dog.".

Unfortunately there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. These are what I call IAN films  Incomprehensible Artistic Nonsense. Tsai Mingliang is the king of this subgenre and Vive L'Amour is his masterpiece. In fact this is the crme de la crme of crapinfested garbage under the guise of art. People walk around in their apartments drink water stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant hang posters staple papers together go to the bathroom eat do pushups have sex slap at mosquitoes etc. I'm not joking when I say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless arthouse trash. There is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly  no drama.The most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous. The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically nonexistent. Tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang. The person under the bed is just as onedimensional and uninteresting. He likes to drink water makeout with melons and stroke himself. This is Tsai's idea of character development. A truly misguided entertainer indeed.Tsai's true contribution in Vive L'Amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in arthouse film history. He first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds. The film then abruptly ends. No point. No entertainment. Just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer. In an effort to beat a dead horse. The underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. In fact Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film Kairo. And guess what? It's actually INTERESTING! That film moved as slow as molasses in January but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as Vive L'Amour. Kairo is a perfect example of that.Fans of cinema may thank Tsai Mingliang for directing this film as he has provided irrefutable evidence that arthouse cinema can be just as poorly made as Bgrade madefortelevision horror flicks. Arthouse snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of selfrighteousness. The quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like Army of Darkness and  gasp!  Showgirls. How do you like them apples?".

Critics say it was minimalist I say it lacked a complete plot and anyone writing positively about it simply is full of themselves. For the ignorant raters that gave this film an average rating of 3.95 or an 8.110 I see absolutely no justification for this. The lack of plot is not high art or abstract or even a symbol for anything about Taiwan. This movie was just an incomplete film that wasted two hours of my life. For the people who may disagree with my thoughts all I can say is if you guys enjoy the movie so much rewatch the scene where Mei licks AhRong's nipple. That was enough for me.

For the ignorant raters that gave this film an average rating of 3.95 or an 8.110 I see absolutely no justification for this. The lack of plot is not high art or abstract or even a symbol for anything about Taiwan. This movie was just an incomplete film that wasted two hours of my life. For the people who may disagree with my thoughts all I can say is if you guys enjoy the movie so much rewatch the scene where Mei licks AhRong's nipple. That was enough for me. However it is a shame to say that the ending was even worse than that atrocity.";

A few examples1. Jackie Chan has long hair and not only long hair but unbelievably long sideburns. These sideburns let me tell ya there so good right they don't even grow from his face as much as they are extensions of his hair. Awesome.2. There's a guy a ghost or specter I can't tell and he comes from nowhere during the first 10 Min's. of the film and screams at Chan and his family to return my hand return my hand in full scary movie voice and Chan throws the hand to the guy. He laughs maniacally and then runsdisappears in a series of laughably bad cuts. Classic.3. Shortly after that we are introduced to the main villain'steacher and her gang of weirdo all girl henchmen.Get this THE DREADED KILLER BEE GANG! who apparently were disgraced by Chan's father. Now this gang of Killer Bees or whatever they all have these weird flower masks as well as Chinese lanterns on poles. WHY? I don't know either. Anyway the main villain's and two other Killer Bees shoot out of these caskets like jack in the boxes laugh maniacally and proceed to massacre Chan's entire family. Obviously sending Chan into a full on hatefest for the Killer Bees. But he's out of luck to do anything as he gets his rear handed to him by the girl.And folks this all takes place before we hit the 30 min. mark.4. After Chan gets knocked out over he's laying in a bed seemingly pretty comfortable until 3 ChineseMogonlianMexican henchmen decide to float up in THROUGH the window to attack poor sleepy Chan. Guy can't catch a break! Anyway he easily dispatches the gang killing one of them by kicking him through the window in full bad reverse too bad we didn't have more than 13.94 for a SFX budget motion. Just a barrel of laughs man I'm telling ya.5. All I'm gonna say for this one is the main bad guy is posing as three different people. Chan's best friend Chu Chuk The Governor and the main bad guy and they all look the same same actor same duds but none of the stupid cast figures it out. At one point before handing these two guys butts to them he says So you now know that I am Chu Chuk as well as the Governor but I'm also a THIRD person. Who do you think? and the two guys just look dumbfounded as would I if I heard such a laughably bad line. Who do you think? HAHAHAHA that is the best man and the way he delivers it classic.Listen if you truly like Kung Fu films and I don't mean HALF PAST DEAD or CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE or any of those crappy Hollywood films I mean old school Kung Fu 1977 style pick up this movie. It cost me 3.99 at WalMart and it was ten times funnier than I expected and if your into these old movies your looking for funny.Just sit back relax smoke a joint and get ready to bask in the overwhelmingly bad funny and weird To Kill With Intrigue.At one point Chan actually has half his face burned off you can't beat that.".

Filled with unexpected surprises and unusual plot twists it really keeps the viewer guessing when he or she's not shaking their head in confusion. The most confusion stems from the relationship with the veiled woman who all reason suggests should be Cao Lei's sworn enemy yet...Still I love the action sequences and although the wire stuff just never looks believable there's the suggestion of something mystical at work in our story that helps make some of these scenes somehow a little more credible that they would be without it.

However I was sadly disappointed to find out that it was not to be.The story in To Kill with Intrigue Jian Hua Yan Yu Jiang Nan was sort of trying to be everything at once trying to accomplish a lot but just ending up in a sort of strange confusion and semicoherent story. Which made it not overly enjoyable and quickly had my attention drifting elsewhere and only pay attention to the movie with half an eye.And part of the lack of interest in it on my part is that the DVD I acquired from Amazon only had a horrible English dubbed language track. I could not even if my life depended on it understand why English dubbing is appealing or acceptable to anyone? It is poorly done it totally destroyed the feeling or mood of the movie and it just makes it come off as a very low budget production.Now for the good parts about To Kill with Intrigue well you have Jackie Chan in a very unusual role if you compare it to his other roles throughout his career as he is not really the goody twoshoes that he usually plays. Plus this movie doesn't have the usual slapstick comedy either. It is a serious movie and the martial arts in it was actually quite nicely choreographed and executed whereas many of his movies before this one the martial arts was horrible staged and rigid.This movie sort of has a weird mutated mixture of traditional old Chinese warrior movies mixed with Chinese Operalike characters. Not really sure what director Wei Lo was aiming for here.To Kill with Intrigue is the type of movie that you watch if you are a hardcore fan of Jackie Chan or old Chinese cinema. For me this was not one of Jackie Chan's better movie despite it being a venture away from the slapstick comedy. If the movie only had been with its original language track it would at least have scored a 410 rating but now has to settle for a 310 rating from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao Hsien just made a film in Japan 'Caf Lumiere.' This his first foray out of Asia to make a film was commissioned by the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It's a precise study of the quotidian and since that quotidian is in Paris it's particularly graceful and lovely despite the themes of urban loneliness and stress which seem to grow seamlessly out of the last film into this one. It's about a frazzled lady named Suzanne Juliette Binoche with overbleached unruly hair. Her life is a little like her coiffureshe can't quite seem to control it. She has a sevenyearold boy named Simon Simon Iteanu with a fine profile and a big mop of hair and an annoying downstairs lodger Hipolyte Girardot a friend of her absent boyfriend who it emerges hasn't paid his rent in a year. Suzanne's work is unusual. She puts on Chinese puppet plays for which she does all the voices. As the film begins she picks up Song Song Fang a Taiwanese girl studying filmmaking fluent in French who is going to be a child minder for Simon. And then she picks up Simon at school introduces them and takes them to the apartment.The Musee d'Orsay lent Hou a copy of Albert Lamorisse's 1956 classic 34minute short 'The Red Balloon.' This is a kind of homage to and riff on it. There's a big red balloon that keeps following Simon. Song also starts shooting a little film of Simon with a red balloon.Hou admits he didn't know a lot about Paris. Somehow he got hold of a copy of Adam Gopnik's book about the city 'Paris to the Moon' an enlightening and truly smart study of the French and their capital that grew out of the years when Gopnik was The New Yorker's correspondent therewhen he also had young a little boy along. From Gopnik Hou learned about how old Parisian cafes still have pinball machines 'flippers' the French call them. He also learned that the merrygoround in the Jardin du Luxembourg has little rings the children catch on sticks as they ride around like knights in the days of jousting. Hou put both those things in his movie. He says that once he had Simon's school and Suzanne's apartment the film was safely under way. He provided a very detailed scenario penned by Hou with cowriter and producer Franois Margolin complete with full back stories but the actors had to decide what to say in each of their scenes. They did quite convincingly.Hou's life has been full of puppets from childhood and he made a film about a puppet master. This time he incorporates a classic Chinese puppet story about a very determined hero he meant it to describe Suzanne who creates a new version of it. He also brings in a visiting Chinese puppet master. Suzanne calls in Song to act as interpreter for the puppet master during his visit and also asks her to transfer some old family films to disk. The lines between filmmaker and story actors and their characters blur at times.Flight may be seen as a contrast of moods. That tenant downstairs has become a real annoyance. Simon's father has been away as a writer in residence at a Montreal university for longer than he planned. These two things are enough to make Suzanne fly off the handle whenever she comes home. But Song and Simon are calm souls and they hit it off from the start. With Simon all is going well. He's happy with his young life. Math spelling flipper wandering Paris with Song catching the rings at the Jardin du Luxembourg taking his piano lessons the world according to Simon is full and good. Suzanne hugs Simon as if to draw comfort from his love and his serenity.Hou has a wonderfully light touch. Changes of scene feel exactly right. The red balloon and the occasional judiciously placed pale yellow filter by Hou's DP Mark Lee Ping Bing make the Parisian interiors seem almost Chinese and beautiful in their cozy clutter. Let's not forget that red is the luckiest color in Chinee culture.You could say that nothing really happens in Hou's red balloon story. Like other auteurartist filmmakers he requires patience of his audience. But nothing in particular has to happen because he stages his scenes with such grace and specificity that it's a pleasure to watch them unfold a lesson in life lived for its zen hereandnowness. Occasionally perhaps here the absence of emotional conflicts or suspense leads to momentary longeurs but one's still left feeling satisfied. Clever Hou who is clearly a master of seizing the moment can make you feel as much at home in Paris as any French director. Though Flight of the Red Balloon may generate little excitement it provides continual aesthetic pleasure and at the same time has the feel of daily life in every scene. This is a method that can incorporate anything so at the end the Musee d'Orsay is easily worked in through Simon's class coming for a visit and looking at a painting by Flix Vallottonof a landscape with a red balloon. It's in the nature of good film acting that Binoche's character though sketched in only with a few brief scenes seems quite threedimensional. This is Hou at his most accessible but there is more solidity to this film than might at first appear.An official selection of the New York Film Festival 2007. Chris Knipp 2007".

In Caf Lumiere his lyrical tribute to Japanese auteur Yasujiro Ozu the focus was on the streets of Tokyo Japan. In his latest film the lovely and nostalgic Flight of the Red Balloon Hou and cinematographer Lee Pingbing bring their observational camera to the streets of Paris focusing on a Parisian family as they walk the streets sit in the park shop at stores and visit a puppet theater where Suzanne the family's matriarch Juliette Binoche works as a puppeteer writing the material and providing the vocal dramatics for the shows.Unlike the missteps of Hou's last film Three Times where innocuous pop ballads filled the air the only sounds we hear are the ambient sounds of the environment people talking traffic and street noises. Filmed as the first in a series commemorating the 20th anniversary of Paris' Musee d'Orsay Flight reprieves the magic of the original Red Balloon a thirtyminute short by Albert Lamorisse from 1956 that has attained the status of a children's classic. The balloon is not as intrusive in the update but still maintains a mysterious if more distant presence. In the opening scenes a young boy named Simon Simon Iteanu attempts to coax the red balloon from its perch high above a Parisian subway station.The balloon decides to hover for a while and then begins to follow Simon as he makes his way home from school on buses and trains. Going on hiatus the balloon reappears now and then but takes center stage once again at the film's conclusion. The plot is woven around Simon's mother and the frustrations she faces in being a single mom working with her puppet show dealing with recalcitrant tenants as a landlord interacting with her gracious Taiwanese nanny Song Song Fang arranging for child care and piano lessons talking on the phone to her boy friend in Montreal barely having enough time to provide affection for young Simon who is quiet and lonely estranged from his sister who lives in Brussels and only visits periodically.It is a story no different than thousands of other split households but the ability of the impeccable cast and the lyricism of Hou bring the film alive. In spite of her emotional ups and downs Suzanne never loses control and Hou always maintains a wistful almost lighthearted approach as people come and go in the crowded apartment a piano tuner tries to do his job over the clamor of voices the couple from downstairs cook vegetables in the kitchen and Suzanne's lawyer discusses her options in dealing with the tenant behind in his rent.The main character of the film however though not always on camera is the balloon a shimmering object in the sky that provides the emotional center of the film. While there are no overt magical sequences as in the original the appearance of the balloon has a calming effect suggesting that when we lose perspective and become too bogged down in the stuff of life there is a presence that follows and guides us into the night.".

Flight of the Red Balloon Hou's Hsiaohsien's second foreign language i.e. nonChinese film is not a remake of this alltime classic. Rather Hou's film pays tribute to it as well as borrows from it the obvious motif.Those who have watched his first foreign language film Japanese Cafe Lumiere 2003 would recognize Hou's unassuming style slow languid pace visually complete silence to dreamy piano in the audio department. This film actually already has more action for want of a better word than most of Hou's other films. Wandering nonchalantly around various slices of daily life of a simple family in Paris the film starts with Song Fang Song a film student from Beijing taking up a post as nanny of little kid Simon Simon Iteanu whose divorced mother Suzanne Juliette Binoche is a busy actress.Revolving around the three principle characters the film depicts various things  alternatively amusing frustrating touching mundane inspiring  at that particular time in their lives Song and Simon getting to know each other Suzanne's interesting current assignment of supplying all spoken dialogue in a puppetry theatre how wonderfully Binoche does that! hassles with an irresponsible basement tenant Song's selfinitiated project of filming a red balloon sequence with Simon as the subject Simon's longing for his loving elder sister currently sojourning in Brussels and more.It is through sharing with them their simple daily lives rather than earthshattering emotional turmoil that we come to know and care for these characters. In Hou's usual unassuming style meticulous attention is given to simple details things so simple that a crafty Hollywood screenwriter wouldn't dream of writing. Example. Suzanne brings home an armful of grocery as presents and in high spirit dumps them on the kitchen table hitting the overhead lamp with the upswing of her arm. Completely asamatterofcourse little Simon says Mind the lamp. Example. Two workmen after a tough negotiation with the staircase succeed in moving a piano upstairs during which time Song and Simon wait patiently downstairs. As the workmen after a friendly chat with Suzanne and receiving their fee walk out of the door Song walks in carrying the piano stool. Suzanne exclaims Oh I've forgotten all about the piano stool! Going back to the title the red balloon as mentioned is used as a recurring motif not too frequently but just at the right moments to punctuate the mood of the film. This is vintage Hou and brilliant Pinoche except to those few who walked out of the TIFF screening obviously out of boredom and at Cannes early this year too from a review I've read. But then there are always a few of those.".

Directed with class and elegance although stumbles in indulgent overextended shots and pacing problems it pays dividends to the patient as we are welcomed into a claustrophobic apartment inhabited by a mother and son struggling to come to grips with a marital separation. The film knows its audience and it caters to them loyally however won't convert any nonbelievers.Although not explicit the sense of chaos is however present right from the point where we enter Suzanne and Simon's apartment in Paris. Clearly not in control of her marital and maternal situation she drowns herself in work as a puppet show narrator where she can control the fantastic as opposed to her real and disorganized state. Enter Song a film student who acts as Simon's surrogate as his mother deals with this transitional process.The film's screenplay is as light as a helium balloon we enter their microcosmos through Song almost this film's allegory towards the original's red balloon as its voyeuristic anchor  nonjudgmental and omnipresent. Although certain scenes clearly leads to nowhere they are nonetheless welcome as it highlights the reality of the situation and also the characters' desire to reach back to normal. It is clear here Suzanne desires a somewhat 'normal' family life almost pleading for her eldest daughter to move back to Paris and for his exhusband's friendtenant to leave the property. A daughter of divorce she knows it is imperative that a routine has to be established.The way Hao films this it has this odd certain detachment towards the characters almost a Wings of Desire approach static camera in tow. We see a single mother in despair but the audience isn't allowed to feel anything about it almost factual. Binoche personifies Suzanne with a quiet dignity and pride that her devastation is disallowed to be brought to the surface but of course when things build up to a boil we can sense her immediate discomfort and frustration.What seems like a nonchalant Simon he is clearly affected too as he can't even distinguish his own family tree to the effect that even the audience can be driven to confusion. He becomes distant to his own mother finding solace through nostalgia with a long summer with his sister. He and Suzanne's relationship is also obviously affected as most of the film they indulge in small talk and when the mother desires for an eye to eye contact he looks away.The decision to film this in a calming atmosphere as opposed to the chaos in the characters' is a smart idea it highlights the juxtaposition even more. As opposed to the Lamorisse classic the maternal figure here is in focus. The film works within its parameters and Hao does not belittle its audience  of course only to those willing to be engulfed by it.".

	schema:headline " An Extemporaneous Homage to Albert Lamorisse's THE RED BALLOON";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere the highly regarded Taiwanese director Hou HsiaoHsien had the idea of paying homage to the 1956 classic Albert Lamorisse film THE RED BALLOON a tender story of a child's interaction with a nearly animate floating balloon and while there is indeed an short introduction of a small boy addressing an errant red balloon floating in Paris the 'homage' stops there. What follows is an overly long frustratingly impromptu series of scenes that lack cohesion and resolution. THE FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON Le Voyage du balloon rouge is a prolonged 113 minutes series of scenes that stutter along with the same sort of wandering course of the occasionally visible red balloon to present moments in the life of a disheveled frumpy single mother Suzanne Juliette Binoche whose income depends on her fascination and obsession with Chinese marionette presentations for which she supplies the backstage voice for all of the characters. Her absent 'husbandboyfriend' has left her to write in Montreal while Suzanne must care for her young son Simon Simon Iteanu with the help of a newly hired Taiwanese photographer nanny Song Fang Song while her daughter resides in Brussels. This disheveled household is further complicated by the freeloading Marc Hippolyte Girardot the friend of her absentee 'husband' by Simon's piano lessons taught by Anna Anna Sigalevitch and by impossible conflicting schedules for marionette performances partially relieved by Song's quiet ability to take Simon on adventures outside the confines of the cluttered little space they all call home. The only quieting element of this film is the occasional appearance of the 'guardian angel' red balloon which seems to be a symbol for defining the real world of Simon and the illusory world he craves. The dialogue as written by Hou and Franois Margolin is choppy and the camera work and constant meandering piano music seem extemporaneous there are few resolutions to the individual stories that are only hinted. Juliette Binoche is a solid actress able to make the most of a minimal script and horrendous costuming and makeup her moments of being the voice of marionettes are magical. But this Red Balloon just doesn't take flight in the context of this homage. As with the rest of the film the balloon just floats off at the end. The viewer needs a lot of patience with this film!

But this Red Balloon just doesn't take flight in the context of this homage. As with the rest of the film the balloon just floats off at the end. The viewer needs a lot of patience with this film!

I liked this more than any other Hou I've seen so far which is odd because it seems to be considered one of his lesser films. Perhaps I only like Hou when he's not being so Hou. There was a lot to decode here but I think one of the primary messages is the meeting of two cultures. The red balloon could be associated with the red prominent in Chinese culture floating through and discovering Paris much in the same way as the director himself. The balloon seems to watch over and sympathize with the characters but doesn't ever connect. We have Juliette Binoche in a very warm and relateable performance practicing the art of Chinese puppet theater and in her employ is Fang Song another very likable performer a Chinese nanny. These characters interact and even have moments of tenderness together but they are detached not quite involved in each other's lives. And then there are multitudes of instances being seen through windows in reflections through a camera on a screen via a child's toy. We are separated but I see you and watch you with care. Outsiders looking in doing what they can. I enjoyed my time with these characters and was engaged with their situations understated though they might be. Lovely photography by one of my favorites Mark Ping Bin Lee and a gentle score. Makes me wonder what I've missed in Hou's other films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flight of the Red Balloon may be the most mundane movie I've ever seen. This is one of those sliceoflife movies in which there is no strong story line to move things forward. Most of the movie is about ordinary everyday events that have only the barest hint of drama. In one typical scene the characters spend several minutes discussing how many pancakes they want to eat. Like the Seinfeld TV show this is a movie about nothing but it lacks Seinfeld's witty intelligent dialog. What the characters say here is just as mundane as what they do. These ordinary scenes drag on forever too. If the director had edited the movie down to maybe 45 minutes the result might have been pleasant and mildlyentertaining. But as it stands you can hardly stay awake to watch. Granted the actors are good but sadly they don't have much material to work with. And by the way the director's use of the red balloon makes no sense. The balloon inexplicably follows the boy around in the beginning and the end of the movie. But in between the balloon is nowhere to be seen except paradoxically in a few brief scenes as a prop in the nanny's home movie. The red balloon almost appears to have been added as an afterthought to pay homage to the classic 1956 movie The Red Balloon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This morning when I looked at The Flight of the Red Balloon lying on our bistro table waiting to share its journey with me I realized that I had been avoiding watching it because of how much I love Albert Lamorisse's Red Balloon from 1956. I would like to believe that it's a staple of every household not just French every language and art teacher's classroom and a necessity for anyone who dares to let loose their imagination and dreams.The first scene itself grabbed me with young Simon talking to a red balloon outside the subway entrance so I settled down and let myself enjoy the rest. It spread a warmth inside me like when soft morning sunlight streams in through closed windowsall is lit quiet still warm and happyoblivious of that which might have transpired the day before lovingly inviting you to a fresh and a new beginning full of possibility.Hou Hsiao Hsien the 60yearold borninChinaraisedinTaiwan filmmaker packs in so much and with such adroitness that he makes everything seem simple.The broader context of the film is dark  frankly realist  a single mom Suzanne juggling work and care for her children one of whom is away at school. In her struggle Suzanne races to get it to it all but winds up diluting the quality time she would spend with her 7 year old Simon were she not so devoted to her career in puppetry and theater Juliette Binoche is brilliant as she gives voice to the puppets.The child minder she hires is a Taiwanese film student Song who is quiet and aloof in her own way her attention divided between taking care of Simon's needs and making progress on her film making projecta tribute to Lamorisse's Red Balloon.Simon is selfabsorbed as well. He moves from one thing to another seamlessly propelled by instinct and subconsciously felt needs and desires just as a boy his age would. We watch him practice piano play on his Playstation go for long walks in town with Song speak to the red balloon talk on the telephone use the digital movie camera to help Song make her film and register the adult world conflict and strife albeit peripherally.Three different worlds and levels of consciousness and isolation. Yet no one seems to make undue demands of one another and everyone seems to try to accommodate others' needs and in doing so they spin a delicate web of verbal and mostly nonverbal communication facial expressions body language decor and silenceas they meet the challenges of modern day living. Hou is able to find the reassuring simplicity in this complex world and that's what tempers the dark hues and keeps the spirits high.Explaining in an interview with Mathieu Menossi of vne.fr January 2008 why he chose to remake Lamorisse's film Hou says and I translate this from French  It's been fifty years since the original Red Balloon came out but for me it persists like an old spirit. A soul that did not depart but continued on it's journey to contemplate our current world. my translationHou also says again my translation  The red balloon represents what resides in all of us in the form of childhood sensibilities and instinct and passion. And from my point of view the red balloon is me as the director.The red balloon seems to watch over and observe everyone at play from a distance. It tells us that hope and color survive in adverse circumstances. While it does not interact with the characters in this storysave the very first sceneit does interact with us the spectators and has been placed there for us. The red balloon IS us silently bobbing along hovering eavesdropping... It's Hou reminding us that we too can be playful and buoyant  rising above the vicissitudes of life that seem to tie us down. And since the balloon is silent we can supply our own dialog as needed to complete our own story of the flight. Ironically but happily we are captives of Hou's machinations.Hou did not try remake the same film. He paid homage to the original film by making another beautiful film symbolically related to its predecessor. And in doing so he also forced us to ask the question about the place and influence art has in our lives today. This is also a nod to music piano lessons painting Flix Valloton's tableau in the Muse d'Orsay oral folk traditions the revival of puppetry as a valid and precious art form of its own and of course the 7th art Song making a film using her digital movie camera to pay homage to Lamorisse. The intertextuality and the mingling of different cultures is particularly elegant and appropriate given the times we live in today.Using the opposition between dark and light banality and magic pragmatism and innocence adulthood and childhood just like in Flix Vallonton's le ballon from 1899 Hou has created a masterpiece that offers layers of color and texture to the viewer with a patient eye.".

Marc and his girlfriend are tenants of Suzannes but don't pay rent and use her kitchen. Simon takes piano lessons in a piano in Marc's apt. Suzanne has the piano moved upstairs and we hear a long description of injuries one can receive from moving such things. We go on a train ride. There were three things I found of interest in this movie. 1 you use green rather than blue for erasing on a computer. 2 the teacher with the children in the museum was interesting. Can't remember the third so I guess it wasn't so interesting after all. I gave it 2 stars because all of the actors were good but it may have been hard to tell.

Life is not easy as she tries balancing 10 things at once. But isn't that what we all go through? She hires a Chinese film student Fang Song in her film debut to watch her child Simon Simon Iteanu also in his first film.Acclaimed writerdirector Hsiaohsien Hou doesn't bother with plot in this film and I am given to understand that much of the dialog was extemporaneous. It is a credit to Binoche and the others that is gives us a picture of French life.The film is purported to be an homage to Albert Lamorisse's 1956 short The Red Balloon. In this film the balloon floats in and out of the story without apparent contribution to what is going on. It is not the balloon that becomes a friend and companion to the boy but the nanny.It is particularly French  a slow film requiring much patience to appreciate.".

Summer popcorn flicks fill the screen with explosions and action scenes in the hope that no one will notice there's no story. This film uses the same tactic replacing explosions for bright colorful settings.Characters Good movie characters are interesting and relatable. They don't even have to be likable.

We've all gone through times in our life where we we feel nothing is happening in our lives.

Suzanne also provides the voices of the puppets. Suzanne's life is hectic. Besides the theater she has to contend with an absent for two years boyfriend her daughter from a previous marriage subletting tenants who don't pay their rent and the care of her schoolage son Simon. Suzanne hires a young Asian film student Fang Songto watch the boy. Song brings an air of tranquility into Suzanne's and Simon's life and into the movie.Meanwhile in homage to the classic film The Red Balloon a red balloon hovers near Song and Simon as they travel around Paris. In fact Song decides to make a filmwithinafilm featuring Simon and of course a red balloon.Director Hsiaohsien Hou is fascinated by mirrors and glass. Many of the scenes are filmed as reflections or we see the balloon through glass that is also partially reflecting a room or a gallery. Nothing is clearcut or simpleimages and the people they portray are complicated and opaque.Juliette Binoche is one of the most beautiful actors on the screen today. However in this film her hair is dyed blonde and it doesn't enhance her appearance. Her clothes appear to represent whatever she could find quickly in her cluttered apartment and she's not elegant. No director could make Ms. Binoche unattractive but in this movie the emphasis is upon her life not her appearance. Ms. Binoche and Fang Song make a wonderful pair and the people that enter their livespiano tuners furniture movers piano teachers puppet mastersare effortlessly drawn into their orbit.This is a wonderful movie if you don't mind a slow unhurried pace a lack of traditional plot and no explosive climax or lastminute denouement. We join Ms. Binoche's troubled life and Fang Song's quiet life and we get to walk through Paris alongside them.".

Song brings an air of tranquility into Suzanne's and Simon's life and into the movie.Meanwhile in homage to the classic film The Red Balloon a red balloon hovers near Song and Simon as they travel around Paris. In fact Song decides to make a filmwithinafilm featuring Simon and of course a red balloon.Director Hsiaohsien Hou is fascinated by mirrors and glass. Many of the scenes are filmed as reflections or we see the balloon through glass that is also partially reflecting a room or a gallery. Nothing is clearcut or simpleimages and the people they portray are complicated and opaque.Juliette Binoche is one of the most beautiful actors on the screen today. However in this film her hair is dyed blonde and it doesn't enhance her appearance. Her clothes appear to represent whatever she could find quickly in her cluttered apartment and she's not elegant. No director could make Ms. Binoche unattractive but in this movie the emphasis is upon her life not her appearance. Ms. Binoche and Fang Song make a wonderful pair and the people that enter their livespiano tuners furniture movers piano teachers puppet mastersare effortlessly drawn into their orbit.This is a wonderful movie if you don't mind a slow unhurried pace a lack of traditional plot and no explosive climax or lastminute denouement. We join Ms. Binoche's troubled life and Fang Song's quiet life and we get to walk through Paris alongside them.";

The director Schoendorffer was an army cameraman sent to Dien Bien Phu and one of the characters Howard R. Simpson was an US correspondent in Indochina and wrote an interesting book Dien Bien Phu The Epic Battle America Forgot worth to read.Schoendorffer was prisoner after the battle and sent to Vietminh concentration camps where he survived after another cameraman from the Red Army meet him.He is the narrator's voice.What caught first my attention in this movie is that if you were serving in the army it puts you right from the beginning in the atmosphere of a regular soldier spending time in maneuver and camp exercises.Guys on the field some artillery some air force and some shouting in the background.Nothing spectacular absolutely no epic just like you're back in the military.At a certain point mortars fire is increasing and shouting escalating and that's the start of the battle.And you are in the mud bleeding bodies and dead around you.It's just slightly over the level of raw documentary. So it's easy to feel close to the guys on the battlefield.Some Thai volunteers are shown alongside Vietnamese African troops paratroopers legionnaire regular infantry etc.Quite realistic photography and not like in the movies. The Vietminh artillery made landing impossible the place was isolated and only parachutist support is possible. Hills all around it's often cloudy and Vietminh troops keep until the end hidden by their camouflage strategy.Nguyen Giap opted for an intense moving and steady mortar bombing backed by supplies and troops supported by China.Instead of a fierce battle were the tactics of the french general could had been superior.But that's no the point of the movie. Because scenes at the ground depicting the evolution and worsening of the battle are alternated with the situation as seen from Hano. In this part there's a reconstitution of the colonial french time the Vietnamese the Europeans the colorful variety of uniforms. A violinist comes to the city for a gala concert.Life keeps going on at the same pace while in the meantime soldiers are being sacrificed in Dien Bien Phu.A symbolic way to show how the politics were already wanting to leave Indochina but at the same time they wanted a nice exit with military bravery and honors a la legionnaire. The nice violinist lady has a relative who is captain and they meet with other soldiers at a bar where some talks give an insight on the situation and the meaning of the battle which appears more and more like a strategical nonsense.Soldiers are shown doing their job and there's nothing theatrical just few quaint words about military duty's spirit and a somewhat old school sense of bravery.But in the 50's that was still very alive in the french military.So it stays in context. Talks between soldiers are fully understood to people familiar with french army mind and traditions.Otherwise it works like an insight.The movie is somewhat biased as an ode to Indochina and its people itself which is a point of view debatable.Ho Chi Minh was despite being communist an independents and French were foreign rulers.Yet that point of view and the kind of relation of Vietnam to french culture is represented by the boss of the local paper in Hano.All in all an excellent movie even if not accessible to a noninformed public.".

Director Schendorffer was an army cameraman at the actual battle of Dien Bien Phu.The French had been battling the Vietminh since they reclaimed Indochina after World War Two. The Communist crowd were not happy with this idea and started an evergrowing campaign against the French.

We follow their exploits during the final month of the battle. The French Government is not willing to expend any more resources. Several thousand troops are soon trapped after the Reds overrun the surrounding hills. Air support can only do so much and the French positions fall one after the other.There is also a minor side plot with an American newspaper man doing a story on the battle. The man Donald Pleasance seems to spend most of his time drinking and checking out the local gambling establishments. Said establishments are doing a box office business with wagers on when the French garrison will fall.The look of the film is quite good with excellent use of period detail and weapons involved. The pace of the film though is just too slow the jumping back and forth between the battle and back area of Hanoi just does not work.I wanted very much to like this film as I was impressed with the director's other two Vietnam films THE 317th PLATOON and THE ANDERSON PLATOON. This one however just does not make the cut.".

	schema:headline " A haunting and melancolic war epic";
	schema:reviewBody "The film unforgettable opening which switches back and forth between scenes of a concert at the Hanoi Opera and a platoon's last stand against the Vietminh in the dead of the night set the tone for the rest of the movie. This is a slow pace melancolic and factual depiction of the fall of the colonial presence in Indochine in the early 50's. Whilst adopting the perpective of french soldiers the movie never falls into the trap of naive patriotism. Instead it serves as a tribute to the lost lives of french soldiers many of which came from the colonies. The soundtrack is composed by Georges Delerue one of the most famous film composer of this era. He notably composed the score for 'Le Mpris' and in many ways the movie slow and tragic unfolding reminded me of 'Le Mpris' by JL Godard 1963. This is not a film I would recommend to everyone. It is a rare account of a military disaster and of the fall of the french colonial empire a melancolic movie teinted by regrets. Visually the movie is splendid it shows hypnotic battle scenes sometimes taking place in complete silence like shadow play on the theatre of a hill only sparsely lit by bright explosions of mortar. The violence is suggested rather than explicitly shown. The movie makes use of beautiful long shot in order to show the breathtaking scenery where the troops await their fate. In that regard the story succeeds in delivering a looming sense of doom as the viewer is increasingly aware that Dien Bien Phu is forming into a deadly trap for the numerous french troups which have become isolated from the world. There are romantic undertones in the showing of men lost in monumental natural setting against which they are powerless the theatre of french colonisation being swept away by the monsoon and the Vietminh represented as a swift army of shadows. The movie has flaws the length is one of them. Another possible issue people may have with it is the tone which is difficult to pin down at times the movie feels like a documentary and at times an introspective epic. Overall it is better to have some background on french cinema and the Indochine conflict before diving into this one. French films often refuse to deliver a clear message at the end of the movie. This is also the case of this movie and you won't find an obvious moral message here. Instead the movie is about nuance and seems to pride itself in silence and its ghostly atmosphere. If you liked the movie you would probably also enjoy another of Schoendoerffer's work 'Le crabe Tambour' 1976. If you are rebutted by the weight of an epic war drama I would recommend watching Verneuil's 'Un singe en Hiver' 1962 which captures the spirit of that era in a completely different setting and more lighthearted mood.".

	schema:headline " Epic Battle Scenes Make It Memorable";
	schema:reviewBody "The battle Of Dien Bien Phu is one of these battles that became quickly forgotten in military history . It is a battle that should never be forgotten . In an attempt to deal a decisive blow to the nationalist Viet Minh during the French IndoChina war the French forces built a base deep in the hills of IndoChina in 1954 hoping to cut off the VM supply lines and to use the base as an anvil where the Viet Minh would be hammered in to submission . With hindsight the plan was doomed to failure since the French were conducting a not altogether unsuccessful strategy of mobile warfare against the nationalists up till this point . The French also underestimated the Vietnamese ability to carry heavy artillery including anti aircraft guns in to the war zone which considering the French base was totally reliant on air supply led to the disaster that saw 2500 French forces killed in a six week battle  another 11000 captured of which nearly 80 died in Viet Minh captivity and led to France losing the war  the first time a major industrial power lost to a third world nation and set in motion the build up to the cold war confrontation that saw 58000 Americans and 2000000 Vietnamese die in the better known conflict that started 10 years laterThe French IndoChinese conflict isn't one that is often seen on celluloid . I remember in the mid 1980s how popular the American experience Vietnam was in popular Western culture with countless books being published and of course the big Hollywood blockbusters . One of the problems with this is summed up in an interview with the writerdirector of DIEN BIEN PHU Piere Schoendoerffer who stated that there that he had a problem getting the budget to portray the battle and you can see his point since French cinema is depending on how you look at it famous or infamous at making small budget existentialist movies rather than Hollywood style blockbusters Make no mistake this is big budget  epic cinema rarely seen in Europe and many of the battle scenes resemble those seen in the Du Long bridge sequence of APOCALYPSE NOW . The director spent the real life battle as a cameraman so he knows what the conditions were like and it shows . For anyone who has visited the Asian continent during monsoon season they'll realise rain doesn't exist in the Western hemisphere only drizzle and Schoendoerffer gets that right . I have no experience of war in general and the battle of Dien Bien in particular but have no reason to doubt that the battle here is anything less than 100 per cent accurate as each hill is over run and the French defenders realise that the outcome is historical defeat There are a couple of points that do irritate . One is the presence of Donald Pleasence who hasn't a lot to do and his miscasting seems to be included to sell the film to an English speaking market . The second is a sequence where the story cuts back to Hanoi  The fractured storyline keeps cutting back to Dien Bien Phu and Hanoi  where a concert is taking place and a female violin player plays a solo as the picture cross fades to the night time battlefield which brings an arthouse scene where the film certainly didn't require it These are minor flaws in a film that requires to be much better known and it's somewhat sad that so few people have commentated on DIEN BIEN PHU in the English speaking pages of this website . If you like watching war films there's few films showing the horrors of war better . Put this in perspective in ten years of war in Afghanistan it took ten years for NATO to lose 2000 troops . At Dien Bien Phu the French lost that amount in six weeks".

The French also underestimated the Vietnamese ability to carry heavy artillery including anti aircraft guns in to the war zone which considering the French base was totally reliant on air supply led to the disaster that saw 2500 French forces killed in a six week battle  another 11000 captured of which nearly 80 died in Viet Minh captivity and led to France losing the war  the first time a major industrial power lost to a third world nation and set in motion the build up to the cold war confrontation that saw 58000 Americans and 2000000 Vietnamese die in the better known conflict that started 10 years laterThe French IndoChinese conflict isn't one that is often seen on celluloid . I remember in the mid 1980s how popular the American experience Vietnam was in popular Western culture with countless books being published and of course the big Hollywood blockbusters . One of the problems with this is summed up in an interview with the writerdirector of DIEN BIEN PHU Piere Schoendoerffer who stated that there that he had a problem getting the budget to portray the battle and you can see his point since French cinema is depending on how you look at it famous or infamous at making small budget existentialist movies rather than Hollywood style blockbusters Make no mistake this is big budget  epic cinema rarely seen in Europe and many of the battle scenes resemble those seen in the Du Long bridge sequence of APOCALYPSE NOW . The director spent the real life battle as a cameraman so he knows what the conditions were like and it shows . For anyone who has visited the Asian continent during monsoon season they'll realise rain doesn't exist in the Western hemisphere only drizzle and Schoendoerffer gets that right . I have no experience of war in general and the battle of Dien Bien in particular but have no reason to doubt that the battle here is anything less than 100 per cent accurate as each hill is over run and the French defenders realise that the outcome is historical defeat There are a couple of points that do irritate . One is the presence of Donald Pleasence who hasn't a lot to do and his miscasting seems to be included to sell the film to an English speaking market . The second is a sequence where the story cuts back to Hanoi  The fractured storyline keeps cutting back to Dien Bien Phu and Hanoi  where a concert is taking place and a female violin player plays a solo as the picture cross fades to the night time battlefield which brings an arthouse scene where the film certainly didn't require it These are minor flaws in a film that requires to be much better known and it's somewhat sad that so few people have commentated on DIEN BIEN PHU in the English speaking pages of this website . If you like watching war films there's few films showing the horrors of war better . Put this in perspective in ten years of war in Afghanistan it took ten years for NATO to lose 2000 troops . At Dien Bien Phu the French lost that amount in six weeks";

Was the movie bad no doubt but it had every person I showed it to nearly crying in laughter.There are a lot of miscommunication here though. In the English Dubbed version there are numerous name changes. The real original names are followed by the movie namesMonkey Boy  Goku Sparkle  Father Gohan Seito i'm sure thats the name  Bulma Piggy  Oolong Mrs. Knowitall  Puar Lord Horn  Pilaf Mr. Westwood  Yamcha Turtle Man  Master Roshi I can't remember chichi's name but it doesn't matterAnyway there is a good reason the names are translated so poorly. This is Japenese being translated into Chinese. Monkey Boy makes perfect sense. DB is based off of a Chinese legend of a Monkeylike boy named Goku after all. No one really wanted the names to be that dumb but I'm sure there was a good reason for it. The effects are hilariously awful. Strings are very visible. Grenades are nomore than rubber balls. Westwood's sword seems to be rubber lol. The Velcro on Monkey Boy's and Sparkle's outfits are visible. When sparkle is shot out of the well the body is a stationary doll of some sort. When Lord Horn's mouth moves the face seems like it is falling off. When Lord Horn releases the spell on all of the citizens they are all supposed to fall but a whole group of people can be seen standing up looking very confused.The sound effects are also hilarious. It seems as though the production team was running out of money. PacMan noises can be heard everywhere.Anyway I can't really bash this movie. I love it. It is so bad that it can make me laugh just by thinking of it. Every time I think about the bad animations and paper airplane attacks I can't help but crack a smile. I'll give it a 5 on a completely objective point of view. I would give it a 10 because I love it so much.".

	schema:headline " At this point the best ever liveaction adaptation of Dragon Ball";
	schema:reviewBody "I think it's fair to say that by now most of the world knows about DRAGON BALL the actioncomedic anime about the adventures of a dim but noble warrior Goku and the various fighters he encounters and battles. Most probably know that in 2009 there was an American film released DragonBall EVOLUTION that proved to be an utter failure and a sterling example in how to not adapt a cartoon well. But I think not many people know of this film The Magic Begins. Made in Taiwan it was an unofficial adaptation of the series and takes certain liberties the character names are changed one character is changed from a pig to a fat man and a major character gets to live. However it still retains the sense of adventure and humour that made the original work so wonderful and enjoyable which reflects on this film and improves it considerably unlike DBE mentioned above. While generally it's a lighthearted adventure it's got enough serious moments to enhance the danger and risk and thus intensifies the fight between the heroes and villains. I was watching the English dub of this film which additionally gives it an oldstyle kungfu film vibe. If you liked that kind of film you'll enjoy this one as wellThe film needs to be watched in the context of its era which I think improves it considerably. It's a 1980s piece back then feelgood fantasy adventures were very popular at that time as someone from that era I can say this film had a distinct 80s atmosphere. Also back in the 1980s it was common to employ nondigital VFX trick camerawork careful editing and prosthetics are the main effects employed and even though they look painfully obvious today they add a vintage charm to the film and make it look closer to the cartoon it was based on.The cast is fairly standard they overact a little but are mostly reliable in their roles. The Goku actor looks a little feminine but that's a first impression that fades when he starts to kick serious butt. The show stealer is the Master Roshi actor who is so shamelessly funny that he ends up owning every scene he appears in.At this point this is the best ever liveaction adaptation Dragon Ball can get. Until Hollywood can make a decent production treat yourself to this and enjoy yourself!".

Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter.  The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely overportrayed and it seems most of the time anyhow that the film had been 'spedup' to make the characters move faster!  I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too? I understand the cartoon had this but it doesn't work for liveaction. It just looks odd... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors.The English version is horribly dubbed and the character's words do not match the mouths at all.  I would have preffered subtitles but since this is a kids movie and since some kids cannot read well I'll let it go.  But there is something extremely odd about this movie.  It's supposedly a kids movie but there's a lot of material about SEX RAPE and STRIPPING which isn't exactly for young Western audiences.  In the Orient they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted. But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts!  Who was this movie made for anyway?Oh and the special effects are laughable.  You can tell the spaceshiplike things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts or animation I wasn't sure that look unconvincing even to a kid.  The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need.  I didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z.I don't really recommed this movie to anyone.  Kids adults or Dragon Ball Z fans.  It's just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it.  I won't even get into the camerawork... just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes... most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs.  Grainy film quality too.Just all around horrible!!!!".

	schema:headline " Taiwan Comes of Age";
	schema:reviewBody "For those viewers who are rusty on their Taiwanese history Cape No. 7 is a good time a sweet if somewhat angsty love story and an intriguing glimpse into the daytoday life of a Taiwanese town. For those who do know something of Taiwan's history and present international deadlock the film becomes a vocal assertion of selfhood.The amorous tension in the film is between a local Taiwanese boy Aga and a Japanese model Tomoko. Aga has returned home to his small seaside village moody and gruff after failing to make it as a musician in Taipei while Tomoko trying to organize a Japanese pop star's concert at a nearby resort has been tasked with finding locals good enough to form the opening band. A sweet if somewhat skimmedover subplot involves a failed romance set during the aftermath of Japan's occupation of Taiwan in World War II in which a young Japanese teacher writes letters to his Taiwanese beloved as he sails home to Japan. Sixty years later these letters now find their way into the hands of Aga and Tomoko who determine to discover their owner.Both love stories reflect aspects of Taiwan's relationship with Japan at different times in its history. The Japanese teacher deserted his Taiwanese beloved much as the Japanese deserted Taiwan after the war turning over the reigns of their repressive but adept rule to the even more ironfisted Chiang Kaishek. During colonization Japanese cultural systems were forcibly enforced on the island under Chiang's rule Chinese culture was dominant. In both cases local Taiwanese culture was considered secondbest. The movie addresses these issues of abandonment and desire for equality. Aga yearns for recognition of his talent which he finally gets when Tomoko confesses her love and when his music  specifically a traditional Taiwanese ballad  is embraced both by the local villagers and more importantly by the Japanese pop star who says he knows the song. By winning the love of Tomoko and the acknowledgement of the Japanese pop star Aga  and Taiwan  claim equal footing at last.The film can also be seen in light of Taiwan's current condition as a pariah in international relations. As a country formally recognized by only 23 states most of them small islands in the Pacific Taiwan has fought tooth and nail for just minimal acknowledgement from the world community. This year's small victory as an observer in the World Health Assembly which as part of the United Nations has traditionally refused to recognize Taiwan is one such example. Taiwan's lack of global recognition is due in a large part to the influence of China which sees Taiwan as part of its territory. Tellingly Cape No. 7 makes no mention of China or the Chinese influence on the island most of the dialogue is in Taiwanese Japanese or Taiwan guoyu Taiwanese Mandarin. Mandarin Chinese the official language of China becomes the compromise language between Tomoko and the Taiwanese villagers  she snaps at them I can't understand your Taiwanese accent! and they make fun of her saying Who can understand her Chinese? Mandarin although a necessary tool for communicating is a foreign tongue for all of them which illustrates the ambivalent position of China in the world of the film. In real life ties between Taiwan and its Mainland neighbor have thawed rapidly the two now permit direct flights the first in sixty years and economic relations grow closer with each dip of the stock market. China's marginalization in the film however consciously disregards that part of Taiwan's complicated present to explore other aspects of Taiwanese identity  perhaps a way of fighting back against the influence the PRC has increasingly tried to cast over the island.Aside from being a love story that will appeal to the emotionladen teenager in all of us Cape No. 7 is a glimpse into an unvarnished unapologetic Taiwan. From pompous local politics to millet wine and karaoke to betel nuts and motorcycle mail delivery the film throws back the shutters on all aspects of a Taiwanese village. Many of the actors in this production are not professionals and it is the honest tatteredattheedges quality of the scenes that most transports the audience into the world of the film.Cape No. 7 is the comingofage story of a nation. Shot on a shoestring and popularized by word of mouth the film became one of the highest grossing ever to be shown in Taiwan second only to Titanic. It is rare for Taiwanese films to receive much attention in the U.S. but as a confident selfintroduction Cape No. 7 has the potential to be the film that crosses the impasse. And now that Taiwan is coming into its own hopefully this will be the first of many vibrant films to come out of this small but spirited country.".

However that is not to say the movie wasn't creative as it is arguable that there are only 5 stories and seemingly infinite ways to present them.I personally loved the movie. It was touching and admittedly I criedfrom flooding nostalgia of memories past.Because the majority of the movie is based on Taiwanese culture it is definitely a hard one to push internationally especially in the western part of the world.However I felt that a movie like Cape No. 7 was long overdue in Taiwan and believe that it is a first step for Taiwan to take to gain international footing in the movie industry.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really captures the type of local people who live in the Southern parts of Taiwan. The true local people the type who have never left their hometown and the type who have never adapted with the times. For a Taiwanese person this movie will be hilarious it truly shows the older generation characters are being the way most of elders are. The actual foul language in Taiwanese dialect can never really be understood unless you realise how bad these words are and the true meaning of said words and phrases.Some would say this is a romantic comedy for me it was more of just a comedy. The romance seemed little and not massively important to the story. For me the story was about a group of people coming together to create a band which no one would've ever thought possible not the locals and not even the band members themselves. The romance was a side part it wasn't enough to make you feel sorry for the characters or enough to make you want them to be together.In Taiwan this is the biggest movie ever well it certainly seems that way. The Taiwanese rant and rave about it like its the greatest thing since sliced bread there might be many reasons why... Because it truly captures some of the Taiwanese elders perfectly or perhaps because Taiwan makes very few movies. And the other only big movies made in Taiwan are of a sexual nature Tsai Mingliang.Overall I did enjoy this movie but I feel without my knowledge of Mandarin language and Taiwanese Dialect along with my experience of living in Taiwan for a number of years I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much. Without a true understanding of the setting there's no way I would've found even half of the jokes amusing.I think if you know about Taiwanese culture or if you've visited Taiwan you'll enjoy this movie. But if you don't have such knowledge or experiences you might want to pass this movie by as it won't be enough to entertain you for 2hours.".

It is a very well done Taiwanese film which is particularly impressive given its relatively small budget. It's not mindblowing but it is reasonably well executed certainly better than a lot of the crap that is out there. It has a good dose of often local humour and an interesting storyline and several subplots that unfold at a smooth pace. Performances are more than adequate. Cinematography is top notch. On the down side there are a few aspects which lacked attention to detail despite the 2 hour running time some loose ends which weren't tied up and a romance that feels a little more forced than natural. Also some scenes didn't really work. However the Japanese letters which link the film together are beautifully written and definitely add an extra dimension to the overall feel of the experience.

I really tried to enjoy it but found myself hitting the fastforward button from impatience. I've watched some excellent Taiwanese movies and this had to be thrown to the other far end. Poor character development The subcharacters didn't even have their closure screenplay very very poor direction and some very bad acting. The story isn't original although the small seaside town setting is nice plus the focus on the indigenous Taiwanese. I felt the director was really trying to hard to convey multiple story lines across which fell completely flat for me. I don't really understand why the tie in with a mysterious letter from Japan. It made the movie so much more disjointed with the poor direction acting editing etc. Should have just kept it simple.".

I really tried to enjoy it but found myself hitting the fastforward button from impatience. I've watched some excellent Taiwanese movies and this had to be thrown to the other far end. Poor character development The subcharacters didn't even have their closure screenplay very very poor direction and some very bad acting. The story isn't original although the small seaside town setting is nice plus the focus on the indigenous Taiwanese. I felt the director was really trying to hard to convey multiple story lines across which fell completely flat for me. I don't really understand why the tie in with a mysterious letter from Japan. It made the movie so much more disjointed with the poor direction acting editing etc. Should have just kept it simple.";

Taiwan has no Hollywood but for decades until recent years it has produced dozens of movies every year. It's been the hub of Chinesespeaking film making industry and nurtured internationally renowned directors such as Hsiaohsien Hou Edward Yang and of course Ang Lee. That's why it's a surprise to see what the film has achieved because whichever way you look at it it fell short of many high standards set by its predecessors. It's by no means a bad movie though. A warm story executed reasonably well. The elements of romance and certainly music Taiwan's pop music industry is also well developed added to its viewing pleasure. Beautiful photography gives extra charms to the tropical town in the southern tip of the island. Acting wise not overall brilliant but some roles depicting typical local characteristics are particularly lovable. Old Mao is the best example.Perhaps the underlying reason for the film's popularity is something beyond its plot. Taiwan society in recent years has suffered from slow economy isolation from the world as a result of One China Policy and especially the conflict between political parties within the island. People are tired. Tired of struggling to make a living in the big cities and tired of watching confrontations among politics everyday and night on TV. The simple small town lifestyle and goodwilled characters demonstrated in the film remind people of the good old days. For two hours it's like providing an escape for people who have long been trapped or bringing light to people who have long been live in dark. This film will represent Taiwan for the quest of Oscar's best foreign language film. It's not going to win. It's even unlikely to be nominated. But maybe by accident this film has achieved something that makes it bigger than winning prizes  bringing hope to depressed souls!".

	schema:reviewBody "Taiwanese romantic comedy that according to some of the reviews on IMDb is bound to baffle those from other parts in the world. Maybe or maybe not.The plot has a musician named Aga moving to a different part of Taiwan and ending up as postman and then drafted into a rock band that is being put together to help draw people to the local hotel. Its a battle of old ways and new ways with a duel romance tossed in. One is the romance of our hero with the girl named Tomoko and the other is the letters from 1945 that were in a package our hero failed to deliver which kind of mirrors the main characters.Wonderfully acted at times incredibly touching with great music and a bunch of great characters this is very often a magical movie. When its on its great but the film has a couple of hiccups that made me want to grab the director and the screen writer and slap them around.First the film is way too long at 130 minutes. Had the film worked from top to bottom I would have been happy to watch these people for hours but as there were times when I wanted to reach for the remote.The other problem with the film is that the character of Aga doesn't do much. His often inaction affects the romance of the story. He drives around and looks grumpy and kind of interacts with Tomoko and then he's grumpy some more and then he sings and then he looks at Tomoko and she looks at him but there is nothing between them. We never know what our hero is feeling. Its not the actors fault its the way he's written. Until the wedding scene I honestly had no idea who the object of his affection was since nothing was really happening between anyone. Then what happens is so brief that you can't believe that a romance was built out of that. Its kind of a WTF moment and a review for a film called Finding Shangrila in China Daily mentioned the sequence in this film as nonmoment that they feared was going to be repeated in that one. Apparently its not If you take the romance as a given its better then if you wait for something to really happen because it never really does. So much of this movie is off screen that I felt as though there should be another half hour just to explain what we're not seeing.Annoyance aside the film is worth a look. The music is as I said great and it adds much of the emotion that the film is otherwise lacking. And of course there are the characters who may not always be likable but are often well drawn. Its a good film that should have and really could have been better.Worth a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the skimming of the synopsis alone I thought Cape No. 7 bore some resemblance to an upcoming Japanese film The Shonen Merikensack which was featured in the recent Tokyo International Film Festival. Well at least the characters have to come together to form a band and are managed by a lady. And that this film had Japanese elements in it too. But this is a Taiwanese movie and its success back at home being its 1 film of all time has undoubtedly raised the curiosity level as to what actually made this movie tick so much so as to garner numerous nominations in this year's Golden Horse awards.Being Taiwan's submission to next year's Academy Awards to compete in the Foreign Language category this film got no love by the distributorscensors here as it was deemed that the PG rating with 2 badly butchered cuts for coarse language overruled the NC16 version. Granted they would want this to be accessible by most it was nonetheless badly edited and the cuts were quite jarring to say the least. Though the word kan Fword equivalent was uttered loudly it seemed to be OK and passed with no issues. Yes it's in local dialect and even for me the Hokkien language used was unfamiliar and I had to rely on the subtitles to understand the meaning of what was said by various characters from time to time.There are two stories here in Cape No.7. One involves a case of forbidden love between a Japanese man and a Taiwanese woman and his forced separation to return to Japan. On the sea journey he confesses his love through 7 letters hence the title which he never found the courage to deliver them and had them locked away both the letters and emotionally his heart. It was until his demise that his daughter discovered the truth and decided to mail them back to the known address which of course since WWII no longer exists.So the letters get into the hands of main protagonist Aga Van Fan who was a rock band singer in Taipei who failed to make good and returned to his village of Hangchun to become a part time postman. Not knowing where to send those letters to he eventually brings them back with stacks of other letters due to his nonchalant work attitude and got to read the big romantic story contained within. Meanwhile he has to juggle with a band put together by the MayorRepresentative of the town as well as Tomoko Tanaka Chie who is the local coordinator for a big Japanese singer coming to Hengchun and the motley band is to be the opening act.I didn't find much to celebrate in the romantic story as told from within those letters ala The Notebook style. For some reason it failed to move me and I can't see past the clichs within though it got framed from within very luscious cinematography. However it served as an ample backdrop on which to evaluate the relationship between Van and Tomoko now being a Taiwanese man and a Japanese woman the former a struggling musician while the latter after her Taiwan stint has a cushy job waiting for her back in Japan. Given that they started off as loggerheads and slowly developing a liking for each other it doesn't take rocket science to figure out what will happen eventually.But the crux of the movie rested on the shoulders of a typical Japanese ZeroToHero formula and here we have a bunch of misfits who can't play together being forced to team up. Each comes with emotional baggage and plenty of background pathos and here's where the strength of the movie resided in as written and directed by Wei TeSheng They are all likable characters even though they are like everyone else flawed to begin with which makes them easy to identify and sympathize with.We have the drummer Frog Ying Weimin who is a mechanic and harbours an unrequited love for his boss' buxomy wife Rauma MinHsiung an exSWAT Taipei cop now being demoted to a traffic cop in a small town because of his illtemper Malasun Ma Nienhsien who started off as a street smart rice wine salesman before being recruited as bassist a ten year old keyboardist in Dada Joanne who has been kicked out from providing her service in church because of her failure to conform to playing for a boring congregation and last but not least an elderly Gem of the town Old Mao Johnny Lin who struggles to keep up with the rest and having to insist that he gets to play a part in their performance. In fact Johnny Lin steals almost every scene with his fast talking uncouth mouth that you just wait look forward to each of his screen appearances and anticipate with glee when the punchline will be delivered.It's a slice of life of a small Taiwanese town where everyone almost knows everyone else and you can see how certain dynamics between the private and public sector comes into play. In its human story the themes of love and cooperation respect and understanding all come into play and get expressed and it is unlikely anyone will not get swayed by the sincerity and small town charm it exudes throughout. And as for building up to the final act it's something that doesn't disappoint or find a need to summarize or opting for a cop out. It delivered where it mattered and finished off very strongly.Cape No 7 earns a recommended tag from me and it's as feel good as you can get about a film and its wonderful themes. It's no wonder already why and how this film would make Taiwan and of course the town of Hengchun a tourist attraction already.".

Meanwhile he has to juggle with a band put together by the MayorRepresentative of the town as well as Tomoko Tanaka Chie who is the local coordinator for a big Japanese singer coming to Hengchun and the motley band is to be the opening act.I didn't find much to celebrate in the romantic story as told from within those letters ala The Notebook style. For some reason it failed to move me and I can't see past the clichs within though it got framed from within very luscious cinematography. However it served as an ample backdrop on which to evaluate the relationship between Van and Tomoko now being a Taiwanese man and a Japanese woman the former a struggling musician while the latter after her Taiwan stint has a cushy job waiting for her back in Japan. Given that they started off as loggerheads and slowly developing a liking for each other it doesn't take rocket science to figure out what will happen eventually.But the crux of the movie rested on the shoulders of a typical Japanese ZeroToHero formula and here we have a bunch of misfits who can't play together being forced to team up. Each comes with emotional baggage and plenty of background pathos and here's where the strength of the movie resided in as written and directed by Wei TeSheng They are all likable characters even though they are like everyone else flawed to begin with which makes them easy to identify and sympathize with.We have the drummer Frog Ying Weimin who is a mechanic and harbours an unrequited love for his boss' buxomy wife Rauma MinHsiung an exSWAT Taipei cop now being demoted to a traffic cop in a small town because of his illtemper Malasun Ma Nienhsien who started off as a street smart rice wine salesman before being recruited as bassist a ten year old keyboardist in Dada Joanne who has been kicked out from providing her service in church because of her failure to conform to playing for a boring congregation and last but not least an elderly Gem of the town Old Mao Johnny Lin who struggles to keep up with the rest and having to insist that he gets to play a part in their performance. In fact Johnny Lin steals almost every scene with his fast talking uncouth mouth that you just wait look forward to each of his screen appearances and anticipate with glee when the punchline will be delivered.It's a slice of life of a small Taiwanese town where everyone almost knows everyone else and you can see how certain dynamics between the private and public sector comes into play. In its human story the themes of love and cooperation respect and understanding all come into play and get expressed and it is unlikely anyone will not get swayed by the sincerity and small town charm it exudes throughout. And as for building up to the final act it's something that doesn't disappoint or find a need to summarize or opting for a cop out. It delivered where it mattered and finished off very strongly.Cape No 7 earns a recommended tag from me and it's as feel good as you can get about a film and its wonderful themes. It's no wonder already why and how this film would make Taiwan and of course the town of Hengchun a tourist attraction already.";

To the general audience outside Taiwan this movie's appeal comes from its affecting story of a group musical oddball underdog a proliferation of likable characters from pop superstar to humble little people and a duo of parallel love stories which reminds me strangely of Possession 2002 an unlikely yet plausible comparison.I'll start from the end. While people may have different view on whether Cape no. 7 is sufficiently engaging throughout its entire 129 minutes of running time the vote seems unanimous that the last 15 minutes is a climatic finale well worth waiting for. By that time the audience would have developed a firm empathy with some or likely all of the members of the local a quaint little resort town by the ocean in the south of Taiwan band assembled in a most haphazard fashion to do the warmup for a visiting Japanese pop super star. With a recruiting process that reminds you of The magnificent seven and training process that reminds you of Dirty dozen the final rock band that is supposed to showcase local talent comprises all kinds of odd ball characters imaginable and indeed unimaginable  from a preteen little girl as cool as cucumber at key board and an 80yearold man who deficient in his attempt to learn the bass guitar sneaks up with his tradition Chinese instrument the fullmoon referring to the shape lute that blends surprisingly well with the pop group. What the climatic finale reminds me of is another concert scene at the end of a Japanese movie called Yomigaeri or Resurrection.The lead of the band is a talented pop musician Aga who failing to get his break gives up on music and works as a postman. The audience however knows where his heart is seeing his fingering the string that ties a parcel as if it were a guitar string. The love story is of course his and one that takes a format that always works  a relationship that starts as a fight. The girl is a Japanese wannabe model who ending up being an organizercumPRperson for the concert gets stuck in this forsaking place. Two unhappy people throw in a situation with endless potential for conflict generates ample comic scene that eventually leads to romance. Parallel to this is a love story told through letters written by an old man who recently died in Japan and now sent by his daughter to an unknown address which Aga has to deliver too.I started by mentioning three things that will appeal to the general audience. In addition to the music and the love story there are so many characters in this movie that it will take a few pages to describe them all. Many of them have their own stories and even those of whom we know very little generate interests in their own various ways. And there is no villain in this movie.This is huge crowd pleaser that has something for almost everybody. To me it's the rapport between the members of the band and their final coming together to make exhilarating music.".

From crudely unsleek Tony Montana to Kitano's too cool for school gangsters our fondness for these rebels who live on the outer ring of rulesfollowing society stem from our own yearning to break free of authoritative constraints. In 'Monga' directed by actordirector Doze Niu a young man named 'Mosquito' falls in with the wrong company and like us is drawn into a love affair with all things explicitly illegal. Set in the 80's there's a feeling of gleeful reminiscence when watching this. Violence and backstabbings occur like bees drawn to honeypregnant flowers as with all secret societies but it is all done with such a sentimentalized romanticized gloss that it came across as refreshing as a glass of lemonade on a scorching day. We feel special mention should be given to Ethan Yuan. He plays 'Monk' with such conviction and heartbreaking vulnerability we felt he anchored the whole movie with his presence. Similarly its impressive cinematography and direction gets a shoutout too.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the stunning What On Earth Have I Done Wrong? the second film by the persistent directoractor Niu ChengZeaka Doze Niu has finally been released under expectations. Besides the attractions of the new generation actorsidols Juan ChingTien and Zhao YouTingaka Mark Zhao everyone was also expecting if this will be better than Cape No. 7 the Taiwanese box office miracle back in 2008. From the first day box office record it was helped by the success of Cape. As for the film itself it's so much better than Cape. The story begins from a nonMinnanese teenager who was raised in a single parent family and had no friends faced the embrace of the Prince Gang an inheritor of a major local gang he of course couldn't resist the eagerness of getting recognized. But the best of youth also came to the inevitable testament of humanity.Before I saw the film I couldn't help wondering if this will have the shadow of I Vitelloni by Fellini or the look of Goodfellas by Fellini's follower Scorsese or even the glamour of City of God by the Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles. When it comes to the violent scenes the way Niu used the slow motions and soft instrumental score reminds me of Scorsese's romantic sentiment. I could also tell he was trying to avoid any too artistic presentation. With the outstanding editing it was very intense with the length of 140min. It inherited the deep observation of Taiwanese gangsters by Hou HsiouHsien and Chang TsoChi but also gives it a new look for the audience to get close to more easily.Though it's not perfect the plot came out of Niu's thinking direction makes it more reasonable than any other new Taiwanese films. The desire for friendships of the accepted boy Mosquito led him to be the most loyal member in the gang. He was too innocent to see the fragility of humanity. Monk who was considered the smartest one could only be trapped in a fate of religious superstitions. His value of loyalty due to one single false judgment and the raised anger of vengeance has been pushed to the edge of his reason with the paradox in his heart. To decrease the strong masculine of a gangster piece Niu added the young prostitute who made Mosquito know what love is. This blended a sense of tenderness into the film smartly.Comparing to saying it has the romanticism of Goodfellas it's in fact closer to the tragedy of the conflict between idealism and realism we see in Infernal Affairs and the remake The Departed. It's not told from a first person unlike most Scorsese works but from the upgraded multiple point of views such as The Departed. More strictly defined Mosquito and Monk like Tony Leung and Andy Lau DiCaprio and Damon are the two narrators of the story. But shamefully the characters lack of the quality of more vivid or heartfelt which they could've been despite of the enough backgrounds and motivations and the natural twists and truths. While being so it's still a film that represents the period and culture in Taiwan truthfully. It is unique and has the unique feeling that only Taiwanese audience can connect to.Sandee Chan's music leads the atmosphere successfully. It even has a slight epic feeling of The Godfather and a slight sharpness of City of God. With also the quality guaranteed sound processing by the national treasure Tu DuChe the performance of sound in the film really reached an international standard. Niu selected a hit at the time Making Love Out of Nothing At All by Air Supply especially to describe the time Mosquito and the young prostitute spent together. It also added up a bit of cute and retro cheesiness. The big space for the two leading actors to interpret also made them the promising candidates for the yearend's Golden Horse Awards. This film can also be seen as the unity of Taiwanese filmmakers such as an awardwinning actor from Cape No. 7 the producer of Orz Boyz and even the director of Winds of September who joined as an assistant director with his crew. It all shows another Taiwanese Cinema New Wave has officially been set off.".

Firstly Dragon Lee looks very much like Tom Cruise and if you have Tom Cruise as one of your lead gangsters let alone in a Taiwanese film then I have to say it's bad casting. Second thing that bothers me see the alternation between Taiwanese and Chinese being spoken by them. I have friends who speak Taiwanese only among each other and no they do not alternate between Chinese let alone gangsters in the 80's with proud Taiwanese heritage. Thirdly Monga is too clean and nice in the movie. In reality many parts of Monga is a seedy place with many sketchy people and teenagers. There are much trash on the ground rundown houses... but in the film there isn't much portrayal of the seediness and grittiness of the area. I can't feel the Monga that I knew in this movie. And that's the problem with commercial movies in Taiwan where everything is just a bit too sanitized English song played in the background please.This film lacks a bit of realism. The violence is there and the older gangsters do looked more real but overall it could be better. It's nice to see the Taiwanese film industry begin to revive slowly but I wish commercialism won't destroy this movement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Monga is set in the 1980s and it's a tale of two halves the first of which is strikingly similar to The Days being in a school setting and setting the scene with the recruitment of a newbie into the ranks of a group of street punks who call themselves The Prince Gang. Narrated by main protagonist nicknamed Mosquito Mark Chao a teenager with no friends and often a target for bullies he soon finds the enticement of belonging to a group who swears loyalty amongst their ranks giving him a shot into the dark side through an initiation rite that involves roughing up one's enemy. Typical modus operandi employed to get a newbie down the slippery slope of gangsterism where first you win his impression respect and loyalty then he fights for all his brothers.But of course the Prince Gang is more than just a start up racket with their defacto leader Dragon Lee Rhydian Vaughan being the only son of Monga's Temple Front triad. We're soon introduced to the rest of Prince's crew which includes the intelligent and brooding Monk Ethan Ruan the cowardly APo and fighter Monkey. We're told of the team's dynamics and how Mosquito soon finds himself a loyal member of the group who spend most of their time playing truant to while away at their hideout or to visit prostitutes where Mosquito soon falls for a hooker with a large facial birthmark Ko Chia Yen beginning a romantic subplot that's tender enough not to get in the way of the main narrative.The first half of the film puts the spotlight on the shenanigans of this youthful group as they go around squandering their lives away from school and into fights. Unlike Crows Zero where schoolboys trounce each other with far out powers the fights here is almost balletic in delivery and serves as quite the highlight especially with their kill or be killed mantra. Like a cautionary tale it tells of how impressionable teenagers can be especially when showed with much needed attention and gifts which comes with the pricetag of eternal loyalty.Loyalty though seems like a dirty word however especially when there's always that temptation and rationale of serving selfinterest first or when it boils down to a family matter where real kin blood runs thicker than water or even brotherhood. It's a walkthrough the Monga ecosystem where we learn of the various turfs set and how scary the gangsters with real powers can be being seemingly everyday persons on the streets and quite nonchalant about their position as gangster chiefs though coming complete with uncouth vulgar vocabulary to betray their calm business fronts.Just as we're getting comfortable and chummy with the Prince Gang the narrative turns on its head as it enters a darker phase in the run up to the finale with a boot camp for martial arts training in various Chinese weapons being the middle point where boys are trained to become men of war. Everything becomes more serious as Prince Gang unfortunately gets woken up to inevitable reality and while faced with a potential internal strife things don't look all too sunny at Monga with the advent of the Mainland Chinese gangsters who are salivating at a hostile takeover.It is here that Doze Niu himself comes to the forefront as Crazy Wolf from the Mainland up against the established Monga powers such as Boss Geta played by Ma Ju Lung both actors putting up powerful riveting veteran performances in contrast to the teen idols Ethan Juan and Mark Chao who do hold their own but certainly the gulf in charisma is obvious. The latter half becomes a commentary on the fear of change of being inside a comfort zone that any threat to change the status quo is a declaration of an all out no holds barred war. It's almost akin to any situation where the incumbent almost always feel threatened by change and to put it into our own topical context how we rationalize our fears toward new immigrants into our land who inevitably shake up what we hold dear and some having total disregard to what has preceded but to want to stamp their own brand of the way things get done.It is this half that examines what loyalty really means whether lip service or something to be carried out with honour and the narrative spins into a hydra of subplots all of which will get addressed as the film races toward the end with plenty of urgency and closure. You'll be kept glued to the screen for the most parts of its extended narrative which encompassed plenty of themes and ideas and the characterization here will definitely make you feel something for all the characters making you care whether they live through their ordeal or not which is telling of the strength of the story and storytellers involved. And I'll say it again the fight scenes here are stylishly filmed complete with blood and gore and with fluidity love those one take sweeping camera motion even though we have to suffer the unceremonious censor scissors every now and then for this NC16 rated film.To the local audience you may already be familiar with gangster flicks such as The Days from last year. Monga though makes that look like child's play and the Crows Zero films really look too out of this world given Monga's ultrarealistic setting. If gangster flicks are up your alley then don't let this one pass you by as it's highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Monga";
	schema:reviewBody "Monga is directed by Niu Chenze from Taiwan in 2010. This film is based on the mid1980s in Taiwan as a background. The film related to five young teenagers who just out of school and the experiences of entry the gangsterdom heishehui. The entire film revolves around brotherhood interests fight and conspiracy to develop the story plot. The genre of this film is drama. The story start in Taiwan that a place called Manga. A young boy Zhouyiwen or mosquito he was a timidity and kind boy he has been bullied by others since he was little. He has not a father. Because of a drumstick he met a several young people who living the gangster life. Also because of a drumstick he began his gangster life. They set up a group called Prince Gang. They often fight on the street visits brothel and receive protection fees from others. As result of Li Zhilong's father Geta is a boss of Temple Front no one can bully them. As the resentment of elder they involved in that. Conflict and betrayal leads to them killing each other finally.I want to analyze two character mosquito and Heshang.The lead character after met his four buddies and he thought his life has meaningful suddenly. He thought they save his soul and brought a new world for him. In the film there are have a one scene that is when they climbed the wall and play truant go to outside mosquito looked back and without hesitation to jumped the wall. I t seems tell us he wants to say goodbye to his past. This is my favorite place. He just knows the brotherhood is very important to him. He thought His buddies like his brother. Because of them his life was becoming exciting even leave school he felt not matter. They protected him at school and celebrate his birthday. They help each other they together do everything. All this he was deeply moved by them. Compared with them he is more innocent and kind. He is more like a follower. Just like the lines of film the grass flutters in the same direction as the wind blows. From this movie we can clearly see that mosquito aspires to paternal love. He was very envy Zhilong has a good father he saw zhilong with his father sang a song together affectionate he was touched by this scene. He cried he hopes he was Zhilong and Geta was his father. Actually in his heart he has been thought Geta was his father. At the Temple Front he saw Geta lying in the pool of blood he was collapsed. After Geta dead he replaced Zhilong attended the funeral. These evidences reflect mosquito was much respected Geta although his emotion was humble. He fell in love with Xiaoning a hooker he thought he could tell everything to Xiaoning. Particularly he discovered the real gangster life is terrible and the cruel ways of punish to others lead to him felt fear and thought of her as refuge.The other lead character Heshang he was clever he and Zhilong grew up together  they have exceeded the feelings between brothers. He knew his father's hand was cut off by Geta he decided to revenged. At the same time his heart was extremely contradictory. In the movie when he found the missing Zhilong he embraced him tightly and he recalled the picture that he killed the Geta. He burst into tears loudly. He was much regretted. All the remorse in his mind is vent out in this moment. In the film's final he chose to believe mosquito. Like mosquito said you thought you goof the gangster life in fact you goof the friendship and brotherhood.

	onyx:emotionText "Monga is directed by Niu Chenze from Taiwan in 2010. This film is based on the mid1980s in Taiwan as a background. The film related to five young teenagers who just out of school and the experiences of entry the gangsterdom heishehui. The entire film revolves around brotherhood interests fight and conspiracy to develop the story plot. The genre of this film is drama. The story start in Taiwan that a place called Manga. A young boy Zhouyiwen or mosquito he was a timidity and kind boy he has been bullied by others since he was little. He has not a father. Because of a drumstick he met a several young people who living the gangster life. Also because of a drumstick he began his gangster life. They set up a group called Prince Gang. They often fight on the street visits brothel and receive protection fees from others. As result of Li Zhilong's father Geta is a boss of Temple Front no one can bully them. As the resentment of elder they involved in that. Conflict and betrayal leads to them killing each other finally.I want to analyze two character mosquito and Heshang.The lead character after met his four buddies and he thought his life has meaningful suddenly. He thought they save his soul and brought a new world for him. In the film there are have a one scene that is when they climbed the wall and play truant go to outside mosquito looked back and without hesitation to jumped the wall. I t seems tell us he wants to say goodbye to his past. This is my favorite place. He just knows the brotherhood is very important to him. He thought His buddies like his brother. Because of them his life was becoming exciting even leave school he felt not matter. They protected him at school and celebrate his birthday. They help each other they together do everything. All this he was deeply moved by them. Compared with them he is more innocent and kind. He is more like a follower. Just like the lines of film the grass flutters in the same direction as the wind blows. From this movie we can clearly see that mosquito aspires to paternal love. He was very envy Zhilong has a good father he saw zhilong with his father sang a song together affectionate he was touched by this scene. He cried he hopes he was Zhilong and Geta was his father. Actually in his heart he has been thought Geta was his father. At the Temple Front he saw Geta lying in the pool of blood he was collapsed. After Geta dead he replaced Zhilong attended the funeral. These evidences reflect mosquito was much respected Geta although his emotion was humble. He fell in love with Xiaoning a hooker he thought he could tell everything to Xiaoning. Particularly he discovered the real gangster life is terrible and the cruel ways of punish to others lead to him felt fear and thought of her as refuge.The other lead character Heshang he was clever he and Zhilong grew up together  they have exceeded the feelings between brothers. He knew his father's hand was cut off by Geta he decided to revenged. At the same time his heart was extremely contradictory. In the movie when he found the missing Zhilong he embraced him tightly and he recalled the picture that he killed the Geta. He burst into tears loudly. He was much regretted. All the remorse in his mind is vent out in this moment. In the film's final he chose to believe mosquito. Like mosquito said you thought you goof the gangster life in fact you goof the friendship and brotherhood. In fact all of them are not had gangster life they trust each other and not leave each other. Heshang's confusion helplessness sadness and contradiction also are represents the other four. In this film there are two lines repeated several times. I only heard of brotherhood never heard of meaning. And If you don't killed them up today once day you'll be killed.

But the showstopper without any doubt is Ethan Ruan who won a coveted BEST LEADING ACTOR trophy in the Golden Horse Awards which is the most prestigious recognition from panChinese cinema. His endeavor impresses with both physical exertion and copious pathos. In the main MONGA breezes a bracing air into the teengangster genre which usually entails a veto of a mainland China release due to its unlawful subjects and subsists its ethnographic mark remarkably.".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED in February 2010 the epicstyled Monga became a runaway hit in Taiwan grossing US1.6 million in its first week. Its success in Taiwan should be obvious. Besides the historical interest in its locale the Wanhua district of Taipei there is the attraction of its young and hot cast of TV stars like Ethan Juan Mark Chao and the Tom Cruise lookalike Rhydian Vaughan.Needless to say Monga's success gives fresh hope to starting a 'new wave' in Taiwan's film industry. Elsewhere however it has to compete with the more vibrant and bettermade Hong Kong gangster efforts  and the differences and weaknesses may be glaring.Set in the 80s high school student Mosquito Mark Chao explains at the start that he became a gangster because of a chicken leg. The chicken leg was his lunch and when a bully snatched it away from him the socalled Prince Gang led by Dragon Lee Vaughan intervenes  and recruits him into the 'brotherhood of five'  with Monk Ethan Juan Monkey and APo. The boys get along reasonably well with their elders the Temple Front triad led by Dragon's dad Geta Ma Julung.The gang's youthful skirmishes and street fights soon develop into a more sinister conflict when mainland gangsters like Gray Wolf played by director Doze Nui himself try to muscle into Monga with guns  considered cowardly weapons by the locals. With a power struggle in the cards conspiracies and betrayal follow. Will friendship triumph over greed and power? The comingofage story may seem clichd but it has enough twists and turns to sustain our interest. Director Niu has developed Mosquito's character as a fatherless kid brought up by his hairsalon owner mother well enough to get our sympathy even though some of the subplots may be rather incredible. A case in point is his platonic relationship with a young prostitute Ko Chiayen that seems a bit badly contrived. Also the camera work on the Monga locations looks good at least to nonTaipeh residents and the lapses into Hokkein dialect lend a touch of reality to the film although it can be irritating to some.What I dislike most about the movie is the slow and draggy narrative  with repetitious bonding scenes taking nearly twoandahalf hours to unfold a story that should be familiar to fans of gang flicks about brotherhood and betrayal. Indeed compared to Western and HK films the action here is mighty tame. Actingwise Chao and Vaughan appear rather wooden but Juan provides a powerful account of himself. Niu is also convincing as the mysterious old flame of Mosquito's mother and newcomer to the district.Verdict Promising but not compelling.  LIM CHANG MOH limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

After hearing so much about it I had to go see it... and it was quite good. I have to honestly say I wasn't really expecting too much based on Taiwanese films I'd seen before disclaimer I actually haven't seen very much but this one is very well made has a great story and the actors are pretty hot... Takeshi Kaneshiro watch out!In short it's about a place called Monga which I have learned was a port where many mainlanders entered Taiwan from back in the day. In this film the story takes place in the '70s and '80s and is about a group of friends part of the Temple Front gang. The narrator of the story Mosquito Mark Chao is invited to be a part of the gang after a silly fight with members of another gang the Back Alley. Mosquito has grown up without a father and has never had any real friends so after Monk Ethan Ruan and the others take him under their wing he fully embraces the new lifestyle and there's no turning back. The story has a number of heartwrenching twists and while it is a drama there's also a lot of humor which I loved. In the end it all comes down to the characters trying to balance the harsh realities of a violent gangster life with the honor of friendship and brotherhood.I have no idea when the film will be hitting the U.S. but it has a promising future as it's totally something fresh out of the Taiwanese film industry. As they would say in Taiwan this film is  hong or red... meaning it's hot!Overall thoughts Strong acting engaging story and a good film to watch with a group of friends!".

But they're in a class of their own when it comes to atmosphere.The most famous and popular of these fairy tale movies is Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella a brilliant merger of Allerleihrauh and Cinderella. Its star Libuse Safrankova is a recurring face in Czech fairy tale movies  and one that seemed to ensure movie magic was about to take place. I suppose she was many a German boy's first movie crush Usually cast as princess or heroine this is the only fairy tale where I've ever seen her play an ambiguous character.Then again it is also the only of the fairy tale movies where having just watched it I am not sure what I've actually seen. I have seen this movie once before when I was very young. I remember feeling strangely elated bedazzled and awed by the film and liking it more even than Three Hazelnuts. Unfortunately we'd neglected to record it on VCR so it's been twenty years before I'd see it again.Having just seen it I am strangely elated bedazzled and awed. With a deep sense of magic and fairy tale atmosphere and characters this movie manages to tell me a story that resonates but without repeating a story previously told. There are elements from many different tales but I cannot identify any single one as the primary influence. According to the credits it is a story by K J Erben that was adapted  I am now wondering how I could get my hands on a translation of his work A prince goes out to find a princess and never returns. His parents slowly descend into morose unhappiness. Then visiting gypsies perform a prophecy is made and the queen has twin sons who grow seven times faster than normal children. They grow up  and discover the secrets of their unmentioned brother...There is a lot of mystery in the plot. Like many written fairy tales it springs surprises on you that you would not expect. Sometimes the narrator gives a lot away and sometimes nothing at all. Sometimes you know which character is on screen and sometimes you wonder. The movie works its way along unexpected and winding paths towards a finale that is almost indecipherable thanks to editing and direction. And yet despite the mystery despite the unexpected plot turns despite sometimes intrusive narration the movie is a gem. In a way it's almost because of the asymmetries of the plot the asymmetries of the resolutions and the unexpected ambiguities that the film is so magnificent.Perhaps it is accidental and perhaps others watch the film and find it alienating or even amateurish  but to me the film seems as if it takes fairy tale magic and turns it into something truly artful. There are edges there are distortions of tales we've previously seen and heard there are questions unanswered by the movie and it feels unlike any fairy tale I've ever seen on screen. Characters may not all be three dimensional but they are ambiguous  and the ambiguity really enriches the movie.It is magnificent. It is quite possibly the best fairy tale movie ever made.".

The sequence with Ives and Newman in the basement of the house remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a very appropriate title.

Burl Ives's Big Daddy is larger than life insensitive domineering selfabsorbed. Ives is on every moment. And every moment is true.Paul Newman's Brick is as afraid of life as Big Daddy is in love with it. Yet in his way he's a chip off the old block  selfabsorbed insensitive.And domineering or as Big Daddy and Maggie would have it masterful ready to take charge if he could just get over himself.I confess I don't care for Elizabeth Taylor as an actress but she is so right for the part that I can't think of anyone else to fill it. Anyway who else has eyes that could compete with Newman's? Judith Anderson plays the typical Williams matron living in her house of delusions. She's Big Daddy's tormented desperately lonely unloved partner who towards the end wins Big Daddy with her nobility and devotion.The underappreciated Jack Carter has the unenviable role of Brick's pliant conformist brother Gooper decent at heart but worn out after years of jumping through Big Daddy's hoops and still winding up on the short end with a house full of brats bred at Big Daddy's presumed bidding and delivered by a scheming ambitious weasel of a wife. Gooper the only character I have a little trouble with because his climactic speech as rendered by Carter is so heartfelt that we are aggrieved with him at the injustice of Big Daddy's favoritism for the noaccount but aesthetically more pleasing Brick.Perhaps an even more unenviable role is that of Gooper's wife played to perfection by Madeleine Sherwood. Anyone who has grown up in the South has known Sister Woman. I can assure those who haven't that this character is not a stereotype or caricature.There are a few quibbles. One character the family doctor though played well by Larry Gates has a dramatic function that's about as useful as the referee in a pro wrestling match but not nearly as decorative. I guess he's included to provide plot information but I think it could have been provided just as well without him. I was also put off by the contrived thunder claps at dramatic moments. Then there were some continuity problems such as different facial expression when shot angles were changed and Gooper's too many Shut ups to Sister Woman.If as another reviewer has said Tennessee Williams hated this film then it couldn't have been because it was untrue to his work. If he disliked the changes and omissions he should blame '50s prudishness not the film for dictating say the suppression of Brick's homosexuality. Williams wrote about lies and delusions the good ones and bad ones. Well that's what Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Streetcar Named Desire and Glass Menagerie were all about. Tennessee Williams's stories about the South and its culture of delusion are not just rebukes of Southern hypocrisy and bloodymindedness but paeans to the gentle and genteel refuge which delusion provides. As Maggie The Cat says Truth truth  everybody keeps hollerin' about the truth. Well the truth is as dirty as lies.Finally I think it was brilliant of Richard Brooks to insist on color for Williams's stuff is talky and with the drabness of a typical Williams set this can be a bit oppressive. With color and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended I think he has given us something just as fine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been made of the differences between Tennessee Williams' play and this filmthe homoerotic themes have been driven further into subtext though not eliminated entirely and a more upbeat ending was added.  The changes were necessary when the film was made although theater and literary purists decry the sanitizing or censorship of plays when they are adapted for the screen in some cases such as this one the changes can improve the work in question.  Cat on film is clearer for one thing.  Tennessee Williams plays tend to be cluttered in their original form.  They are also cynically downbeat if that type of story appeals to one this adaptation might be offputting.    As with all theatrical adaptations many of the scenes are excessively talky especially the BrickBig Daddy scenes in the second act.  Some of the highlights are just as wordy but thoroughly enjoyable rather than tedious especially Maggie's story about Mae's reign as Cotton Carnival Queen and the entire scene in the basement.  All of the performances are excellent though Paul Newman as Brick is less flashy it's not really until the basement scene that one feels his talent is given a workout.  Elizabeth Taylor is an emotional rollercoaster venturing from flirtatious to hectoring to wheedling to calm to grasping to tender often within a single scene and yet she never slips the rails.  Watching films from this period her career peak one wonders what happened to turn her into the vague blearyeyed woman we see today.  Judith Anderson's Big Mama is loud coarse and bossy but completely sympathetic both in the scene with the birthday cake and in the confrontation scene at the end.  When Big Daddy invites her along with him at the end it is every bit as welcome to the viewer as it is to her.  Burl Ives is the most towering of all the emotional growth in the film is as much his as it is Brick's.  Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood are every bit as good despite being relegated to comic relief at times.    My favorite aspect of this story however is the social dynamic.  Brick and Maggie are spoiled young beautiful people who have yet to take on any responsibility while Gooper and Mae are the epitome of a serious young family.  Brick is an alcoholic former football player while Gooper is a corporate lawyer.  Despite these obvious differences however both their parents and the audience and Tennessee Williams obviously clearly prefer Brick and Maggie.  Every aspect of Gooper and Mae's personalities even those which bespeak traditional values are portrayed as petty and unimaginative.  Even if one believes that Gooper and Mae have done all the right things they have done them for the wrong reasons. Thus the theme of the story is most clearly presented  all that is important is to love and to express that love.".

	schema:headline " A powerful Burl Ives livens up a simple story";
	schema:reviewBody "The best thing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof has going for it is one truly remarkable acting performance. And that performance comes from neither Elizabeth Taylor nor Paul Newman. There's nothing wrong with the work turned in by Taylor and Newman they are both perfectly fine in their roles. And it is their characters who are the focus for most of the film. But late on in the proceedings Burl Ives grabs hold of the film and makes it his own. Ives turns in a performance which is so strong and powerful that it threatens to overshadow and overwhelm everything else in the film. However it is rather difficult to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman. And the film's rather simple story is certainly compelling enough so as not to be overwhelmed by the Ives tour de force near the end. So while Ives may end up being the most memorable thing the film has to offer he is certainly not the only memorable thing. His great performance is merely the best part of what is an overall thoroughly satisfying film.The film's simple story centers around a day in the life of a wealthy Southern family. With this family the key word is mendacity. What does that even mean? Any of our characters who initially don't know about mendacity surely will by the time the story plays itself out. As we meet them everyone has come together to celebrate the 65th birthday of family patriarch Big Daddy. Initially it seems the film is about Big Daddy's son Brick and his wife Maggie the Cat. Brick and Maggie are not currently in the throes of wedded bliss. To say their relationship is strained would be putting it mildly. The fact that alcohol seems to be the only thing in life Brick is at all interested in probably does not help matters. But as the film progresses we see there is a larger issue than Brick and Maggie's troubled marriage. Big Daddy is dying. And nobody not his family and not his doctors has the guts to tell him. This will ultimately play itself out in powerful heartrending fashion.For much of the film's running time you would call it compelling but certainly not spectacular. But then Ives as Big Daddy grabs the film by its throat and shakes some real life into it. There's a scene where Ives as Big Daddy and Newman as Brick are alone in a basement which simply could not have been performed any better. There's so much these characters have to say to one another. The emotion is raw and the scene is so powerful. It hits you right in the heart. Just this one scene alone with these two great actors elevates the film all by itself. Newman is terrific. Ives is astounding. Perhaps it is in fact possible to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor. Maybe just this once. Maggie the Cat is an intriguing character in her own right and Taylor certainly doesn't disappoint in the role. But it turns out that ultimately the film is really about the relationship between Brick and his father not Brick and his wife. And as such it is Newman and most especially Ives who you will most remember. It is their work which transforms a good movie into something truly memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sultry and downbeat this Richard Brooks directed film is set at a Southern plantation where a dysfunctional family celebrates the 65th birthday of family patriarch Big Daddy Burl Ives a portly man whose health or the lack of it is very much on the minds of all the family members. The story centers on one of Big Daddy's two sons a brooding young man named Brick Paul Newman and his childless wife Maggie Elizabeth Taylor.Brick is reticent and repressed for reasons unknown and finds relief in alcohol. Beautiful Maggie is concerned that Brick's indifference to Big Daddy may cost them their share of the family inheritance at the hands of Brick's brother and scheming sisterinlaw. Adding fuel to the fire is Brick's prepubescent nieces and nephews inyourface brats whom Maggie refers to not kindly as little noneck monsters. Big Momma Judith Anderson just wants Big Daddy to be physically well and for everyone to get along.Of course with a big inheritance on the line tension erupts first between Brick and Maggie then later between them and everyone else. As the tension mounts arguments erupt into a real downhome Southern soap opera.The film's script is heavy on dialogue. But because of the story's thematic depth the issues are interesting and insightful and the script never seems talky. At the heart of the story is the subject of mendacity of lies and not telling the truth. There is considerable emotional pain expressed as anger resentment and sarcasm. The story originated by Tennessee Williams goes against its era in that it contradicts the virtues of traditional family values and capitalism.Casting and acting are quite good. But Burl Ives' performance is wonderful and alone makes the film worth watching. Color cinematography is conventional. It's a slowpaced film with long camera takes. Sets and production design are lavish.Because the dreadful Hays Code censored much of the thematic content in 1958 the film's conclusion is weak and does not justify Brick's emotional state. This is not a criticism of the film but of the Hays Code itself which mercifully was abolished in the 1960s.Dripping with Southern atmosphere and with a sultry jazz score Cat On A Hot Tin Roof is a terrific movie for its thematic value its cast and the splendid performance of Burl Ives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another example of a 1950s stage to screen adaptation in which the entire reason for the play's existence is removed from the screen version in order to placate the censors. Why did people even want to make movies out of plays if they wanted to remove everything that made the plays interesting in the first place? Without the homosexual subtext Cat on a Hot Tin Roof isn't about very much except Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor disliking each other until they do a complete 180 and get it on in the film's final scene. I guess at the time the pairing of two hot actors was enough to get audiences into the theatres but that's not good enough now. This is tepid and bland with uninspired direction and would make anyone wonder why this Tennessee Williams play is considered to be such a classic.There is one reason to see this film though and that's Burl Ives. Newman and Taylor fade into the background and the movie becomes the story of Ives' Big Daddy who gives a fascinating bellicose performance as a dying patriarch desperately in need of a worthy heir to carry on his legacy. With this and The Big Country released the same year Ives had perhaps the best 1958 of any other actor working at the time.Grade C".

Without the homosexual subtext Cat on a Hot Tin Roof isn't about very much except Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor disliking each other until they do a complete 180 and get it on in the film's final scene. I guess at the time the pairing of two hot actors was enough to get audiences into the theatres but that's not good enough now. This is tepid and bland with uninspired direction and would make anyone wonder why this Tennessee Williams play is considered to be such a classic.There is one reason to see this film though and that's Burl Ives. Newman and Taylor fade into the background and the movie becomes the story of Ives' Big Daddy who gives a fascinating bellicose performance as a dying patriarch desperately in need of a worthy heir to carry on his legacy. With this and The Big Country released the same year Ives had perhaps the best 1958 of any other actor working at the time.Grade C";

	schema:reviewBody "The Pollitt family gather to celebrate the 65th birthday of Big Daddy Burl Ives wealthy land owner and cotton merchant. Amongst the group are Big Daddy's wife Ida their eldest son Gooper Jack Carlson Gooper's wife Mae Madeline Sherwood and their five children and the Pollitt's youngest and favourite son Brick Paul Newman and Brick's wife Maggie Elizabeth Taylor.The movie opens with Brick in a drunken stupor attempting to recapture his lost glory days on the athletics track. Unfortunately the only glory he gains is a broken ankle. Brick is a former star footballer who has become a miserable alcoholic. He spends his days in a deep depression hobbling around on his crutch grieving for the death of his best friend Skipper and yearning for the love of his father that he has never had. Brick is so wrapped up in feelings of disgust and sadness he can't even bear to make love to his wife Maggie whom he accuses of seducing and sleeping with Skipper. He lies on the couch swilling whiskey nursing his broken ankle and wounded pride and rejecting Maggie's seductive advances as well as refusing to care about the family quarrelling downstairs.The story really heats up towards the middle of the film. As a thunderstorm erupts outside the gloves come off. Determined to find out the cause of Brick's alcoholism Big Daddy battles Maggie and Brick behind closed doors. Several revelations finally come to the surface. Brick's hatred of himself over losing his best friend and 'crutch' finally bring him out of his emotionless state as he starts to talk about the events leading up to Skipper's death. His deep blue eyes slowly well with tears and his griefravaged face crack through his father's harshness towards him. Big Daddy realises that his son's 'very close and almost obsessive' friendship with Skipper replaced the love that had been denied by his father for so long. During the heated arguing Brick lets it slip that to Big Daddy that he has been lied to about his illness. Stunned with the revelation that he has terminal cancer and he has been lied to Big Daddy wanders off to be alone.Brick searches for Big Daddy to apologise and finds him in the basement where they both have a deep and meaningful talk about their relationship. Father and son then realise how much they need each other. Brick doesn't care about wealth. All he wants is a father not a boss. Both men are physically crippled  Brick with his broken ankle and Big Daddy with cancer. However they become emotional crutches for each other which in turn ease the physical pain. With a new found respect understanding and love for each other father and son help each other up the stairs to face the storm brewing in the living room between the remainder of the family. This particular scene is the strongest and most emotional in the entire movie.The family gather for a 'final confrontation' in the living room. It is uncovered that Gooper and Mae have drawn up papers to try and take Big Daddy's plantation from under him due to his terminal illness. With these revelations out in the open Maggie cunningly takes the opportunity to give her 'birthday present' to Big Daddy. She announces that she is in fact pregnant with Brick's child. Of course Big Daddy knows that it is a lie. But he also knows now that Brick's demons have finally been laid to rest and that his youngest son is ready to take on the responsibility of a family as well as the Pollitt property. He admires Brick for his simple want of love not money. Big Daddy then organises to have his lawyer leave his wealth to Brick.Paul Newman captures the intense depression of Brick really well. For the first half of the movie he is emotionless uncaring and wrapped up in his own world of pity and sadness. Elizabeth Taylor was perfect as the desperate and beautiful Maggie the Cat. She was courageous and powerful. Her performance perfectly bounced off Newman as he expressionlessly thwarted her advances. Both Newman and Taylor are so stunningly beautiful in this movie that they take your breath away.Burl Ives was magnificent. What I loved most about Ives' performance was Big Daddy's ability to be the domineering patriarch but at the same time in his scenes with Brick he allows himself to show that he understands his son's emotional pain and in his facial expressions you can see that he does hurt for the torment that Brick is going through. They are very subtle expressions of tenderness but at the same time they do make an impact on the viewer. Big Daddy's heart does truly break for his son and it is clear that Brick is the favourite. Madeline Sherwood was impeccably cast as Gooper's annoying greedy wife Mae. Her whining yelling and constant sneering at Brick and Maggie's infertile marriage is enough to make you wish Maggie actually did slap her into oblivion. The underrated Jack Carson is Gooper. Judith Anderson plays Big Mamma  the desperate lonely and underappreciated wife.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof takes us back to when the performances of actors were simply enough to draw audience. The story only revolve around family domestics but it keeps the viewer interested and thoughtful until the final scene because of the pain torment and greed of its characters. It was a pleasure to see such wonderful and talented performers at the top of their craft and it is a terrific salute to the way dramatic film should be made.".

Unfortunately Liz was up against Susan Hayward for I Want to Live and nobody was beating Hayward out that year.But Elizabeth Taylor proved something. She was more than just an extraordinarily beautiful woman. That girl had real talent and she proved to be more than a box office name to insure business.In fact of the original Broadway cast only Burl Ives as Big Daddy and Madeleine Sherwood as his other daughter in law were retained for the film version. Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor replaced Ben Gazzara and Barbara Bel Geddes as the leads.Newman also got one of his early triumphs playing Brick Pollitt the favored younger son of Big Daddy Pollitt. Brick's an aimless guy still living out his dreams of glory from being a football player when he was younger. In fact in a drunken stupor he tried some athletic stuff at his former high school and got a broken leg for his troubles. Newman spends the entire film on crutches with Ives berating him for being a 30 year old kid.The Pollitts are one dysfunctional family. They are awaiting the arrival home of the patriarch Burl Ives from a big name hospital and the news ain't good. Ives is dying and it's how the estate is to be divided that's his concern. Older son Jack Carson as Gooper with Sherwood has five kids with another on the way. A thoroughly obnoxious little group of 'noneck monsters' but Southern families do like breeders.Brick on the other hand is making a big show of ignoring Elizabeth Taylor and no normal heterosexual male's going to do that for long. Obviously something is eating him possible infidelity by Liz with his late football buddy Skipper.A whole lot of family skeletons get thrown from the closet before this film is over. Each one of the Pollitts is a deeply flawed human being as Tennessee Williams shows us. Burl Ives as actor was established in this role and in his role in The Big Country for which he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. 1958 was that man's career year on screen. Big Daddy Pollitt is a man who worked his way up from nothing concentrating so much on making a success he had no time for his family.And Paul Newman really is wonderful as a 30 year old kid who if he doesn't straighten out will soon be a 50 year old kid. It's a performance that really rings true for me because I was pretty aimless in my twenties before settling down to the job I held for 23 years before retiring.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of the great pieces of 20th Century American literature. It has some universal lessons we could all profit by in viewing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with the movie version of Tennessee Williams' Cat On a Hot Tin Roof is not the censorship so much which removed the homosexual aspect of the story though it's still there for the more perceptive viewers but the play itself. Director Richard Brooks does a decent job with it but the play's the thing and the play ain't that good. I have no problem with the movie. Elizabeth Taylor is well cast as Maggie the Cat Paul Newman is apprpriately brooding and convincingly impotent as her husband Brick Burl Ives bellows authoritatively as Big Daddy and Jack Carson is almost painfully good as Newman's sycophantic brother Gooper who in some ways is more impotent than his sibling. The story can basically be summed up as 'Daddy's dyin' and who's got the will' or rather the money. It is set in the contemporary South. Much of what goes on hinges on the refusal on the part of son Brick to have sex with his wife. Since the old man is dying he wants to help favorite son and ne'er do well Brick but is more or less forced by circumstances to prefer Gooper who has children who will keep the family going. Big Daddy holds Gooper in contempt. He is concerned over Brick's drinking  sexual problems and his personality in general. The conflict between father and son is as much the focal point of the play as the son's sex stuff. I find this play somewhat repulsive it's as sycophantic as Gooper. Williams aims his pen so to speak at the heart of Middle America. He is out to enlighten his audience on sexual matters also on life in the then still exotic Deep South. I have no problems with either of these goals except that as issues they don't belong in a serious play they belong in the back pages of magazines like The New Republic and The Nation. I believe it is beneath Williams' enormous talent for him to curry favor with his audience the way he does here with his ostentatious 'Southernisms' as in terms of endearment such as 'sister woman' and in Maggie's calling herself 'Maggie the Cat' and all the talk about the kids as 'no neck monsters'. This is sitcom stuff. Williams' language so beautiful in The Glass Menageries and A Streetcar Named Desire fails him here. The sexy aspect of the play big news in the fifties is not news at all any more. Thus the sensationalism so crucial a factor in the play's success is missing. I felt continually manipulated into reacting to the material in a certain way. Unlike in his earlier works Williams doesn't give his audience much breathing space there's little room here to form a personal interpetation. Williams sets things up so that either Cat is a 'laugh riot'and of course devilishly sophisticated as wellor it is nothing a mere anecdote a failed epiphany maybe. It is a mediocre  play all the more disappointing because its author is anything but and so the occasional flashes of brilliance become more irritating than revelatory only serving to remind us that Williams could do so much better. Yet it is if nothing else wellcrafted. Williams' professionalism does not fail him here. Cat belongs to its time before girls wore bikinis on the beach when homosexuality hell sexuality in general was spoken about in whispers by polite people and even then not too often. The play owes a huge debt to Freud and Freudian analysis which Williams was in at the time and it shows.".

A Mississippi delta accent is a very very specific sound and most of the cast miss it by a milewith Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the worst offenders of the lot. That aside the Mississippi delta simply doesn't look like the brief bits of landscape we're allowed to see in the film and the architecture of the big house is also extremely unlikely for that area. So if you're actually expecting to find any sense of the region you're out of luck. Most viewers probably won't notice these problems but they are a drawback for William's work is always as much about place as about character and plot and the film's failure to accurately capture it is a disservice to both audience and creator.That said the big problem with CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is 1950s censorship it simply wasn't possible to film a play about an unconsciously homosexual man's inability to forgive his oversexed wife for her role in his pseudolover's death. As a result the film sidesteps the entire issue and focuses on the subplot of just who is going to inherit Big Daddy's estate when he dies. Accents aside the cast does quite well with supporting players Anderson Carson and Sherwood particular standoutsbut the end result is just so much steam without substance well done but not particularly meaningful.Gary F.

Cut 15 minutes of mendacity from the picture please.The acting was excellent and well directed. The second half of the picture is stronger than the first perhaps because there is more clarity in the second half.

For example in his own description of the characters he refers to Big Daddy as tall and thin. This hardly fits Burl Ives but then Ives played the part on Broadway so Williams must have changed his mind as well he should have for Ives is superb. Similarly Big Mama is described as short and stout and weighing about 170 pounds and the play's dialogue has Big Daddy referring to her fat old body.

	schema:reviewBody "A topnotch adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic play the first screen version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is a wrenching and intense character study that brings out the best of nearly every individual involved. Williams' source material is arguably his greatest play rivaled primarily by A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and it is expertly adapted to screen by screenwriterdirector Richard Brooks. Although the racier elements of Williams' dialogue is either toned down or eliminated Brooks remains remarkably faithful to structure of Williams' story and its characters. Brooks wisely regulates his screenplay to the basics of the play which allows plenty of time for him to reach into his lead character's minds.The film is remarkably gripping and intense for such a leisurelypaced dialogueheavy film. As a director Brooks manages to wring every bit of tension out of the source material without attempting to expand the narrative which surely would have placed the film in danger of losing focus. Although the MGM production values are typically lavish Brooks maintains a marvelously claustrophobic aura throughout the entire film that somehow manages to remain faithful to its theatrical origins without actually feeling static or stagy. In fact although the film reaches such pseudooperatic heights in its drama it's somewhat shocking that proceedings remain as relatively grounded as they do.The film is blessed with a topnotch cast lead by the breathtakingly beautiful Paul Newman in a complex and thoroughly convincing portrayal of wounded masculinity. In a deeply internalized portrayal Newman clearly conveys volumes of information with one glance of his steelblue eyes. Taylor is unarguably at her sultriest as the frustrated Maggie a definitive Williams' heroine and her oldschool Hollywood glamour contrasts perfectly with Newman's refined method acting. The supporting cast is flawless lead by an outstanding scenestealing portrayal Burt Ives and featuring terrific turns by Jack Carson Judith Anderson and Madeleine Sherwood completing the impossibly tight ensemble.Although Tennessee Williams himself panned the film for censoring the more salacious elements of his original play the film received largely positive reviews from most major critics and was later nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Audiences also responded as the film grossed more that five times it's budget. It is crucial for a film adaptation of source material from any media to stand on its own and the 1958 film version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is an absolute classic by any measure.".

In fact although the film reaches such pseudooperatic heights in its drama it's somewhat shocking that proceedings remain as relatively grounded as they do.The film is blessed with a topnotch cast lead by the breathtakingly beautiful Paul Newman in a complex and thoroughly convincing portrayal of wounded masculinity. In a deeply internalized portrayal Newman clearly conveys volumes of information with one glance of his steelblue eyes. Taylor is unarguably at her sultriest as the frustrated Maggie a definitive Williams' heroine and her oldschool Hollywood glamour contrasts perfectly with Newman's refined method acting. The supporting cast is flawless lead by an outstanding scenestealing portrayal Burt Ives and featuring terrific turns by Jack Carson Judith Anderson and Madeleine Sherwood completing the impossibly tight ensemble.Although Tennessee Williams himself panned the film for censoring the more salacious elements of his original play the film received largely positive reviews from most major critics and was later nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Audiences also responded as the film grossed more that five times it's budget. It is crucial for a film adaptation of source material from any media to stand on its own and the 1958 film version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is an absolute classic by any measure.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of classic films but I had never seen this movie until today in my high school English class. We've read The Catcher in the Rye Antigone Fences and The Death of a Salesmen. So we watched Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. First of all the movie had excellent acting. I adored Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of the loveseeking woman who rides a constant emotional rollercoaster. Paul Newman was also absolutely amazing. I will never forget the scene in which Maggie grasps on to Brick and he almost embraces her but then shakes her away. Then he goes into the bathroom alone and buries his face into her slip that's hanging on the door. It's so haunting and it shows something deeper in Brick. The other actors were absolutely wonderful as well. Secondly the symbolism in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof are incredible. The thing I noticed within the first few minutes of the movie was how the relationship between Big Daddy and Big Momma mirrored the relationship between Brick and Maggie. Also I loved the use of the weather in the telling of the story. It starts raining and then it starts storming when the conflict between the characters really starts to roar. When Brick leads Big Daddy up the stairs they see that it has stopped raining. Their arguments were like a storm. Also another storm was going on in the parlor with Big Momma Maggie Gooper and Mae. The breaking of Brick's crutch was major symbolism. Alcohol and his story about Skipper had always been his crutch. At the moment he saw who he really was his crutch was broken. The ending of the movie was very touching. Mae getting what she deserved was so very gratifying. I had kind of hoped that Maggie would have hit her or something but Mae was given what would bother her the most. She saw Maggie and Brick receive respect something that she had waived in front of them for the whole movie. The final scene in the bedroom was so simple yet so thorough. I loved how when Maggie and Brick were embracing Brick reaches for his pillow from the sofa and tosses it onto the bed. Such a wonderful movie. It will undoubtedly become one of my alltime favorites!".

	schema:reviewBody "I kept seeing the beginning and ending of this film throughout the 70s on the weekend afternoon movie Saturday or Sunday and it was one of those boring adult movies about stuff that only adults care about.And then when I finally saw all of it when I was in college I still didn't like it a whole lot. Newman's character poking fun at Taylor's bragging about places she's never been and Newman getting called out on his short comings all makes for an interesting character analysis if you're into that sort of thing.I guess the thing I find frustrating about so called classic films is that there's a lot of social taboos that people want to tiptoe around. Me I just didn't get what the heck these people were hung up about. Apparently the lead characters liked one another but couldn't come to terms with their character flaws. The best I as a casual viewer can comment is say Oh well. then change the channel and hope that Star Trek or something with a little more action or brain power was on.And no matter how well a film is acted or shot if the story material is taboo and yet still vapid or vice versa I just don't let it register. I think of all the films that danced around sex in all forms love in all forms and whatever else or even a failing marriage money and lawyers and I think to myself Are these people for real? And that's kind of the sense I get with this film. It needed an alien invasion a dog fight and a few more action sequences to spice it up. With apologies to Tennessee Williams I think writing about hidden taboos and acts thereof is absolutely the dumbest thing in the world. People make up social codes and seeing Taylor and Newman navigate their way around them to get to the core of what they want is a real bother and bore.I felt like jumping in slapping a pair of handcuffs on both and shipping them off on a two month cruise. But that's just me.Well shot made for a late 50s early 60s audience when the nation was grappling with sex and race as hot domestic social issues it gives a window into what the film industry was addressing as a placebo to keep people from throttling one another. Otherwise I'd pass it up. There are better films out there.Watch at your own risk.".

The God Father of America cinema Martin Scorsese himself is making a American version of the movie titled Departed. I'm somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.A little history of Hong Kong film industry being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years Hong Kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria. On one hand everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. On the other hand lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and mature.Now back to the movie itself. 3 years ago when I was still a poor student I was loitering in the local Chinese video store as usual looking for something exciting. The owner handed me a VHS copy of this movie he personally recommended it and said it's new and unique. So I went home and watched it immediately. And then I said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes in utter silence.There was no plot twist and no surprise ending no Mr. M Night's heavy handed gimmicks and Hollywood's camera tricks. But from the beginning to the end for full 2 hours you can cut the tension with a knife. In the end you still don't want it to end. The story goes on in your mind questions bits and pieces start to put together characters start to take shape even after the movie ended.In my entire life I've never seen a movie that there isn't a single excessive frame until I saw this movie. It has forever changed my expectation on crime drama.The story is genius and simple enough. A mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia. They don't know each other's identity so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each other's wits. I won't reveal too much of it even though like I said there's no plot twist.It's a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out and since been talked compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema and of course the screenplay the acting the editing the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards.If you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie try this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "As cadets Lau and Chan both show promise as police officers.  However Chan is removed from the training and send to be a longterm undercover in Sam's gang.  However unbeknownst to the police Lau is also a longterm mole who is feeding information back to Sam.  When Sam and police chief SP Wong both have their operations scuppered each realises the other has a mole and sets out to uncover each.  With each other's lives at risk Lau and Chan must be the first to uncover the other.I decided to see this after hearing good things about it but I was conscious that often foreign films can be given more leniency than Western films doing the same thing.  After a slightly confusing opening few moments as characters settle down not helped by using completely different actors for characters at late teens and late 20's  do people change that much? the film immediately becomes gripping.  The plot may well have the occasional hole and have unnecessary personal details Lau's girlfriend and Chan's ex weren't really needed but the central story is well written and told with such urgency that it is hard not to be totally engaged.The film doesn't have many massive shoot outs or action scenes but it has a pretty consistent sense of tension that is enjoyable right up to a typical but impacting ending.  The direction is stylish and only occasionally overuses the slowmo jump cuts.  It may owe more to American cinema than that of the Orient but it is still a very good film and I hope the inevitable remake will be as good.The cast don't need to do that much apart from look intense and portray the tension of the story in a realistic fashion  something that they do well. At times the lead two actors are pushed out of this by the personal asides but they happily keep things on track.  Both Lau and Leung play it very well  it never came down to good guybad guy and the audience was pretty well split.  Wong is a solid officer while Tsang is good as Sam.  Chen and Cheng may not have a great deal to do apart from slowing the film but they both look good doing it.Overall this is a solidly enjoyable cop thriller regardless of what country it comes from.  It will eventually be remade I imagine and when it is I hope that it manages to retain it's consistent sense of tension doubleedged characters and a real tight hold on it's audience just as this did here.".

However the comedy is a large part of Hong Kong cinema as is the gangster genre. Infernal Affairs breaks with the comedy keeps the gangsters lau being a first class clean cut one  whilst Leung acts a remarkable strained police officer and adds clever and intelligent tension. The acting is first class as is the mood that truly captures the zeitgeist.This movie is about the two characters and their similarities and moral obstacles. It also has something subtle to say.This film was huge news in Hong Kong and the mainland. It is an important Hong Kong film. The US remake will be more clichd than you can imagine. This film will translate it is not that original no. But it has substance and mood that is valuable.See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm late in discovering the Hong Kong crime thriller genre so I can only compare Infernal Affairs Mou gaan dou to its Hollywood compatriots. It grippingly is the equal of such intense examinations of the anguish of undercover cops as Donnie Brascoe or dirty cops such as Narc or Training Day. Key is the dynamic opposite pairing of two leonine charismatic actors Tony Leung Chiu Wai the selfsacrificing heart throb from Hero Ying xiong and the languid lover from In the Mood for Love Fa yeung nin wa here as an antsy anguished too long undercover cop versus Andy Lau as his crisply efficient ambitious counterpart. The plot propelled as well by the music unpredictably twists and takes hairpin turns from the beginning so that even with helpful flashbacks it's a thrilling roller coaster ride to try to follow the constantly changing loyalties manipulations deals and revelations not unlike the TV series The Wire. Regardless you get that the real battle is for the characters' souls as much as their lives and you hold your breath to the last surprising minute. The initial motivations for how the men came to be at this crossroads will doubtless be explored in the prequel and sequel that haven't been released in the U.S. yet. The women are just the girlfriends but they do have separate lives jobs and choices that impact the men in their lives. With noted cinematographer Christopher Doyle is listed as a visual consultant in the credits the great bulk of the film takes place at night like a comparable chase film Collateral so it was unfortunate that the print I saw was not pristine. It was also annoying that the subtitles were white on white illegible and that ideograms that are shown in the scene are not translated even when the camera rests on them for a length of time that makes one assume something significant is written there.".

It does not have a grand acting Jack Nicholson who basically plays Daryl Van Horne with the attitude and Infernal Affairs characters don't talk and don't curse as much as they do in The Departed but the Hong Kong's movie only benefits from it.

Both lead roles are suitably underplayed allowing the stress and tension of the respective moles' jobs to show itself without resorting to Pacinolike over acting. Indeed much of the film is told in dialogue there are no ridiculous action sequences and the final rooftop confrontation is both incredibly intense and masterful in keeping such a sprawling tale enclosed in such a small yet fitting finale. It has been followed by two equally wonderful films but the original remains both a sophisticated piece of modern cinema and a dizzyingly exciting thriller.".

The beginning is sort of confusing but the rest of the movie is excellently put together and is in perfect sync leading to the climax. The depth of the movie is amazing and is true to the story line.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an incredibly sad movie.Its because it is pretty good. Its tight. Its completely coherent. The narrative veers in odd directions just before you expect it to. The pacing is just right for a mainstream picture.What's sad in watching it is knowing Scorceses's remake something that follows this very closely. People seem to like the fact that its sparkly in terms of the characters. It was almost tolerable for me when I watched it. But seeing how this roots the story and how Scorcese's blind spot kills him... its enough to make you worry even cry for the state of cinema.Scorcese's a good man. He loves cinema and the world is far better off for him in it just on his preservation efforts and promotion of film as a sort of art. But his curse is that he is locked in an Italian mind. He has only one way of telling a story. In his world all creation flows from individuals. Those individuals bend the universe. If you understand their motives you understand how the world works at least the world you experience in the film.Actors think they love this because it empowers them. But it also gives them no support no cosmos in which to exist. They have to carry the entire narrative burden on themselves. That's why you have such colorful characters thugs and such. And its why you need such extreme and un nuanced actors who can only bulldoze through. He's been doing it long enough that he knows how to make it work.But then you see this. Its eight dimensions more full. Yes it is less loud less aggressive in terms of personal projection. But it works at such a deeper level that one wonders why we even tolerate Scorcese and his friends. In this film the filmmaker and writer have created a world two worlds actually. These two worlds interact but largely stay statically opposed. As with ordinary noir a simple soul finds himself caught up in the dynamics of the world he is in mostly hapless in terms of what happens. He can only respond. How he responds is what makes the narrative.The trick in this story is that there are two worlds and people from each caught in the other. So the tension between the two worlds can be dramatized as the tension between two men and their sponsors. Not as bombast but as human. Honor and survival mean something because there is a context not just an assertion.In this story some men don't survive. They are the Scorsese types.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Without Internal Affairs The Departed would not exist. The film is not without its flawsit is at times hokey and lapses between scenes derail the continuity at points. But the intriguing premise vivid characters slick visuals and breakneck pacing come together to produce a film that isn't only fun to watch but substantive. It would be unfair to place Scorcese's remake on the pedestal it stands to occupy without acknowledging this film.This isn't Nicholson Damon and DiCaprio but the acting is no less compelling. Tony Leung ragged and feral is a stark contrast to his adversary played capably by Andy Lau who traverses dangerous ground as a Triad packaged as a charming and talented detective. Eric Tsang and Anthony Wong both turn in performances that buttress the theme of dichotomy as two weathered veterans engaged in a human chess match with the lives of their protges at stake.The story revolves around a wouldbe officer played by Leung a former academy standout handpicked to infiltrate the Triads for an indefinite amount of time. Simultaneously the Triads send a young solider to establish a vein of intelligence within the police department. Both men quickly rise in their respective agencies enmeshing themselves in the operations finding it increasingly difficult to see the way out and as years pass increasingly difficult to separate reality from the lives that they've built on a foundation of deceit. Their paths come to a head when those who commissioned them inform them that they each man must identify and expose the other all while avoiding being discovered by their own.Thematically the film showcases the delicate interplay between truth and deceit safety and death crime and justice that subtly manifests itself in the fabric of this film and never wavers. Masterfully crafted tension is broken up in parts by comic moments that are as fleeting as any sense of security afforded its protagonist.The most important aspect of this film the notion that the two leads are reflections of one another that every man has a propensity for good and evil that dilemmas of justice like morality have no easy solutions is not new by any means. But here it is treated in a manner that is neither stale nor heavy handed. The two lead characters are as connected as they are opposed something which is explored here to a greater degree here than in the Scorcese remake.Although The Departed borrows much from this film it does not achieve the level of cohesion or the richness of connection between its characters. That's not to say that Scorcese's film is a failure it's an entertaining film with viable themes. And though this came first the Westernized version is still worth watching even if only for the star powered cast for a taste of Scorcese's signature gangster lean or for Alec Baldwin's scene stealing banter. After reading so many responses to the film on this site it's clear that some of the credit for its warm reception is due to the film being set in the city of Boston. But for whatever reason this story just seems more at home in the alternately murky and glowing streets of Hong Kong.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something very invigurating about Asian cinema. I think it has to do with the free reign the film makers are given. Unlike hollywood they really don't have to adhere to focus groups or near sighted Hollywood suits. They are able to take their stories to places that we as North American viewers are not fully accustomed to.Infernal Affairs is a film that emphasizes this point. I realize that it has been optioned by a group led by Brad Pitt in the hopes that it will be developed into a big budget Hollywood flick. If they succeed I really do hope they remain true to the source material because this is one beautifully resonate film.First of all I must admit that it took a little bit to get used to especailly the kind of karaoke feel some scenes have. But as the story played out the more involved I became. I was truly routing for both of these guys and hoped that some way everything would work out. Probably the main thing that kept me glued to the screen was the performances of the two leads especially Andy Lau I am not too familiar with his work you know I have just recently been introduced to Asian filmsthanks to Ain't It Cool News for pointing this one out along with Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance he is amazing his face alone can hold a scene. Fantastic actor.I am not going to go into details about the plot but like I said some scenes are kind of done like bad karoake but they are few and far between. What struck me the most was that it didn't really dumb down the plot not everything was fully explained except maybe a last moment of reflection that was not really necessary. The film makers really assumed that we as the audience were smart enough to figure some stuff out on our own. I was also amazed at the lack of violence and lack of strong language. I mean don't get me wrong this is an intense flick but it didn't need to resort to that kind of thing to get the viewer involved I found that pretty interesting. I am not sure if the cultural differences had anything to do with influencing my opinion meaning that I am not familiar with police laws in Hong Kong or the relationship the Triads have with the police and so on. I just took everything at face value and it all seemed plausible to me but again what do I know.Anyway aside from an occasional oddity and my own ignorance this is one refreshing film. Smart intense and beautifully acted. Thank God for Toronto's China Town or else I would never be able to see this film unless it starred Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is something very invigurating about Asian cinema. I think it has to do with the free reign the film makers are given. Unlike hollywood they really don't have to adhere to focus groups or near sighted Hollywood suits. They are able to take their stories to places that we as North American viewers are not fully accustomed to.Infernal Affairs is a film that emphasizes this point. I realize that it has been optioned by a group led by Brad Pitt in the hopes that it will be developed into a big budget Hollywood flick. If they succeed I really do hope they remain true to the source material because this is one beautifully resonate film.First of all I must admit that it took a little bit to get used to especailly the kind of karaoke feel some scenes have. But as the story played out the more involved I became. I was truly routing for both of these guys and hoped that some way everything would work out. Probably the main thing that kept me glued to the screen was the performances of the two leads especially Andy Lau I am not too familiar with his work you know I have just recently been introduced to Asian filmsthanks to Ain't It Cool News for pointing this one out along with Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance he is amazing his face alone can hold a scene. Fantastic actor.I am not going to go into details about the plot but like I said some scenes are kind of done like bad karoake but they are few and far between. What struck me the most was that it didn't really dumb down the plot not everything was fully explained except maybe a last moment of reflection that was not really necessary. The film makers really assumed that we as the audience were smart enough to figure some stuff out on our own. I was also amazed at the lack of violence and lack of strong language. I mean don't get me wrong this is an intense flick but it didn't need to resort to that kind of thing to get the viewer involved I found that pretty interesting.

When you also include the biggest names around in HK showbiz into the cast  Andy Lau Tony Leung Sammi Cheng Kelly Chen Edison Chen Shawn Yue and Elva Hsiao all have iconic popstar status with huge followings  you'd expect either an explosive story or sheer disappointment nothing in between. Fortunately it is the former category and how well did they do it at that.Infernal Affairs tells of two top police cadets who choose or are forced to choose to follow different paths. Inspector Lau Andy Lau is recruited by a triad leader Sam Eric Tsang to infiltrate the police force and act as a mole. Meanwhile Yan Tony Leung appears to have been kicked out of police academy but has been secretly been recruited to act as a mole in Sam's gang. Suddenly both come under the pressure each organisation suspects a mole but can they keep themselves under cover.With three of my favourite actors headlining this film I was hopeful for some quality performances. Andy Lau turns in a brilliant performance on a level with A Fighter's Blues aka Ah Fu. It's emotional and gritty and indeed very human. Not much to say about Tony Leung other than he produces everything that we expect of this veteran actor. Eric Tsang plays the boss convincingly.  Ok I have to admit it is hard to pinpoint where the quality of their performances is for each of them but that's the socalled 'Xfactor' and they've got tonnes of it!As for the remainder of the cast they are fairly short cameos but it is nice to see Sammi Cheng in a role removed from her traditional RomCom roles. Kelly Edison Shawn and Elva's roles were really too short to comment on.But take away these stars and you see the underlying plot and script were simply excellent. There was drama and intensity keeping your adrenaline pumping. Action scenes weren't innovative but fit in nicely with the film. And there's plenty of subtext emotion roller coaster rides and beautiful scenery they love their rooftops to add.Infernal Affairs was the highest grossing movie in Hong Kong according to the MPIA which is not bad for an industry that is suffering from imports to Hong Kong. And it certainly deserves that award because it is probably the best HK film I've seen in a very long time.One to watch over and over again.DVD review Media Asia have released an 'alternate endings' version of Infernal Affairs in Hong Kong. Please note that without spoiling it the second ending is much shorter than the first so please don't be disappointed. Guess that's why they put the first one in the real version. The extras are on a second disc and are packed with lots of additional bits but most of them do not carry subtitles. Nonetheless a worthwhile buy I think.".

This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 060241 the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million Russians died or 20 of the entire population.  Historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the Russian people but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious. During the war Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultrapatriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to Stalin himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader.  But Kalatozov changed this depiction as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalin's death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or as well as the Best Director and Best Actress Tatyana Samoilova reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40's. This film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real.  Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine Veronica who hasn't heard from her lover Boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with Veronica.  This film features the famous line You can dream when the war is over.  In the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets Veronica learns Boris died all are happy and excited with the soldier's return but Veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing  cranes white and gray floating in the sky. The film was released in 1957 in Russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallen...and tears unlocked the doors.".

Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII don't expect to see any Nazis cannons blood gore etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here. You'll certainly appreciate it if you're Russian like me but even if not you'll probably love it. If you speak no Russian look for the RUSCICO Russian Cinema Council DVD version. It's got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the English dubbing on this one I'd say is just as good.

	onyx:emotionText "If you're looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII don't expect to see any Nazis cannons blood gore etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here. You'll certainly appreciate it if you're Russian like me but even if not you'll probably love it. If you speak no Russian look for the RUSCICO Russian Cinema Council DVD version. It's got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the English dubbing on this one I'd say is just as good. It's of course not as good as the original Russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the English subtitles. So go check it out especially if you're studying film in any aspect.";

It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for it is about forgiveness and about hope. The film received absolutely deservingly the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie. After separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent.For me the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets squares and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books. Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life  my background my memory and my past.".

She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow.The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous BW cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM.It's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia. She's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. Their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.By the end of the story she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. There's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.The stylish and striking camerawork is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story.Tastefully done but perhaps the English subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.Summing up Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival.

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen director Kalatozov's I am Cuba before I saw this movie. I loved the camera work in I am Cuba but I felt that the story was too rigid too much of a propaganda piece too much of an advertisement for my taste. The characters weren't real enough not fully developed. It felt as if I were watching types of people rather than actual people. In The Cranes are Flying which Kalatozov made prior to I am Cuba I didn't find the same problem. The story is thoroughly engaging and I felt a whole range of emotions. The lead character specifically is so real I think she will haunt my dreams. She is played by Tatyana Samojlova who deserves special acclaim. She is dazzling. Her sweet charm reminded me of Audrey Hepburn and yet Samojlova's acting seems to have a broader range. Hers is more realistic in a way that feels ahead of its time in 1957. Her wild despair is in a league with the best emoter actresses such as Natalie Wood Isabelle Adjani Juliette Binoche. I must mention also that the cinematography is so crisp it seems to be 4 decades ahead of its time. As far as composition and movement of the camera I'd say it has strains of several styles including German Expressionism of the 20's and 30's and the stormy noir melodramas of the '40s like Out of the Past 1947. This is a romantic dramatic movie that looks long and hard at the repercussions of war and yes it does have a message and it certainly hammers it home but still I think it stays more clearly in the realm of universal themes rather than falling into the propagandist ditch.In summary I don't think I have ever seen better acting better camera work better editing or better direction in any movie made previous to it. There were some scenes made with such planning and precision that I had to press PAUSE just to catch my breath. Lovers of movie history enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you see a film and it knocks you for six. Sometimes those films are unknown to most people. The Cranes Are Flying is one of those films. Made in Soviet Russia in 1957 the films starts with the romance of Veronika and Boris a romance that is rudely interrupted when he volunteers to go to the front during WWII. After the lose of her own family Boris' family invite her to live with them only for his brother who found exemption from fighting 'forcing' her into marriage. The family are forced to move to Siberia to escape the onslaught of the Germans and it is here Veronika learns the fate of her real love.The film's main plot the love story is tragic but the film as a whole is as tragic in it's depiction of war and the immense effect it has on people. Through fine performances the cast bring another episode of war to life with drama joy despair and hope. Director Mikhail Kalatozov achieves something else a masterpiece of film making. The film contains some of the most remarkable camera work you'll likely to see in a preCGI film world. One of the early scenes where Boris runs up flights of stairs as the camera pans and follows in one take is a hint of things to come. That scene is mirrored when Veronika returns to her family apartment to find it bombed and runs up the same stairwell that hangs among the ruins and fire. There are fine tracking shots such as where Veronica runs along the dispatch area or when she runs along the train track. Another stand out scene is where Veronica is 'trapped' by the brother during an air raid the noise loud the camera angles obscure the lighting jarred and ominous it's a powerful moment among many throughout the film.The audience learns the fate of Boris way before Veronica who tries to hang onto hope that he will return. Her love grows ever more when she discovers the note he left in the toy squirrel. The powerful end scenes when the truth is revealed are stunningly effective full of emotion and the horror of what war can create in people.War films are often too busy concentrating on the battles itself but occasionally a film will explore the real battle the one that humanity has to endure on a personal level.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com".

It's a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the Western movies  but then again she would probably never find herself there. In Letyat Zhuravli she is unforgettable. This was one of the few movies where I was crying...In addition to Samojlova Batalov and Merkurjev who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an alltime classics worldwide. Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies. The very simple means  but the great technique added to the emotional weight... Mind you 20 years before The Star Wars 41 years before Titanic and with a Soviet budget.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama with a WWII setting and now that I have all I can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this one's free of such emphasis  with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he'll never return. The girl a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova is also loved by the young man's cousin and when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him. He however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her. Finally word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him.The film features some truly amazing camerawork which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive  two in particular the stunning scene frenetically edited and spedup to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck and the young man's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I've ever watched with the sun moving away from him symbolizing the life that's seeping out of his body as he imagines the wedding day he'll never have!. Also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist  which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face  taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!Disappointingly the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a barebones affair the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot! Criterion released it in conjunction with another warthemed Russian classic BALLAD OF A SOLDIER 1959  which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming... The only other film I've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT 1969 albeit via the muchshorter U.S.release version! a starstudded international production based on true events given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA 1964 a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year apart from receiving a oneweek theatrical run it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a featurelength Making Of!!".

	schema:headline " I am always waiting  The Cranes are Flying";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying Letyat zhuravli is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov based on his own play Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way by telling us straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason against their will it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return.Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.The acting is topnotch throughout but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris a happygolucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.Besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.The real feats however are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scne can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.".

	schema:headline " Realistic humanistic portrayal of the civilian effects of the Great Patriotic War";
	schema:reviewBody "The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill a mere nine featurefilms were released in 1951 and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years. It wasn't until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widelyconsidered the first postStalin Soviet masterpiece 'Letyat zhuravli  The Cranes are Flying' one of the finest depictions of war I've seen from any country or time period. Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union but international recognition was soon to follow and Kalatozov's film was honoured with the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival.'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet warthemed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional wartime hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict. Love as a cinematic concept is toooften idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. In the film two lovers Veronika Tatyana Samojlova and Boris Aleksey Batalov separated by the advent of the WWII widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War 19411945 pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish. Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting Veronika agrees to wed Boris' cousin Mark Aleksandr Shvorin a handsome but unworthy youth. The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic flagwaving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds.Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes are Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic handheld cinematography which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades in fact only one of the film's sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind. In one particularly impressive oftcited long shot the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The handheld camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her  capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands  before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of handheld photography The camera he once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray his inner sensations. The cameraman must act with the actors.".

In the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill a mere nine featurefilms were released in 1951 and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years. It wasn't until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widelyconsidered the first postStalin Soviet masterpiece 'Letyat zhuravli  The Cranes are Flying' one of the finest depictions of war I've seen from any country or time period. Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union but international recognition was soon to follow and Kalatozov's film was honoured with the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival.'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet warthemed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional wartime hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict. Love as a cinematic concept is toooften idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. In the film two lovers Veronika Tatyana Samojlova and Boris Aleksey Batalov separated by the advent of the WWII widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War 19411945 pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish. Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting Veronika agrees to wed Boris' cousin Mark Aleksandr Shvorin a handsome but unworthy youth. The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic flagwaving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds.Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes are Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic handheld cinematography which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades in fact only one of the film's sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind. In one particularly impressive oftcited long shot the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The handheld camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her  capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands  before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of handheld photography The camera he once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray his inner sensations. The cameraman must act with the actors.";

This is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. The actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fianc Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.Others have summarized the movie so well so I'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry Tatiana Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape. You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother or worse show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't French existential cinema the latter doesn't happen. Thankfully! Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... StillTatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried after all.I won't mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing antisoviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wifetobe would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film! The ending when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movie.Incredible. Go see it.".

The way in which the movie is shot is excellent the use of handheld camera makes the movie more realistic. It literally follows the characters through the movie. The expert use of symbolism in this film also contributes to the overall message. One of the most important symbols used in this film is rotation the rotation in the film implies a sort of image in how things spiral down in life. The film also does a good job of developing characters. The protagonist of the film Veronika is representative of the nation as a whole. She represents the guilt brought on by being the survivor in war as well as the hope associated with new beginnings. The entirety of the film is mostly heartbreaking however the message at the end of the film is a hopeful one. The Cranes are Flying gives light to the harsh realities of war and its effects on a nation. Overall the movie is very well done.".

THE CRANES ARE FLYING is for the first half at least supremely entertaining boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms two stunning subjective setpieces and a romantic verve that flirts with but never quite topples into Lelouch territory. It's just that  in its subsuming of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie.Of course in a Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else and in an era World War Two that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief.  And the thematic similarities  all consuming love rent apart by war  with two of the most wonderful of all films SEVENTH HEAVEN LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG also adds to its potential loveability.The story is simple enough.  Boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and Veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time.  Boris's cousin Mark a composer also has eyes on Veronika.  When the Nazis invade Russia Boris secretly volunteers to the chagrin of his family and lover.  He promises to write to Veronika but never does thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable.  Veronika's parents die during an air raid and she moves in with Boris's family helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers.Distressed by Boris's silence Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official.  She is eventually worn down and marries him to the disapproval of her adopted family.  Boris meanwhile is killed in action.  Veronika disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark refuses to believe this and awaits his return fostering a young orphan bearing his name.The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant epiphanical power.  But this is illusory  the cranes fly in a V formation and this shape pervades the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings interiors exteriors groupings of people composition camera angles the heroine's name  or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another.  This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film.  Although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an unpeopled environment or privileged in generous closeups they are always ironised minimised torn apart  by circumstances families by crowds see the brilliant if obvious sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd or simply by the film's structure which is constantly distancing through paralellism their closeness. Although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it is constantly being broken  by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music.What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces.  The whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and dreamlike we are never shown its harsh brutal actuality just its effects on the lovers.  In fact it is transformed into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty Germans. On the home front the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade or ruins of almost Gothic decadence.  In the bunker the threat to the Soviet empire is less important  than Boris's perceived indifference. The empty oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially than Veronika with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces. When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations.  This is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent Expressionistic terror in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the earlier scenes' wistful gentleness.It's not much different at the front either where fights over girls' honour are more urgent than tactics Nazis or despair.  The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic and Boris' final predeath flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dreamwish fulfillment and heightened anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque.From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious.  One more grasp for Expressionist overload  Veronika's attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant  is clumsily handled and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow  over the whole film.  The use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE.  After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in Russian art transmutes into symbolic i.e. sexless dehumanised hope.  A pity.".

This Russian film is blatantly patriotic while at the same time portraying its protagonists with all of their frailties and faults.This is the story of a male Master Sergeant in the Russian Army during WWII in Northern Russia. He has the duty to command a detachment of female antiaircraft gunners assigned to protect a railway and supply depot. Although this is a war story the essence of it describes the developing relationships between the Master Sgt and his soldiers and among the soldiers themselves. There is humor suspense pathos romance and tragedy as this older man and his very young women charges are assigned the responsibility of tracking and killing or capturing two German paratroopers in the forest near camp.Unfortunately for the six Russians the two Germans turn out to be sixteen armed with submachine guns and explosives. Against the odds the Master Sgt decides to try to delay and confound the German troops with tricks and finally with weapons. Rather than take the easy and safe route to retreat the brave Russians ambush the Germans at every turn and start picking them off one by one.During the course of the desperate actions by the Russians the relationship between the male Sgt and the girls changes and grows. He begins the mission wanting to protect the girls and he ends the mission being protected by the girls who use everything they have including their lives.The love that these stalwart soldiers share is not of the romantic kind but more that of a brother and sister but even closer. They share respect admiration humor sadness and horror together and resolve to help each other to the end.Although somewhat sentimental this film does not assume that only Russians will have an interest. The situations people and emotions it portrays are I believe universal. The depiction of the German paratroopers as cowardly and inept is inaccurate but excusable given the premise of the film.In summary I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in war films but also to those who think bravery in combat is only for men. The performances are excellent and credible except for the Germans and direction and photography is superb.".

Unsurprisingly give the date of production it now feels that it belongs in a past era. I would recommend this authentic film to any dedicated Soviet film follower. Recommend it to anyone who is studying Russian history or The Eastern Front. And recommend it to anyone possessing an interest of the Soviet Army during the Second World War. In addition there is a fine framebyframe modern Russian television remake of this film aired in 2014.Unforgettably The dawns Are Quiet Here pays merited honour respect and admiration to the female fighters in the Red Army.

In reality 45 unexperienced women and one man even if he is a genial soldier would have no chance again 16 Gebirgsjger. Well I accept that in movies the leading characters act a bit better than their opponent so that it is a little bit unrealistic like in Die Brcke  which is by the way a far better movie from 1959 but this was to much. I also think that to much patriotic phrases are used in the movie  that the women fought for good reason would have been clear also without this".

	schema:headline " Highly entertaining Asian Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Modern Chinese History forms the backdrop for this sweeping portrait of the Soong Sisters three siblings who married powerful men and used their positions to influence the politics of early 20th Century China. The film spans the period from the formation of the Chinese Republic in 1911 to the takeover by the Communists in 1949. The details of history take a back seat to the real focus of this movie however which delves into the intricate and intimate relationships these women have with their husbands their parents and each other.Lushly photographed and superbly acted the movie showcases the talents of three veteran actors of Asian Cinema. Michelle Yeoh Maggie Cheung and Vivian Wu play sisters Ailing Chingling and Mayling Soong. All three seem wellcast and bring the full weight of their skill and experience to their roles. The move sizzles with electricity when these three beauties appear on screen together as they do in several scenes. This is definitely a case where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Wen Jian gives an outstanding performance as father Charlie Soong despite dying off halfway through the story. The deathbed scene where he passes away in the presence of his wife and three daughters is especially moving. Winston Chao and HsingKuo Wu take sold turns as Sun YatSen and Chiang KaiShek.The story explores a number of themes in both a personal and socialhistorical context. Conflicts between fatherdaughter old valuesnew values old Chinanew China and EastWest all figure prominently in the plot. A shoe metaphor runs throughout the film depicting the stepbystep movement of Chinese history bringing to mind the old Chinese proverb A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. This motif also reflects the increased role of women in Chinese social and political life as they are liberated from the footbinding that hobbled previous generations.The movie is slowmoving at times with some abrupt plot transitions. Director Mabel Cheung occasionally hits us over the head with that shoe to get her point across and the script seems to contain some hints of political propaganda. Nevertheless I found this to be a wellmade and highly entertaining piece of Asian Cinema. Sadly this movie is not likely to reach a wide North American audience because it's in Mandarin with English subtitles. That's too bad because it is just as accomplished as anything coming out of Hollywood these days and well worth seeing.5 stars.".

Any film about women made by a woman suffers from a bias and this film is no exception. No mention was made of the three brothers or what became of them. Because the rise of the sisters was due in no small way to their father's conversion from a young Chinese shop assistant to an American educated Christian minister subsequently making a fortune printing bibles I would have liked at least a prologue showing his extraordinary progress. Not only was their father a Methodist Minister but he had a very western progressive outlook and judging by their lack of filial piety  spoiled his girls rotten.  Of the three girls only ChingLing comes across as sincere the others appear motivated by greed and power.  This slant may of course be due to the mainland Chinese influence.  Overall the film can be summed up as a spectacular epic romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "A romantic yet tragic story about the relationship between 3 sisters which would ultimately shape the future of China.Beautiful cinematography excellent cast even to the tiniest details about the lives of the sisters were well done.A scene where the characteristics of the 3 sisters were laid out for all to see was the demonstration that they attended at a very young age. We recall how the father Charlie Soong had asked them to throw away their dolls as they were foreign made. The youngest refused so the second took her doll and her youngest sister and threw it into the raging fire. The eldest on the other hand hid her doll in her sleeve. A testament to the characters of the girls.The show makes us love the second sister Chingling for her passion and dedication to her country. It makes us look at all 3 sisters and feel that the luckiest was the one motivated by greed and thus married a banker. We cry as we see Chingling lose her baby then her father and finally her husband as if it was the price she paid for loving her country.The show makes you feel sorry for the Communists as Chiang Kai shek went around persecuting them while Japan was fighting a war with China. Cries from his own party members to unite with the Communists to fight the Japanese went unheeded until he was abducted. One wonders if Chiang ever realised that his true enemy was himself and not the Communists.One feels sorry for Sun acted well by Winston Chao and he looks uncannily like the man himself perhaps because his true vision of China was probably realised at a very heavy price the price of freedom. While Soong Chingling remained loyal till the very end to her country a question lingered long in her mind and the minds of her sisters...did they find the new China their father had wanted them to find? All 3 lead actresses displayed their acting prowess in the show. The youngest played by Vivian Wu who thought it was romantic of her sister to elope with Sun though life with him would have been very unstable yet who had no qualms about standing by her husband in the quest for greater power. The role of the second sister was well played by Maggie Cheung as she showed her love for her country her wit when she said that both she and the plane were made in China so why could they not trust made in China goods and her loyalty to the memory of Sun when she stepped down from the party feeling that its true principles had been betrayed.Michelle Yeoh acted well as the eldest sister she even looks the part as a mentor to her younger sisters. Her approval of the match between Chiang and Mayling showed that she let greed get the better of her. She knew Chiang would be powerful and what better business deal to do than to strike one with the most powerful man in China? Hsingkuo Wu did well as Chiang kai shek. Not only did he look the part the manner in which he exude wickedness made you believe that Chiang is there at the scene in the movie! So one loved money one loved power and one loved her country. And the country's future depended on the relationship of these sisters. Is that why the story never truly ended?".

As a character study of these singular women it is disturbingly deficient only Maggie Cheung as ChingLing the socially conscious husband of Sun Yat Sen figures close to what we know. As history...well let's just say that the film is oblivious to the oldest sister's welldocumented draconian schemings not to mention the youngest's public charisma crossed with spoiled petulance.It's critical to the film that these three extraordinary women be portrayed as personable as Ailing the oldest sister Michelle Yeoh is always engaging and instantly likable. The real Ailing may have put on a show for friends and diplomats but the record tells a different story which includes political assassination and worse. A film has to be evaluated on its honesty the The Soong Sisters  perhaps consciously perhaps not  tells lies that brutalized generations.This film does have extraordinary setdecoration and photography and its story is quietly engaging. A few even sniffled at the poignant finish. I can imagine there's just as much reason to react in anger. If you must see it for the highbudget glory but dismiss it as anything but fiction.".

It is doubtful in the extreme that Chingling survived miscarriage and 42 days sloshing through the marshes as portrayed but until a more sober and satisfactory account of Mme. Sun's life and accomplishments are on the film record this portrait will have to do. The production is super even if the glib pictorials may offput in their slick projections. And finally from this perch one of the most engaging sidelights here is the wondrous staging of the opera house wherein Chiang Kaishek ogles and woos Mayling. I found myself wishing the principals would get out of the way to let the opera speak for itself in toto. Reminded me of how Hollywood always cut away from more interesting spectacle to zoom in on the treacly romance of the overpaid and undertalented stars. Oh well you can't have everything and there was enough of the opera and its stellar performers intercut nicely with war footage. Soneone should make a film about Chinese opera and I don't mean that saga about the two starcrossed Peking Opera stars and especially not that impossible restaging of that improbable romance between a French diplomat and a crossdressing starlet.".

Chingling Maggie Cheung married Sun Yatsen Mayling Vivian Wu married Chiang Kaishek and Ailing Michelle Yeoh married H. H. Kung although his role is minimized. Large portions of the movie seem to be about the visuals as we see the elegant setting in which the sisters grew up.The film came out the same year that Hong Kong got returned to China so it might have had the aim of getting the two off to a good start. Of course they had to include lines very favorable to the PRC namely Before we were slaves of old China. Now we are slaves of slaves of old China.

Anna and her daughter Nika is now stuck in the Soviet occupied zone unable to go back to Krakow in the German zone not until a brave Russian captain helps them to flee. 3 April 1940 Andrzej is transported from the prison camp in Kozelsk to the Katyn Forest where thousands of Polish officers are killed. In 1943 the Germans capture this area and find the mass graves. 13 April 1943 they start announcing the names of the identified corpses through loudspeakers in Krakow. Anna is happy that Andrzej is not in any of the Katyn lists which gives her some hope. 18 January 1945 the Red Army liberates Krakow from the Nazis. The Russians ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Katyn on a home computer screen. Even in that limited format Katyn had an impact on me comparable to such cinematic greats as Lawrence of Arabia. I cried throughout most of the film. I resolved that many of my relationships would be different. I remembered people I had known who reminded me of characters in the movie. After the film ended I felt that I could not listen to the radio or read the newspaper or listen to anyone speak. I just needed to allow the film to sink into me.Naysayers have critiqued Katyn as boring and dull. If you need a film to depict war occupation and atrocity as shiny compact and compelling as a sports car then you should listen to those naysayers don't watch Katyn rather watch the very silly teen fanboyfriendly Quentin Tarantino flic Inglorious Bastards. If you've seen enough Hollywood productions jampacked with sexy Nazis and happy endings and you want to take in a film that dares to depict in eyeblinks what war atrocity and occupation looked like and felt like to real people then by all means see Katyn. One of the many features that I admired Katyn's Nazis are not sexy. They are not Tom Cruise Liam Neeson Christoph Waltz. Katyn's Nazis are brutal repugnant thugs.I respect this movie. There are too few movies about which I'd say that. It shows the courage not to attempt to weave an uplifting feelgood atrocity narrative that leaves the viewer with a smile. This isn't Schindler's List. Schindler's List is a very good movie but this isn't that. It is rather very much like what World War Two and the subsequent Soviet occupation sounded like to me when I listened to my own older friends and relatives who lived through both. This is disjointed narrative stories that seem headed for redemption or even ecstasy but that end in random death that end in aborted normalcy aborted joy aborted meaning. I felt in watching these cold pale stoic characters as if I were once again sitting across the table from older Eastern European friends and relatives. Yes that's what they looked like. Yes those are the facial expressions they assumed when they talked about the uncle who was rounded up and never heard from again the daring handsome lad who ended up in a mass grave  or when they pointedly did not talk about these people. The gravestone whose inscription dares to tell the truth the tearing down of a propaganda poster the Red Army soldier who struggles to do the right thing by a widow who won't yet admit that she is a widow the singing of exactly the right Christmas carol at exactly the right moment those are exactly the heroic gestures that no one ever saw that went unrecorded that only one person lived to tell about to tell me. Here they are on screen.When a movie is named Katyn the viewer knows how it will end it's kind of like a movie named Auschwitz or Kolyma or Wounded Knee. There isn't going to be a surprise ending. I was still surprised by the ending by how courageous and moving I found it. Once again Andrzej Wajda managed to wow the filmgoer in me. And he managed to move the human in me.See Katyn. See a movie you can respect a movie that is worth your time.".

What cineast of hallucinatory action of nude and crude sensuality of sequences full of monumental catastrophes would make a film in which one had scenes in a slower rhythm without sex with shadowy photography with quiet music and giving ethical principles priority over the characters and their lives.One more reason however for us to thank Hollywood for nominating this film to run for the Oscar for the best foreign film.The Katyn massacre perpetrated on Stalin's orders to eliminate the fine flower of the Polish intelligentsia was left out of official Soviet history until the glasnost of Gorbatchov. There in the Katyn forest and in other places as well thousands of Polish officers were massacred. The Soviets tried to attribute it to the Nazis but the truth eventually came to light. There is still however in Russia today an attempt to deny the historical truth.I would like to make my own the reading of the film which focuses on this question of the distortion of historical fact by the apparatus of the state. The official lie imposed by the Soviet occupation of Poland brought torment to the lives of many of the families of the victims. Wajda's denunciation along with the cry Never kill again! can also serve as an alert for our present world in which so often a virtual reality becomes a substitute for the truth.The first group of interpretations belong to the women wives mothers daughters of the dead officers how they coped first with the hope of their return and then with the definitive notice of their loss. They are marvellous interpretations revealing the director's mastery and the talent of the actors. The portrayals demonstrate how even when nothing else is left there is still dignity. The wife of the dead General in Katyn refuses to endorse a declaration prepared by the Nazis denouncing the Soviets. The truth was known  why then should she play Hitler's propaganda game? He was just as much the enemy as Stalin was. Another woman wants to honour the memory of her brother by putting on the family tomb a stone with his name on it. Courageously she challenges the regime but in vain  the stone is destroyed because on it the date of the officer's death indicates clearly who is to blame.Most of the male characters were simply victims of massacre among those who had the opportunity of showing themselves authentically noble was a Russian officer who tried to save his Polish neighbour and her daughter. I couldn't save my own family but I can help yours. And it is a Polish officer who has changed sides who represents in the middle of so much heroism the weakness of some. It is necessary to survive he declared.An entire population was suffocated by the Nazi and Soviet occupation. It is a shock to be shown in the film the cordial relations between the officials of the occupying powers which would have been inconceivable in earlier years. Poland is partitioned yet again! by the MolotovRibbentrop pact. In the Poland occupied by the Nazis all the professors of a university are summoned and arrested there and then as a means of impeding the formation of future opposition. In the Poland occupied by the Soviets the Polish officers are made prisoners of war an efficient means of stopping them fighting for the independence of their country.Pawel Edelman's photography is simply a work of genius a mixture of sombre realism and the surreal. The music of Krzystof Penderecki fits the narrative like a glove producing just the right atmosphere at the right time. The dry narrative style has something in common with a documentary and calls to mind another of his films Love in Germany. And there is no lack of the symbolism present in all his films this time with a remarkably religious tone.In the development of the story there are moments taken from the films of that period  as for example the powerful exhumation of the dead scenes which served Soviets and Nazis alike in placing the blame on each other.For me the strongest images are those of the young man who refused to declare that his father had not been killed in Katyn by the Soviets of the two waves of fugitives running in opposite directions and meeting in the middle of a bridge  which way to run? of the general who tried to animate his men in the last Christmas of their lives and of the little girl awaiting the return of her father. This last touched me in a special way because I too had waited for my father's return at the end of the war.Katyn is without doubt one of Andrzej Wajda's greatest films.Tomasz Lychowski Rio de Janeiro Brazil February 2008.Translated into English by Graham Connell".

There are many movies on WWII that appear to be more or less captivating touching as well as educational. And in this respect we could easily rate this movie in that way if we treat KATYN as yet another film on WWII. However the case here is different more to say exceptionally unique.Andrzej Wajda after 18 years since the downfall of communist regime fulfills the duty he feels to his parents and all Polish Patriots and makes a film on the theme that not long ago was not only forbidden to discuss in theater or cinema but in all public places the Truth that was prohibited and highly unwelcome the Truth about the slaughter of more than 20000 Polish best officers committed by Soviet communists in the forests of Katyn. Andrzej Wajda based his film on Andrzej Mularczyk's story POST MORTEM and consulted great Katyn witnesses including recently deceased Priest Zdzislaw Peszkowski 19182007. If the film is good or weak belongs to the opinions of particular viewers. But lots of people on the premiere day stated that it's a historic work. Why? KATYN though a movie is a wonderful documentary that supplies the viewer with TRUTHFUL information on what really happened in 1940 why it happened and who did this facts that were most distorted in many historical books and many other sources for years. Here the truth is more important than anything else. The movie contains archive footage pictures and terrific narrator. These moments are well balanced and though appearing several times do not disturb anything but make for all the rest. And what is the rest? The rest contains particularly vivid plots of families their dreams their fear husbandssons' honor wives' love and care and foremost young officers' martyrdom. The story of Andrzej Artur Zmijewski is exceptionally moving. His situation seems to represent the Poland of that time torn between two oppressors two worlds Nazi Germany who attacked it on September the 1st 1939 and communist Russia who attacked it from the east 17 days later. As a victim of Katyn massacre Andrzej appears to tell us a tragic story of separation extreme suffering but hope to the very last day the hope for survival. His notebook seems to tell us No I will live they're taking us somewhere but I'll surely see my beloved woman my loving mum and my sweet daughter. The tragic though full of hope Christmas Eve also depicts that attitude. Other characters including Jerzy Andrzej Chyra Andrzej's wife Anna Maja Ostaszewska General's wife Danuta Stenka constitute a brilliant insight into various usually helpless reactions towards evil hypocrisy injustice cruelty and neutrality.These stories are executed in an accurate and universal way. In such historic but tragic content there is usually a tendency to become either too preachy or too emotional which to some extend jerk the tears from viewers' eyes by force. Wajda does not do anything of these. He remains with the people with humanity in general does not give the final answer to anything. He seems to be with all of us and appears to depict a quest for truth quest for justice and for humanity. Besides he uses lots of very accurate symbols. The unforgettable and probably most thought provoking symbol is when Andrzej's wife looks for her husband and uncovers the bodies of soldiers. Among them she occurs to uncover the figure of Christ taken from the Cross in church and laid among the deceased. Haven't we killed God by losing respect for life? Another brilliant symbol is when Russian soldiers tear the Polish flag into two parts hanging the red part again as the Russian flag and using the white part as a foot dressing.Except for the factors described above KATYN is also a wonderful piece of work as a film. Very good cinematography moody atmosphere flawless performances. Artur Zmijewski does a brilliant job as Andrzej Maja Ostaszewska is genuine as his wife and heroic in a sense Maja Komorowska is again a real artist in her job giving a real portrayal of the caring and then mourning mother. And Andrzej Chyra as Jerzy whose conscience and solidarity do not allow him to go on...magnificent!But at the end I must tell you that it was not easy for me to write this review. The stories like this one do not lead to wordy comments much noise opinions praise or criticism. They call for silence the sacred silence that lets us honor those who died in such inhumane way. This silence shall constitute a significant message for today's generation shall help us see deeper and give us faith to believe that their lives did not end in the soil. Therefore though difficult I consider KATYN one of the most important movies I have seen in my life.Yes dear young Patriot hold Your Rosary high. The world will probably call your act the act of despair. Yet the world is befriended with lie and you are now victorious in a world of Glory and Eternal Light where there is no room for lie.

	schema:headline " The Katyn tragedy deserves a better cinematic treatment";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject  quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time in fact two of my family members died there so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately I was disappointed.I think the main problem lies with the script which encompasses too many subplots and characters none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully onedimensional their stories are intertwined but lack overall meaning. In my opinion the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra portraying Jerzy  the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him.As a result the film lacks emotion. Before seeing it I thought I would be moved if only for sentimental reasons  but in fact I was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout except for the final execution scene. It is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending although the idea of the Lord's Prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit farfetched.To conclude I suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great Andrzej Wajda has produced definitive films about the French Revolution Danton the German destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto Korczak the Polish Resistance in WWII Kanal postwar anticommunist youth Ashes and Diamonds and the beginnings of the Solidarity Movement Man of Iron. Now at the age of 81 he tackles one of the greatest tragedies in Polish historythe 1940 Katyn Forest Massacrein which the Soviets killed about 25000 Polish prisoners of war many of them officers on Stalin's orders. Wajda's accounting is nonlinear with flashbacks and flashforwards and the portentous music leaves no doubt as to what will happen but its impact is crushing and unforgettable nonetheless.I once heard a speech by Lech Walesa in which he introduced himself as being from Polanda place where the Russians used to meet the Germans quite often. In this meeting in 1939 a week after the HitlerStalin pact was signed the Germans and the Soviets both invaded and wreaked havoc on Poland. There is no need to recount the history of the Katyn Forest Massacre here there is an excellent account in Wikipedia. The key point is that after the dissolution of the pact in 1941 the USSR was able to mount a disinformation campaign that for a long time managed to pin the blame for the massacre on the Germans.Wajda deftly shows how that happened and how this coverup persisted in Poland as the USSR took control of Poland after the war. Those who tried to tell the truth including a young artist very similar to the young Wajda were dealt with summarily.What helped make the coverup believable is that the Nazis were of course culpable for other horrible acts. This is depicted when Wajda first shows the Gestapo roughly rounding up and arresting an assembly of unsuspecting distinguished university professors. By comparison the Soviet Army at first seems more honorable as they detain a large group of Polish military officers who had surrendered and were expecting the usual prisonerofwar treatment accorded to officers. As one suspicious Polish officer worriedly notes however the Soviets had not ratified the Geneva Convention. Stalin and the NKVD evidently felt the need to liquidate the Polish officer corps along with police officers etc. to smooth its eventual takeover of the country. Not till after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990 did Moscow admit to these murders.A few years before that in 1986 I took an Intourist tour of the Soviet Union. One of the stops was Minsk now Belarus. We couldn't figure out why the tour sent us there until we were taken on a short bus trip to a war memorial in a nearby village that had been wiped out by the Nazis. It was a very welldone memorial with a dramatic sculpture of a survivor and an eternal flame for the many nearby towns that had been destroyed. This particular genocidal techniqueforcing townspeople into barns and then setting the barns on firewas revealed in the equally great 1985 Russian film Come and See by Elem Klimov. It was a very moving visit. But the impact was undercut to some degree by something I read in my guidebook that this town named Khatyn might have been chosen for this memorial because it had a name similar to the Katyn Forest 160 miles away in Russia where the Soviets themselves had been accused of doing the same kind of thing. I had long wondered about thatand now I understand.Other reviewers mentioned some of the many powerful images in the film but I'll close by mentioning one that nobody has singled outthe closing scene. A young lieutenant we have gotten to know has been executed while clutching a rosary and his body along with many others has been thrown into a pit while a Soviet checks to make sure they are dead. At the same time a bulldozer begins to covering them with dirt. As the dirt covers the lieutenant's his arm with the rosary in hand makes a last fleeting movement. The symbolism is unmistakable. One coverup is complete and the next one has begun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Small spoilers included.For the first time in years I left the cinema physically stunned. My heart raced and my eyes watered. This is a masterpiece.The depiction of the 'Good Russian' was a very clever touch and avoided making the film too onesided or nationalistic.And at last this film explains to the world what Catholicism means to Poles it is not just some medieval fanaticism it is the only thing they had to keep them going through the lies and genocide of history.As a British man of Polish descent I connected with the film in a personal way and understood all of the historical references with ease.But I do fear that many of the references in the film will be lost on nonPolish audiences. Certainly British and American knowledge of the history of Eastern Europe is generally bad. Wajda knows this. Just a couple of lines of dialogue could have been used from time to time to explain the RussoPolish war of 1921 or the Polish partisan activity 19451949 or how and why some Poles joined the Soviet forces in 1943. Wajda drops these facts in as if the audience is only Polish and will understand immediately. I wish Wajda could have tailored it slightly more to the international audience as this is an important film for the Polish nation and Polish emigrant communities to communicate with the rest of the world.Hollywood frequently discusses the Jewish Holocaust. Again Wajda knows this and he could have taken the opportunity to at least touch on the subject to set the record straight. Polish Catholic prejudice against Judaism exists just as prejudice exists in every country in the world. But there were many more Polish Jews saved by Polish Catholics than were harmed by them. There were Jews in the Polish army who felt Polish first Jewish second and strictly antiSoviet. In this film showing a Polish Jew as one of the victims of Katyn would have shown that Polish Jews and Catholics were more often than not united against the Soviets and Nazis.But the main point just as with the 'Good Russian' is that it doesn't matter about your identity. There are good and bad people in the world opportunistic or moral liars or honest cowards or heroes. And they can be any race colour or creed. Eventually the opportunists liars and cowards lose the fight. For me that is the message of Katyn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone in Poland has heard of the Katyn massacre but I've been surprised and saddened at how few people in Britain know of the atrocity. In the early part of the Second World War more than 4000 Polish soldiers were executed in the Katyn forest near Smolensk in western Russia. This was part of an organised effort to eradicate the military political and intellectual leadership of Poland and a series of executions in various other locations removed some 22000 Poles from their loved ones and their nation.So who did this? The Germans claimed to have uncovered the bodies in 1943 and blamed the Soviets in an effort to embarrass and divide the Allies. The Soviet Union categorically denied the crime at the time and for decades afterwards only in 1990 admitting what the Poles and any independent assessor of the evidence knew Stalin's NKVD perpetrated the horror on his express command.The incident has now been made into a major Polish film by the acclaimed Polish director Andrzej Wajda whose own father was killed at Katyn and who is now in his 80s. The work was premiered at the Berlin film festival in 2007 it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2008 and it finally arrived in Britain in a few cinemas in the summer of 2009. It is an exceptional work  both powerful and moving  that deserves a much larger audience.Starting in 1939 with the simultaneous invasion of Poland by the Nazis and the Soviets it takes us in several jumps to the immediate postwar period and underlines that the shame of Katyn was not just the deaths of the 22000 in 1940 but the denial of the truth by so many people for so many years afterwards. Through the device of a prolonged flashback the film concludes with a return to Katyn with closeup scenes of the sheer brutality of what was unquestionably a war crime.The film is based on a novel by Andrzej Mularczyk and revolves around a number of fictional families with a fair bit of location work in Krakow a city centre that looks today much like it did in the 1940s and which I have visited. The photography and acting are both excellent and selective use of wartime film footage simply adds to the sense of verisimilitude.Footnote To my utter astonishment at the Renoir cinema in central London where I saw the film as I descended the stairs to the screen I was given a leaflet by a representation of something called The Stalin Society which insisted that the massacre was carried out by the Germans in 1943 and that Wajda's film is simply part of a sustained attempt to discredit communism at a time of economic crisis when so many people would see it as the obvious alternative to capitalism.".

	schema:headline " Slightly Disappointing Film From A Polish Master";
	schema:reviewBody "The Katyn massacre is a dark day of Polish history when as many as 20000 Polish POWs  mainly army officers were murdered in the Russian forest of Katyn by the Soviet NKVD in the Spring of 1940 . After their invasion of the Soviet Union the Nazis found the mass graves and used them as an anti Bolshevik propaganda coup . Accusation and counter accusation between the Nazis and Soviets followed but there was little doubt amongst neutral observers like the International Red Cross and the Polish government in exile that it was the Soviet Union who were behind the atrocity . This film tells the often forgotten story behind the Katyn massacre The story starts by pointing out the problem Poland had at the outbreak of the second world war . Surrounded by Germany on their Western Border and Russia on their Eastern border . Worse still Germany is ruled by racist demagogues who consider Poles  the wrong sort of Europeans  while Russia is a communist state who consider Poles to be  reactionary nationalistic Catholic fundamentalists  . In political terms the Poles have got a choice between fatal heart disease and terminal cancer and it's summed up by a conversation between two POWs  A thousand year Reich and communism lasts for ever   This alliance won't last a year . They'll need us   Who will ?  The first half hour is compelling stuff . It's slightly similar to a holocaust movie but is more complex since the characters are clutching at straws hoping that one side  if not better than the other  is less worse . The main protagonist Anna has a relative taken away by the Nazis only for him return a few months later as a pile of ashes . This proves to her the Soviets will treat her captured husband less harshly . Unfortunately they don't As the film progresses the intensity sadly lessens as more characters are introduced but distract from the plot proper . A young nationalistic Pole appears in what appears to be a cynical attempt to introduce a romantic subplot but he's killed off leaving the audience wondering why he was included in the first place . Anna is forced by the Nazi occupiers to condemn the murder of her husband and the other officers at Katyn and you'll sit there expecting this plot turn to come back to haunt her when the Soviets occupy her homeland but this thread disappears All in all this is a slightly disappointing film from Andrzej Wajda who made the classic KANAL  a film I saw once twenty years ago and is seared in to my memory . KATYN is a good film though unfortunately doesn't maintain its early brilliance . It's probably summed up by Pawel Edelman's cinematography where primary colours are to the fore but the rest of the colours are muted and cold".

It's downright gorgeous and lyrical and timeless. It's quite an extraordinary visual experience and it moves through beautiful forested and old world urban landscapes that are wonderful to just look at.But that's not the point at all. Or at least the mass murder by the Soviets of Polish officers in WWII is made more horrible by placing the crimes against such beauty. It amplifies how really wrong it is. That war and the crimes of war are inherently against nature. And good moral sense.The pace is what you might call elegiac. That is it is not quite slow but it moves as a boat down a river might with eloquence. I'm not sure that's enough in the long run to make it sublime as sublime as it intends but is really is close to a kind of cinematic poetry.There are many great performances here none of them splashy. There are beauties here women and men both but no star power nothing distracting. What matters most of all is a reminder a realignment even about historical facts and the cruelty of the Soviets against the Poles even as they were fighting the Nazis. Then of course Poland was under Soviet rule for decades so a movie like this was only possible recently. And a movie this powerful and this disturbing and this beautiful is remarkable.

	schema:headline " Perhaps good for a TV miniseries but not for the big screen";
	schema:reviewBody "Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90 of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a handheld camera which is supposed to convey the feeling of personal immediacy but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie. Instead the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick. To be fair there are some great shots too no pun intended but nothing that makes you go Wow!.If you're not familiar with the Katyn massacre the movie will leave you scratching your head. If you are familiar you'll be scratching your head too although maybe for different reasons. Basically the movie states and restates over and over again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However the movie never tries to explain as to WHY they were killed. After all tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet POW camps were not harmed and were released in 1941. It is also never explained adequately HOW MANY people perished although the figure 20000 is thrown in a couple of times.The acting is adequate with only Komorowska old woman and Chyra Lt. Jerzy giving noticeable performances but they get to act for maybe 1015 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matine looks rather than their acting abilities but I won't mention their names. Suffice to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material so any claims that this movie was robbed of the Academy Award are simply laughable.The tone of movie is wrong as well. On one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama on the other it resorts to cheap antiSoviet propaganda such as showing a Russian soldier tear up the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the Krakow University.There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting such as adding a political angle to the story or showing the German discovery of the graves or even portraying Anna's trip from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie but instead they're reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end we get a collection of loosely fitting confusing boring scenes about the reaction of Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of WWII. Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda at all.".

Thats not the best movie made in Poland this year but today we all already know thats the only movie thats going to represent Poland on the international scene. And thats why you need to see it.

Given such a momentous subject matter the film only succeeds in presenting a muddled and disconnected storyline lacking a firm editorial hand and relying too much on coincidence without a natural flow of events . The script jumps around with only a faint nod towards continuity and must appear confusing to anyone visiting the subject for the first time . Undoubtedly there are some impressive scenes in particular the opening and closing ones although too often one is irritated by a flaccid script and total lack of direction . The Polish people deserve a better treatment for one of the many horrendous crimes against them although having watched this film one can at least understand the old post war saying of Polish soldiers...'Killing Germans was one's duty but killing Russians was a pleasure !'".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening and the ending scenes in this film will be hard to forget for anybody who sees them. The opening happens on a bridge someplace in Poland in September 1939. Refugees run on the bridge from both sizes  on one side running of the Nazis on the other side from the Soviets. They have no place to run no place to hide. A strong metaphor for a nation abandoned by history.Then comes the movie a movie that Wajda wanted to make for decades about the massacre of thousands of Polish officers taken prisoners by the Russians in the first month of WWII  one of the most controversial moments and abject crimes in a war that was full of abject crimes. While the message is strong and crisp the feeling one gets is that an even better film was missed. While the stories of the families trying to find the truth about the prisoners then fighting for the truth not to be buried or used as propaganda by the two dictatorships that occupied Poland are in the center of the film the description is too direct. It looks like Wajda who is certainly a great director wanted on purpose to make a very straight indictment in this film. He was more interested in the testimony than in art.The final scene brings to screen the massacre itself. Although quite graphical in nature it is moving and unforgettable. Then for many moments the screen turns to black before credits run. The screen may have become dark but the memory lives and will live forever for those who saw this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I should mention upfront before this I had yet to see an Andrzej Wajda film not without trying of course started to watch Ashes and Diamonds didn't get through it yet. His films aren't too well known outside of the arthouse circles but his name is always known to those who peek into the newwaves of the 50s and 60s in Europe and Wajda was one of the frontrunners of the wave in Poland right before Polanski. It's then with hopefully the utmost admiration that I can recommend his latest film Katyn as a good one to start with. It doesn't mean necessarily that it's much fun but as far as films about the cover up of incredible atrocities go it is at the least fascinating and at best a stunning achievement of classical filmmaking used to present troubling events and the nature of the people who had to live with the atrocity.It's a film that has apparently already stirred up debate in its own country and abroad since it's not something new. The Katyn massacre of April 1940 which also took the like of Wajda's father was immense and horrific on a scale that is one of those top five unforgivable things Stalin OK'd but it's the fact that it was the Russians and not the Germans whom the Russians pin the blame on that keeps it controversial. But in Katyn's hands there's reason for a fuse being lit this is not a work of someone wanting to sugarcoat or make something sentimental and easy. The filmmaking style may appeal to the masses this is not something that is so arty that you couldn't take a reasonably openminded average warmovie fan to but it's the matteroffactness of the plot details the restraint and moving moments with the Polish actors the precise lack of bad Hollywood influence that imbues the story with such a passion and intensity.Basically Wajda focuses on a few key people in the film not the masterminds like Stalin or Hitler but those like the wife of Cavalry officer Andrzej Anna or his mother or his fellow friendLieutenant Jerzy who was on the Katyn list of people to be executed but somehow got away from it haunting him for the rest of his days or a teacher who knows the truth but hides behind the Soviet motherland anyway. At first we see the events leading up to it from the soldier POV and of Anna from home the simple nature of not knowing what's coming next or when someone will come home and then when we know what is about to happen it skips over into the aftermath the 1940s period the immediate postwar and the late 1950s how Poland was made occupied a character says at one point that Poland will never be a free nation and made to carry the burden of Katyn as something people talked about behind closed doors as one thing and out in public as another.Some scenes are given tremendous uplift by the acting. I've not seen any of these actors before but they're all wonderful. Watch the scene where Andrej's mother who's husband professor was taken to a camp among other professors for supposedly damning the Nazis in speech finds out that he has died while Anna reads the letter. So much is held back and yet we see so much in her eyes how she holds her late husband's objects in her hands. Or the actor who plays Jerzy Andrzej Chyra who starts to crack while trying to put a face on what he knows happened at Katyn in a big blowup at a bar when he just explodes in front of everyone while an official report is read on the radio about Katyn. And basically any scene with the principal women characters Anna Rosa they create these people in such raw terms as to support Wajda's need to strip away the melodrama.While Katyn here and there might have a rusty transition or a couple of shots done in classic epic film style that don't quite work a few crane shots are nifty like when a bunch of soldiers sing in a bunker but some could have been trimmed to equate with how the rest of the picture is shot which is more formal it is an old veteranmaster's showcase. Like Clint Eastwood or Akira Kurosawa Wajda is at an age where he knows his craft so well that certain shots and images are classic in and of themselves and are assured in creating the dark and nearly horrormovie tone in some instances. For the most part we're given the framework of a coverup story and for this Wajda directs well scenes of people being hidden or someone being forced to sign something full of lies or running fast away from soldiers.But then it comes to the last five to ten minutes when Anna is given the diary that Andrzej wrote right before he was executed. This is one of those endings that will likely kick the crap out of you emotionally whatever your durability with grisly images. And wisely music is used by Wajda in these murders in a meaningful way what we hear is familiar and it is since it's from the bathroom scene with the old woman from The Shining. It sends chills sharp and thick. And only at the end are we given a moment of release a good long one over a black screen before the credits roll with harrowing emotional music. Katyn is made with the care of a superb filmmaker and of a soul who cares about how his country blunders miserably while doing something for his own lineage only The Pianist tops it for decade's most personal WW2 drama.".

I am German of Polish decent and found this film to be a monosyllabic statement of the obvious namely the fact that Bolshevik soldiers are responsible for the killing of tenth of thousands polish officers and intellectuals. The movie let's the Germans off the hook too lightly in my opinion and seems only motivated by an albeit understandable personal desire for revenge. This massacre would not have been possible though if it wasn't for the HitlerStalin pact or Germany invading Poland or Germany's consent to the communist treatment of the polish officers after they became POWs. Nowhere is a comment to be found about what an irony it is that German soldiers discovered the massgraves in Katyn almost to the point of being relieved to find out that they are not the only people being capable of massmurder or falling prey to the temptation to be radically dehumanized by delusional claims of power. This onesided and quite patriotic treatment of polish history would have been OK though if it weren't for fundamental weaknesses in script structure and storytelling. Like many fellow viewers stated before Katyn delivers a mangled storyline with too many characters showing up and vanishing quickly without a trace so that they remain strangely onedimensional. Meetings by chance falling in love being killed the next second it really owns more to the soapopera than cinema even if it's maybe more true to life than the old formulas of the silverscreen. The end of the film has quite an impact but it is an impact easy to achieve by scenes of this nature and I was kind of hoping Wajda would avoid the easy road.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart whimsey and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen 1938 George C. Scott 1984 and Patrick Stewart 2001.  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.  Statler and Waldorf as Jacob  Robert Marley are appropriately heckling as they seek to convince Scrooge to change his ways.  Kermit the Frog is a wonderfully sympathetic Bob Crachit just as Miss Piggy is appropriately and aggressively belligerent Mrs. Crachit.  Perhaps one of the betterinspired comedy bits comes with the arrival of Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past at Scrooge's former workplace described as Fozziwig's Rubber Chicken Factory.  Such bits are frequent and help to keep the story fun.  Paul Williams' music score and songs are eminently singable and leave the viewer with a lasting memory.A Muppet Christmas Carol has joined the pantheon of classic holiday films easily ranking alongside Holiday Inn White Christmas and A Christmas Story. It is the opinion of this reviewer that for those whom holiday films have become a part of holiday celebration should make this a part of their seasonal experience.  One might even complete the film humming the tunes and thinking better of themselves as well as of their fellow humans.  In other words Henson and company have made Dickens story as memorable as Dickens himself wished it to be.".

	onyx:emotionText "While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart whimsey and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen 1938 George C. Scott 1984 and Patrick Stewart 2001.  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.

	schema:reviewBody "That question pretty much sums up my reaction to The Muppet Christmas Carol a hilarious yet touching film.What did I like about the movie?  Just about everything!  Michael Caine made a great Scrooge and this film showed us possibly better than just about any other version I've seen just how Scrooge came to be such a miser although that could partly be because the versions I saw which really go into Scrooge's childhood were clearly adult versions which meant they could be more subtle in their explanations.  To Caine's eternal credit he made Scrooge very believable which is no small feat considering most of his fellow cast members were puppets.And what about the Muppets?  They were also brilliant!  Kermit made an excellent Bob Cratchit loyal and humble and he had a wonderful tribute to Tiny Tim which also served as a brilliant tribute to Jim Henson.  Miss Piggy was a great Mrs. Cratchit feisty yet very loving toward Bob the worst of her temper was thankfully muted by the story.  Fozzie the Bear was a hilarious Fozziwig and The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made a great team having some of the best lines out there my favorite is Rizzo's Light the lamp not the rat!  Light the lamp not the rat!.  The ghosts were definitely believable and in the case of the two Marley Brothers hilarious as well.  Incidentally the original text had only one Marley  Jacob but to get the two comedians from the balcony in the story Robert Marley was added.Finally the songs were rather good with the best one in my humble opinion being When Love is Gone.So I firmly recommend The Muppet Christmas Carol to one and all.Belle Book".

	schema:headline " The very best of all the Muppet Movies!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Muppet Christmas Carol is my favourite of all the Muppet flicks. Jim Henson of course never lent his name to anything even remotely resembling 'bad' but nevertheless there is a clear mark of sheer mastery and brilliance in this movie that is somehow less evident in most of the other muppet movies.In a way I have to admit that I find this surprising. This was the first Muppet movie to be shot after Henson himself passed away the voice of kermit the most beloved and indeed inventive puppeteer ever to have lived was dead. Could Henson's magic touch ever be recreated? Did the Muppets have a future at all without their creator? The answer of course we now know is Yes they did.As is the secret to all truly great children's movies The Muppet Christmas Carol does not pander to notions of anything being 'too scary' nor does it shy away from the innate darkness of the material at hand. Dicken's tale is one that revolves almost uniformly around themes of corruption poverty and death and here it has most certainly not been diluted.There was the year we evicted the entire orphanage! I remember the little tykes all standing in the snowbank with their little frostbitten teddy bears! hollers a ghostly apparition of Scrooge's dead business partner early in the film. We witness a heartbreaking lament from Scrooge's lover who leaves him because he has become too moneyhungry to love her. We watch as Bob Cratchett's family mourn the empty chair at their table where their beloved and selfless young son once sat. At the eleventh hour scrooge even bends before his own tombstone and begs in tears of desperation to a grim reaperlike spirit to be allowed to live. So much for it being the season to be jolly.Where there is humour it is frequently black and where there is emotion it is generally somewhat adult by todays standards. Of course before you decide not to show this to your five year old son or daughter you should consider that these dark themes by no means drag the film down rather they help to raise it up to become just like the original story a stirring and emotional story of triumph and redemption in the face of mortality. Whilst the script writers wisely keep the story pretty much identical to the original in all of it's major aspects there is plenty mayhem and indeed magic here too which is 24 carat Henson Studios. I remember as a 5 year old simply adoring the spectacle of Kermit's Bob Cratchett taking part in a the Penguins of London Annual Christmas Skating party or the delight of Gonzo and Rizzo's almost postmodernist presence as physical participants but also omnipotent narrators in the tale. Indeed the translation from book to screen is almost peculiarly elegant the Muppet characters all seem to open up to new ranges of poignancy and dramatic possibility when placed in the storyline. You will find yourself feeling immense pity for Miss Piggy's somewhat hysterical but ultimately warm Mrs Cratchett for example and indeed a whole host of wonderful performances on show from the familiar Muppet Show Cast. Of course this review could not be complete without tribute to the simply brilliant performance from the great Michael Cane in the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. he understands his role excellently and invests it with a moving convincing and genius reality always resisting the temptation that must surely be strongly felt when one is the sole human among a cast of felt puppets to play the role for laughs. One feels that his performance would not seem out of place if he were surrounded by the ranks of great British thespians and taking part in a 'straight' production of Dicken's tale as opposed to a Muppet movie. Upon recently viewing the Patrick Stewart film of this story I was delighted to find that Cane quite simply outacted Stewart in the role and clearly this makes his performance something special.The production values are high in this film as is to be expected in a Henson movie and the film has a wonderful almost Tim Burtonesquire look which is by turns wintry and quite breathtakingly beautiful or dark and positively scary. In terms of music it is filled with an array of wonderfully enduring and subtly written songs that fill me with a sense of childlike happiness and that allusive 'christmassey feeling' even after all these years. One recommendation I would make to anyone planning on purchasing the film is to if at all possible obtain a copy which contains the beautiful song When Love Is Gone which in the recent DVD rerelease was sadly cut from the film. This decision to exclude the song from the film detracts hugely from the pathos of one of the film's central themes past Mistakes and ultimate redemption and definitely takes away some of the indescribably bittersweet overall mood of the film.I strongly recommend this film to people of any age or gender as a film that it is virtually impossible not to fall in love with.".

	schema:headline " Pleasant surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "The Muppet Christmas Carol  even the name fills one with trepidation. After all how else can we approach the first largescale Muppet project since the death of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt especially when it came so close on the heels of drastically increased commercialization of the franchise symbolized if not outright created by the Muppets' sale to Disney? That's why the film turns out to be such a pleasant and even occasionally delightful surprise. It's not perfect by any means and I guess I might as well start with the problems first. There's a lot of padding including some rather cruddy songs for the Cratchits. Frank Oz in his few scenes seems to be phoning it in and his Piggy voice has become so strained that's it's painful to listen to. And Steve Whitmire while he performs an honorable even admirable impression can never approach Jim Henson's interpretation of Kermit for anyone who knew it first.And yet there's a kind of magic that creeps in and reminds us many times of the early Muppet Show days and their wonderful insanity. Throwaway gags like Please sir  I want some cheese and the running commentary of Gonzo and Rizzo give the film that unmistakably Muppety flavor.And not only is the movie good Muppets it's good Dickens which is perhaps more surprising. In fact in some ways it's hard to imagine a better musical adaptation of A Christmas Carol  it's certainly better than either of the other two musical Scrooges that first come to mind. To choose a random point of overlap where Albert Finney and Kelsey ugh Grammar make their entrances hobbling along and singing their crabby wee hearts out Michael Caine stalks silently in while the chorus comments on him. Like Bill Sikes in Carol Reed's Oliver! this pretransformation Scrooge doesn't have the time or the patience for singing as of course he shouldn't. Paul Williams's songs themselves vary in quality and Caine while in most respects an aboveaverage Scrooge is no singer but the opening chorus and Scrooge's buoyant revelation number are terrifically tuneful and wonderfully orchestrated with a brassy classically Christmasy texture. Having chains physically drag Marley or rather the Marleys back into the netherworld would be a marvelous idea in a straight adaptation and having the elderly Scrooge join in a sad duet with his decadeslost love is genuinely moving. The Muppet effects for the ghosts while simple are extremely effective and very true to Henson's vision of elegant beautiful and frequently spooky puppet artistry.In the end it may not be a perfect film but it's more than worth a look both for Muppet fans and casual viewers. And of course kids of all ages will love it. 7.5 out of 10.".

Much of the dialogue is lifted directly from the original story and I believe children might gain an appreciation for both Charles Dickens and the Henson family if this is read as a family project before watching the movie. It is a true masterpiece.ps While I was a church lady for a local Presbyterian church I purchased the video of The Muppet Movie.

Michael Caine turns in a perfect performance as Ebenezer Scrooge.  I cry with him when his girlfriend Belle leaves him. This is a very touching story with a light dusting of comedic relief. Though most of the characters are muppets the story flows beautifully with a minimum of nonsense.  The one exception is the perhaps too silly visitation by Jacob and Robert Marley.

But before he died he 'told' my father he could barely speak at that time but his gestures meant enough to buy us a Christmas present from the money he was clutching in his hand. With that money my father bought us this video The Muppet Christmas Carol.It would be the last time in seven years my family would celebrate Christmas this year is the first time in all these years we are trying it again and so far so good But every year I'd go through my closet and watch this movie. I didn't know this was the first Muppet feature since Jim Henson's death... but as this movie was a tribute to the genius The Muppet Christmas Carol is for me a tribute to my grandpa.And still after all these years I still love this movie with all my heart. It's truly a classic it's inventive it's funny it's moving at times heartwrenching always entertaining and touching. I have loved Michael Caine since his portrayal of Scrooge and I still think it is one of his more phenomenal performances. The transformation his character goes through in the tale he portrays masterfully and in the beginning of the movie you hate him during the movie and the journey he takes through his past present and future you feel for him and at the end you love him like everybody else. The Muppets are as adorable as always and I LOVED the family Kermit and Miss Piggy formed together. I will always love Tiny Tim. I will always love this movie.Just my two cents worth see The Muppet Christmas Carol with the entire movie. It's a great classic tale for all ages.".

Wolpor and beautifully directed by John Guillermin the picture has over the years gained something of a cult status and besides being a great favourite with collectors is regarded as one of the more memorable war classics of cinema. Released through United Artists it was photographed in Panavision and colour to dazzling affect by Stanley Cortez and is underlined throughout with a super gutsy score by the always welcome Elmer Bernstein. Also of note is the location filming. It was filmed in 1968 not in Germany but in Czechoslovakia which wonderfully doubled for Germany with the Remagen Bridge scenes shot at Davie on the Vitava River using the old bridge where fake towers were constructed.It is the closing weeks of WW2 and the only escape route for Germany's 15th. Army is across the Obercassell Bridge over the Rhine at Remagen. But Berlin wants it destroyed in case the Americans can put it to their own use. Germany's General Von Brock Peter Van Eyck instructs Major Paul Kreuger Robert Vaughan to blow it up but to delay its destruction as long as possible so as to facilitate most of the 75000 retreating German troops who will be crossing the bridge. Meanwhile the Americans under acting C.O. Lt. Phil Hartman George Segal head towards the bridge to destroy it. But later however Brig. Gen. Shinner E. G. Marshall changes his mind and decides not to destroy it but to secure it instead. The picture ends with the Americans storming the bridge and taking it.Performances are superb from all concerned. Taking the lead is George Segal as the laid back cynical but dutiful C.O. Usually cast in romantic comedies this was a real departure for the actor and is the best thing he has ever done. Excellent too is Robert Vaughan as the ill fated German commander desperately trying first to save the bridge then failing to destroy it and Ben Gazzara as Angel the colourful brash and thieving Sergeant. Those in smaller roles are also outstanding like Bradford Dillman as the the self absorbed Major detested and distrusted by his company and the always impressive Peter van Eyck as the General of the German high command. This was to be Van Eyck's final screen appearance. He died the same year from Sepsis at the age of 54. And carrying the whole thing along is the rollicking score by the always pleasing Elmer Bernstein. Best known for his many scores for westerns the composer here turned in a powerful score of great depth and excitement. His main theme is a dramatic martial statement which segues into a reflective melancholy theme pointing up the plight of the many hapless refugees trying desperately to cross the bridge to safety and not forgetting the bold and engaging trumpet theme for the German Command. The score is Bernstein's best work for a war movie.THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is a gripping and exciting well produced war epic and hasn't dated at all since it was made in the sixties. It remains one of the best post war movies of its kindAn ironic postscript on the final frame of the movie reads Ten days after the Americans captured the Obercassell Bridge it collapsed and fell into the Rhine.".

	schema:headline " One of the most intelligent and best of the sixties war movies  well performed and finely directed";
	schema:reviewBody "Spectacular and exciting warlike movie based on famous event about the Bridge at Remagen . This Blockbuster is one of the biggest war films ever made. It's a magnificent film recreating the known offensive by Allied army on the German front during 1945 .What happened during those desperate days that could have changed the course of war is now history .

However despite the best U.S. efforts on 17 March 1945 ten days after its capture the Bridge at Remagen succumbed to the cumulative damage from German bombing and collapsed killing twentyeight soldiers of the Army Corps of Engineers. However because the pontoon bridges and other secured crossing points had supplanted the bridge its loss was neither tactically nor strategically significant. Still the Ludendorff Bridge remained important as the first point at which Allies crossed the Rhine.".

	schema:reviewBody "American director John Guillermin known for several epic clunkers pulls together this rather tense look at one of the most important battles of World War II American forces clash with the Germans at Remagen where the last intact bridge over the Rhine stands between the two opposing forces.The script divides attention evenly and fairly between the two forces. George Segal The Longest Day is Lt. Hartman a burned out and pretty tired junior officer who doesn't want to accept the responsibilities of command when his company commander is killed. The war is almost over and Hartman is concerned with getting his men home. On the other side of the river German Major Kreuger Robert Vaughn is equally concerned with saving lives  German lives. He becomes obsessed with keeping the bridge intact in order to allow retreating German soldiers to attack despite orders from the High Command to blow up the bridge to prevent its' capture by the Allies.The supporting cast is filled with fine performances. The standouts are Hans Christian Blech Battle of the Bulge as Captain Schmidt a weary Wehrmacht Officer who feels his duty is to protect the civilians whom Kreuger puts in harm's way by continuing a hopeless fight. Blech's acting ability ranges from quiet humility to occasional fits of rage bringing a dimensionality to a role not commonly found in war epics. Joachim Hansen Breakthrough disagrees with Schmidt he is devoted to the High Command and wants a battle with the Americans more than anything. Both actors bring passion to their roles and make these very believable wartime officers not simply normal caricatures and stereotypes.Guillermin takes these characters and puts them in intense combat situations making their humanity all the more believable. The best battle scene in the film has a platoon of American soldiers advancing onto the bridge under a smokescreen but while they are in the open the smoke begins to clear giving the Germans a clear field of fire. As some men are shot in the open others move underneath the bridge to try and rip off as many explosives as they can before the Germans can ignite a secondary fuse to blow up the bridge.In the aftermath of battle scenes like this the human drama unfolds. Sgt. Angelo Ben Gazzara Fireball Forward is a tough GI who loots the bodies of the dead and sees the war around him as a chance to get rich and take the wealth home when it's all over. But when he must shoot a Hitler Youth member who is sniping at his men then weeps when he realizes he has shot a mere preteenage boy. During a lull in the siege on the bridge Hartman faces off with Maj. Barnes Bradford Dillman who wants him to take his men onto the bridge and capture it despite enemy fire and the threat of the bridge's imminent destruction. Hartman argues that he cannot risk the lives of his men Barnes states that it will help to end the war faster is the bridge is captured thus saving more lives in the end. It's a tough choice to make and both decisions have their drawbacks.The performances are complimented by three crucial technical elements scoring scenery and cinematography. Elmer Bernstein provides a sweeping score which resounds with the troops when they are victorious yet mourns and seems to cry during some heartwrenching scenes such as an important scene between Angelo Hartman and Schmidt at the film's conclusion. The Czech locations look magnificent  the film looks and feels real because it was lensed in Europe in a location which passes for Germany perfectly. The cobblestones streets rustic villages rolling hills and clear rivers look amazing. Finally Stanley Cortez's cinematography is fantastic the composition of every shot looks wellplanned and detailed. There is action going on in the background and foreground most of the time. The focus is not just on the main characters but as in real life there is stuff going on around them. Scenes of the battle on the bridge are standouts as the action is captured from every possible angle it's very clear what's going on and who is where at all times.The Bridge at Remagen is a fine World War II film which succeeds in showing history American patriotism and the horrors of war at the same time. It will leave you feeling glad that the Allies won the war and agonized over the great cost of such small gains. But when you realize how much a small gain really matters in the big picture it won't seem as small anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Bridge at Remagen' has for what ever reason largely been lost or forgotten by today's moviegoing public. I think this is a real shame because the sensibilities and attitudes that the film has toward it's own themes fit very much into the modern moviegoer's. Films like 'The Big Red One' 'Saving Private Ryan' 'The Thin Red Line' and a host of other modern war films owe their dark edge to earlier films like 'The Bridge at Remagen.' 'The Bridge at Remagen' is about worn out soldiers. It is a film that doesn't like war and stews in bitterness. George Segal's world weary eyes are matched only by Robert Vaughn's. Two men one an American and the other a German who are trying less to kill the others forces than they are trying to just keep the men that they command. Segal has been ordered to capture the town around the bridge. He's told not to worry about the bridge because it is assumed that the Germans will have blown it up themselves by the time he gets there with his troops or that the Allied air force will bomb it in order to trap and destroy the German 15th Army ... an army on the wrong side of the bridge. Vaughn excellently playing the conflicted Major Kruger is ordered to blow up the bridge. The 70000 troops of the 15th Army and countless civilians are to be sacrificed at the greater expense of protecting Berlin. The General who gives Major Kruger the order to blow up the bridge suggests that holding the bridge for as long as possible so that fleeing troops and civilians can escape might not be a bad idea. This ultimately leads to tragedy for both sides.The film is highlighted by worn out lower level officers who must command on the front lines and the incompetent or uncaring officers who outrank them. These lower ranking officers and their men are merely pawns to be pushed beyond the breaking point and destroyed. The lower level officers see letters of condolence that they need to write for the families of the fallen men serving under them. The higher ranking officers see flags on maps. 'The Bridge at Remagen' is deeply cynical and highly embittered. Although it is in my mind superior in every way to similarly themed films like 'Anzio' It was overshadowed and consumed by films with bigger budgets and star power. Need one look much further than 'A Bridge Too Far'? The two leads Segal and Vaughn are both tremendous and are playing their parts in top form. Vaughn especially turns in some of the best work of his career.The only real flaws in 'The Bridge at Remagen' aren't too serious but they are strong enough to detract overall. The direction does lean toward heavyhanded pedantics and this can become aggravating. Only having a soldier standing in front of the camera and yelling WAR IS BAD! WAR IS BAD! over and over again would it have been more 'in your face.' The movie also suffers from some pacing issues especially early on although I think it is redeemed by the hard and gritty ending.'The Bridge at Remagen'  very much worth taking a look at if you can find it and almost certainly belongs with pride on the DVD shelf of any serious WW2 film fan.".

Why this movie isn't just as big as the other big war movies of the 60'sthe guns of Navarro bridge to far is probably because it was to realistic for the times! acting is good only problem is that the Germans speak a little bit to good English but the action is topnotch especially the big tank battle scene in the middle of the movie is one of the best war scenes i've ever seen till this day!!!The Bridge scene is also very impressive with tanks that destroy huge apartment blocks! this was a big budget movie at the time you can tell you can't count the extra's walking around and the destruction is as realistic as I've ever seen !!TRULY A MUST SEE FOR WAR MOVIE LOVERS!!!".

Why this movie isn't just as big as the other big war movies of the 60'sthe guns of Navarro bridge to far is probably because it was to realistic for the times! acting is good only problem is that the Germans speak a little bit to good English but the action is topnotch especially the big tank battle scene in the middle of the movie is one of the best war scenes i've ever seen till this day!!!The Bridge scene is also very impressive with tanks that destroy huge apartment blocks! this was a big budget movie at the time you can tell you can't count the extra's walking around and the destruction is as realistic as I've ever seen !!TRULY A MUST SEE FOR WAR MOVIE LOVERS!!!";

Only they know of the finality of the gunfire and the smell it left in the air along with the smell of the dead bodies. But as a combat veteran I was impressed by this movie as it retained the tension and fear involved in war. I do not like most movies because they gloss over reality but this movie closely shows the different types of individuals that usually make up an army. There are the commanders at the top who see the overall picture the selfcentered career minded officer types who reap only contempt and the officers and their N.C.O.son the American side armored infantrythat just do what they have to do and are just trying to survive. It also shows the close emotional bonds that war can create between soliders involved in battle. This movie keeps it dirty with nothing very unbelievable. It gives a good idea of an armored division on the moveand that ain't much fun.".

I think most of the technical flaws uniformsweapons both American and Germancan be overlooked by the quality of what they did get right and the only real tactical flaw that I can't forgive is the outintheopen American tank vs German Flak battery duel.

This movie doesn't fall into that trap. The characters  both German and American  are believable and the movie sets and the equipment used with the glaring exception of Korean War era American tanks are authentic for the period. With so many WWII Sherman tanks and other vehicles still in museums private collections and at least back in the 60s still in use in large numbers in the armies of several smaller countries it has always been a puzzle to me as to why so many moviemakers took the simple option and used anachronistic military hardware in WWII movies presumably assuming that the average moviegoer wouldn't even notice or wouldn't care. The most horrible example of this is the 1965 movie Battle Of The Bulge. But I digress. Ignoring the tank factor The Bridge At Remagen is a great movie. The best performance among many strong ones in this film has to be that of Ben Gazzara as Sergeant Angel Angelo and the scene in which he kills the German sniper is extremely strong moving stuff.

It is a well written film that does a commendable job of getting the setting right starting with the sweeping opening shot of the bridge at the center of the action. There are nice touches throughout the film. In one early series the German commander receives orders to blow up the bridge which he knows will trap his troops on the wrong side of the river meanwhile the American commander tells his staff not to even worry about the bridge because he assumes that either the Germans or Allied bombers will destroy it anyway. This provides a subtle statement about the futility of war where two armies will fight a battle over control of a bridge which apparently nobody wants.The battle sequences are well staged and the main characters are given sufficient depth to make the film work as a human drama. One quibble I have about the film is the age of the actors. On average American GI's in the second world war would have been in their midtwenties yet almost every actor playing an American soldier in this film appears to be in his mid to late thirties Bo Hopkns being a notable exception. Ben Gazzara and George Segal were both closing in on forty when this film was made and they look it  Gazzara in particular. It detracts from an otherwise strong film when the impression is given that the US soldiers were fighting off middle age as well as the Germans.".

The bridge in the movie is on the Vltava river in Davle south of Prague. I visited it a month ago. When you stand on it it seems much narrower than in the movie. It was a road bridge in reality the railroad was built as a set for the movie. The remains of the railroad tunnel the entry of which was also built for the movie is visible behind a real railroad that runs perpendicular to the bridge and parallel to the river along its eastern bank. Today it serves as a pedestrian bridge. I cannot upload a picture here but here is one on the web taken during the floods in 2002 httpimg.radio.czgaleriepovodneprehradydavlemost1.jpg".

Of course not. But still I enjoy movies like Battle of the Bulge and The Bridge at Remagen and 70's epics like A Bridge Too Far and Midway all though the last one is streaching it not because the storyline is very coherent or even remotely interesting but because it manages to capture the feeling of grandeur that you are witnessing a recreation of something massive the type of movies where you see every buck spent up there on the big screen either put into gasoline for a dozen Sherman tanks or blocks of buildings being blown to bits.In many of these movies there is also quite often a rare chance to see more moviestars in one movie then you normally see in ten movies! This last bit is not the case when it comes to The Bridge at Remagen. Sure Robert Vaughn was a star so was George Segal and Ben Gazzara but they were far from international superstars. Still the casting is very entertaining giving the WW2genre a bit of fresh air all though Bradford Dillman seems almost wasted as an hole of a major who cares more about his own career than his men. And you know you won't be riddled with superstars in a movie that announces E. G. Marshall as the big guest star. Sure he was a great actor but he wasn't exactly the Henry Fonda of guest stars.In many ways Ben Gazzara steals the show with his complex character but I still personally enjoyed Robert Vaughn even more. From his opening scene  when he enters in his cool majoroutfit and the type of sunglasses that never go out of style  to the final poignant scene Vaughn delivers one of the most memorable German officers ever portrayed onscreen by an American actor. Apart from Vaughn what sticks in my mind is Hans Christian Blech's portrayal of Capt. Schmidt who in one scene towards the end that includes a brief conversation with a uniformed child reveals his true background and very effectively sums up the sickness of war. Damn come to think about it The Bridge at Remagen left me with more sympathy for the Germans than for the allies which is something you don't see every day at least not in the 1960's!The plot of The Bridge at Remagen feels somewhat aloof and it takes time to really get involved maybe because of it's weird true story Germans need to blow up bridge Germans trying to hold bridge for as long as possible Americans wanting to blow up bridge too Germans trying to blow bridge Americans then wanting to save the bridge and... oh... well as history has proven time and time again real life is weirder than any fiction.".

One scene that looked a bit phoney was the one showing US tanks neatly lined up shooting at German guns also neatly lined up and not concealed or camoflaged. Of course the US tanks win the engagement while losing only one tank set ablaze. In my opinion the film is not too violent for kids but there is one scene of a barracks whore played by Anna Gael stripping to the waist after taking cigarettes as payment.

Because the Remagen Bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it. They knew how vital the battle was.This film has little to do with real history.

	schema:headline " An AntiHeroic War Film";
	schema:reviewBody "In March 1945 during the Allies' final advance into Germany the U.S. 9th Armored Division succeeded in capturing the Ludendorff Bridge in the Rhineland town of Remagen. This was an important event because it was the only significant bridge still standing over the Rhine and its capture meant that the U.S. Army could cross it immediately with heavy tanks artillery pieces and supply trucks thus establishing a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the river without the need for an amphibious crossing. The Bridge at Remagen tells a fictionalised version of these events. Virtually all war films made during World War II itself and most of those made during the following decades took a strongly patriotic approach with the heroic Americans or British putting the villainous Axis forces to flight. There were however a few which took a more objective nuanced look at the war. Bridge on the River Kwai and Ice Cold in Alex are two fine examples which come to mind and this film is another. The three main characters on the American side are Major Barnes Lieutenant Hartman and Sergeant Angelo generally known as Angel. Barnes is an aggressive gungho officer determined to capture the bridge at all costs although he is motivated less by belief in the Allied cause than by a desire to further his own military career by impressing his superiors. Hartman by contrast is becoming disillusioned and weary of the war his main motivation is to get home alive along with as many of his men as possible. He has reluctantly been promoted to company commander following the death of his more reckless predecessor. He despises Barnes whom he sees as putting his own interests before the lives of the men under his command. Angel also at first seems like a man who puts his own interests before all else in his case by trying to make a profit out of anything he can steal. Early in the film we see him picking the pockets of a corpse much to Hartman's disgust. Later on however Angel is humanised by his exposure to the darker side of war especially after he is forced to shoot a German civilian who has opened fire on his unit only to find that he has killed a teenage boy. The main character on the German side is Major Paul Krger the officer charged with defending the bridge. Krger is not portrayed as a stereotypical Nazi but as an honourable Wehrmacht officer with a strong sense of duty. He is however confronted with two difficulties. The first is that he has been given two sets of mutually contradictory orders. The German High Command on Hitler's instructions has commanded that all bridges across the Rhine should be destroyed but Krger's immediate superior General von Brock has ordered him to hold the Remagen Bridge for as long as possible to enable the German 15th Army trapped on the west bank of the river to escape. His second difficulty is that he has been allocated insufficient troops to do the job. Unlike many war films this is not a simple tale of the triumph of American heroism over Nazi villainy but rather a psychological study of men at war. It features a number of very convincing performances especially from George Segal as Hartman Ben Gazzara as Angel and Robert Vaughn as Krger. Hartman and Krger may be on different sides but both are shown as fundamentally decent if flawed characters. We do see evidence of German brutality and treachery but against this must be set Barnes's callous disregard of the human cost of his actions and a scene where American planes strafe unarmed German civilians trying to flee across the bridge. It is not an antiwar film in the way in which say Catch22 or Oh! What a Lovely War are antiwar but it can be seen as an antiheroic war film with no attempt to paint one side as wholly good or the other as wholly evil. In place of glory or heroics it shows us ordinary people both soldiers and civilians trying to survive the war with their lives or their honour intact. Director John Guillermin made some other good war films including I Was Monty's Double and The Blue Max which also showed some of its German characters in a sympathetic light but The Bridge at Remagen is the best of his which I have seen. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King who began his career still in 1915 Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a bestseller by Han Suyin called simply A Many Splendored Thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson where that many splendored word love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of God. Made in the 50s the film marked along with works by such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity.     The story begins when a handsome American reporter Mark Elliott played by William Holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible playboy' roles comes to the Hong Kong and meets there a young and pretty Han Suyin Jennifer Jones of halfChinese halfEnglish origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Instantly Mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by Han's heart left cold after the death of her husband I believe in human heart now only as a doctor'. But very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell Mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing even by the fact that Mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence.   Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made Love is a Many Splendored Thing features fine performances from William Holden and Jennifer Jones wonderful Academy Award winning musical score by Alfred Newman and extremely romantic touching heartwarming but ultimately heartbreaking story. Don't miss that many splendored film. 810".

Made in the 50s the film marked along with works by such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity.     The story begins when a handsome American reporter Mark Elliott played by William Holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible playboy' roles comes to the Hong Kong and meets there a young and pretty Han Suyin Jennifer Jones of halfChinese halfEnglish origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Instantly Mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by Han's heart left cold after the death of her husband I believe in human heart now only as a doctor'. But very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell Mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing even by the fact that Mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence.   Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made Love is a Many Splendored Thing features fine performances from William Holden and Jennifer Jones wonderful Academy Award winning musical score by Alfred Newman and extremely romantic touching heartwarming but ultimately heartbreaking story. Don't miss that many splendored film. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "In the book The Films of William Holden the author says the film does not wear well and its popularity is due to the hit title song from the film that you could not get away from hearing in 1955. How well I remember though I was only eight years old back then. I disagree the film is a tremendous romance for those who like that and the location photography in Hong Kong is fabulous.A few things struck me. Since Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr had their famous romantic swimming scene in From Here to Eternity I think that Harry Cohn was trying to one up Darryl Zanuck with having Bill Holden and Jennifer Jones do the same.I also think and I could cite other film examples from 20th Century Fox that Zanuck acquired the film rights for the original novel with Tyrone Power in mind for the male lead. Holden is fine in the part but try and picture Power in it. Not to mention the fact that Power's favorite director Henry King is at the helm. But it is true that the song is the real star of the film. It really carries the romantic plot along. One of the great examples of the right music making a good film.Ironically both the stars dealt with a lot of heartache in their lives. Holden with his alcoholism and Jones with the various marriages and deaths of people close to her. But when you see them high on that windy hill in Hong Kong they are a pair of the most romantic lovers ever filmed.RIP Bill Holden and Jennifer Jones. Both of you dealt with so much bad karma in your lives.".

My favorite line is The greatest strength is gentleness and William Holden portrays an intelligent gentleman. He and Jones looked fantastic in their swimsuits and when she asked him to bring her a cigarrette behind the rocks I thought for sure they were going to have a torrid make out scene. Or at least torrid by 1955 standards. But no she makes him wait! Also a woman physician who is Eurasian was quite an idea back then. This movie was way ahead of it's time in many respects.

	schema:reviewBody "Love is a ManySplendored Thing is set in Hong Kong in 194950 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott a white American journalist and Han Suyin a halfChinese halfEuropean doctor. This story of a mixedrace love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties and as it often did Hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly nonCaucasian woman who falls in love with a white man something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. Think for example of the casting of Ava Gardner in Show Boat or Natalie Wood in West Side Story The setting of the story in a British colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. As was sometimes the case European colonialism was made the whippingboy for some of America's own failings. Imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixedrace woman doctor in a hospital in Alabama.Besides racial issues the film also raises questions of international politics referring to both the Communist seizure of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a wellknown author of the period in reality she tended to support Mao's Communist regime but here she is shown as firmly antiCommunist. This is not however primarily an issue movie about either racialism or politics but rather a romance a good example of what would have been known at the time as a woman's picture. Such films although mostly made by male directors were mostly aimed at female audiences. They dealt with love and romance often unhappy romance from the woman's point of view and had a strong female character in the leading role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. Earlier examples were normally in monochrome but by the fifties they generally as here used lush sumptuous colour.Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role Jennifer Jones does a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden as Mark rather uncharismatic but this does not matter much as Suyin is very much the dominant figure. She is screen much more than Mark and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful she was in her midthirties rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. Holden was about the same age unusually for the fifties when boymeetsgirl often meant older man meets girl.The film is not particularly profound but is wellmade with some attractive photography particularly of Hong Kong itself reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. Seldom can Hong Kong have looked so beautiful the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning as this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic assignments. The overall mood is one of poignant doomed romance a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I purchased the DVD for this one having seen the trailer for it on another DVD. I am fascinated by the film for several reasons and wonder whether it was really filmed in Hong Kong. The paradisiac scenery of the film continuous anticyclonic weather clear blue skies the beautiful hill with the tree behind the hospital a deserted beach etc etc all seem to have very little to to with the pictures we see of HK today  rain mist and thousands of skyscrapers ... could it really be the same place or was the film in reality shot elsewhere ? Perhaps HK internauts could confirm or deny ! Does that hill with its tree really exist.In French the film is called  La Colline de l'Adieu   Goodbye hill Apart from this I don't like the Cinemascope format all the characters seem to small so I have to use the zoom on my DVD to fill the screen  losing picture detail in the process of course .Perhaps Mr William Holden liked the Orient I'd already seen him in Suzie Wong and it was interesting to compare the two films. SW was more gutsy and crude than LIAMST.I love the theme music of this film and have countless different recordings of it. I also loved both actors both Holden and Jones were beautiful people. Repeated viewings of the DVD have brought me to like the film more and more but I would have preferred just a little more passion in the love scenes. Also JJ as a Chinese person leaves a little to be desired beautiful though she is she doesn't have the mannerisms of a Chinese person. It would be interesting to have an Oriental point of view on this one.Should I add that the FINAL scene on the hill tightens the spectator's throat to a point of near suffocation !".

	schema:reviewBody "Age cannot tarnish the beauty of this Eastwest love story for me. Ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of countercurrents involving social conformity bigotry war doubt and the need for immense courage. With Hong Kong as the backdrop this movie tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and a U.S. journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean War. As Mark Elliott William Holden is intelligent breezy and a bit weak Jennifer Jones is perhaps wellnighperfect as Dr. Han Suyin by turns doubttorn and ecstatic eager and hesitant. Others in the large cast include Torin Thatcher Isobel Elsom Murray Matheson Virginia Gregg Richard Loo Soo Yong Philip Ahn Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell many of Hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also. The script by John Patrick followed Han's exquisite novel closely the direction by Henry King was solid as always. The thrust of the storyline is how unwilling Han was to fall in love with Elliott with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future and how unafraid he was despite the intolerance and interference they faced as their affair became known. The film is unarguably physically busy interesting and often beautiful also. The hill to which the lovers go to be apart the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city large social events and teeming streets hospital corridors and trafficfilled arteries. With cinematography by Leon Shamroy Ben Nye's makeup and Helen Turpin's hairstyles the great work by set decorators sound and lighting art department and all concerned this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major nonU.S. city of all time and one of the most difficult to capture on film. Yet what one remembers most here is the lovers thankfully not extremely young facing the odds against them and assessing exactly what they arethen going ahead as if love mattered and those conditions which are set up as barriers to love do not. The climax of the affair is Mark's going back to war thereafter Han receives his letters even after she knows he is has been killed they seem messages from a better wold. A world where hope is all that matters courage is the price of admittance to that world and it is always summer on a high and windy hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be victimized made subject to illfortune or brushed aside by militant forces of evil. Truly love is a manysplendored thing Dr. Han says and this movie stands as one of that doctrine's shining proofs lucent as a pearl timeless as a Chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade set against a rough background.".

One reason it was a hit was it was deeply romantic and epic and yet dealing with a vividly disturbing issue for Americans the take over of China by Communist rule. William Holden at the height of his fame holds his own in his restrained and slightly diffident way and Jennifer Jones is forceful and believable and likable if a hair too mannered for my taste and too frankly lovely for the good of the movie. This is a love story set against a new kind of wartime leading eventually to the Korean War and there is nothing better for a movie than love and war. Ask Tolstoy. The filming is wide screen saturated color in that first two years of this kind of spectacle and like other films of the midfifties it falls victim to being pretty at times. The events are set in Hong Kong and that's part of the visual charm but it's also a distraction for the filmmakers drifting just slightly at times into a travelogue. There all my reservations are out of the way. If you can not worry about how good the movie is or what it could have been compared to others or just on it's own formal terms it's a vivid engrossing politically loaded situation with two charming and beautiful actors. It might be a surprise that Jones plays a Chinese doctor Eurasian officially Dr. Han Suyin Jones was actually an Oklahoma girl but this is what Hollywood was still demanding of its casts afraid to diversify. And depending on star power to succeed. Holden plays Mark Elliott a journalist.As the affair begins between our leads Dr. Han Suyin a widow says to Elliott after he wonders why she'd go out with a married man I thought if you were happily married there could be no danger and if you weren't it could make no difference. And it begins there freighted with desire and worry. You know somehow that things will not go smoothly and they don't though the plot is oddly prosaic at times. It's partly the script but also oddly enough the filming with a very static camera which sits and waits as the actors talk beautiful backdrops and all. I think Jones and Holden are creditable in their roles a good word because it's so awkward and awful.One thing that happened for me in 2011 was getting washed in nostalgia. It's a movie about falling in love as the world is spinning out of control around you. It's before cell phones and constant newsso some of the best scenes are out of touch with everything in the world except the two of them. The music swells the sun hits the blue waters in the bay and it seems like a huge escape. I suppose that's what it was for them from their histories from their obligations. Eventually the world caught up however and things unravel.Another great thing about the movie however oldfashioned the approach might seem is the racial conflicts at work for and against them. It is maybe the big theme of the movie when all is said and done. This is a tear jerker of the largest magnitude. Soak it up.".

Everything in this account of the facts comes directly from those who were actually involved in it from the British and German fighter aces to private Londoners they all contributed to make this not just another war movie but rather a dramatized documentary with accurate precision.This by no means signifies that it is just that. The sky battles were very carefully choreographed in accordance to rules of combat which were followed in the 1940s. Some planes were flown by the same veterans so that when you see a Messerschmitt Bf109 followed by Spitfire Mk 1 you know it's for real.The technical efforts were immense and although the Messerschmitts have reworked engines and even the Heinkel He.111s have different aerials and engine specs because they were updated by the Spanish Air Force for later use after World War Two the difference is barely noticeable when one watches one of those spectacular aerial battles.On the whole this is a history lesson about how a people isolated from the rest of the world and in a minority position withstood the overwhelming crushing machine of the Axis the Luftwaffe.More than a movie this is a celebration to those brave people both civilian and military who did commit themselves against all odds to resist and fight back a very aggressive and dangerous enemy.This together with The Longest Day Sink the Bismarck! Tora! Tora! Tora! and A Bridge Too Far is one of those rare examples to make history come to life again and should be considered as didactic material for schools.An excellent multinational cast and a skillful direction make this a masterpiece of its genre.".

Being a 31 year military veteran I have a somewhat different frame of reference for watching films such as this. I look for things in a film many civilians never will. I don't think this one has ever been shown on TV in the US at least not within a couple of decades so it's certainly not overplayed here. Luckily the tape I accessed was in excellent condition so it was crisp and new in appearance. It is still a very excellent film depicting one of Britain's most harrowing times and the unwavering heroism of those who fought so desperately to secure their victory. The film didn't enjoy many fine reviews when it was new as it was compared as most war films are to the plethora of fiction produced by the movie industry and REAL history usually comes off looking mundane by comparison. I have found this a similar oddity for many excellent films of war. This is one film that more than adequately stands the test of time and I would absolutely love to see a widescreen DVD version of it offered. Although it helps to have an understanding of war in general and in particular the second world war and the actual battle of britain one can be ignorant of those facts and still come away well entertained. It is a wonderfully produced film acted with talent and grace by a cast of performers who are now legendary. The sets costumes and musical score are wonderful and perfectly compliment the cinematography. If I can find a copy I am going to add it to my library.".

It had to be made when it did sic if only because the Spanish Air Force still had their Merlin engined Hispano HA1109 and HA1112 Me 109s and Casa C.2111 111s flying in 1968!It's good that some stars do not have big roles. Michael Caine whilst being hot box office is shot down  many pilots who seemed invincible were lost. A number of the parts are based on real characters Robert Shaw's is based on Adolf 'Sailor' Malan  74 Squadron Ace Susannah York's Harvey is based on one Felicity Hanbury who later became the Commandant of the WRAF. The scene where she has to deal with a bombed slit trench is based on what happened when Biggin Hill was attacked. Being burned and still being alive was one of the biggest risks  sitting next to a tank of 100 octane whislt being shot at was risky.It's chief flaws are i Hurricanes shot down the bulk of the German losses during the Battle  this error is primarily because there were more flying Spitfires available. More serious is depicting The Few as a group of equals  in reality the class system was still to the fore in some places more so than others. Officer would not mix with NCOs Auxilliary Air Force pilots predominantly from the upper classes looked down on Volunteer Reserve pilots predominantly from the workingmiddle classes. But bear in mind this was made less than 30 years after the event when some of the myths and propaganda surrounding it were still treated as the truth unlike Pearl Harbor and U571 and other recent films they haven't just thrown historical fact out because it doesn't fit the desired story line!Many pilots were killed simply because of the stupid tatics they used  fighting by the 1930s RAF rule book until lessons were learnt. Many didn't see what hit them. In most other ways the film is by and large correct. The British were very reluctant to use Polish and Czech squadrons despite many of these pilots being much more experienced than British.Oh and having read the other comments here  this does not follow just one squadron Robert Shaw is one Michael Caine another The CzechPoles others Christopher Plummer another. I seem to remember that the film makers went out of their way not to show any one squadron as being the winners hence no squadron numbers are mentioned  all aircraft codes are ficticious.A film has to keep an audience's attention for 100 minutes real life isn't like that just showing the fear and boredom of sitting around on hot summers days dreading the 'phone call would not make a good movie instead compromises are made. When you watch it remember that this wasn't just dreamt up by some scriptwriter this really happened.".

It is the absence of such elements that makes some viewers not enjoy this kind of film.  However if you are interested in seeing history played out on the screen or are a history buff like me you will enjoy this movie.  The characters are not deep or complex and there is little character development but in a movie like this it is not necessary. There is a pretty useless subplot involving a man and his wife but other than that this film is not to be missed by those who enjoy WWII history.".

	schema:reviewBody "Battle of Britain which depicts same owes a lot of its inspiration not only to The Longest Day but to The Magic Box. In that film Robert Donat played William FrieseGreene who many in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth claim to be the real inventor of motion pictures. It was a biographical film in which as many stars of British cinema that were available got to play even bit parts.Here as many stars as could be gotten under one roof paid tribute to the valiant fighting heart of the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force which did nothing less than save civilization itself in their defense of their 'blessed isle.' Such folks as Christopher Plummer Michael Caine and Robert Shaw portrayed RAF squadron commanders who had to be mobilized at an instant notice to face the German Luftwaffe which outnumbered the Royal Air Force 4 to 1. As Laurence Olivier put it just to stay even our young men will have to shoot down their young men at a rate of 4 to 1.Olivier plays the guy ultimately responsible for the success of the RAF as Fighter Command chief Air Marshal Hugh R. Dowding. Olivier did very well in capturing the essence of character that was Dowding who was a brooding pessimistic sort not given to wild claims of bravado. That in itself did not near and endear him to his Prime Minister who liked a great show of spunk from his military commanders. Dowding was also into spiritualism and after retiring in 1942 claimed contact with the spirits of dead RAF men from the other side.Dowding had to referee between dueling Air Vice Marshals Keith Park and Trafford LeighMallory played by Trevor Howard and Patrick Wymark. LeighMallory wanted a more offensive type strategy and Park was for husbanding what resources the RAF had. Good arguments were put forth by both men. Dowding came down eventually on Park's side though after Dowding was retired by Churchill LeighMallory got his way. By that time through LendLease Britain had enough planes to do what LeighMallory envisioned. The conflict between these guys was a great deal nastier than portrayed here. But Olivier Howard and Wymark give you some insight into the character of each.My favorite bit in Battle of Britain is not any of the aerial combat sequences which are spectacularly done nor is it the conflict in the higher command. It's a scene that takes place in Geneva where the ministers from Great Britain and Germany meet. The German minister is not a Nazi party hack but a career diplomat. Yet he's real full of himself when he tells Ralph Richardson that you British might just as well surrender because we got the resources to take you out right now.Classical actor that Ralph Richardson was his reply was in the spirit of John Wayne when he tells them if you think you can you're welcome to try just don't make with the mouth. Minister David Kelly was echoing the bulldog defiance of his prime minister who was stiffening the backbone of his people for the long haul.One thing I wish had been showed in Battle of Britain. There was reference to Buckingham Palace being bombed and it did get hit a few times over the course of the next five years. King George VI and his family stayed there they certainly could have left for the relatively safer areas where Sandringham Windsor and Frogmore were. But they chose to stay as well. Not enough is ever spoken about the King and the other royals in that period. They too were an inspiration to their subjects. I wish that the Royals had been portrayed here it might give some insight to nonCommonwealth people about why the Monarchy is held in such respect despite recent antics by some of its members.Of course the Germans took Ralph Richardson's invitation to step up and get the job done and they failed. Thanks to some 600 RAF pilots which included volunteers from other commonwealth countries from exiles from such places as Poland and Czechoslovakia and even from the USA Great Britain kept control of its skies and a planned invasion never took place. Although aerial attacks took place over the United Kingdom for the length of the war the threat of invasion was officially over when Hitler turned his attention east and southeast.Battle of Britain is a wonderful tribute to the 20th century's noble 600.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found the secondary subplots and personal dramas to be hokey and formulaic to wit the Susannah York character Maggie is horrified and transfixed by the appearance of a badly burned pilot only to hear moments later in screen time that her own pilot boyfriend has been badly burned. Nevertheless what struck me much more than any of the performances effects or writing was the simple fact that the RAF adviser on this film was the exceptional Sir Douglas Bader who was one of the most aggressive flyers in Fighter Command despite having lost both legs in a flight accident in the early thirties while the Luftwaffe adviser on the film was the man who shot Bader down in 1941 Adolf Galland. Each man was a fighter ace and each was among the most famous and respected pilots on his respective side at the time of the war itself. That is to say that these men were not only in the Battle of Britain but played significant roles in it and were privy to if not party to many of the tactical and strategic decisions and debates depicted in the film. In fact the sardonic request to Goering to give me a squadron of Spitfires voiced by Major Falke in the film was spoken by Galland in real life. No quantity of flashy CG effects could outweigh the guaranteed authenticity of having the real thing on hand.An amusing side point The roll of nationalities at the end of the film concluded with one Israeli pilot a mild anachronism as there was no Israel until 1948. At the time of the war he would have been referred to as a Jewish Palestinian or simply a Palestinian but of course the film was produced shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Day War 1967 and the term Palestinian was coming to refer uniquely to those Arabs inhabiting the territories captured by Israel in that war.Anyhow in summary while I found much of the melodrama to be overplayed and unnecessary the central action of the film both at Headquarters and in the air vibrates with an authenticity which is ever more difficult to reproduce as the remainder of the wartime generation ages and dwindles particularly those who were old enough to be in staff and leadership positions during the war.".

	schema:headline " A Classic!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Battle of Britain is a classic movie about one of the key battles of World War 2. It stands up there with the epics The Longest Day ToraTora Tora and a Bridge Too Far. The allstar cast has well known and lesser known English Canadian German and others actors who play their roles well. The movie does a good job of portaying both sides of the battle. The special effects and the air battles hold up well after well over 30 years. The criticisms that people have to me are quite unfair. As for charcter development the movie is about the battle much like the Longest Day was and there was  no time to develop that part of the movie because it focused on the entirety of the battle. Also this is not like Cross of Iron that someone compared it to. Cross of Iron was a fictious story while this is done in semidocudrama style.It is an unfair comparison. The best comparison would be with the three previously listed movies. I liked that fact that some big stars characters did get hurt or died just like many of the better pilots did in the the battle and the war. The movie gives an excellent overview of the battle much like the other movies listed here. I like the fact about the bit of English snobbery concerning the foreign pilots that they were training even if some were as good or better than they were.This is a four star war movie obout Britains Finest Hour. Where if it wasn't for the Brits holding off the German's the Allies would not have been able to launch DDay against the German's. The movie showed bravery and courage from both sides men and pilots. It is a great portrayal of young men in battle as knights of the early war skies. Rent it or buy it because this is a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was an attempt to deal with the crucial events of 1940 when Britain might have been invaded and oppressed by Nazi Germany. Had this succeeded then subsequent history might well have been very different a Europe subjugated by the dark evil of that regime.As a straight historical account this film fails rather badly. Most of the characters are artificial created for the Stars and stars involved. Dowding and Park historically absolutely crucial never develop properly  a pity. Goering is cartoonised but at least reflects his total failure to conduct a strategic assault on the UK.The flying sequences are mostly superb. It was a huge achievement to bring together the aircraft used. As an enthusiast I can pick massive holes in those used. None of the 'German' aircraft have correct engines  they were postwar Spanish Air Force stand ins. And that's before we start on the late war mark Spitfires etc. But who cares? The point is the conflict in the air. It is not close enough to 'real' aerial combat  10 seconds of terror in 60 mins of boredom. But that is the nature of the cinema medium.The distraction of Suzanne York BTW she's not trying to get divorced! in full 40's uwear was very exciting when I was 16. At 52 I suppose it still gives me the odd moment!And look for the hanger being 'bombed' behind Suzanne York and Kenneth More it really WAS blown up at Duxford  boy were they cross!The revisionist historians like to claim that the actual Battle of Britain was not that important. That the Germans couldn't have crossed the Channel anyway because of the Royal Navy probably but not necessarily so. With air supremacy JU87s would have massacred RN vessels. That the Germans already had eyes on Russia and really wanted to ignore GB as a sideline possible and a fatal mistake. That the Germans lost the battle rather than the RAF won it no statistical basis for this the Luftwaffe smashed itself against the RAF.But the Battle WAS fought and won by the RAF.Which is why I believe this film is worth a viewing.Especially the Walton scored sequence where the Luftwaffe's bombers are hacked down by the Hurricanes and Spitfires of the RAF. An impressively moving sequence of the horror of war in the air. To which the music adds enormously.I place this film well ahead of the 1990's Memphis Belle travesty in depicting the reality of war. It is certainly on a par with 12 O'Clock High.".

	schema:headline " Favorite Personality WW II Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my favorite WW II movie and I have seen and liked flicks like Saving Private Ryan. The kind of War Movies I like are that ones that focus on both sides with personalities and details although most of the personality is on the Allied side. Other War movies that I loved are like this such as Gettysburg Tora Tora Tora and The Enemy Below. In The Battle of Britain everything is realistic except for some special effects which is forgivable since this movie was made in 1969. The French speak French. Poles speak Polish and so on!!! I especially liked watching the Poles who relay this sense of 'payback' on the Germans now that they fly in excellent warplanes. There is this sense of admiration for them as well since they could have sat out the War but chose instead to keep fighting the Nazis. They probably were not even sure that Poland would be liberated from the Nazis. The Poles are still like that today. They gladly help us in Iraq compared to other Europeans. I liked watching the Germans too even though they are 'the bad guys' so to say. Just to let everyone know I myself am Jewish. I watch the hordes of Nazi aircraft swarm over England like a wave of great Evil. I shudder to think what if Hitler really conquered England. Then in the scenes of dogfights I see the Spitfire blast away a Nazi plane and I cheer. Die you Nazi !!!! Movies have a way of taking your mind in certain directions especially when you are already predisposed. Then right after the Nazi bomber catches on fire a very contrary camera shot happens. I see the German crewmen want to live. I know that even bad guys want to live but then you see something else transpire with the German crewmen. These German men think. They feel. They care for each other. They see that combat against a nonpushover European is terrifying and they take no pleasure bombing cities full of civilians. You get the sense that they are only men born into the wrong generation of Germans. In five close up shots I saw these guys courageously help each other. They make sure everyone bails out. They comfort their wounded. Seeing a friend in deep trouble or dead makes them still. In the beginning they were cocky but that comes after fighting the French Belgiums Danes and so on. I rather liked watching Goering with the Staff meeting in the woods fly off the handle at his executive commanders and immediate subordinates. They tell him that they are doing the best they can with what they have. Nobody is suggesting cowardice!!!!!! one of them replied to Goering. I was thinking of MGM telling the prospective German Actors that they have an opportunity to show that most Germans are not robots. I myself got to know a lot of Germans in my 45 years on Earth and I must agree. Now to the Allied side. Naturally most of the focus in the movie are on the British characters as it should be. After all the British must win. Must!!!! I see English wives children marital spats failure and success. A pilot gives his two boys toy Spitfires. But one expects a WW II War movie to show that the allied troopers are more like yourself except for the 1957 movie The Enemy Below. The 1993 movie Gettysburg equally showed personalities on both sides too but both sides were American really. The music is also tops. I often hum that intro martial music to myself as well as the British victory tune. This movie is clearly my favorite War Movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This dramatized biography to my mind represents one of the most difficult sorts of film to make. I believe the makers of The Battle of Britain succeeded in making it a stirring war film and one that deserves to be watched and remembered often. Many people find the battle scenes in the air in this film among the best ever staged. Cliff Richardson deserves praise for his special effects and Guy Hamilton director in charge has frankly done marvelous work of a very difficulttoachieve sort. He has interiors intimate scenes outdoor lectures strafings bombings aerial battles airplane landings group shots and conferences to handle.Wilfred Greatorex and James Kennaway. In addition Ron Goodwin and William Walton supplied memorable music veteran Freddie Young the lucid cinematography and Maurice Carter wonderful art direction. The storyline chronologically follows the Battle of Britain No aspect is overlooked. The success of Luftwaffe air attacks on forward bases is noted and so is the lucky decision by Hitler to start bombing Londoners instead that caused a shift it tactics and saved Britain's radar towers key to targeting incoming attackers for interdiction by British aircraft. We hear a lecture by an Air Marshal see firefighting squads and female drivers in action we see both sides talking in their own languagesthe Germans being subtitled and we see action in the British War Room and at the highest levels of military planning. A couple is followed to illustrate what pilots and their wives she being part of the war effort also had to undergo and the pressures they faced. The pilots are also seen waiting between sorties at their bases and finally when none come the first phase of WWII the expedition and subsequent Battle of Britain is over. In the huge cast are most of the leading male actors in England including Laurence Olivier as Hugh Dowding chief of the air effort Trevor Howard as Keith Park Patrick Wymark as Mallory their chief opponent within the air corps plus Christopher Plummer and Susannahh York as the troubled couple Harry Andrews Michael Caine Ian McShane Kenneth More Curd Jurgens Nigel Patrick Michael Redgrave Robert Shaw Robert Flemyng Michael Bates Ralph Richardson Isla Blair and Edward Fox. This is a splendid wellpaced and beautiful recreation. The music is superb the combat footage unexcelled and the acting faraboveaverage. I rate this film on many counts above anything else ever done concerning the defense of Britain by its air forces during the late war.".

	schema:headline " At last  restored to it's full glory!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have always been a fan of this film and have been impatiently waiting for a DVD release for some time. When I found out that MGM were releasing this film on DVD I was delighted followed by some irritation when I found out the RRP 19.99 as the film was out in the US for 8. Yet another special edition second disc of bits and pieces with a hiked up price tag.I hereby apologise to MGM for such unkind thoughts because this edition is superb. The US version is in mono where this release has 5.1  DTS it is excellent and for fans of William Walton they only used about 5 minutes of his score in the original film Ron Goodwin supplying the rest the soundtrack with the full Walton score as an alternative. The picture has also been restored and has a full anamorphic 2.351 picture.It is a well worn clich but in summer 1940 Britain stood alone facing the might of the Luftwaffe and the German army which had swept all aside. The Battle of Britain is one of the pivotal moments in the history of this country and I believe that this film does it justice. The cast are excellent but particularly Laurence Olivier as Hugh Dowding and Robert Shaw as Squadron Leader Skipper. The film has been well researched and manages to weave all aspects of the battle into the film.Some of the special effects are a little bit dated but this was made 35 years ago and they do not detract from the story. But what makes this film convincing are the real aircraft used to make it. Various reports suggest that when assembled the aircraft were anywhere between the 11th and 35th biggest air force in the world. The aerial battles are just excellent and the shots of bombers and fighters in formation over the real life locations in 1940 give a powerful sense of authenticity. When I think about scenes like the flight of Me109's breaking to attack a flight of Spitfires and compare it to the awful battle of Britain CGI of Pearl Harbour which was an awful film in itself I cannot help but think that this film is something special. I have read reviews from some 'rivet counters' who state that the German Bombers are not authentic. This is true as the aircraft were built by CASA in Spain for the Spanish Air Force after the war but you do not notice.I cannot recommend this film enough and at last the DVD version lets us see it in all its glory.".

When I found out that MGM were releasing this film on DVD I was delighted followed by some irritation when I found out the RRP 19.99 as the film was out in the US for 8. Yet another special edition second disc of bits and pieces with a hiked up price tag.I hereby apologise to MGM for such unkind thoughts because this edition is superb. The US version is in mono where this release has 5.1  DTS it is excellent and for fans of William Walton they only used about 5 minutes of his score in the original film Ron Goodwin supplying the rest the soundtrack with the full Walton score as an alternative. The picture has also been restored and has a full anamorphic 2.351 picture.It is a well worn clich but in summer 1940 Britain stood alone facing the might of the Luftwaffe and the German army which had swept all aside. The Battle of Britain is one of the pivotal moments in the history of this country and I believe that this film does it justice. The cast are excellent but particularly Laurence Olivier as Hugh Dowding and Robert Shaw as Squadron Leader Skipper. The film has been well researched and manages to weave all aspects of the battle into the film.Some of the special effects are a little bit dated but this was made 35 years ago and they do not detract from the story. But what makes this film convincing are the real aircraft used to make it. Various reports suggest that when assembled the aircraft were anywhere between the 11th and 35th biggest air force in the world. The aerial battles are just excellent and the shots of bombers and fighters in formation over the real life locations in 1940 give a powerful sense of authenticity. When I think about scenes like the flight of Me109's breaking to attack a flight of Spitfires and compare it to the awful battle of Britain CGI of Pearl Harbour which was an awful film in itself I cannot help but think that this film is something special. I have read reviews from some 'rivet counters' who state that the German Bombers are not authentic. This is true as the aircraft were built by CASA in Spain for the Spanish Air Force after the war but you do not notice.I cannot recommend this film enough and at last the DVD version lets us see it in all its glory.";

Battle of Britain is a great movie about the glorius British Royal Air Force in their famous halt to a German invasion and their ability to stop the Germans from Bombing the cities out of existance. Some of the special effects are kind of cheesy but they didn't have Industrial Light and Magic. I'm very impressed about the Cinematography by Freddie Young. Why didn't he receive an Oscar nomination? The aerial photography was excellent. One complaint I will make about the DVD version is that the Main Credits have been changed The music was credited to Sir William Walton in the DVD. On the VHS Ron Goodwin composed the score I don't know why they changed this on the DVD. They also changed the music at the end credits of the movie which I thought wasn't appropriate for some reason. Other than that this is a great movie with a great cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a youth living near Hornchurch RAF aerodrome during this battle and vividly remember the hot sunny September afternoons when we could watch great aerial dogfights in the skies above almost every afternoon. We ducked into the shelter if the dogfights were directly overhead but the drama was too great to stay there if the coast seemed clear enough This was probably unwise on one occasion a piece of metal later identified as part of the engine cowling from a Me 109 whistled into our garden a few yards from us  but what wonderful memories it has left me throughout a long life. I avoided watching this film depicting the events for a very long time  I did not want to come up with some lukewarm judgment that yes it was quite a good attempt to recreate what I remembered so well. The greatest compliment I can pay this film is to acknowledge that I made a mistake  watching it I learned what it means to be transported back in time and to be present again during one of the great moments in history. This experience totally transcends any reality TV.My heading  the window of time refers to the short period following any great event during which it is possible to create a worthy reproduction of it in pseudodocumentary form. Once this opportunity has slipped away it will never return. Recognition of this finally led to the long planned film actually being created  there were only just enough of the aircraft left flying many of them having reached the end of a long period of service with the Spanish Air Force. Details like antennae changes were not really important except to survivors of the battle but it was sad that the film has had to reinforce the myth that the United Kingdom was saved by the magic of its new Spitfire fighters  actually the brunt of the battle on the British side was carried by the more venerable Hurricanes which achieved the majority of the kills during this phase of the war. There were not enough Hurricanes still in serviceable condition to enable this to be shown accurately one of the very few minor historical 'errors' in the film. We can all envisage an attempt to create a similar film today if it had not been made when it was. Very carefully constructed flying models assisted by closeups shot in reconstructed cockpits and some computer generated fighting effects would all look incredibly real on the screen but at the end our reaction would be that we had watched a technological masterpiece not a feeling that we were present during real events! The cast list reads like a who's who of the great British actors of the period but as with the real events the Germans and all important Canadians Poles and CzechoSlovakians were also appropriately represented. Overall the acting level was consistently good and this film also incorporates one of the all time great moments on film  I am thinking of four very brief linked sequences totalling not much over a minute which essentially summed up the complete story. First Londoners sheltering underground from the nightly blitz on September 15th listening to a news bulletin reporting heavy German air attacks all day their losses 163 planes with RAF losses 40 and 10 pilots safe then Air Marshall Downing asked by Churchill for amplification because Capital Hill believed German claims that the low RAF losses showed the final destruction of the RAF responded I am not very interested in propaganda if we are right we have won this battle  if wrong the Germans will be in London in a week. These were coupled with two very brief sequences one showing returned German pilots assembling for their evening mess dinner and staring dismayed at all the seats which were not filled the other the German invasion flotillas in the Channel ports being dismantled two days later. Historically this film has few inaccuracies but wisely does not address the ongoing question of whether the Battle of Britain or the Battle of the Atlantic almost equally well served by the film The Cruel Sea was the more important. Whilst both were vital to an allied victory the former was shorter and more intense  which made it easier to reduce to the scale of a film  whilst the latter dragged on right until the end of the war and ultimately claimed many more lives.For a very long time to come this film will remain a standby in schools trying to increase awareness of key events that have shaped their world among today's children  many uninterested per se in history But I was too personally involved to assess its likely appeal for other IMDb users  all I can say is that it a well made and gripping film which will not be quickly forgotten. Some critics dislike a very minor romantic subplot involving the wife of a squadron leader serving in the WAAF who fears hearing of his death every day as she is plotting the movements of the planes  eventually he experiences a bad crash surviving severely burned and facing a very long period of rehabilitation. But I believe this provided a very necessary reminder that great events are achieved only at high personal cost.Real history buffs may note that there is a later DVD also entitled 'The Battle of Britain' Classic Pictures 2004 It carries the subtitle 'The Official History' and is essentially a documentary assembled from contemporary monochrome newsreel sequences spanning a longer period that includes the night bombing 'blitz' which followed.".

I did this because I have been and remain a life long WW II addict. In my humble opinion this is the finest WW II Fighter movie ever made bar none. Considering the constraints the movie makers were working under their efforts resulted in a 99 historically correct movie. Only Tora Tora Tora is in this class. All of the of events both RAF and Luftwaffe are portrayed in their proper sequence. Every effort was made to show the correct aircraft. WW II crazies like me will recognize the minor errors and omissions i.e. no Bf110's Ju88's or Do217's. With superb casting there is no Hollywood overacting. The British audience also played a part as most of the survivors were alive and would have laughed a mediocre effort right out the theater. The furor created by the later production of A Piece of Cake will bear witness.If you love high quality WW II movies and there certainly not enough of those you can't go wrong in purchasing a DVD copy.".

From the very start of the film Guy Hamilton's direction and the great musical score left me spellbound even when I knew how the story ended.  The casting was flawless. Olivier looked like Dowding. Trevor Howard could pass for Keith Park's twin brother and I swear Goering himself had a small part in the film too. I've always wondered if Robert Shaw's role of the squadron leader Skipper wasn't patterned after famed RAF pilot A.G. Salior Malan.  If it was Shaw looks alot like Malan. War in the Air is one of my favorite pieces of music and it flows beatufully through the film. Great acting by Christopher Plummer Michael Caine and one of my favorites Edward Fox makes this movie a must see for any WWII buff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Battle of Britain was produced when more film makers were trying to move away from the stereotyped and provide a balanced perspective. A rare but notable attempt from the early 60's was 'The Longest Day'. The results were variable and Battle of Britian was only partly successful in this respect. Having said this there are other more important aspects to the film that make it stand well above the average. Before I go on to these I'd like to get the negatives out of the way.I've always been irritated by the 'romance' between Christopher Plummer and Susannah York. I think they were trying to show how the hardships and tragedies of war impact on people's personal lives but the portrayal of this relationship seemed embarrassingly shallow to me. As a result I find this part uncomfortable to watch especially if somebody else is watching with me because I recommended the movie! Some comments and quotations have not been presented with complete accuracy. Perhaps the worst example is when one of the senior German officers asked by Goering if there is anything he can give them to help ensure victory replies Give me a squadron of Spitfires! It was in fact Adolf Galland who gave the answer I should like an outfit of Spitfires for my Group! Problem is the movie conveys the impression that even the Germans considered the Spitfire to be superior to the Messerschmitt Bf109. Rubbish! The movie had an opportunity to dispel this myth but instead has strengthened and perpetuated it. Not long before that conversation Goering had ordered his fighters to fly in restricted close formation escort to the bombers robbing them of the advantages of height and surprise and forcing them to burn precious fuel. Galland's comment meant that if the German fighters were forced to use such foolish tactics the Spitfire's characteristics made it better suited to the purpose.Then there's the question of balance visavis HurricaneSpitfire. In the public mind the popular myth is that the Battle of Britain was pretty much won by the Spitfire with the Hurricane helping out. In fact the reverse of this is closer to the truth. Throughout the battle there were about twice as many Hurricanes as Spitfires making the Hurricane the backbone of fighter command. To be sure the Spitfire was the only British fighter that could face the 109 on equal terms and as such it was a vital 'stiffener' to British resistance but the Hurricane was a rugged and steady gun platform that was in the right hands a great instrument for bringing down German bombers  which it did in considerable numbers.I feel that the movie makers had the opportunity to give proper recognition to the Hurricane but failed to do so and merely added to the already immense Spitfire legend. The Spitfire does deserve its fame as Britain's premier WW2 fighter but such is its stature that it does not need to steal credit from the Hurricane.So much for the downside.On the positive side this movie made at a time when computer enhancement was only a dream has to be the bravest attempt at large scale aerial combat I have ever seen. Huge numbers of real aircraft were used many of which were highly authentic. True the Heinkels and Messerschmitts were reengined Spanish variants particularly noticeable to enthusiasts with the 109's but finished in reasonably accurate camouflage and markings they produced a very acceptable overall effect. Most of the Spitfires were later marks 'modified back' to resemble the Battle of Britain variants but again the overall impression was acceptable.The sheer logistic effort and cost involved in coordinating and filming formations and movements of aircraft in this fashion and then enacting the combat sequences is something never attempted before or since. Small wonder because it almost bankrupted the movie. In the end to cut costs some combat sequences were used more than once but from different angles. It shows but you can understand why.Other touches of technical realism include faithful detail in uniforms insigniaranks sets etc where they went to great lengths to produce the 'feel' of the period. Even the language and expressions of the time which seem corny today but were very real then.Finally and most important in my view is the level of historical accuracy. Measured against what we know of history all movies fall short of perfect. But you can tell the difference between those who make a genuine effort and those who don't. The fair comparison is with the general standard set by war movies that claim to portray true life events. Most struggle to achieve even a 50 percent score for technical and historical accuracy. Battle of Britiain rates much higher than the norm I believe from my research around 80 percent accurate at least.The British were in a very desperate position in 1940 and regardless of historical debate today invasion seemed very possible to them. Hitler wanted them to believe that invasion was imminent and force the stubborn British to the negotiating table so he would then be free to attack Russia without the spectre of a war on two fronts. But to make the threat credible he had to destroy Fighter Command or at least make it impotent over SouthEast England.For there to be any real chance of Allied victory in WW2 Britain HAD to stay on its feet and remain in place as a CREDIBLE and VIABLE enemy of the Third Reich. In a very real sense then the outcome of the war could very likely hinge on the outcome of the Battle of Britain. In my opinion the movie conveys this general message very well indeed and it is the crowning achievement of the film. Despite the faults I rate it highly.".

Food was becoming scarcer as the price skyrocketed far beyond what was affordable and in the end there just wasn't any left. With the attempt to help England during WWI Churchill used the help of India and exported the majority of food that was so badly needed by the local Indians. As someone had stated he also forbade other countries from offering any aid to India. The starvation resulted in more than 5000 000 deaths.'Ashani Sanket' takes place in a poor rural Bengali village where most people are illiterate and even unaware of the war going on in the other side of the world. In a beautiful scene Ananga and her friend Chutki are fascinated by the flying jets which hardly means anything more to them than a distant thunder. They aren't even aware that those jets are flying to war. Gangacharan and Ananga are the newer inhabitants of the village and are of a 'sophisticated' Brahmin class. The villagers look up to them.However as hunger strikes an become more severe it gradually strips the villagers off their humanity the fight over the rice and integrity Chutki offering herself in exchange of rice but at the same time it also brings a more positive change in Gangacharan and Ananga. Gangacharan who was arrogant and pompous learns that he had lived his affluent life at the cost of the villagers. He becomes aware of the sacrifices others have made for him and that in this tragic ordeal there are no inequalities. Class does not matter for everyone is suffering equally. Consequently he offers to give the the 'untouchable girl' a proper death ritual. The always compassionate Ananga grows from the naive housewife to a stronger woman.Ray's treatment is simple and this makes the portrayed village life look very authentic. At the same time he brings depth and there is plenty of detail and metaphor like the two butterflies that intrigue Ananga. Ray has always been known to be one of the greatest storytellers and 'Ashani Sanket' is no different. He gradually unfolds the story as he reveals how powerless hunger can cause humans to become and yet how these people fight to survive. On the technical front background music is effectively minimalized and the cinematography is stupendous.Soumitra Chatterjee is marvelous. Obviously there's a reason why Ray has repeatedly cast him in so many of his films. Thanks to Ray for discovering Babita's talent because this is one of the very very few movies in which she is given a role that does full justice to her acting abilities. Sandhya Roy too delivers a noteworthy performance as Chutki.'Ashani Sanket' is an astounding film that I found to be very enlightening. Many have claimed for it not to be their favourite Ray film but to me it's a remarkable film another gem from the legend.".

The always compassionate Ananga grows from the naive housewife to a stronger woman.Ray's treatment is simple and this makes the portrayed village life look very authentic. At the same time he brings depth and there is plenty of detail and metaphor like the two butterflies that intrigue Ananga. Ray has always been known to be one of the greatest storytellers and 'Ashani Sanket' is no different. He gradually unfolds the story as he reveals how powerless hunger can cause humans to become and yet how these people fight to survive. On the technical front background music is effectively minimalized and the cinematography is stupendous.Soumitra Chatterjee is marvelous. Obviously there's a reason why Ray has repeatedly cast him in so many of his films. Thanks to Ray for discovering Babita's talent because this is one of the very very few movies in which she is given a role that does full justice to her acting abilities. Sandhya Roy too delivers a noteworthy performance as Chutki.'Ashani Sanket' is an astounding film that I found to be very enlightening. Many have claimed for it not to be their favourite Ray film but to me it's a remarkable film another gem from the legend.";

The doctor is humbled by the experience and is forever changed for the better through experiencing firsthand what it feels like to be hungry.

	schema:reviewBody "Ashani Sanket or Distant Thunder is one of the first color films of Satyajit Ray probably my favorite film maker.  It is a story about a young Brahmin couple Gangacharan Chakravarti played by Soumitra Chatterjee and his wife Ananga played by the simply named Babita who come to settle in a rural and largely illiterate peasant community in India's eastern province of Bengal.  Gangacharan takes up teaching and the occasional priestly duties disparaging the backwardness of the people he is serving.There are several scenes of military aircraft flying in formation the villagers wonder how they can fly and remark at their beauty.  But the planes are flying because of their participation in WWII and soon people start hearing that their British king is at war and food shortages are causing their rice prices to increase from 6 presumably rupees per kilogram? to 8.  The price skyrockets to 10 11 12 ... and gets to over 30.The historical background is a seemingly forgotten Holocaust the Great Bengal famine of 1943.  The British callously disregarded and even facilitated the starvation deaths of 35 million people in rural Bengal. While ironically India was very significantly supporting the British war effort with over 3 million troops after again being denied independence after its WWI support Winston Churchill exported food from India that was desparately needed domestically and even barred other countries who were ready to send aid to India from doing so.  This after a series of famines under the British Raj such as one in 1770 that decimated 13 of Bengal's population  10 million people  and that was compounded by the greed of the East India Company.As hunger affects all including Ananga and Gangacharan and some to the point of starvation Gangacharan is shamed to realize that the relatively luxurious life they had led was at the expense of the landless peasants. Ashani Sanket is a portrayal of the horrors inflicted on rural Bengal by the wartime famine and of Gangacharan's new questioning of caste restrictions and privileges as well as the selfless sacrifices others less fortunate than he willingly make for him as a hardly understood conflict goes on as distant thunder.I would recommend the film as a poignant but by no means maudlin historical drama.  Technically I think the film would have been more powerful in black and white  but that could just be because it is difficult to watch a Ray film and not compare it to his famous Apu trilogy or Home and the World with the stark reality of lower middle class life that the films' medium displays.  I finished watching the film minutes ago on video and leave with the impression that it's by no means my favorite Ray film but like everything by him I've seen worth seeing.Dilip 10282001".

It's marred by an ableist depiction of one character with a scarred face which is especially too bad because the scenes in which he appears are the ones in which Ray cinematically draws the connections between male violence in the form of rape and male violence in the form of war planes overhead.

	schema:reviewBody "Jancso was part of a group of filmmakers who around the same time in different places largely influenced by one another and the tide they set forth sat down to examine in their work issues of perceptionasymmetric memory abstract representation of self and feelings how seeing shapes narrative. Now that it has settled we can see that they weren't all of the same make. We can see for example that Bergman was much more oldfashioned than Antonioni. A lot of Godard's novelty is just not a big deal anymore.Jancso seems more advanced in retrospect.Most of his films from this period are about war they are fine as such better than most anything by anyone else and war usually WWII did after all loom large in the consciousness of people who lived through it as impressionable youngsters so it was a much more personal experience than it is for us now distantly desensitized to it by TV footage of war coverage and atrocity. And they are so purely about war it seems a lot of viewers have rested upon watching his films on a certain abstraction of war.But let's see something else. Nevermind war for a moment. We can know it is WWII somewhere in Hungary but there are no battles no two armies on opposite sides to clearly define conflict. We know as much about it as we do about the protagonist nothing beyond that he's a boy of 17 tossed by forces beyond understanding. There is no broader story to define who he is versus what he is up against nothing beyond the fact that there he is strange people arrest him he breaks free is arrested again and there's the vague hum of violence hanging over the prairie.It is all so clear when you see through Jancso's eyes no clutter here.Where most filmmakers try to get the whole image he lightly sketches edges onlythe air around the thing.

	onyx:emotionText "Jancso was part of a group of filmmakers who around the same time in different places largely influenced by one another and the tide they set forth sat down to examine in their work issues of perceptionasymmetric memory abstract representation of self and feelings how seeing shapes narrative. Now that it has settled we can see that they weren't all of the same make. We can see for example that Bergman was much more oldfashioned than Antonioni. A lot of Godard's novelty is just not a big deal anymore.Jancso seems more advanced in retrospect.Most of his films from this period are about war they are fine as such better than most anything by anyone else and war usually WWII did after all loom large in the consciousness of people who lived through it as impressionable youngsters so it was a much more personal experience than it is for us now distantly desensitized to it by TV footage of war coverage and atrocity. And they are so purely about war it seems a lot of viewers have rested upon watching his films on a certain abstraction of war.But let's see something else. Nevermind war for a moment. We can know it is WWII somewhere in Hungary but there are no battles no two armies on opposite sides to clearly define conflict. We know as much about it as we do about the protagonist nothing beyond that he's a boy of 17 tossed by forces beyond understanding. There is no broader story to define who he is versus what he is up against nothing beyond the fact that there he is strange people arrest him he breaks free is arrested again and there's the vague hum of violence hanging over the prairie.It is all so clear when you see through Jancso's eyes no clutter here.Where most filmmakers try to get the whole image he lightly sketches edges onlythe air around the thing. Here the image is of the boy rushing from one stage of life to the next always moved because the gears of the world move. Others pass through the outpost soldiers civilians wary bored some of them smallminded fools doing what they were told to do.

	schema:reviewBody "My Way Home deals with very much the same themes as The Red and the White and The Round UP except here we have hope and an example of a way out.All of the films deal with the randomness of violence. War does not pick out people because they deserve to live or die. And authority is not tempered with justice. It is arbitrary. Even your own country men are a danger in this world.The landscape bare plains in all directions as far as the eye can see captures the hopelessness of trying to escape. There is nowhere to hide. You are like a leaf caught in a wind that blows you one way or another. The point is made with a beautiful homage to North by Northwest 1959 when a plain chases the boys in the naked landscape while they try to catch up with a naked woman who is probably running away from rapists. It is telling that we never find out where she came from or what became of her. She is like one of those leaves being blown around by the winds of war.So all these films capture the evil of war and how inhuman and cold it is no wonder Kubrick loved Mikls Jancs. This film however does show us how the world could be. A friendship of a Hungarian and Russian boy is formed when the Russian boy saves the Hungarian one from a minefield. They take care of each other even though they don't speak each other language and form a friendship and love that is stronger than anything he receives from his own country men.And let's us not forget that this film was made during the Cold War when nations refused to see each other as human and threatened each other with weapons of mass destruction. Into that world comes this beautiful cry for peace love and understanding.".

And then at the end of the film we see him use the kungfu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid. Is that even possible? I don't think so.This show is purely for Jay Chou fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plot.Anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other to the extent that you'd think they were the one and same person? Long hair sunshineboy look tall and strong. The two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm. Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all.The jokes were lame and not funny at all.The scene with regards to the 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. Worse of all when the 4 masters won the fight the crowd began cheering and the match continued. It was truly a WTF? moment.At the end of the show when they win the match all thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired those kungfu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master.And then his longlost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his longlost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film.In short this is a Jay Chouflick instead of the usual chick flick. Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of IMDb's top 250 films of all time then this film is not for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is absolutely silly.But were you expecting a highbrow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eyecandy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There's an evil Triadstyle dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it  I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it.

	onyx:emotionText "The movie is absolutely silly.But were you expecting a highbrow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eyecandy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There's an evil Triadstyle dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it  I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I have to say that the Cine Asia DVD cover promises more than the movie actually delivers. Which just goes to prove don't judge a movie by its cover.Kung Fu Dunk is a combination of basketball Kung Fu and a semiromantic love story thrown into the midst. The end result was entertaining enough. However the movie didn't really fully get a chance to spread out its wings and be all that it could have been. The movie just brushed over the various topics on the storyline on the surface. And that was a shame because if the director had delved more into the depths of some topics instead of trying to be everywhere at once then the movie would have had much more impact depth and meaning. Personally I found the movie to be good entertainment but it was a rather shallow story because it never took time to go into depths with the topics.The action scenes were nicely shot and the Kung Fu scenes were really well choreographed and looked nice. The basketball scenes however well they were great it was like you were there on the court with the players. One thing that really didn't fit well into the movie despite it was amazing to look at and funny was when the four Kung Fu masters entered the basketball court and started fighting the Fireball team. Sure it looked nice and there was a lot of nice effects but come on it was just too much.Being a longtime fan of Asian cinema then it was really nice to see some of the big guns from Hong Kong cinema appear in a Mandarin Chinese movie. I haven't seen Eric Tsang playing Zhen Li in a long long time so it was a nice treat to get to see him on the screen again. He always brings some comical charm with him to the movies he is in. And of course you had Hong Kong cutie Charlene Choi playing Lily as well and despite having a minor role she actually did it great because it was a step away from her usual sugarcoated lateteen love romance roles and it was nice to see her in a movie without Gillian Chung around. Finally in a small cameo role you had huge Hong Kong movie star from back in the day Kenneth Tsang playing Wang Yiwuan. His role was very small but still just his presence there was awesome.The movie's main actor Jay Chou playing Fang Shijie was really carrying the movie mostly by himself. He was really wellcast for this role and he did a great job with his character.Kung Fu Dunk suffered from a halfhearted storyline that never explored its potential and that was a shame because the movie really had potential for so much more.If you liked Shaolin Soccer then the chances are that you will like Kung Fu Dunk as well though this movie is not as good as Shaolin Soccer. But still it is entertaining and fun to watch.".

This leads to a big fight the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation.Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects photography and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot. Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining even with a scattershot ending. Recommended.".

Basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and Tsang bids to get him a spot on a University team and to promote him in the media. General success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before.It's all a bit Shaolin Soccer I guess but not so quirky or ridiculous  the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the setup. You've seen it all before but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well. Luckily it really is done well here some might say 'surprisingly' with Chu YenPing in the director's chair... I expect he had good 'assistants'  the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish. Jay Chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates with a largerthanlife character that he's played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional moments.Since the film revolves around basketball it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing. The cast show some real skill including Chou and some well done wirework and CGI add that element of hyperreal kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movie's plotexistence.There's only one significant fight scene in the movie but it's a doozy in the one against many style. Jay Chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive  he's clearly pretty strong and fast for real and Ching SiuTung's choreography makes him look like a real martial artist. I wish there'd been more but at least it's a lengthy fight.Very much the kind of Chinese New Year blockbuster I hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing!".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Kung Fu Dunk";
	schema:reviewBody "Tagline A much lesser attempt at recapturing the spirit of Shaolin Soccer Review by Neo Kung Fu Dunk follows the same route as one of HK's biggest movie in Shaolin Soccer but the results is totally another story. While the aforementioned flick starred the arguable the biggest Hong Kong superstar Kung Fu Dunk have Taiwan's own favourite son in singer turned actor Jay Chow. Combining kung fu with sports is no longer something new and the result providing the audience with an average mindless entertainment. While Shaolin Soccer is a classic three act underdog story Kung Fu Dunk goes like a rollercoaster rides but without the thrills in between. Sure some fun can be had and the duo chemistry in Eric Tsang and Jay Chow is even at times touching but this is by no means a great movie at all.Jay Chow is a stoic actor and in other words he is like a piece of wood. His face is expressionless and while he once claimed that he wanted to be become the next Jet Li it is fast becoming more of a dream than reality. Li is a stoic actor but not one without emotions one classic example is Li performance in Hero. On the outlook his performance is that of wooden but looking closely his eyes contained deeper motivations as he confronted the King. Needless to say Li is now a Best Actor in his acclaimed role in Warlords and if Chow wants to become anywhere near his ambition he will need to learn and reflect upon his method of acting. Despite sharing the same surname as Stephen Chow Jay is no comedian and while he is easily likable he does not oozes the same level of charisma as say Li or the much more famous Chow counterpart.Perhaps the film unlikely saving grace comes in the form of veteran Eric Tsang in what is most likely his best role since Infernal Affairs. Tsang is a flawed character yet he is sympathetic and probably the only person in the whole movie that seemed human and real. He is greedy selfish but deep down he is sentimental and his belief in Jay till the very end allows the audience to relate to his human character rather than special effects. Tsang lifts up this film from bad to average and for that Mr. Tsang take a bow. While the cover of the atrocious Dangerous Games claimed that his performance there was better than Comrades A Love Story maybe the cover designer was referring to this movie.Charlene Choi also appears in the flick but in the end she really has nothing to do other than look cute promote that style of glasses act cute and be cute. With her counterpart Gillian now in seclusion it is now up to Charlene to stand up by herself. It is disappointing to witness Choi in such an insignificant role especially after her Hong Kong Film Critics award winning performance in Simply Actors.At the end of the day the real reason why Kung Fu Dunk did not work is really pointing at the producers and director. The overuse of crappy special effects is one huge downfall and adding to the mix is the unrealistic script based on a manga. Without forgetting it is ultimately the director's Kevin Chu fault in filming such crappy basketball sequences. As a basketball player for almost 14 years despite the fact that Neo is not a good player still the film lack any sort of tactical awareness or the never give up spirit that is required in competitive basketball. Without being a big head this movie did reminded Neo of a little over 7 years ago that he was once in the school basketball team which reached the State Grand Final. In the final Neo lifted up his game and played the best basketball he has ever played. Despite losing in the final Neo holds no regrets as we played our best as a team and as an individual. Even though 7 years on he may never have another chance to reach those heights again that feeling and emotion of playing in a grand final is priceless.All in all Kung Fu Dunk is at best a mindless entertainment but even so it is just an average one. It is a shame that it cannot be what it intended to be namely Shaolin Soccer and with technology 7 years on since that little Stephen Chow movie it is just not good enough. Jay Chow has done extremely well as a debutant director in Secret but here his acting has become all too familiar. There is no doubt that he did not deserve the Best New Artist Award for Initial D where Anthony Wong commented so strongly. Still it is really just yet another average Hong Kong movie but once again it is really the case of what could have been. So what's next on the menu? Kung Fu Tennis sounds utterly original Neo 2008 I rate it 5.510www.thehkneo.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Tagline A much lesser attempt at recapturing the spirit of Shaolin Soccer Review by Neo Kung Fu Dunk follows the same route as one of HK's biggest movie in Shaolin Soccer but the results is totally another story. While the aforementioned flick starred the arguable the biggest Hong Kong superstar Kung Fu Dunk have Taiwan's own favourite son in singer turned actor Jay Chow. Combining kung fu with sports is no longer something new and the result providing the audience with an average mindless entertainment. While Shaolin Soccer is a classic three act underdog story Kung Fu Dunk goes like a rollercoaster rides but without the thrills in between. Sure some fun can be had and the duo chemistry in Eric Tsang and Jay Chow is even at times touching but this is by no means a great movie at all.Jay Chow is a stoic actor and in other words he is like a piece of wood. His face is expressionless and while he once claimed that he wanted to be become the next Jet Li it is fast becoming more of a dream than reality. Li is a stoic actor but not one without emotions one classic example is Li performance in Hero. On the outlook his performance is that of wooden but looking closely his eyes contained deeper motivations as he confronted the King. Needless to say Li is now a Best Actor in his acclaimed role in Warlords and if Chow wants to become anywhere near his ambition he will need to learn and reflect upon his method of acting. Despite sharing the same surname as Stephen Chow Jay is no comedian and while he is easily likable he does not oozes the same level of charisma as say Li or the much more famous Chow counterpart.Perhaps the film unlikely saving grace comes in the form of veteran Eric Tsang in what is most likely his best role since Infernal Affairs. Tsang is a flawed character yet he is sympathetic and probably the only person in the whole movie that seemed human and real. He is greedy selfish but deep down he is sentimental and his belief in Jay till the very end allows the audience to relate to his human character rather than special effects. Tsang lifts up this film from bad to average and for that Mr. Tsang take a bow. While the cover of the atrocious Dangerous Games claimed that his performance there was better than Comrades A Love Story maybe the cover designer was referring to this movie.Charlene Choi also appears in the flick but in the end she really has nothing to do other than look cute promote that style of glasses act cute and be cute. With her counterpart Gillian now in seclusion it is now up to Charlene to stand up by herself. It is disappointing to witness Choi in such an insignificant role especially after her Hong Kong Film Critics award winning performance in Simply Actors.At the end of the day the real reason why Kung Fu Dunk did not work is really pointing at the producers and director. The overuse of crappy special effects is one huge downfall and adding to the mix is the unrealistic script based on a manga. Without forgetting it is ultimately the director's Kevin Chu fault in filming such crappy basketball sequences. As a basketball player for almost 14 years despite the fact that Neo is not a good player still the film lack any sort of tactical awareness or the never give up spirit that is required in competitive basketball. Without being a big head this movie did reminded Neo of a little over 7 years ago that he was once in the school basketball team which reached the State Grand Final.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Kung Fu Dunk";
	schema:reviewBody "This project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular Japanese manga SlamDunk! and that's not something new to Jay Chou who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga Initial D. Along the way it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie so hence the title even if the idea wasn't very original with Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined.However and thankfully those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum and in Kung Fu Dunk really quite unnecessary because they don't add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when Stephen Chow used kung fu in football games. Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist Fang Shijie since it's not the first time he fought using martial arts Curse of the Golden Flower anyone? and under the stunt direction of Ching SiuTung he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer just to let you know who's boss.That was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle. And with Eric Tsang as a small time hustler ChenLi who sees his potential and becomes his agent he joins a university to play varsity basketball but not without the initial objection of team captain Tingwei Chen BoLin and team star Xiaolan Baron Chen in his bigscreen debut. But you know with team members on the same side it's not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court.And I will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how Goal was to football. It made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts. Here special effects and wirework were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the NBA league and in all honesty really looked stunning especially when they mimic various dunking moves and performing combomoves thanks to technology and stunt work. So in actuality the kung fu elements don't really have to be in the movie. The stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they're quite grounded to reality only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk.Pity too that the number of games were only a handful with the time spent on plenty of subplots but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please. Things like the abandoned Shijie's quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games and his love life with Charlene Choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else. Everyone's acting a little too cool leaving little room for main characters to add depth. One of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court than only on it and during competitive games apart from the highfives and friendly passes.With the US10 million budget it is easy to see where the money went to  the effects in particular a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie. It's quite flawless nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone but again I like to emphasize that even without those elements the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves. And having Jay Chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmmakers Guttentag and Sturman have produced a short but unforgettable documentary about one of the ugliest stories in twentieth century warfare the event known as the rape of Nanking. During a brief period in late December 1937 Japanese forces bombed the city of Nanking then the capital of China moving on after assaulting Shanghai. Much of the city's population fled. But the poor had to remain lacking the money to get out. Troops then moved in and brutally executed several hundred thousand civilians using guns and bayonets and fire and raped tens of thousands of woman leaving most of the once beautiful prosperous city in ruins. They also immediately executed by various methods thousands of captured soldiers.The positive side of the story is that a group of foreigners perhaps less that two dozen who had been resident in Nanking remained there to help save the helpless civilians and soldiers who had fled and created a Safety Zone to protect them. It was not respected but nonetheless they were able to save perhaps another couple of hundred thousand people.The presentation lasts only 88 minutes but is packed with mindboggling material. Using a ground approach similar to the Culture Project's theater events 'Exonerated' and 'Guantanamo' in which a group of actors dramatically read actual accounts the foreigners' stories and that of one Japanese soldier are reconstructed by Stephen Dorff Woody Harrelson. Mariel Hemingway and others. In between their accounts there are interviews with Chinese survivors and some Japanese soldiers involved in the massacres.The most important foreigners are Bob Wilson Minnie Vautrin and John Rabe whose accounts are voiced by Harrelson Hemingway and Jrgen Prochnow respectively. Wilson was a surgeon born in China son of a missionary who stayed on after the bombing.

	onyx:emotionText "Filmmakers Guttentag and Sturman have produced a short but unforgettable documentary about one of the ugliest stories in twentieth century warfare the event known as the rape of Nanking. During a brief period in late December 1937 Japanese forces bombed the city of Nanking then the capital of China moving on after assaulting Shanghai. Much of the city's population fled. But the poor had to remain lacking the money to get out. Troops then moved in and brutally executed several hundred thousand civilians using guns and bayonets and fire and raped tens of thousands of woman leaving most of the once beautiful prosperous city in ruins. They also immediately executed by various methods thousands of captured soldiers.The positive side of the story is that a group of foreigners perhaps less that two dozen who had been resident in Nanking remained there to help save the helpless civilians and soldiers who had fled and created a Safety Zone to protect them. It was not respected but nonetheless they were able to save perhaps another couple of hundred thousand people.The presentation lasts only 88 minutes but is packed with mindboggling material. Using a ground approach similar to the Culture Project's theater events 'Exonerated' and 'Guantanamo' in which a group of actors dramatically read actual accounts the foreigners' stories and that of one Japanese soldier are reconstructed by Stephen Dorff Woody Harrelson. Mariel Hemingway and others. In between their accounts there are interviews with Chinese survivors and some Japanese soldiers involved in the massacres.The most important foreigners are Bob Wilson Minnie Vautrin and John Rabe whose accounts are voiced by Harrelson Hemingway and Jrgen Prochnow respectively. Wilson was a surgeon born in China son of a missionary who stayed on after the bombing. Vautrin was a missionary and head of the education department of a college she hid her women students and saved them from being raped. Rabe was a German businessman and Nazi Pary member who protected hundreds of Chinese civilians on his estate. He and Wilson and Magee were the most active in establishing the twosquaremile Safety Zone that provided a shaky but essential shield for refugees who fled their homes.There are some film clips of killings.

	schema:headline " Stunningly powerful documentary filmmaking and an elegant monument to its heroes";
	schema:reviewBody "Nanking is a film that derives a devastating power from its staid remembrance of humanity's capacity for suffering its capacity for evil and its capacity for good. It catalogues one of the most horrifying events in the history of the continent. As an overture for the Second World War the Rape of Nanking was hell on earth. Nanking the then bustling capital of China was savagely brutalised by the invading Japanese military force in the summer of 1937. First the air raids began tearing through the city's economy destroying the lives of its citizens leaving them helpless to the inevitable slaughter by the approaching troops. As the city's expatriates and those with money scurried to flee a foreign contingent made up of the clergy teachers and professionals stayed behind to protect and aid the destitute.Directors Bill Guttentag and Bill Sturman pay tribute to those 22 men and women whose courage and kindness enabled them to establish a provisional safety zone that provided refuge for over 200000 civilians despite being outnumbered by a belligerent army angered at having the eyes of the world on them. Somewhere between being a cogent docudrama of heroism and a harrowingly powerful documentary of an unfathomable catastrophe the vivid characterisations of these Americans and Europeans are crafted through the film's wellenvisioned and excellently staged readings by its weathered performers that include Woody Harrelson Mariel Hemingway Stephen Dorff and most notably Jurgen Prochnow. The letters and anecdotes of the expatriate saviours that provide the pointbypoint narration carries with it a cutting painful urgency and is delivered with compelling ideas of responsibility and personal anguish by the thespians and various composite characters.Much of the film's haunting intensity comes from its use stock footage to recall the horrors of the past. The seamlessly inducted black and white archival footage of wartime atrocities capture the sorrow and ad hoc sentiments of people long gone even as their cries and pain linger and reverberate throughout history. It adds to its sentience by summoning the voices and memories of Chinese survivors their tears and pained expressions leading the way to the film's most enduring interviews. When one interviewee recalls how his mother breastfed his infant brother even as she was dying from being bayoneted through the chest this anecdote ominously carries with it the burden of indescribable truth and inexplicable iniquity and a discovery of unknown depths of madness. Then the interviews with the surviving Japanese soldiers show remorselessness and the descriptions of the matteroffact executions and acts of depravity convey a sense that living through the war has changed these men irreparably. The footage and interviews show how the perspectives seen through the eyes of humanity are reconfigured during times of war when sin becomes justified and decency is abandoned.The shared human consciousness between the foreigners and ravaged citizenry is indelibly considered in Prochnow's recital of the German businessman and Nazi sympathiser John Rabe's journal entry a detail from memory made fecund by time Shouldn't one make an attempt to help them? There's a question of morality here and so far I haven't been able to sidestep it. This pronouncement is a scathing indictment of the denials and of the deliberate obscuration of truths so oppressive that it is met with ethical and universal repercussions. The preclusions of accountability are present even today as other parts of the world are mired in invasions Rabe's conundrum is still a relevant inquiry that is responded with an uncomfortable silence.".

A panel of actors speak the lines from letters and diaries of EuropeanAmerican witnesses and Chinese and Japanese survivors tell their stories themselves on film.

The story line is well honed accompanied by stills 16 mm smuggled out by one of the foreigners and the actors provide voice for the foreigners. It is an incredibly moving and informative film. I sat next to two couples two Japanese American men married to Chinese American women. One wife had seen the film the night before and our night she brought everyone else back with her. I spoke with one of the husbands and he said that out of scale of 5 he gave it a 7.

This film is an absolute mustview for those driven to bringer greater peace justice and truth to the world regardless of heritage.Of course there will always be a swell of controversy among descendants of Japanese and Chinese heritage which is an unquestionable shame especially for those in the former group. The list of excuses denials and sophisticated coverup I've often witnessed firsthand by many of my JapaneseAmerican friends is disgusting. However I am not interested in fueling a debate inspired by closeted nationalism racialethnic pride and partial history the end results have so often led to circular frustration beyond comprehension. The evidence of the Nanking Genocide not massacre is overwhelming and indisputable. These realities are clearly demonstrated throughout this emotionally paralyzing film. I would further declare that any person of Japanese lineage strong enough to view this film will undeniably depart with a shaken conscious.Effectively Nanking utilizes written verbatim historical documentation mostly from Western figures who were present during the swift and unforgettable tragedy of December 1937. People who thankfully recorded their experiences by pen and further confronted the horrors of the Japanese army with unbelievable courage. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword. Throughout this spiritcrushing reel the historical dialogue is channeled via familiar Hollywood actors and actual survivors of the genocide  all genuinely driven by objective therapeutic and moralseeking resolve.

One being Darfur Sudan which continues at this very moment. Even more the denial by people especially with Japanese heritage is just utterly perplexing and beyond tragic.I'll refrain from further analysis and opinion only to suggest that you find courage in your moral capacity to spend roughly two hours of a day with a good friend or family member to see this film of monumental tragedy and courageous heroism. We cannot call ourselves human without facing the wickedness within. The soul requires to be wholly cleansed from time to time. Nanking has such effectsaffects.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1937 the ancient capital of China Nanking was surrounded by the expansionist troops of Japan. For many days the city was bombed until it was forced to surrender. Then in an act of evil barbarism the Japanese entered the town and executed 10s of thousands of prisoners of war. I have read about this incident in Iris Chang's THE RAPE OF NANKING and in this book as well as in this documentary surviving Japanese soldiers rationalized this as necessary and that they had no choice since they couldn't feed all these prisoners! One even seemed to smile and laugh about it in the documentaryat which point I found myself ready to scream at the screen! That's because no matter how you try to justify this massacre what happened next is subhuman and evil as half the city was butcheredmen women and children. Young women old women children and even boys were repeatedly raped then murdered. Living noncombatants were used for bayonet practice and Japanese officers had contests to see how many and how quickly they could behead these civilians! It was indeed a holocaust though sadly today few recall that it occurredincluding MANY within Japan itself.This story of the fall and rape of the city of Nanking in 1937 by the Japanese is explained in this film using an unusual combination of interviews with survivors film footage photos and recreations of the voices of witnesses to the horror who are now long dead. One reviewer thought that the way they had actors portraying the dead Western witnesses to the slaughter was tacky but I am not sure how else they could have done this effectively. Regardless of how it was constructed the topic was so gutwrenching and sad that the film couldn't help but be a very emotionally draining documentary. This is not fun to watch but also very necessary lest we forget.If I had any criticism of the film is that perhaps it wasn't quite graphic enoughthough it was very graphic. I've seen film and photos that were worse than many of the ones used in the film. I've also seen interviews with evil exsoldiers in Japan today who contend that none of this is true or make excuseseven though there are boxes of evidence to the contrary such as many photos soldiers took with trophies that were then sent to their familiesthese trophies were rows of severed Chinese heads for which they were responsible.By the way I mentioned Ms. Chang's book and I learned that not too long after writing it Ms. Change committed suicide. That is a great loss and you wonder what the impact her research had on this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I imagine it's hard enough to make a compelling documentary with those depicted being alive. That said when those whose diaries are the basis for said documentary have long since passed on it must be a minor miracle if the project works in even a small way. Oh yes add in that few people cared at the time the actual events occurred either by ignorance or indifference and that very same lack of interest still exists today...So why bother? Perhaps because it has been said that a society who fails to recognize its mistakes is doomed to repeat them. If you believe in this simple premise then how can we not properly acknowledge what the Japanese did while the world watched even this many years later. Every generation needs to learn from our collective history and I believe this movie is an important tool in that lesson.More to the point of Nanking. It is not in any way meant to be any kind of definitive documentary of all events that were related to the Japanese destruction of Nanking and therefore should not be examined as such. It tells the story of the few the foreigners in a very narrow time period who were responsible for the preservation of at least a quarter of a million Chinese refugees who would have most certainly been massacred. It does this by a uniquely artistic device of using some living survivors interspersed with actors portraying those who are dead yet are able to tell their stories using wording right from their diaries. By understanding that the words are the actual words of these deceased people who saved lives against the fiercest evil more than validates this approach for this viewer.I want to recommend this movie to those interested in the atrocities of war as it relates to history and who we are and should be. All civilized humanity should fight for justice and never sit idly by as evil goes about it's business unchecked. When we sit back and do nothing evil flourishes as history proved all to well in the next seven or eight years as more Japanese and Nazi atrocities mounted. This movie reminds us of that and as such is not a hate letter to any sect but shows the human capacity for both evil and good. It's our mandate to make sure good wins and I find this documentary effectively states this. Important and timely highly recommended.".

It intercuts original newsreel film and film made by witnesses to the atrocity facetocamera reminiscence by some of the Chinese eyewitnesses interviews apparently made some years ago with surviving Japanese soldiers who were involved in one part of the massacre and a small cast of mostly American actors reading excerpts from diary entries letters and other documents written by some of the 15 Europeans who tried so valiantly to maintain the safe zone in the old town of Nanking during the massacre.As a history teacher I have taught a little 20th century East Asian history. I knew of the Nanking massacre. I have read some of the documents used in the film and seen some of the still pictures. I hadn't seen any of the film before though. It's very shocking stuff. That said the most powerful and emotional moments of the film for me were the interviews. Especially the accounts of the old people children at the time who saw their family members killed or experienced rape.Some of the comments I've read on the message boards here question whether this is a legitimate documentary. The Europeans and some of the Chinese and one Japanese are portrayed by actors. They do their job very well but there is always a problem with dramatisation. How much can we trust the actors' interpretation of their lines? And how far has the editing gone? Then also why choose just these people to represent the European community? Where were the Danish and British voices? Also although they had tried to put themselves into character as prim missionary grey businessman reticent doctor at least three of the actors were familiar faces to me and in the beginning I found my thoughts wandering off the topic as I tried to identify them. Mariel Hemingway Jrgen Prochnow and Woody Harrelson. Contrary to some of the voices on this message board I don't think Nanking is antiJapanese propaganda or simply out to shock. I think the film makers are sincere when they say through the words of their European witnesses that the film does not set out to vilify the Japanese as a people. Though I note that the Chinese witnesses uniformly refer to Japanese devils  at least in the subtitling. But isn't it often the case that a film made to condemn the atrocities of war is always likely to be interpreted differently depending on the prejudices the audience brings with them? If you already think the Japanese are devils this film will confirm you in your belief. If you distrust Americans you will find more fuel for your prejudice here. If you think all war is hell you'll go away convinced that this film is a great contribution to the cause of pacifism.I tend towards the latter. And I think I could use this film in class to teach history.".

They talk about the killings and rapings impassively even with a little hint of smugness. It ironically holds a mirror to the actors' readings of characters. Do they hate the Japanese?

I don't know what Hitler was thinking???What the Japanese hold against the Chinese is not hatred but disgust. Despite a major part of the Japanese language and culture is borrowed from the Chinese more than a millennium ago the Japanese are very different from the Chinese. They are neat clean organized disciplined efficient and focused. Anything that the Chinese are not. Since the 19th century many Japanese view the Chinese as rats subhuman beings. They have no problem killing raping the subhumans like they did in Nanking in 1937 and many other occasions.My friend was puzzled by the smugness showing in those Japanese interviewees in the documentary. I know why. Many Japanese historical samurai stories boast the feat of raping women. Most notably Miyamoto. Rape is not a sin or something to be shameful about in the spirit of samurai.I don't hate the Japanese. I'm just wondering when I watch Clint Eastwood's movie Letters from Iwo Jima. I wonder how much unnecessary blood had been in those Japanese soldiers' hands before the battle of Iwo Jima? How many Chinese civilians had they killed? How many Chinese women had they raped? How many American soldiers had they disembodied and disemboweled?I don't hate the Japanese. I only question the hundreds of thousands of people who believe the Japanese didn't deserve the atomic bombs in 1945 in order to end WWII.I don't hate the Japanese.

On November 11 1937 after securing control of Shanghai the Japanese army advanced towards Nanking from different directions. In early December the Japanese troops were already in the outskirts of Nanking.On December 9 the Japanese troops launched a massive attack upon the city. On the 12th the defending Chinese troops decided to retreat to the other side of the Yangtze River Yangzi Jiang. On December 13 the 6th and 16th Divisions of the Japanese Army entered the city Zhongshan and Pacific Gates. In the afternoon two Japanese Navy fleets arrived. In the following six weeks the occupying forces engaged in an orgy of looting and mass execution which came to be known as the Nanking Massacre. Most experts agree that at least 300000 Chinese died and 20000 women were raped. Some estimate the numbers to be much higher  340000 and 80000 respectively. The Japanese government to this day maintains that the death toll is greatly exaggerated and some politicians have even claimed that the Massacre itself is a fabrication.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one visualize the diaries of unfilmed people who are no longer living? Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman employ actors to read as if in a playwrights' initiative the records of the tortured souls buried by time and the formal writings of human history. At first I thought the story was somehow cheapened by this technique but upon reflection I see the power of its subjectivity. As a freshman in high school I saw a documentary in a history class about The Rape of Nanking in 1937 which truly stunned me with its depictions of the utmost brutality and heartless destruction that went on when the Japanese invaded. That was one thing. Another was seeing this film which not only interweaves stock footage and photographs on par with those of the Holocaust but features Chinese survivors who tell their stories their overwhelmingly horrific stories. And as for the survivors who can't speak for themselves actors speak their very words for them. In a sense that is one of the more essential aspects of what actors do Identify.It's not often that I connect on a personal level with historical accounts of atrocity. I hear of Jews gays and gypsies being cooked alive gassed starved and other such things and I can only recognize the horror and be disturbed by indefensible fright and indescribable shock that I see in a victim's eyes for instance. The story of Nanking from the mouths of these people seems to me like a whole new world of terror. It is thus evidenced that human beings are capable of the most unspeakable cruelty and insurmountable venom. Perhaps it's that German and Japanese culture have a history of thinking very uniformly whereas Americans in spite of how cruel and despicable we've been throughout our history have a record of being torn by internal struggles. This documentary glimpses the other side of the coin Are human beings capable of surviving their experience with the same unspeakable cruelty and insurmountable venom?Maybe the reason I felt at first as if the film was deterred by the artifice of actors could be because the most riveting moments are all interviews with real Chinese survivors. The most arresting moments by far are the unexpected interviews with Japanese who were in the army during the Sino Japanese War committing the atrocities. At least one of them chuckles at a recollection.".

Yet all you ever seem to hear is the 6 million Jews that the Nazis killed. YES YES YES the holocaust was an obscene tragedy of the worst kind but why don't we rap the Japs for their 14 million victimsafter all the world leaned on us for herding the Japs living in the US into internment camps during the war and then waiting 35 some years to repay them a part of what they lost but what reparations have the Japanese made to the world for THEIR atrocities? THEY HAVEN'T EVEN ADMITTED IT TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE!! Japanese world history goes up to 1940then skips to 1946 and continues to the present day!?!?!? This movie is a MUSTSEE! It is accurate factual and chilling! Go see it! And Iris Chang may you rest in eternal peace dear lady!".

They saved over 250000 by setting up a safe zone. Another 200000 were killed and 20000 women between 12 and 60 were raped by the Japanese soldiers.The Japanese killed all young men just because they may be soldiers. They gang raped every night as many women as they could. It was an atrocity that clearly shows the level to which soldiers go in time of war.

	schema:reviewBody "There's Woody Harrelson. There's Mariel Hemingway. And look there's the Chinese lady from The Joy Luck Club who baked chocolatepeanut butter pies for her American husband. These wellknown actors aren't here to do a press junket for their latest film. Somewhat reminiscent of Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street the arriving performers aren't here to do a workshop production of Anton Chekov's Uncle Vanya neither. Harrelson and the other actors file into the theater find their seats and transform into period piece characters before our very eyes. Adapting the story of Nanking into a filmed theater piece could have gone horribly wrong but it's a creative gambit that pays off handsomely sometimes with stirring results. Interspersed with familiar faces such as Hemingway and Rosalind Chao survivors from the secret holocaust help create a dynamic of firsthand testimony and theater performance art. With each new horrific account of the tenday siege that made a ruins out of China's capital city the Hollywood actors slowly disappear into character as the narrative takes precedence over the mode of its telling. What began as a jarring mix of amateur and professional actors soon coalesces into a seamless whole as the spilled blood of threethousand Chinese innocents democratizes the disparate ensemble. Hemingway however needs to be singled out. As Minnie Vautrin the granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway is more like a conduit than an actor.In depicting the Japanese army the lateIris Chang author of The Rape of Nanching didn't excuse their inhumane behavior but she did get to the root of it. Chang wrote that the young Japanese men were subjected to a very rigorous training program which desensitized them to violence. And their Shinto faith as opposed to Christianity doesn't contain the same message of an allencompassing love for other people. Shintoism bred a sort of feral tribalism that proved fatal for anybody who wasn't of Japanese descent.Nanking gives the Japanese side a voice too but it's a highly selective one which may infuriate some viewers. Not one of the surviving soldiers nor the actors portraying their brethren expresses any remorse towards the raped and slaughtered. But perhaps this is warranted since the war criminals continue to be hailed as conquering heroes at the Yasuhune Shrine. To inflame the viewer Nanking shows the men shouting Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! in a context that suggests an overriding indifference among the Japanese towards the dead Chinese peasants many of whom were women and children.Perhaps no director embodies the Japanese ideal more than Yasujiro Ozu whose domestic dramas that feature quiet humble characters stand in stark contrast with the brutal actions of the Japanese army. During the war Japanese filmmakers were encouraged to praise the war and promote a fascist ideology. Many succumbed to the state's edict but not Ozu. This omission of politics is worse than a ideologically fascist film. For those who've seen propaganda films in particular Leni Riefenstahl's The Triumph of the Will there's a sense that something is amiss. In a film like Tokyo Monogotari Ozu's acknowledged masterpiece the people exist in a vacuum. The Chinese aren't even a rumor hiding in the negative space. They don't exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched Nanking at the Seattle International Film Festival. OK I can understand why the movie would get a high rating as of the time of the writing of this review it averaged 8.310 out of 87 votes. It has an amazing amount of details and footage about the Nanking Massacre as well as information about the Safety Zone that I had never known about until I saw the movie. Nevertheless I must respectfully disagree with previous voters' opinions on Nanking.First of all the idea of showing the actors who read the lines was a bad move. It seemed artificial... almost conceited. Why couldn't they just show the atrocities with a voiceover? Why did they have to add extra time to the movies to show the actors? Was it just to get a feature film running time of 88 minutes? Couldn't they have added extra minutes by interviewing more Chinese people instead? There's a smattering of the Chinese point of view and very little of the Japanese point of view. Not there could be much for exJapanese soldiers to say about it that wouldn't inflame more antiJapanese feelings. Secondly I'm sure we all agree that the events were atrocious and despicable. If the rating was solely determined by the movie's content it would get a good score from me. However as a movie the pacing did not let up for a moment. The audience was bombarded with image after image of atrocity. Meanwhile a bunch of actors are reading the diaries and letters of the Westerners who observed many of the atrocities firsthand and some of them aren't conveying much emotion and Mariel Hemingway overacts. After a while I got desensitized about it. I was not the only person who felt that way after the screening either. Several others who I talked to felt the same way. I don't think this was the intended effect by the filmmakers. They wanted sympathy for the Chinese but they ended up with a bunch of viewers who shrug their shoulders say Gee that sucked for the Chinese shrug their shoulders and move on. Or at the worst they created people who say Gee that sucked for the Chinese get over it and actually think less of modern Chinese people for being stuck in the past. Third... what happened after 1938? The movie doesn't explain what happens to Nanking after the Safety Zone was abolished. What happened to the Chinese people? What happened to the survivors who spoke in the movie? It's a glaring hole in the movie. It's like the fate of the city became less important after the foreigners' importance was reduced. If it was not for these problems I'd give the movie at least a 710. However I can't give a high rating to a movie that creates the opposite effect from what is intended. You know what's going to happen? Most of the people who are unfamiliar with the Nanking Massacre and decide to watch this movie are going to pop in the DVD watch for 1545 minutes and then stop the movie because they can't watch anymore. They'll remember that bad stuff happened in Nanking and that's it.".

The Nanking Massacre or The Rape of Nanking as it's widely referred to took place over a 6 week period in 1937. The Chinese capital city was invaded by Japanese troops resulting in 200000 or more depending on varying estimates innocent people raped and slaughtered. Tales of civilians being forced to have sex with corpses or family members unborn foetus's being cut out of their mother's belly with bayonet's or the gangrape of small girls and boys are all confirmed here. But Nanking achieves its power not through shocking and repulsing but by showing the triumph of the human spirit in the face of hell on Earth.Although plenty of archival footage is used  from the beautiful pulsating Nanking sitting proudly as China's capital to it's destruction through heavy bombing  a bulk of the film consists of readings by actors of diary entries written by the likes of Nazi party member John Rabe and American missionary Minnie Vautrin. Rabe and Vautrin were part of a small wealthy group of men and women who decided against fleeing Naking and set up a 'Safety Zone' inside the city. The actors including the likes of Jurgen Prochnow Mariel Hemingway Woody Harrelson and Stephen Dorff are earnest and understated in their delivery and this helps give these moments an urgency when it could have come off as trying to add some Hollywood gloss to a devastating event.The Japanese agreed to the implementation of the safety zone but their soldiers would parade the grounds raping women at will and dragging men off to be executed on mass for being suspected enemy soldiers. Still the protection offered by Rabe Vautrin Bob Wilson et al is estimated at being responsible for the survival of 200000 Chinese lives. This is hard stuff to watch one of the most despicable war crimes ever committed  interviews with Chinese survivors and seemingly remorseless and disconnected Japanese soldiers hit particularly hard  but this is essential viewing proving that in order to move forward we must look back.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Hollywood actors read actual writings of the American and German missionaries that created the Safety Zone for the Chinese possibly saving 250000 lives.

	schema:reviewBody "While the Nazi atrocities were the most infamous events in the 1930s and 1940s Japanese forces carried out a series of equally vicious actions in China and Korea. In 1937 the Japanese army nearly wiped the city of Nanjing off the face of the earth while committing a near genocide against the population. In the midst of the horror a group of westerners established a Safety Zone as a refuge for people fleeing the atrocities. The documentary Nanking intersperses footage of the terror with readings from the diaries of the westerners who established the Safety Zone and also interviews with Chinese citizens who survived the massacres. In addition there are also interviews with former Japanese troops who act as if they didn't do anything wrong.The documentary shows a good contrast between the ability to carry out evil acts and the desire to do good in the most desperate circumstances. The Chinese survivors have some of the most heartbreaking stories probably very similar to the stories that the survivors of concentration camps have.The point is to understand that these malicious deeds are unfortunately inevitable when a country has an empire. Much like Germany's actions in Poland or Italy's actions in Ethiopia Japan's actions in China must never be forgotten although Japan's government still denies it.Another good movie focusing on the Japanese occupation of Nanjing is the recent Flowers of War starring Christian Bale as a clergyman giving Chinese schoolgirls sanctuary.".

But the car who beat him was actually driven by a local Tofu shop owner's son Takumi Fujiwara who had unknowingly perfected the art of mountain racing through daily deliveries of tofu. Takumi was able to defeat Nakazato again showing that he is no fluke. However winning hasn't helped him home life as his father Bunta Fujiwara was a drunkard and a racing genius. His girlfriend Natsuki Mogi wants his attention even though she's got a dark and shameful secret and his best friend Itsuki who has no talent in driving wants Takumi to teach him road racing... after buying the WRONG car.

	schema:reviewBody "Just to set the expectations from this review I have not read the Initial D manga nor watched any of the anime. Therefore this review's point of view will be from the cinematic experience and there will be no comparison on how true it stays to the mangaanime.Despite all the star power in the film from teeny boppers Edison Chen and Shawn Yue to veterans Kenny Bee and Anthony Wong this still remains a Jay Chou vehicle pardon the pun. Jay stars as a petrol pump attendant who by day works at a petrol kiosk and in the wee hours of the night helps his tofu selling dad deliver tofu in an old Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno using a route that traverses along a winding Mount Akina.Naturally with his 5 years experience he intimately knows the terrain and gets faster each time until a group of street racers set their sights to conquer the route.There will definitely be comparisons with Hollywood's The Fast and The Furious series starring Vin DieselPaul Walker. The similarities are there  the fast cars the beautiful racer babes the rivalry between arrogant drivers. You even get the same cinematography technique used that starts from the driver's POV pulling back to the dashboard the rear seat the boot and the car from a helicopter view.But what sets this film apart is the way it is delivered. Being based on a comic book offers some depth to the storyline and it helped by staying true to the setting being based in Japan and not HK. The races in itself might seem repetitive as the highlight seemed to be focused on its title  the drift technique being used adnausem but having different drivers challenge each other on the one and only route breaks the monotony as you root for your favourite to come out tops.Given this is Jay Chou's debut movie role it is difficult to critique if his acting skills are up to mark as his lead character Takumi Fujiwara is a nonchalant man of few words. Which is very much like his persona. His costars Edison Chen and Shawn Yue could very well be their own persons as well. Chapman To as usual brings across the rather light hearted moments and Anthony Wong as Chou's dad a veteran race ace who finds solace in the bottle and having a penchant for dozing off.Perhaps the only flaw about the movie was the sappy romance between Jay and his Japanese costar. Not that she isn't gorgeous which is a saving grace but their scenes together doesn't further the plot much and slows down the pace somewhat of this movie about the need for speed.This is an enjoyable flick one in which I waited for the theme song  tune to be featured only at the end credits!. But no I don't think I will be converted to a Jay Chou fan boy anytime soon.I suspect that in the upcoming weeks we probably might see parallel imports  makes of the Trueno on our shores to satisfy the racer boy wannabes heard Singapore only has 2? although it probably can't run as fast as in the movies movie magic lah. And yeah the driving with one hand on the wheel and the other on the face with the contemplating look.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a liveaction adaptation of a mangaanime series of the same name. The story is abridged synthesis of the first two seasons of the anime with details from the fourththird? mixed in. Compared to the original work much of the characters' personalities relationships and motives have been altered some in the ways that are hard to agree with too. Many of the characters have been dropped or diminished. Judging the movie as independent entity it's not a great deal but some of the modifications make the story a bit confusing. Casting itself is rather good. Characters have strong resemblance to their drawn counterparts apart from the main character and her girlfriend. To even things a bit their characters are best preserved in the screenplay.What I like in the movie best is it's honesty. The movie does not try to justify the illegal street racing theme with some farfetched undercover copfamily honorextortion subplot it's only about young men driving fast on downhill. Though the most spectacular stunts are CGI the races are pleasant to watch by no means small reason being the relatively calm pace of editing. Drivers' actions while cornering the toeheel braking down shifting and steering are usually shown in single shot instead of several splitsecond extreme closeups. What I also liked was the fact the races are about who was the best driver not about who has the most outrageous sticker or flashiest accessories on the car. The movie has been criticized for lack of plot. I don't think it is so. The plot is subdued not overly dramatized story of a regular kid who learns about downhill racing scene in his home town. The biggest problem with the script is the inclusion of 2nd and 3rd Stage. The plot makes all too abrupt change of direction halfway through the movie because of this. The movie finale is a synthesis of 1st season and rewritten 2nd season finales it's awkward and not very successful. I can't help thinking the movie could have been better if the writers had made the scope a little less wide and only included the 1st season.Even so the movie is rather enjoyable. You don't need to vegetate through the movie to enjoy it or have a diehard passion for the subject.".

	schema:headline " Chinese adaptation of a Japanese comic is not you typical race film. Probably will play better if you don't know the source and are open to different take in a race film";
	schema:reviewBody "Takumi is a high schooler who often delivers his fathers tofu late at night. His late night trips have made him adept at the winding down hill run of Mt. Akina which is a course used by the street racers of the area as the ultimate test of skill. When an unintentional race brings him to the notice of the racers his life changes as he has to field numerous offers to actually see who is the best driver.Based on a Japanese comic and cartoon Initial D is a live action Chinese film thats broken box office records across Asia. Despite being a huge animation fan I've never seen the animation nor have a I read the comic. I'm not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing but seeing how many fans of the source material are unhappy with the film I would say its a good thing.Flat out I liked this movie. It did take a while to warm up to but once I began to take it for what it is I thoroughly enjoyed it.Is it a great film? In someways yes and in others no. As I said this takes a bit to get going. The lead is a bit too closed mouth for my taste barely uttering a word for the entire two hours. Its a bit too teen angsty. Still you have great characters and great performances by pretty much everyone in the cast even if everyone was speaking three or four different languages when this was filmed.The racing is excellent. Its mostly seems to have been done with out CGI enhancement. I like that there are no horrific crashes police chases or other clichd events that are so rampant in American movies. And while I was initially apprehensive by the fact the racing is always on the same stretch of road I warmed to the idea since by doing that we really got to see who was best. If you want American style racing in many different environments stay away Definitely worth a look see especially if you want to see a race film that is not like all of the rest. 7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 out of 10 for IMDb purposes.".

	schema:headline " Bad for Initial D fans!";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course I had to watch this movie since I was a big Initial D fan. I had high hopes when watching the opening scene where Jay Chou's character is effortlessly gliding down the mountain pass in his Trueno. That was the best part of the movie unfortunately.Let's talk about the good first. The car scenes are pretty fun to watch sometimes. In many of the scenes they'll hug a turn on the inside and let the rear slide out and overtake the opponent. It's pretty fun to watch and you just have to wonder who the stunt men are or if they brought in Japanese drift legend Tsuchiya on to the set for some of these shots.Unfortunately that's the only thing that is good about this movie. Let's talk about the bad now. The characters are two dimensional. If you are a fan of the anime you will not find your beloved characters here. Jay Chou does a pretty bad job as the protagonist. I feel like he's always mumbling out his lines or is just wondering why he isn't doing the music video yet. Also let's talk about his friends. They're morons. His best friend Itsuki is more of a raving idiot than his anime counterpart would ever hope to be. In the anime this character talks about trying to get better and having Takumi as his inspiration. In the movie this character talks about how he's a racing god and when he loses and wrecks he asks his poor father to buy him an even faster car GTR so that he can rematch and wreck that one too. Takumi's father is also a drunk and a bum. Also he is abusive. He beats his son and Jay Chou has scars on his back from all the beatings. I don't know what they were thinking by making him an abusive drunkard since obviously from the original material he was never one. Obviously you can tell from what I'm writing here that the director probably never watched an episode of Initial D in his life.I find the camera work to be also crappy and low budget. There are lots of scenes where they freeze the frame and you are left thinking did something happen to my DVD player? Nope. That's their creative take on racing. To freeze the scene even when it's a person's face talking. Then there's the music. Nothing in the movie was good except for Jay Chou's song. The racing scenes have music that sounds like a background track for a rap battle without the rapping. If you're a fan of the anime don't expect to hear your favorite eurobeat tracks or Move songs.Overall I was bored only paid attention during the races and got utterly perplexed by the ridiculous ending sequence where the people are celebrating. The other team and even his abusive father who has his arms around two young girls start cheering. Also I'd like to point out that not only is a 3 car race unfair I've never seen a race with 3 cars in Initial D or any mountain race scene in any movie!Next time try not to squeeze so much crap in.".

Takumi blows the engine on the AE86 while racing team emperor's leader ON AN AKINA DOWNHILL RUN. In the comic and anime he never lost on Akina!

When the cars are racing there are some sweet camera choices and your pulse gets moving a bit.

When the action stops it gets worse. Slow motion at all the wrong times sloppy cuts and a slow pace all slap the audience in the face. The only high point is the drifting work was pretty good at times for running through hairpins on the mountain passes. Aside from that I wish I never knew this movie existed. I love the series even more because it doesn't make these horrible story choices.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starting with the title note that long before the first user comment was posted someone had started in the message board below on the subject of drifting a thread that has now grown to considerable length. Any reader interested in the subject should find it very useful.Initial D brings back memories of an alltime classic in car racing Grand Prix 1966 which boasted an impressive international cast including James Gardner Ives Montand and Mifune Toshiro. Although both are about car racing the two movies may very well be in two entirely different genres. Grand Prix is drama in epic proportion Initial D a comicadapted action comedy. I'm just saying that they are different and therefore difficult to compare not one is better than the other.I haven't enjoyed a local movie as much as I did Initial D since The Storm Riders and The Mission in the late 90s. Never cared much for Stephen Chow while the Infernal Affair trilogy has been marred by one too many the last one that ran out of steam and tantamount to a rip off. The beauty of Initial D is that it is entirely devoid of pretentiousness. Well paced and giving you the feeling of reading the comics the movie is also sprinkled with funny gags that are mercifully not insults to the audience's intelligence like some that you find in local productions. Some may find the turn of the romantic subplot unsatisfactory but that only goes to show that the movie makers have not gone all out to make a crowdpleaser. The emphasis is rightly put back on the theme car racing.Casting is more than just a good job. The chemistry between the pair of veterans Anthony Wong and Kenny Bee is just fantastic. The Infernal pair Edison Chen and Shawn Yue continue their maturing process that was very evident in Gong Wu. Yue gives a winning portray of a gentlemanly competitor while Chen never looks better with his poise as a leader. Chapman To's comic relief is pleasing. Jordan Chan even with his brief appearance shows great screen presence. This guy is good on stage if you've seen him in live theatre. Anne Suzuki has come a long way from the tom boy in Returner shed some of the chubbiness in Hana and Alice and takes on a new persona of youthful voluptuousness.As to Jay Chow the directors intimated in various radio interviews that the main character was initially intended for Edison Chen. Then in a checkingout meeting with Chow they were convinced that they have got the right man who can project the shy introvert appearance and the intensely fierce competitiveness inside. The result upon seeing the movie convincingly vindicates that decision. In these interviews they also talked about the actual filming. It's interesting to hear that at the initial planning stage 120 shots on the race those with drifting in particular were planned to be made with CG assistance. But as the filming onsite progressed they found that the stunt people hired to drive the cars were so good that most of these shots did not need any CG 114 to be exact. So we have a film that is NOT a repeat of the animation when it comes to the racing scenes. When ask who among the cast actually is the best driver the answers is Shawn Yue.What I also like about this movie is that despite fierce competition there is no villain. In flicks on boxing you would often find use of dirty tricks or hitting below the belt. In Initial D even when some opponents are obnoxious the competition is entirely clean and fair. This is good. Did I mention the racing scenes? Terrific fun with music to match.".

	schema:headline " a total waste of electricity to watch";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know about all the other reviewers but I have been an avid follower of this animation since the beginning. To begin with I d say that this director n everyone involved in the making of this movie has no idea whatsoever about the legacy of original story. Where shall I begin...... any movie you see with an allstar cast means only one thing publicity without any depth in the film.While I applause the director's effort of trying to imitate some of the out of this world angles used in the animation there is nothing in this film which suggests it has been properly written or related to the original drawings of the manga writer himself.An all star Hong Kong cast except Anne Suzuki  venue in Japan  actors and actresses speaking in 3 different languages which eventually was dubbed is weird enough and to spice up the ridiculous plot the Hongkies made Takumi's father a drunk and a child abuser. Totally revolting and disgrace how they bought the rights and twisted the whole plot into a circus act.Takumi played by Jay Chow plays the easiest act showing his emotionless corpse now and then in the film. Only positive thing about him is that he bears some resemblance to the Takumi in the Japanese animation. Ryousuke Takahashi played by Edison Chen lacks the vibe and aura which makes him stand out as a great leader as well as driver. All he had with him is a bunch of mechanics a van and a laptop. Finally the biggest mistake was the Itsuki Tachibana character played by Chapman To which is obnoxious and shallow. The problem in this film is that the moron who casted all these people i this film felt it was alright for them to act out what they have been doing in all other movies. So before you watch this movie close your eyes and imagine all Chapman To's movies and you will know what I am saying. If I hadn't known better I thought Itsuki Tachibana Chapman To was the lead because he was the loudest and the director paid too much time in his character developing which is totally unnecessary.I felt ashamed knowing I once admired the director and he screwed up such a beautiful and exciting story and the fact that I was a big Initial D fan didn't help. To make matters worse Itsuki Tachibana was the petrol kiosk owner's son wtf?!!!!!. I know it is unfair to expect a good storyline in a 2hour film from a four staged animation  manga which spanned more than 8 years to created but other films have done it before with great success i.e ichi the killer spiderman lord of the rings.The only good thing about this film is that the cars are made to resemble the ones in manga and animation and that s just as much excitement you will get. Car races shows no formula or tactics so there isn't much connection or mantocar relationship in this one. Just pure luck rather than skill. Kyouichi Sudou from Emperor team might look arrogant and overconfident but his skills are welltimed and counted for and his experiences are matched by only the best drivers. So to see him irrationally trying to overtake 2 cars after being warned that there is an incoming vehicle and then crashing topsided beggars belief. If you watch the film very carefully you would realize that all the director is interested in is the fact that takumi won all his races. No time given on how the races build up to the end where usually our hearts would be pounding trying to figure out what Takumi's next super trick would be.NOTE TO MUSIC PRODUCER FIND ANOTHER JOB YOU BOUGHT YOUR DEGREE FROM A COCKEYED BUTCHER IN KOWLOON. One of the most important elements in Initial D animation is the music. No arguments there. Tracks such as Around the world Forever Young and No One sleeps in Tokyo still linger in our head long after we watched the animation. Great beats like those kept us glued to the story as well as the action. In this Hong Kong movie they got a 85year old man with a chronic herpes beating the drums at the studio while recording. So throughout this film you will hear a same dull beat. Makes you think that the beats are just placed there as a requirement rather than a catalyst to the car races.Finally would I recommend anyone to watch this film? Let s just put it this way I would rather have a hot iron with the words 'I am Freddy Mercury's Bitch' up my ass than to go through this crap again.".

Where shall I begin...... any movie you see with an allstar cast means only one thing publicity without any depth in the film.While I applause the director's effort of trying to imitate some of the out of this world angles used in the animation there is nothing in this film which suggests it has been properly written or related to the original drawings of the manga writer himself.An all star Hong Kong cast except Anne Suzuki  venue in Japan  actors and actresses speaking in 3 different languages which eventually was dubbed is weird enough and to spice up the ridiculous plot the Hongkies made Takumi's father a drunk and a child abuser. Totally revolting and disgrace how they bought the rights and twisted the whole plot into a circus act.Takumi played by Jay Chow plays the easiest act showing his emotionless corpse now and then in the film. Only positive thing about him is that he bears some resemblance to the Takumi in the Japanese animation. Ryousuke Takahashi played by Edison Chen lacks the vibe and aura which makes him stand out as a great leader as well as driver. All he had with him is a bunch of mechanics a van and a laptop. Finally the biggest mistake was the Itsuki Tachibana character played by Chapman To which is obnoxious and shallow. The problem in this film is that the moron who casted all these people i this film felt it was alright for them to act out what they have been doing in all other movies. So before you watch this movie close your eyes and imagine all Chapman To's movies and you will know what I am saying. If I hadn't known better I thought Itsuki Tachibana Chapman To was the lead because he was the loudest and the director paid too much time in his character developing which is totally unnecessary.I felt ashamed knowing I once admired the director and he screwed up such a beautiful and exciting story and the fact that I was a big Initial D fan didn't help. To make matters worse Itsuki Tachibana was the petrol kiosk owner's son wtf?!!!!!. I know it is unfair to expect a good storyline in a 2hour film from a four staged animation  manga which spanned more than 8 years to created but other films have done it before with great success i.e ichi the killer spiderman lord of the rings.The only good thing about this film is that the cars are made to resemble the ones in manga and animation and that s just as much excitement you will get. Car races shows no formula or tactics so there isn't much connection or mantocar relationship in this one. Just pure luck rather than skill. Kyouichi Sudou from Emperor team might look arrogant and overconfident but his skills are welltimed and counted for and his experiences are matched by only the best drivers. So to see him irrationally trying to overtake 2 cars after being warned that there is an incoming vehicle and then crashing topsided beggars belief. If you watch the film very carefully you would realize that all the director is interested in is the fact that takumi won all his races. No time given on how the races build up to the end where usually our hearts would be pounding trying to figure out what Takumi's next super trick would be.NOTE TO MUSIC PRODUCER FIND ANOTHER JOB YOU BOUGHT YOUR DEGREE FROM A COCKEYED BUTCHER IN KOWLOON. One of the most important elements in Initial D animation is the music. No arguments there. Tracks such as Around the world Forever Young and No One sleeps in Tokyo still linger in our head long after we watched the animation. Great beats like those kept us glued to the story as well as the action. In this Hong Kong movie they got a 85year old man with a chronic herpes beating the drums at the studio while recording. So throughout this film you will hear a same dull beat. Makes you think that the beats are just placed there as a requirement rather than a catalyst to the car races.Finally would I recommend anyone to watch this film? Let s just put it this way I would rather have a hot iron with the words 'I am Freddy Mercury's Bitch' up my ass than to go through this crap again.";

Anthony Wong is his same reliable self and Chapman To again provides comic relieve seems like he is typecast now.The movie did not follow its inspiration the manga. Even though Jay Chow's character is lowkey and mildmannered already in the manga the character is even more mildmannered and even less intense. In the manga the dad seemed to be more responsible and nicer. That does not matter though because the races are entertaining enough. That is one of two reason why people pack the theaters to see it. The other reason? Jay Chow. Do not underestimate his draw power. This guy is an idol in Asia. Whatever he do is gold.This film is made for entertainment purposes. No depth. No plot.

	schema:reviewBody "You know I'm a man and I like cars. There's nothing to be ashamed of there. I also liked The Fast and the Furious it had some fun in there but it also had big fast shiny cars and one like mine too. So when I heard that there was this movie Initial D about drift racing popular with Japanese teenagers and it had been adapted from the Manga story I was interested and courtesy of Moviesville I got to see it.Movie The movie itself is good it's quite comic in places which could be traced back to its Manga origins and unfortunately this takes away from the story because it does present itself as having a serious underside.Something that surprised me about this movie is there isn't that much racing. For a film that is supposed to be about drift racing there's not that much that goes on. However the four or so races that do occur are superbly filmed and driven. Mixing unusual camera angles some CGI and smooth stunt driving you end up with every race scene being exciting and visually rich.The pace of the movie is quite back and forth. It's this feeling that there should be more racing and yet we're taken through scenes that range from comic to romance. It's understandable considering the group that the movie is aiming towards but you can't help but feel a little bit of growing up could have been applied to the story.The romance thread is interesting and brings a dimension to the character of Takumi. Not only does he awaken his racing spirit but also other feelings as a teenager. However some of the scenes are a little long and can feel like they jar you out of the story. It's a shame because again this movie is about racing. Ultimately though it's a good plot device and comes to a satisfying ending comparable with his Fathers life and choices.Some characters are not full explained and although that can sometimes be a good thing here it makes them feel as though they are only brought in as a distraction. The character of Takumi's friend is straight out of a comic and nothing much appears to have been done to bring him into the world of the movie. Perhaps this was a deliberate move in order to retain the connection with the story's roots but he just seems to get in the way of events.Jay Chou playing the lead of Takumi don't have that much to say and although this reflects a troubled teenager it does quickly get grating and you can understand why his Father wants to kick him into action!Picture Presented 2.351 The picture is very sharp and clear this is particularly noticeable during the racing scenes which mainly occur at night. The CGI is seamed in very well and the picture remains strong even when the camera is locked to a crane sticking out from a speeding car! It looks like a lot of work has gone into making this DVD look good.Audio Presented DD5.1EX  DTSES During the racing the sounds are really good you can hear the engines changing gears and over revving and when the camera is near the car the LFE kicks in well. Good use is made of the DTS track during these races and you feel immersed in the action.Outside of the racing little is made of the DTS but then the story doesn't really dictate it at these points. Use of the DTS would have felt forced and unnatural.Extras Presented Behind the Scenes Character Bios Making of Featurette Deleted Scenes Outtakes TV Spot Promotion in Shanghai Promotion in Japan Photo Gallery Cast and Credits Unfortunately there were no English subtitle options with any of these extras but I still watched them all! Mainly to see some behind the scenes of the racing moments and to see more of the cars in action. They are there you just have to watch rather than listen...unless of course you can speak Chinese.Overall It's an okay movie but where it excels are in the racing scenes superb drift racing which has been filmed really well using some interesting techniques camera angles and a little CGI. This makes for very impressive viewing and when combined with the powerful audio track it pulls you right into the race seat. Yet the rest of the story seems a little bit weak and could have done with more character development and less reference to its Manga roots. If you like cars and you like street racing you'll enjoy this movie.".

Or the fact that the anime Nakazato drove the 4WD GTR model of Skyline and did not drift. I won't touch on these in detail as they didn't really bother me that much.However the biggest element lacking in this is the music! Inital D fans know that Initial D is known for it's high energy dancestyle Jpop music. Considering there are at least 10 Initial D soundtrack CD's out in Japan I can't believe they didn't realize how popular the music is.The music in the film is best described as Chinese rapRB I guess which really hurt the feel of the movie in my opinion.As synonymous the anime is with the music I can't help but think what it would be without it. We'd be left with scenes of car racing with cheesy dialog intertwined with brief romance scenes. Which now that I think of it pretty much sums up this film.If they were to make an Initial D anime series with music similar to this movie's soundtrack I wonder if I would like it as much.I just might feel the same way about it as I do this movie in that it's a nice reminiscent film somewhat faithful to the original but nothing to get really excited about.If you're not a fan of Inital D or of import racing there's not much for you here.".

If you've never seen the anime or read the manga ignore the next paragraph!.My first big sticking point is the exception of several key recurring characters where has Keisuke and his yellow RX7 gone? The rest of the NightKids and Speedstars? There's a RedSuns sticker on Ryousuke's car but there's no team there! This has the result of cutting two seasons of anime into a short movie leaving little room for a sequel. The characters and relationships themselves have changed beyond recognition.

Or Ryousuke being so cocky or that he was ever a smoker he's meant to be in medical school! or was so friendly with Takeshi? Or that they ever ran three car races? The list is infinite so I'll just leave it there.Firstly the mixed bag actor choices. Jay Chou playing the main character is the most debatable. Being Taiwanese and naturally Mandarin speaking he makes an attempt at the Cantonese translation but valiantly fails. Cantonese speakers like myself can clearly tell his tone and accent is too far out of place around the other naturally Cantonese speaking actors. Even worse is that his girlfriend is Japanese and her lines are clearly dubbed. There is absolutely no chemistry between them and he reacts like a cold dead fish to her advances. No offence but she isn't all that great looking either.The arthouse look camera work is generally well done most of the time giving the film a unique though common style but sometimes it makes the scene and shot transitions confusing. The best part of the movie is clearly the racing scenes none of this straight line drag 'The Fast and the Furious' business with riced up cars or speeded up replays of cars driving at normal speed 'Legend of Speed' style. There is clearly real driving skill shown on the actual mountain passes in Japan compliments to the stunt drivers!.In terms of the acting Jay Chou tries his best to emulate Takumi's sleepyness but the 'driving with one hand and the other on the face look' clearly adds nothing except to show what a couple of the audience may be doing. As for the rest they try to work with the little substance actually present. Anthony Wong plays what he is asked and does it with his usual flair Shawn Yue does an excellent job in the interpretation of his character and Jordan Chan plays his terribly dressed antagonist with his effective silence.Unfortunately the entire film has the feeling of being dumbed down and is clearly made as one of those films where the audience wants to copy its image from the incessant slang and constantly unneeded swearing there has never been a conversational expletive in the anime! the need for everyone to smoke the excessive sexual innuendo some of the humour is effective but the more adult jokes and language clearly makes it not family friendly. This isn't something that should really be seen by its target age brackets.To sum up average acting bad plot but excellent race scenes 6.210".

	schema:reviewBody "A thoroughly commercial enterprise from the word Go Initial D stars untrained Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou who gets able assist from Hong Kong cinema king Anthony Wong and a cast that will be familiar to Hong Kong cinephiles. The film has an impressive pedigree being directed by the duo of Andrew Lau and Alan Mak and written by Felix Chong the trio having worked together previously on the mega hit and soon to be Hollywood remade Infernal Affairs trilogy.Based on the Japanese manga by Shuichi Shigeno Initial D follows the literally downhill adventures of tofu delivery teen Takumi Chou who spends his school days in a daze about the flirty Natsuki Anne Suzuki Returner his afternoons working at the gas station of best bud Itsuki Chapman To and his nights delivering tofu for his hard drinking and narcoleptic one presumes dad Bunta Anthony Wong.

The film has an impressive pedigree being directed by the duo of Andrew Lau and Alan Mak and written by Felix Chong the trio having worked together previously on the mega hit and soon to be Hollywood remade Infernal Affairs trilogy.Based on the Japanese manga by Shuichi Shigeno Initial D follows the literally downhill adventures of tofu delivery teen Takumi Chou who spends his school days in a daze about the flirty Natsuki Anne Suzuki Returner his afternoons working at the gas station of best bud Itsuki Chapman To and his nights delivering tofu for his hard drinking and narcoleptic one presumes dad Bunta Anthony Wong.

	schema:headline " Interesting Hong Kong Movie shot in Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a long running comic series by Shuuichi Shigeno this all star cast Hong Kong movie puts on screen what's on the comic's volume 115  Part until Takumi joins Project D .Takumi Fujiwara Jay Chou is a high school student who lives with his single father running a tofu shop. Inbetween his tofu deliveries he frequents Mt. Akina that has winding roads to improve his driving skills. He gets involved with the street racers that frequents the area and a battle ensues to prove who's the fastest one on the road. Takumi with his outstanding driving skills bests other racers with better performing cars. Amongst the people who shows up was Ryosuke Takahashi Edison Chen. Ryosuke takes notice of Takumi's talent and takes interest in him. Takumi's girlfriend Natsuki Ann Suzuki is chummy with Takumi but she also has other things going on with older men. Takumi goes head to head with Keiichi Sudo Jordan Chan to prove who's the fastest man on the road.The same staff from Medea Asia that's created the Infernal Affair series made this movie. The movie was shot on location in Japan around Yahikoiwamuro highway in Niigata Prefecture and Shibukawa city in Gunma prefecture. The production quality is high despite the difficulty of bringing the location to Japan. Mt. Akina is a fictitious mountain that's modeled after Mt. Haruna in Gunma prefecture.One of the center piece of the action is the Sprinter Trueno AE86 that Takumi drives. Despite its diminutive size it succeeds in out performing cars that are designed for racing performances. Trueno is is a sister model of Corolla Levin and shares the same frame and the engine. It's a performance version of the standard Sprinter model with a twin cam 4AGEU engine. In the '80s Japan 4AGEU souped up to 450 horse power was sold by custom shops. Used on AE86 that weighs less than a ton the combination made the car into a deadly rocket that can go head to head with lesser powered cars like the GTR. So a car to car battle like the one seen in this movie was entirely Possible. The original comic states that the story is occurring sometime in the '90s time frame and the cars appearing in this movie also reflects this fact.I wonder if China these days are following the Hollywood style casting that casts compatible astrological sun sign actors in the leading role. This method seems to ensure good chemistry between male and the female lead. In this movie three earth sign actors plays the lead Ann Suzuki  Taurus Anthony Wong  Virgo and Jay Chou  Capricorn. The movie has a world of its own that's completely different from the TV anime series and in some ways more exciting due to the interaction between the stars and the actual driving that takes place on the road. It's an excellently made movie that combines best of what Hong Kong Taiwan and Japan has to offer. I only wish that Edison Chen would return to Hong Kong cinema. He was very good in this movie. A very enjoyable movie that takes you into the world of street racing culture of Japan.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is official. NOBODY seems to be able to do a animemanga adaptation right. Hollywood has had a spotty track record with some good ones Speed Racer Guyver Dark Hero but many terrible ones Dragonball Evolution etc. France has had minimal success with Blood the Last Vampire and Even Japan has trouble making a anime adaptation that not only stays true to the original source but is a good movie in its own rightdeathnote was very true to the original but turned out like a cheesy convoluted B movie.With a cast of A list actors a veteran director and the promise of a blockbuster hit that would satisfy all Tau Man Ni Dinitial D looked to be the one to buck that trend. Alas it only proved that even veteran Hong Kong directors cannot make a good anime adaptation. Fans were appalled by all the changes made to many of the main characters. Changes like that are actually fine if they work well but in Tau Man Ji's case they did not. Having alienated the long time fans at least the production team would do well to deliver a solid movie experience right? WRONG! Tau Man Ji D focuses on the story of young Takumi a tofu delivery boy who honed his drifting skills delivering for his father in the Akina mountain roads. He drives the AE86 and soon attracts the attention of local street race gangs who come to challenge Takumi to races on the treacherous downhill roads. Along the way he has to deal with his budding romance with his girlfriend Natsuki and take on the notorious Emperor team. Aside from the aforementioned changes in the personalities of many characters the premise is the same as the manga. However the whole setting is a very confused one. Though obviously set in japan everyone speaks in fluent Cantonese. It would have been a lot more believable to either set the story in hong kong or at least dub over the actors with a Japanese voice track.Even as a standalone story barring any comparisons to the original manga and anime Tau Man Ji D would still be a mediocre film. The main narrative is easy enough to follow but not exactly the most original of plots typical underdog sports story. Sadly the romantic subplot feels forced thanks to Jay Chou's flattire acting and a very cheesy script. There is fair share of comic relief moments but they come across as very awkward and horribly misplaced. Most of the actors except the star Jay Chou play their roles with utmost professionalism. Too bad The script itself has quite a bit of uncomfortable lines that read more like sentences in an essay than actual conversation dialog. Being part of title itself one would expect the drift races to at least look good. THEY DO NOT! The racing itself is fine and pretty well choreographed but the camerawork and editing is painful to watch. It lacks the kinetic sense of energy that made other racing films like Fast and Furious tokyo Drift such fun to watch. Most racing scenes involve documentarystyle wide tracking shots of the cars zooming by or a static first person perspective shot that looks like it was sped up in post production to make the cars look like they are moving faster than they really are. Cheesy cartoony Freeze frame and choppily edited slow motion all give this film the look of a cheap B movie. They even tried to use CGI for one very obvious crash scene but the crappy computer generated car looked very fake against the photorealistic background.The only reason for Tau Man Ji D's possible success in Asia was the cast and Jay Chou. Banking on Jay Chou's fame as a singer this movie attracted the bulk of young Chinese music fans who just want to see their idol's big screen debut caring little for the movie itself. A very clever though underhanded marketing strategy that effectively makes Tau Man Ji D only good as a star vehicle for the Taiwanese pop star. Well this star vehicle does not fire on all cylinders. It chugs its way from start to finish on flat tires flat scripting and flat directing. Aside from Jay Chou fans followers of the manga and lovers of good racing movies would do well to look elsewhere.".

We ended up watching it every single night and twice on the day we bought it. We were up at 2AM watching it at having the time of our lives. This movie is based off the famous Anime show  Initial D. I honestly didn't catch most of the plot as I had the English Subtitles on and was too busy laughing at how amazing it was. It's not as good as the Anime but deserves a 1010 just for how amazing it is to watch with others especially in Blackpool at 2AM.".

	schema:headline " Middling road race antics from China";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a very odd background to this car racing movie clearly aimed at the teenage crowd in Asia. It's based on a Japanese anime of the same name of the 1990s and filmed in Japan with Japanese characters. And yet it's a Chinese film in Cantonese language with mainly Chinese actors playing the Japanese roles. Despite or maybe because of all this INITIAL D DRIFT RACER turns out to be a very middling type of film although it is a damn sight better than the most execrable the genre has to offer SPEED RACER.Still INITIAL D does deserve credit for making repeated scenes of cars racing on the same stretch of road throughout interesting but the car chases are merely perfunctory and hardly the best thing about this. For a film based around racing the film has much better characterisation than you'd expect even if the central casting left me cold I've never been able to warm to Jay Chou and that doesn't change here. The characters are far more realistic and their motivations more believable than in an average FAST AND FURIOUS film for example.There are welcome supporting roles for Edison Chen and Shawn Yue who at least have the movie star charisma that Chou lacks and Anthony Wong is a welcome presence as ever in a comedic supporting role playing Chou's dad. Chapman To bags the 'idiotic friend' role but his character does grow on you throughout although the female characters in the cast are particularly ill served by the script. INITIAL D DRIFT RACER is hardly a good film but it passes the time well enough for fans of Asian cinema even if it is a film I'd never want to watch again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the highly popular Japanese mangaanime series this Hong Kong made movie clearly took some ideas from the earlier smash hit American movie 'The Fast and the Furious'. Despite the whole concept of illegal street racing generally being a word wide thing its always been a popular icon in American and Japanese pop cultureculture. The concept of drifting drift racing is originally an entirely Japanese form of illegal racing which involves racing down and through tight mountain passes or simple tight narrow winding roads. This movie is centred on drift racing as was the source material and will feel very similar to 'The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift' so if you enjoyed that you'll like this.The plot is obvious and the usual thing for this type of movie. A young tofu delivering teen is the undisputed king of the mountain when it comes to drifting he learnt everything he knows from his racing guru of a father...who for comedic purposes is a drunk. His fame for drifting gets noticed by various other racer gangsteams and he is challenged at various points throughout until he must face some stiff competition at the end. During all this racing drama there is of course the drama of reality with a girlfriend his best mate who also wants to race the car breaking down his father etc...the usual boyracer issues.Lets be brutally honest here...this movie is basically a Fast and Furious movie set in Japan its virtually an extension to Tokyo Drift. Everything plays out as you'd expect the characters are all clichd and cheesy I love the Japanese black leather wearing gang racers with bandanas and dreads the races are of course predictable and you know what's gonna happen at every turn pun intended. What makes it a bit unique is the simple fact its set in Japan a very picturesque prefecture it feels more realistic being in Japanese subs and the race sequences are gritty looking.In that sense the movie is better than its US counterparts just like Tokyo Drift is the best of the 'FnF' franchise. The racing is very impressive and very realistic with genuine drifting stunts on genuine tight twisty roads in Japan. Again I must stress its nothing you haven't seen before of course not anymore but it looks really solid. There is little fanfare here either the races are merely two average looking modded ricers a few drably dressed onlookers the hero is also pretty drab himself and there are little to no special effects bar the odd zooming through the car interior and a hint of internal engine tomfoolery. Expect lots of slow motion replays tight camera angles on the cars flybys closeups on pedals and speedometers grimacing facial closeups etc...all regular racing clichs.There are no seminaked females in ultra tight skimpy attire no boom boxes blaring out rap tunage no heavily blinged up chavy patrons no heavily pimped up stupid looking cars no muscles covered in tattoos blah blah blah. This is very down to earth and grounded Japanese teens are incredibly sensible and well dressed compared to teens elsewhere. Its actually amusing to see them try and be rebellious because they just end up looking like preppy school kids dressed badly.As I already said the cars are not luminous monstrosities scraping the tarmac polluting the air with hip hop and with the kind of body kits you'd see being used for a glider. Nope...what I loved about this movie was the use of straight up ricers with little gloss but plenty of real muscle. Naturally we see the glorious GTR a lovely Mazda RX7 a stunning Evo IV and the plucky little Toyota Sprinter Trueno that is taken faithfully from the manga series. In the manga series the Toyota is apparently unmodified but in this movie it does seem to be somewhat with suspension and the odd bits n bobs. There are quite a few inevitable changes from the source material to this movie and one appears to be the absence of how Takumi's father does a Mr Miyagi and slowly teaches him how to become a top drifterracer without him even realising whilst he delivers his tofu. In this movie you do get a hint of that but it seems as though Takumi knows he's being taught which takes away the sparkle.Watching this now it feels very very very hokey I won't deny its cringeworthy in places its so damn corny. Plus the rush in street racing flicks has flooded the market so the originality is long gone. Like I said the locations work nicely and will really get Jap super saloon fanboys excited and the cast is solid despite a weak performance from lead star Jay Chou as Takumi...he's hardly much to look at either. Chapman To is easily the best thing cast wise with his chubby bumbling over the top comedic display combined with that odd haircut he does boost the movie which would of been too dull in places without him. The movie ends on a bit of a flat note I think but other than that its a decent street racer flick which should satisfy anyone who likes this sort of thing. Still not too sure why the franchise is called 'Initial D'.610".

	schema:headline " Classic Chinese operetta based on The Butterfly Lovers";
	schema:reviewBody "THE LOVE ETERNE aka LIANG SHANPO AND CHU YINGTAI is a 1963 Hong Kong operetta based on the oftfilmed classic story Liang ShanPo And Chu YingTai aka The Butterfly Lovers. It offers sumptuous color filming on lavish Shaw Bros. studio sets and tells its love story in a combination of dialogue and song focusing on a pair of students at a university in Hangchow one Chu YingTai a female disguised as a man in order to gain entry into the school and the other an older fellow student Liang ShanPo.YingTai falls in love with ShanPo and when she has to leave school after three years tries to drop hints in song that she's really a female as the clueless boy accompanies her part of the way on her memorable trip home. Eventually he gets the picture but by then her family has already promised her to someone else setting the stage for a tearjerking finale. This is the film that Ang Lee director of CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON chose to watch with reporter Rick Lyman when he was the subject of an installment of the Watching Movies series in The New York Times March 9 2001.The stars of the 127minute film are Le Di touted in the DVD cast notes as Hong Kong cinema's one and only 'Classical Beauty' in the role of Chu YingTai and Ivy Ling Po aka Ling Bo one of Shaw Brothers' top female stars of the time in the male role of ShanPo. They're both quite captivating whether in the straight dramatic and comic interactions of the spoken dialogue or the operettastyle singing to each other in the more intimate scenes. The camera is usually focused on the two lead performers so the success of the film depends greatly on their expertise in conveying believably the strong emotions of the intense love story particularly in the latter stage of the film where YingTai's family has effectively blocked the young pair's budding romance. Ling Po's turn as a heartbroken young man in the throes of an emotional breakdown is quite wrenching and most convincing.Ivy Ling Po often played young men in Chinese Operabased Shaw Bros. films of the era most notably THE GRAND SUBSTITUTION 1965 a tale of court politics and family loyalty in Old China. The actress can also be seen as a female swordswoman in TWIN SWORDS 1965 starring Jimmy Wang Yu. Both films are also reviewed on this site.The songs in LOVE ETERNE are quite pleasing and the orchestrations making use of traditional instruments quite evocative of Chinese Opera. The score does not use the famed Butterfly Lovers violin concerto which figures prominently in a later film version of the same story THE LOVERS 1994 directed by Tsui Hark and starring Nicky Wu a male actor as Liang Shan Po and Charlie Young an actress as Chu YingTai. The characters don't sing in Hark's film leaving the scriptwriters more time to pack the film with plot and incident and make it much more intense. They tell the same story but they're two different kinds of films with the older one drawing more explicitly on Chinese theatrical traditions while the newer film is a little punchier and designed to spruce up the tale for modern youth appeal.The Taiwanese DVD available for review was made from a print with very good color values but transferred with too much croppingon all four sides. The cropping at the bottom of the frame is designed to cover up the original burnedin Chinese subtitles and provide a space to put the new removable subtitles. That said it should be pointed out that much of the camerawork consists of closeups of the two leads rather than the widescreen action compositions featured in so many Shaw Bros. films that suffer from cropping when transferred to tape. Also unlike those tape transfers the subtitles in LOVE ETERNE are all clear and wholly visible. As a result this DVD offers one of the better transfers of an early HK film available in the U.S. although a new subtitled widescreen transfer would be most desirable.The English title given on the DVD case is THE SHANPO AND CHU YINGTAI.ADDENDUM April 6 2010 Since doing this review the film has come out under the title LOVE ETERNE in a restored remastered Region 3 DVD from Celestial Pictures as part of its massive Shaw Bros. restoration campaign. Watching the new DVD was like seeing it for the first time. It's a beautiful film and Ivy Ling Po's performance is breathtaking. Also since the original review a Taiwanese animated version of the tale has come out on DVD under the title THE BUTTERFLY LOVERS 2003. It has its good points but is too Disneyinfluenced and kiddieoriented for my tastes.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very simple tale but great direction by Li and great acting by the 2 leads simply the 3's best movie. All the songs are the best of this genre too.Legendary Classic Beauty Betty Loh Tiher fame then was only next to evergreen Li Lihua and 4 times Asian movie queen Lin Dai proved to be a great actress again considering her role is more difficultshe need to play both sexes and the singing is not her own voice and she has to act the songs too. The opening part where she imposed as a male to fool his dad the rest of the scenes which she imposed as a male against his male classmate and secretly in love with him till she appears as a female to face him are all great acting seldom seen anywhere else.Her acting is natural and seeing it 40 over years later now you don't feel outdated like some of the acting by others in the early days. Observe her body language too while as a female and male is so natural you just don't feel she is acting. Those who enjoyed her should also watch her 2 other great movies available in DVD nowEnchanting Shadowremade by Tsui Hark Chinese Ghose Story and Dream of the Red Chamber. Tsui Hark also remade this into Butterfly Lovers. Ivy Ling Po who acted as the male did a good jobher own singing voice too although she overacted in some scenes. She became an instant hit and continued to acted many male roles in such genre but none of her films to follow come close to this. WARNING Foreigners who are not used to such films may find it hard to accept as more than 95 of the dialogs are done in songs. This movie created a craze in all Chinese areas and broke all boxoffice records. Reported that someone in Taiwan saw it 40 over times during the original release !! A great pity so few people in IMDb saw it. Note This movie is voted among the Top Ten of HK films wonder why not mentioned in this site.".

All the songs are the best of this genre too.Legendary Classic Beauty Betty Loh Tiher fame then was only next to evergreen Li Lihua and 4 times Asian movie queen Lin Dai proved to be a great actress again considering her role is more difficultshe need to play both sexes and the singing is not her own voice and she has to act the songs too. The opening part where she imposed as a male to fool his dad the rest of the scenes which she imposed as a male against his male classmate and secretly in love with him till she appears as a female to face him are all great acting seldom seen anywhere else.Her acting is natural and seeing it 40 over years later now you don't feel outdated like some of the acting by others in the early days. Observe her body language too while as a female and male is so natural you just don't feel she is acting. Those who enjoyed her should also watch her 2 other great movies available in DVD nowEnchanting Shadowremade by Tsui Hark Chinese Ghose Story and Dream of the Red Chamber. Tsui Hark also remade this into Butterfly Lovers. Ivy Ling Po who acted as the male did a good jobher own singing voice too although she overacted in some scenes. She became an instant hit and continued to acted many male roles in such genre but none of her films to follow come close to this. WARNING Foreigners who are not used to such films may find it hard to accept as more than 95 of the dialogs are done in songs. This movie created a craze in all Chinese areas and broke all boxoffice records. Reported that someone in Taiwan saw it 40 over times during the original release !! A great pity so few people in IMDb saw it. Note This movie is voted among the Top Ten of HK films wonder why not mentioned in this site.";

She meets ShanBo who is a boy who unbelievably to me doesn't know she is female that part of it is minimally disconcerting at best. Based on a Chinese folk tale which should give you a hint to what could be this is an absorbing drama with a lavish group of sets as well as two very appealing leads. There are class differences in this film with Ying Tai being rich while Shan Bo isn't. There were a number of these adaptations of folk tales at the time The Kingdom And The Beauty starring the beautiful and also tragic Linda Lin Dai immediately springs to mind and this one is very good. If you like musicals with pageantry here it is. Watch it on a big screen television its better. I watched it from a VCD and the beauty of the film still grabs you. Rest in peace Betty Loh Ti.".

Scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage. With Versus and Aragami Kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget. So what happened in Alive ? To be more blunt the answer would be  nothing. Nothing happened in Alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.Adapted from a comic book by Tsutomu Takahashi Alive is an examination of the life of one Tenshu Yashiro played by Hideo Sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution. He is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments. He chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it's host's humanity grants supernatural powers. Naturaly at some point that parasite moves into Yashiro the bad thing is that doesn't happen very soon. Similar to Aragami Alive sets it's first half in establishing the basic exposition. Characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered. The whole thing even takes place in just one set. The first major problem of that comparison is that while Aragami was just a 70 minute movie Alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long. That length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case. Dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves aren't much interesting. There were some small attempts at making Alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic  evil government people against superpowered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end. Like I previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasn't even interesting to begin with and doesn't do much to improve on other aspects of the film.Now after that first part is over one might think that Kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning. Sadly that is not the case. The two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from Hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers. They're just not interesting or fun Kitamura's creativity from Versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camerawork and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame really.Evidently Aragami was better on all accounts and Kitamura had learned something from Alive. So it wasn't at least a total loss watching this movie. If only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie.".

I have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. Frankly I went to the video store to get Versus but I am just fine with Alive.If you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then Alive is not your pick. There is plenty of action however it comes as payoff for a whole hour of character driven buildup. Personally I think it is well done and worth it.Of course some of the plot is silly as with many SCIFi action films and I think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.They kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground buildingtaking a cue from the cube but the film doesn't suffer for it. Another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many Flashbacks and dream sequences. Rent this!".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair. Then our hero who is called Tenshu is taken to the chair he's zapped and then....he's still Alive. AHA ! He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool  Either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead OR you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you. Our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story commences. He wakes up in a different sort of cell very hightech and very big where he finds another cellmate who also managed to survive the electric boogieride. A voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room. Sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept  What else can they do ? What these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them. Basically the unknown scientists in the background ps them off until they decide that they should kill each other. Sounds weird ? Indeed but there's a greater purpose to all of this. THIS is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain unrevealed. But fear not it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudoaction movie fore it has an entirely different approach to the question  How long time can you stand being with a man who's an S.O.B. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrixlike action fightscenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon. The movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances. However the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly unique. If you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash.".

Hideo Sakaki was of course good but other than that the cast didn't push me either way. They were just there. I say it is misleading about the whole Cube reference because it was nothing like that movie except if you take into account that they're in a cell. But it wasn't claustrophobic at all. THIS IS WHERE IT MIGHT GET SPOILERY!!!! As far as the SakakiSakaguchi reunion went I was a little disappointed. I knew Tak would come in at the last part and I knew they would have an ending fightscene but I was looking forward to that. Heh I was even looking forward to the cheesy makeupbody suit that he would have on which I enjoyed btw. But what disappointed me was that there was no bantering. Tak uttered not a word and that took some of the luster away from the fightreunion. Also I felt robbed that Hideo wasn't the one to give him the death blow. What's worse is that he died from a gun shot wound! No! Ah what a waste. I didn't find it terribly perplexing like some of Kitamura's other works but there's one thing that kept rolling around in my head was Zeros an alien? I don't think he was. I think that the alien part of the story was the virus itself but Zeros was a human previously who caught the disease and the results were what we saw he was changed extensively and was absent of any kind of personality and that's what Tenshu would have become eventually. END OF SPOILERSIt was an alright flick I wouldn't pay the list price for it but it was good. Perhaps even good enough to own watch with a buddy or two and perhaps even play Mystery Science Theatre.".

Yes Kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half but that's about where the similarities end. Versus takes place essentially all outside showcasing Kitamura's ability to craft an interesting Bmovie in natural locations. For Alive almost everything takes place inside. In small cramped spaces. Here the art design is thrust into your face and WHAT art design it is! We are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces. Also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film. Versus was all about action and cool here a LOT more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind. Because of this Alive is a far more interesting film than Versus. You may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.I'm now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You should too! But be sure to realize this is a different animal from Versus  it's often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it.

	schema:headline " Kicks off great but falls off the edge";
	schema:reviewBody "Alive is a dark dystopian sciencefiction drama that convinces with some philosophic thoughts and some social criticism. There are a couple of intriguing mysteries surrounding the movie that keep a certain level of tension. This Japanese flick though lives especially from its dark and twisted dystopian atmosphere and a good graphic work. The acting performances of the two male prisoners and the strange witch are great enough to carry the movie on and have a classic and theatrical approach reminding me of Sartre's No Exit.Towards the end the movie sadly shifts into a rather ordinary fantasy flick with some boring action scenes. I also feel that one could have developed some characters a little bit more and gone more into some details. While there are many interesting aspects the movie doesn't go as it could have. As soon as the mysteries are solved or left untouched the story shifts into emptiness and the whole structures gets somewhat overlong pointless and even emotionless. Even the acting gets less addicting and one loses interest concerning the different characters. The dramatic turn of events in the ending can't save much anymore and leaves the viewers more or less untouched because the flick lost too much credit in its last third.In the end the movie is a mixed package with two third of the running time that is rather addicting diversified and filled with tension mystery and atmosphere while the last third is less intense and lacks of originality. This is a fairly interesting movie to rent or watch once but only of an average quality compared to many other contemporary Japanese movies and I wouldn't suggest you a blind purchase of this flick. After all my rating is seven out of ten but I'm maybe still a little bit generous so don't expect an outstanding movie in here but just some good entertainment with a few enjoyable qualities.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to begin so I'll begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie. Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Kitamura's own Versus. I have not seen Versus so I can't comment on that but I think Cube was an excellent movie which I recommend to everyone. However in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom.I'll just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy Swiss cheese of a plot it's also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you don't know the plot beforehand so it doesn't matter. If I have misunderstood the plot don't hit me  it's probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyelids open.So the American military in Nevada once lost a UFO i the Nambi desert. This apparently makes sense because they're both deserts so surely they're practically the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. What ever. The alien thing is now passed on to anyone who's bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host. The Japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researcher's daughter to some other dude. But instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty AND already on the military's side they decide that it's probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead. Oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the nonlethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted. I don't know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it's not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill.Then the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end.The only one moment in the movie where I didn't want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and he's hanging around up there and another dude walks by. The dude hanging on the wall says I'm in pain shoot me. And the living dude looks at him and it's not like he's a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesn't want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him.Rhetorical pause.In the stomach. Gee THANKS A FREAKIN' HEAP.".

The first half is mostly nothing happening with the film's first 40minutes completely superfluous as it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What amounts to tension is one nice guy who was condemned but is still pretty nice and a notsonice guy who was also condemned and deservedly so trying to outdo each other when it comes to weak acting. The nice guy just mopes a lot and the mean guy just shouts and acts crazy. Amateur hour anyone?It doesn't help that Kitamura shows his familiarity with American films by basically reusing up all the action sequences that he liked from those films in this one. THE MATRIX special effects was used as well as James Cameron's ALIENS sequence where characters run around screaming into each other's helmetvid contraption as they're attacked. For elite soldiers these guys lost it pretty darn quick! We also get psychic powers very VERY similar to Proyas' DARK CITY.Not that ALIVE is completely bad.

Together with the splendorous scenery comes ferocious snowstorms and treacherous quicksand. It's these forces of nature that eventually brought peril to a troop of voluntary mountain patroller in the pursuit of poachers of the nearextinct Tibetan antelopes during the mid 90s.The story of the voluntary mountain patrol is told through a Beijing report who accompanied them through a 10day quest to track down a band of poachers who kidnapped and murdered one of their men. Led by indefatigable leader Ritai these volunteers from all walks of life shared a common passion there fervent love of the lordly Tibetan antelopes and hence their furious hatred of the ruthless poachers. The intensity of this passion is brought home to the audience when they witness a scene of a mountain plain littered by hundreds of carcasses of skinned antelopes in the middle of being picked clean by carrion crows and later reinforced by a similar scene with the skin of these antelopes spread out to dry some with crimson bullet holes.Filmed as a semidocumentary Kekexili does not portray the patrollers as onedimensional heroes as some Hollywood flicks might have done. We see them during their redhot pursuit roughhandling a minor offender caught with antelope hair instead of cotton padding his coat and a couple of worm catchers who happened to have witnessed the poacher passing by. But these are minor as we gradually come to understand that desperate for financial resources as they were only semiofficial and not paid by the provincial government the mountain patrol resorted to selling some of the pelts they confiscated from the poachers. But the lasting impression left with us of the mountain patrol would be their humanity their simple zest for life their comradeship their selfsacrificing spirit and their absolute dedication to doing what they believe in.Kekexili is a deeply moving account of a true story crying out to be told and has won awards in Tokyo and Taiwan. It deserves to be seen by the rest of the world.   After the first screening of Kekexili in the Hong Kong International Film Festival 22 March to 6 April 2005 young handsome director Lu Chuan answered questions from the audience in Putonghua and respectably fluent English.He explained that he was moved to making this film after reading the report of the Beijing photojournalist Ga Yu. The film took two years in preparation before filming and was shot at the exact locations of the actual events. He said that in filming the story of the mountain patrol he was not trying to provide an answer to what fuelled their devotion but just to reflect what actually happened. On the minor questions he explained that the five hundred odd carcasses in the film were not from killing antelopes yes that was the question! but were actually from mountain goats that was the natives' normal food. And yes he himself did try eating raw meat as the reporter did in the movie when offered a leg just cut from a rabbit freshly shot..Breaking of the story by the Beijing reporter brought sensational worldwide reaction. In response the government took strong measures and formed an official force to stamp out poaching of the antelopes. The voluntary mountain patrol having thus achieved its goal was disbanded. The population of the Tibetan antelope has since increased.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the director of The Missing Gun comes this powerful story of a journalist who travels with a small mountain patrol group as they track a band of poachers across the unforgiving lands of Kekexili the last great wilderness.To say this film is great is a grave understatement as its uncompromising nature and cinema verite approach to story telling elevate it above all other films of the year. What this film does so well is connect you with the protagonists in a simple yet very effect manner. Once the initial setup and character introductions are complete the rest of the film is spent following them through the harsh wilderness. In doing so Lu Chuan places the viewer in the same dire situation as the mountain patrol. We're with them as they brave harsh winds freezing water sunbaked plains and treacherous snowcovered mountains. We feel their anguish as they come under attack from seemingly invisible assailants. We sense their fear and pessimism as they struggle to survive in this breathtakingly beautiful yet ultimately deadly landscape. All this to protect Tibetan antelope. The fact that they're willing to risk everything for this unseen animal says more about their character than any amount of dialogue. They do this without a paycheck and with the knowledge that they'll probably have little to no success. By giving the antagonist so little screen time Lu Chuan is able to broaden this story and give it global context declaring that attitudes and actions such as this should be condemned outright. It also serves to elevate the protagonists above ordinary heroes as it can be interpreted that they're not just doing this for the Tibetan antelope but endangered animals everywhere.Kekexili is an enormously powerful film that should not be missed. This is far and away the best Chinese film of the year better than Shi Mian Mai Fu House of Flying Daggers in every respect and one of the best films of the year period. 1010".

Written and directed by Chuan Lu from China and sponsored in part by National Geographic the film was distributed as 'travelforeign placesenvironmental issues' product and while it satisfies those designations it resonates as a story that is not only based on fact but one that opens our eyes to another way of life in a very remote area. The effect is stunning.A journalist from Beijing  Ga Yu Zhang Lei  travels to Tibet to investigate the poaching of Tibetan antelope and the group of unpaid citizens committed to eradicating the poachers and saving their beloved antelope. The leader of the mountain patrol is Ri Tai Duobuji and he has gathered devoted men who spend their lives selflessly searching for the elusive poachers. Ga Yu goes along for the search camera in hand capturing the magnificence of the mountains of Tibet the men's camaraderie and commitment to their mission and the fields of antelope carcasses left behind by the poachers whose only concern is to skin the antelope for their pelts of luxurious wool for the world market. The patrol encounters endless problems with their equipment food supplies loss of men to the poachers' guns and finally capture a group of men a family who serve as skinners for the pelts. Ri Tai attempts to remain fair and nonviolent but his attempts are constantly thwarted. Ga Yu changes from a journalist role to a committed hunter and his relationship with Ri Tai and the other patrolmen is exceedingly touching. The ending of the film is as quiet as the Tibetan landscape and equally as impactful.The cast is not known to this viewer but it is difficult to imagine that Duobuji and Zhang Lei are amateur actors so profoundly moving are their performances. The haunting music by Lao Zai and the breathtaking cinematography by Yu Cao support Chuan Lu's film. This art piece is excellent on many levels and is one that deserves a large audience. Highly recommended.".

Considering the international approval of the movie this seems quite ridiculous to me.Apart from that I don't have to add much to the other users' comments but it can't be said often enough how much energy this film gains first from the nottellingbutshowing technique of the portrayal of its characters and second from the way nature is depicted as it breaks the will even of these strong characters. They become even more realistic because of the strong inner conflict which is aroused by the necessity of selling some of the confiscated antelope skins. All in all the movie represents existential universal questions at least as successful as the best westerns that I have seen.Adding to this Kekexili is certainly also a mustsee for anybody interested in the Tibetan Question as it shows life in the Tibetan highlands from a very uncommon angle It's a Chinese view of ShangriLa torn between admiration of its spirituality and humanity and on the other side shocked amazement by its harshness and inhumanity. Generally it's a universal approach independent of ideology and that's never to be taken for granted whenever Tibet is involved needless to say that this concerns the American or European image of Tibet as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is the best Chinese movie of the year I have seen. I was shocked by the story and the presentation of the movie. It took me quite a while to get out of it.The movie talked about how a volunteer mountain patrol team fought against the poachers and protect the extincting Tibet antelopes. Due to the increasing demand for the leather and cashmere of Tibet antelopes poachers drove the once 1 million antelopes to the edge of extinction less than 10 thousand. A retired military officer volunteered to setup a mountain patrol to protect the antelopes and hunt the poachers.What is touching is not the survival or dying of the antelopes but that of human beings above the 4000 meters over 12000 feet high land. Wind snow and deserts took away food from people and they could not make a living. Lots of people turned to hunt antelopes for their own being. Meanwhile the team members of the mountain patrol were fighting for their own life while hunting the poachers. The volunteers had no government funding no food and no weapons. They were at great disadvantage when facing well equipped out numbered and brutal poachers. Without any alternatives they had to sell the skins of the antelopes they captured in order to support their duties of protecting the extincting creatures. The movie presents the brutal facts right in front of you and make me hard to breath.The story was set in the period of 1993 to 1996 however I highly suspect that it was an ongoing cat and mouse game and the situation of today may not be much better than what was described in the movie.Highly recommended.".

For all the thrilling nobility of the volunteers and grueling challenges they face from man and nature the film naggingly feels like a propaganda effort supported by the Chinese government to show how it supports Tibetan initiatives including a somewhat smug statement at the end that they have now taken over the protection job from the volunteers. I felt complicit in the occupation even as I got caught up in the film.Their struggle to save the antelope vividly recalls scenes of how the buffalo was decimated in Dances With Wolves though we get no inkling of the role of the antelopes in Tibetan culture so saving them just seems either altruism about a rare animal nationalism obsession stubbornness or macho independence.While we meet several of the volunteers in their isolated monitoring stations and frustrating chases who have a range of personalities and relationships it is a bit hard to differentiate them other than by the vehicles they are driving or jewelry they're wearing. The exceptions are the patrol's charismatic leader Ri Tai Duobuji captures the screen and our entre to this world a Beijingbased investigative journalist with Tibetan roots Ga Ju played by Zhang Lei who effectively communicates his transformation by his experiences.Whle the sense of swaggering male camaraderie is well captured in a militarylike bonding of living traveling and partying hard they say the area's name translates to land of beautiful women and that's supported by the few we see during brief respites.In addition to the breathtaking scenes of the Tibetan plateau better seen on the wide screen than on TV in a range of extremely challenging weather and geographic elements one scene in quick sand is particularly harrowing the views of Tibetan towns and quotidian life in the mountains are an intriguing sidelight.The subtitles were only hard to read as white on white a few times though a couple of times they lingered on the screen too long past a dialog blocking views.

Technically speaking special effects weren't overdone background score was kept to a minimum no unnecessary subplot and it sticks to the point.To sum up the plot 'Kekexili' is about a group of patrols who are in search of poachers. We are briefly introduced into the lives of the penniless patrols how passionate they are about protecting the endangered antelopes their selfless deeds and sacrifice yes even their lives and their strength and courage.Chuan Lu's direction is outstanding and he remarkably tells us this sensitive story. The actors breathe into their characters making you forget that they are actors. Cinematography is fantastic and we also get the feel that the climate snow wind etc the haunting mountains and the city are characters themselves.Being an animal lover myself I was very moved by 'Kekexili' as a felt for all the characters and their passion and courage really touched me.

No matter what the scene be it a closeup of an action taking place in a river or a medium shot of vehicles traversing a barren empty land Kekexili is undoubtedly the main character in this gorgeous but bleak film a hostile land that in one of the movie's most striking moments swallows a lone patrolman whole when he makes the mistake of stepping over quicksand.As an action movie only the first scene is really where the brutality ensues as antelope are systematically killed right in front of the camera which makes it a tad intense for anyone not used to these images and the patrolman trying to protect them gets a bullet in his head. It gets quickly established from the getgo that these poachers are soulless individuals whose greed has led them to destroy the wildlife which makes the plight of Ri Tai a man whose life has been committed to the cause of the antelope and Ga Yu a reporter who gets involved in the case more relevant even when everyone else gets blurred in the background and it seems that there will be no solution to this matter.KEKEXILI is a tricky movie to classify even when it's clearly grounded in thriller and action roots due to the overpowering nature of the place where it's set and its refusal to romanticize its two lead characters. If anything it can be seen as a silent film one that tells its story in mute yet powerful images and in doing so gets its message across.".

The Tibetan Antelope have been hunted mercilessly for their pelts which bring good prices for poachers.

They haul the dead antelope bodies to a pit and burn them. The clacking of their bones as they are hauled over the earth is quite unsettling like a deathly wind chime.For the most part the Tibetan actors are amateurs but it works unbelievably well. The landscape will take your breath away just as quickly as it did for the patrolmen when they began to get bloody noses from the high altitudes. The film crew had a grueling time with this film one member was killed in a car accident.

To begin with the Region1 DVD cover shown here on IMDb is splattered with more red blood than you will actually see in the film OTOH the Region3 DVD cover completely gives away the ending. Talk about cultural differences in marketing strategy action plot vs. something worthy of repeated viewing?More importantly American Westerns were generally made in 20th century about 18th19th century so even the most gritty and hardhitting ones are full of American romantizations about a longgone time and place. OTOH Kekexili is a 2004 film about something that only happened 10 years ago so it is full of the kind of realism that even National Geographic may find hard to achieve highaltitude cinematography with the sand and the cold cracking the filmstock getting the locals to talk etc..IOW fans of the American Westerns are not going to enjoy this film the chase action sequences are few short and slow you move too fast at high altitudes you die and the patrolmen don't exhibit any modern or western sense of individualism heroism that audiences can cheer for. Even fans of the Discovery Channel may not know how to react there is very little narration to tell audiences what to think very little music to tell audiences what to feel and very little slowmotionpanning cinematography for audiences to ogle at.What this film is is a different kind of docudrama more Abbas Kiarostami than Akira Kurosawa the kind where the director pulls all his punches with such minimalist scripting plotting acting photography and editing that audiences are denied any possibility of a cheap thrill the ahhah or wow from being given a backstory message climax conclusion etc.. This is where this film rises above the likes of Himalaya which tries to tuck in a conventional but awkward narrativestructure in the words of the director it's very cruel to the audiences.I mean talk about letting the subjectmatter speak for itself it starts out with the premise of some high actionadventure but continually breaks the pace to let the realities of highaltitude patrolling intrude.... And since we are mostly embedded with the reporter who speaks only a little Tibetan very little is explained to us the reporter the patrolmen aren't great talkers.... To improve the immersion factor or get a sense of the wonder and confusion the reporter felt try watching the film without the subtitles for the Tibetan dialogue. Like a backpackingtrekking trip you might have to think about what you saw or felt after you come back.This film had a limited marketing and release because it didn't quite fit any of the commercial film genres but I'll be watching out for director Lu Chuan's next film about the Nanjing massacre or incident as some Japanese call it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a film with serious technical and narrative flaws that can easily be forgiven because the movie gives us a wondrous gaze into a stupendous exotic world stretching far beyond what we have known or seen before.This is a docudrama based on facts about people who live on a Tibetan plain four miles high which shelters Tibetan antelope a species that had been threatened with extinction in recent years because of aggressive poaching to harvest highly prized pelts. Poaching became a serious problem here in about 1985. After years of witnessing declining herds the native people in the region in 1993 took matters into their own hands forming their own mountain patrol to interdict poaching.The patrol served this goal admirably for a few short years until 1996 when the increasing hardships of sustaining these efforts coincided with a government decision to declare the plain a wildlife preserve. The patrol was disbanded and since then the numbers of antelope have gradually increased up to 30000 or more at the time this film was made.The story is a dramatic reenactment of events presumably typical of the mountain patrol period 199396. Captain Ritai is about to lead a monthly tour of the region a caravan of three SUVs transporting about 10 heavily armed men and this time also a journalist Gayu from Bejing who is accepted by the men because his father is Tibetan.Besides the vast flat windswept snowy plain itself and the massive mountains that border it in the distance we witness evidence of wholesale slaughtering of antelope one scene shows the vulturecleaned carcasses of over 400 armed clashes with poachers several shooting deaths and injuries severe cases of pulmonary edema from exertion during chases and a death when quicksand entraps one of Ritai's men.The story which begins strongly enough with the shooting of a patrol member by poachers gradually loses the traction of credibility as Ritai seems to abandon any semblance of good judgment pursuing the leaders of the poacher gang even as his supplies of food and fuel dwindle to the danger point and attrition of his team from illness and injury mounts. So the story goes the journalist Gayu was the only survivor of this particular patrol and his subsequent stories published in the nation's capital were influential in bringing about government action to establish the preserve.Anyone with a thirst for knowing more about extraordinary and inaccessible cultures should rush to see this film flawed though it is. You will see the reverence for life of these people who take the time even to pile up hundreds of antelope carcasses to burn in a funeral pyre. You see the tender manner in which these courageous men embrace knowing that the rigors of their mission may mean death before another meeting. You enter a remote brothel of the sort established in Tibet only recently as a byproduct of Chinese occupation. You discover that the men must pay dearly in cash to obtain emergency medical aid for patrol members who are ill. And there's more.Kekexili by the way means beautiful mountains and girls we and the journalist Gayu are told. My grade B 610.".

Human there are struggling to survive people gotta eat. If they can live a life with warmth and fullness they will leave the animal alone.After all who would want to risk their lives of getting shot for smuggling animal fur?";

The local reviewers Chicago gave it very high marks.The scenery and the backgroundstory destruction of the antelopes makes this movie worth seeing.Yet as I watched this movie I found myself thinking if this movie was about Mountain Goats in the Sierra Nevada i.e. something less exotic than Tibet Chicago reviewers would be more critical. The characters are flat  the plot is somewhat thin. The mountain patrol are searchers but the movie doesn't have that edge of the John Ford western. The movie seemed formulaic for the first hour but happily breaks out of that rut.A similar high altitude movie which I enjoyed more was Himalaya. I recommend both Mountain Patrol and Himalaya especially for those interested in armchairmovie theater traveling to the rooftop of the world.".

But may I ask what caused the poaching and extinction of animals in Tibet? These were caused by China's illegal and amoral occupation of Tibet and greedy exploitation of Tibetan people. The attitude of the Chinese Communist government which doesn't give a damn about Tibetan people or its culture is well reflected in the attitude of Chinese criminals who go to Tibet. These criminals do not care about Tibetan people its culture or the land. They poach Tibetan animals themselves and encourage povertystricken Tibetans to poach so they can make money. The quickest solution to the poaching problem in Tibet is for China to return Tibet to its people and get out of Tibet!! Why didn't this movie give us this obvious and most logical solution to poaching in Tibet? Treating extinction of some antelopes in Tibet as if it is the greatest problem in Tibet is absolutely laughable. The greatest problem in Tibet is illegal invasion and occupation of Tibet by China and Chinese people. Is the Beijing journalist played by Liang Qi totally stupid or totally blind? Can't he see this obvious problem? Does the producer of this film think that just because they made some film condemning the poaching and extinction of some species of antelopes in Tibet the Tibetans will love Chinese who stole their land and massacred their people? Showing some token kindness is not going to erase the crimes committed by Chinese against Tibetan people.This movie is a disgusting selfcongratulatory nonsense made by some government influenced Chinese film producers. Although it is much more subtle this is a propaganda movie just like the antiJewish Nazi film The Eternal Jew. I am nauseated to read the high praise written by some Americans and Japanese about this propaganda film. Did these Americans and Japanese lower themselves to the level of Chinese government mouthpiece? By the way why was this movie awarded Don Quixote Award in Berlin? Are those Berlin judges insane? I have repeatedly criticized this movie because of its disgusting propaganda. I am glad that my repeated criticism has angered some selfappointed Chinese patriots. In China any criticism of the state and its policy is punished severely and the critics are silenced swiftly. If my comment against this film is a criticism of Chinese government I cannot help it. One cannot criticize dangerous propaganda films like this without criticizing the underlying policies of the government which made the film. It is like commenting about a disgusting film like Eternal Jew without attacking Nazism.These Chinese patriots cannot silence me here in the United States a country of free speech. If these Chinese patriots were not thickskinned enough to take criticism I would tell them Welcome to the world of free speech.".

This one is about a theft of a very valuable  antique gold statue. So in comes Feluda accompanied by  his faithful Topshe and the very hilarious Jatayu Santosh Dutta at his  comic best and he is asked to investigate the theft by the owner and  if possible retrieve the invaluable statue. The entire movie is set in  the holy city of Varanasi and we get to witness a lot of the religious  ceremonies associated with Hinduism and how the crime has intertwined  itself with it. A lot of suspense and some very funny  segmentsespecially the one with Jatayu and the knife thrower make  this movie totally worth the watch.

	schema:reviewBody "I read some Feluda stories in my childhood. Since then I haven't ventured towards the book of the ace sleuth written by Ray that have endeared him to millions across the globe. I have seen several films of the detective though two directed by Satyajit Ray himself and quite a few directed by his son Sandip Ray. Among the multiplicity of themes that Ray explored in his films and in his writings one often finds a thematic recurrence interspersed among his works. The core theme in JOYBABA FELUNATH  about a thriving business involving smuggling of heritage art objects from India to the West was also seen in his book KAILASHE KELENKARI which has been made into a film by Sandip Ray. The penchant of Ray to showcase rare skills such as jugglery Phatikchand is again seen in this film in the spinechilling act of a skilled marksman aiming at humans  it was filmed on 'Jatayu.' JOYBABA .. is an engaging suspenseful film from the master filmmaker. The film has the Hindu holy city of Benaras as the backdrop. Apart from a fine performance by Soumitro Chatterjee in the role of Feluda the film was elevated several notches by the terrific performance of Utpal Dutta as Maganlal Meghraj  rarely has Utpal Dutta looked so menacing as a villain his act in Bollywood films playing the evil man was mostly comical. The pivotal child character in the film endearing called Captain Spark brought out the child that used to reside in Ray who was enchanted by magic mysterious occurrences  other aspects of the supernatural besides his love of adventure. Rating 4 out of 5".

Apart from a fine performance by Soumitro Chatterjee in the role of Feluda the film was elevated several notches by the terrific performance of Utpal Dutta as Maganlal Meghraj  rarely has Utpal Dutta looked so menacing as a villain his act in Bollywood films playing the evil man was mostly comical. The pivotal child character in the film endearing called Captain Spark brought out the child that used to reside in Ray who was enchanted by magic mysterious occurrences  other aspects of the supernatural besides his love of adventure.

The alternate humorous and serious scenes kept up the goodness of the story.A point worth noting is the intelligent way of revealing the mystery at the end of the story which did not appear throughout the film. There was no main mystery and the watchers knew from the very first scene that Maganlal Meghraj Utpal Dutt was the villain. Yet there were shots which were kept unexplained. However the watchers made no attempt to put they grey matter into work as they most naturally assumed those scenes to be insignificant  a bit of smoke that Meghraj noticed behind the curtains the hiding of a diamond in Jatayu's story the Lucknow Station on the radio and a lot more.The brilliant climax was unexpected and still stands out of the other ordinary films.".

The protagonist Somnath is an educated unemployed youth struggling with his life in Calcutta. Somnath fails to get the distinctions in his BA because his answer scripts from university exam goes to a professor who had problems in reading his small hand writings with his broken borrowed specs. The result of which is a mere pass marks in graduation much to the irk of his retired father. Somnath's quest with job in corporate Calcutta develops a chain of frustration regrets new relationships and dark humors to the amusement of the audience. He finds no answers to stupid questions asked by interview board as what is the weight of the moon. The only support he gets is from his affectionate sister in law who gifts him a new watch as he enters the challenging phase of job search.To add to his worry his long term girl friend dumps him in order to seek stability for her by an arranged marriage. There is a strong melodrama on the break up scene which catches the audience. Probably women always break up with a sense of encouragement with the dumped men and Ray brilliantly uses Aprana Sen for this role of Somnath's ex girl friend. Destiny chances upon Somnath when he meets an old football game friend who offers him support to start his own business and to leave the false illusion of cracking a job interview. The rest of the story involves Somnath learning the business rules as an order supplier or middleman.The script is adapted from the story of Sankar and portraits the missing ethics in corporate world very strongly. The use of PRO public relations officer and tricks for luring procurement managers forms the main learning curve for Somnath as his middle class values are put to test for these tricks. Finally Somnath gives up and decides to follow the road ahead at the cost of his internal soul sufferings.Ray brilliantly uses the plot in a simple and lucid way and this film is not a complex film as The competitor. The climax is the last 20 minutes when Somnath struggles with his PRO to get a women escort for the client manager and ends up hiring his best friend's sister who has unfortunately turned into an underground call girl forced by sheer poverty. Somnath commercial success and his moral failure marks the end of the film as he fails to make an eye contact with his sister in law in the last scene. Somnath's win's in the end but fails to earn the respect and admiration from himself or from his sister in law. Somnath is definitely gray in shade or rather gets converted from a white shade to grey as he fights back the whole system for his own metabolism and future of a better tomorrow. For sure this contrast makes the end of the Calcutta trilogy.".

	schema:headline " The story gets much better later in the film but the pacing is like lead.";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I get to the movie there are a few things I should mention about the DVD for The Middleman Jana Aranya. Like many other Satyajit Ray films I have seen from the 60s and 70s it's in black  white. Apparently color films were very very late coming to the Indian film industryjust like the Japanese and Chinese were still making silent films up until WWII. The print is also pretty fuzzy and has an annoying 'Shradha' the distributing company pasted across it. It's a pretty ugly looking film that's for sure.The film is about a young man named Somnath has taken a college exam. By a weird chance occurrence he's cheated out of the grade he's learned. This element of chance is something that will come into play a bit later in the film. In the meantime he's graduated but finds the job marked glutted. Considering he didn't graduate with top honors he's unable to stand out from the crowd and he spends a year looking for work. By chance later he slips on a banana peeland this ushers in an unusual opportunity. Now the nonIndian viewer might not understand the significance but Somnath is from a Brahman family from the top of the caste system and the job he takes is NOT one a Brahman would normally doit would be beneath him and dishonor his family. But he needs work and goes into business becoming a 'middleman'a schemer who buys and sells practically anything to make a buck. The work isn't really bad at first but later when he needs to give kickbacks and twist the truth Somnath's father is heartbroken. But Somnath can live with thisafter all it's business. But when he learns what he needs to do with one big client it tests his mettlewhat is he willing to do and not willing to do to make it in business?There were some very positive things about the film. I agree with another reviewer who felt the father was an excellent and wellacted character. I also loved the big moral dilemmathis made the film end exceptionally well. However I also should point out that this is a Ray film that is NOT for those unfamiliar with the man's work. That's because it's far from his best workmostly because the pacing is like lead through the first half of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Before I get to the movie there are a few things I should mention about the DVD for The Middleman Jana Aranya. Like many other Satyajit Ray films I have seen from the 60s and 70s it's in black  white. Apparently color films were very very late coming to the Indian film industryjust like the Japanese and Chinese were still making silent films up until WWII. The print is also pretty fuzzy and has an annoying 'Shradha' the distributing company pasted across it. It's a pretty ugly looking film that's for sure.The film is about a young man named Somnath has taken a college exam. By a weird chance occurrence he's cheated out of the grade he's learned. This element of chance is something that will come into play a bit later in the film. In the meantime he's graduated but finds the job marked glutted. Considering he didn't graduate with top honors he's unable to stand out from the crowd and he spends a year looking for work. By chance later he slips on a banana peeland this ushers in an unusual opportunity. Now the nonIndian viewer might not understand the significance but Somnath is from a Brahman family from the top of the caste system and the job he takes is NOT one a Brahman would normally doit would be beneath him and dishonor his family. But he needs work and goes into business becoming a 'middleman'a schemer who buys and sells practically anything to make a buck. The work isn't really bad at first but later when he needs to give kickbacks and twist the truth Somnath's father is heartbroken. But Somnath can live with thisafter all it's business. But when he learns what he needs to do with one big client it tests his mettlewhat is he willing to do and not willing to do to make it in business?There were some very positive things about the film. I agree with another reviewer who felt the father was an excellent and wellacted character. I also loved the big moral dilemmathis made the film end exceptionally well. However I also should point out that this is a Ray film that is NOT for those unfamiliar with the man's work. That's because it's far from his best workmostly because the pacing is like lead through the first half of the film. Slow and I must add it's hard to really like the main character as he just seems to existand there's little with which to connect. Worth seeing and close to a 7 but it's not quite there.";

	schema:reviewBody "It starts out well enough with a recent college graduate Pradip Mukherjee desperate for work. The montage of his looking for work is great especially a scene where he is interviewed for a job and asked the most irrelevant questions imaginable including How much does the moon weigh? He looks at the interviewer in disbelief. What does that have to do with the job? I'll ask the questions here son! After several months of unemployment he runs into an old friend who sets him up as a middleman where he can make a huge profit with very little effort. It's immoral and Mukherjee can feel his soul slipping away. But he can't quit because he doesn't want to disappoint his elderly father Satya Bandyopadhyay who gives the film's best performance. The main problem with the movie is that it's just too talky and no one's talking about anything interesting. It wouldn't work if the characters were talking out loud about the moral dilemma that would make the film too obvious. But they just talk endlessly about how they are going to go about their business and so forth. The movie just drags on forever and then it throws in this utterly contrived ending. Well I was almost happy for the contrivance because although false at least it didn't involve endless prattle. It's quite overlong. I miss the economy of his better films. A dud by a master. 610.".

It's absolutely dramatic to see Somnath's search through a crowded city where millions of people like him are also with the same problems. I couldn't stop thinking of how difficult and unfair things are in under developing countries mine included even though the economic situation is getting better but things can change sooner or later and how people like the main character must have a enormous sense of faith persistence and struggle while trying to get a job and while doing it too because it's not easy to change yourself and your values just because the money's good and it works to pay the bills.That part of the movie was brilliant the second act with Somnath in his first job is also great although a bit confusing since it presents lots of characters and it's hard to keep track of who they are and what they represent Somnath's bosses friends clients etc. There's a wonderful subplot involving Somnath's father a man who at first pushed his son into studies and work but later he realizes he'll be alone and no one will look out for him which is something that makes him turn back to religion again. Since most cultures are different than the Hindu culture where parents and sons in most families live together for longer times than ours it's interesting the way the viewer can make a comparison between both worlds and think for a moment about the father's feelings about this whole situation.The third and conclusive act is very unsatisfying very confusing and in a film that goes for two hours long enough for a simple theme it gets very tiresome with some annoying talky characters whose lines aren't interesting. Suddenly Somnath gets involved with sending prostitutes to one of his clients fulfilling the wishes of a greedy man who wants to make business with this client but the whole trade is strange confuse played without urging a interest from us. That almost ruined the film. Luckily it has its good moments interesting cultural aspects and a relevant story even today a tale about money and survival versus morality and principles. 710".

	schema:reviewBody " The middleman is the last film on the Calcutta trilogy if we do not consider Mahanagar along the same genres. The protagonist Somnath is an educated unemployed youth struggling with his life in Calcutta. Somnath fails to get the distinctions in his BA because his answer scripts from university exam goes to a professor who had problems in reading his small hand writings with his broken borrowed specs. The result of which is a mere pass marks in literature much to the irk of his retired father. Somnath's quest with job in corporate Calcutta develops a chain of frustration regrets new relationships and dark humors to the amusement of the audience. He finds no answers to stupid questions asked by interview board as what is the weight of the moon. The only support he gets is from his affectionate sister in law who gifts him a new watch as he enters the challenging phase of job search.To add to his worry his long term girl friend dumps him in order to seek stability for her by an arranged marriage. There is a strong melodrama on the break up scene which catches the audience. Probably women always break up with a sense of encouragement with the dumped men and Ray brilliantly uses Aprana Sen for this role of Somnath's ex girl friend. Destiny chances upon Somnath when he meets an old football game friend who offers him support to start his own business and to leave the false illusion of cracking a job interview. The rest of the story involves Somnath learning the business rules as an order supplier or middleman.The script is adapted from the story of Sankar and portraits the missing ethics in corporate world very strongly. The use of PRO public relations officer and tricks for luring procurement managers forms the main learning curve for Somnath as his middle class values are put to test for these tricks. Finally Somnath gives up and decides to follow the road ahead at the cost of his internal soul sufferings.Ray brilliantly uses the plot in a simple and lucid way and this film is not a complex film as The competitor. The climax is the last 20 minutes when Somnath struggles with his PRO to get a women escort for the client manager and ends up hiring his best friend's sister who has unfortunately turned into an underground call girl forced by sheer poverty. Somnath commercial success and his moral failure marks the end of the film as he fails to make an eye contact with his sister in law in the last scene. Somnath's win's in the end but fails to earn the respect and admiration from himself or from his sister in law. Somnath is definitely gray in shades or rather gets converted from a white shade to gray as he fights back the whole system for his own metabolism and future of a better tomorrow. For sure this contrast makes the end of the Calcutta trilogy.".

	schema:headline " Good wombs have borne bad sons";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Ray's second last film made when he was just short of seventy. The tree is Ananda Mazumdar a retired industrialist famed for his honesty and philanthropy to the extent of having his town named after him. The branches are the four sons and two spouses. Mazumdar suffers a heart attack and as he hovers in the danger zone the progeny converges around him. Ray is a good spinner of yarns and he knows how to play the heartstrings. Here he gives us a taut drama about old age and family relations with the background of Bengali society of the eighties there is a family picnic and one of the cars is a Maruti 800.Unlike some of his more acclaimed films which are about youth and childhood this one is about aging with which comes cynicism and tolerance. He is able to turn an eye more understanding than indignant towards the corruption and rot in society. This somewhat lame anger is voiced through the youngest of the four sons who chooses to opt out from the bribe driven business world. Ray was often accused of not being sufficiently concerned about the ills of society. He is after all no activist or reformer he is a mere genius an artist and a truthful mirror of the society to which he belongs.Ray's women are more the expression of his ideals of humanity. The men are more often pathetic shadows as in this one. Lily Chakravati as one of the wives gives a bold and charismatic portrayal of a woman disappointed in her marriage with a mind and strength of self acceptance beyond her era and milieu.This is a more complex film which expands the canvas to depict an era and a society. It achieves a high level of dramatic tension even though it lacks the compassion and innocence of some earlier movies. It definitely limps at many places as Ray is affecting a piety not his own. It is not his nature to judge people as if to say that might have been me. On the whole a gripping film for all it's negligible weaknesses easy and enjoyable to watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is Ray's second last film made when he was just short of seventy. The tree is Ananda Mazumdar a retired industrialist famed for his honesty and philanthropy to the extent of having his town named after him. The branches are the four sons and two spouses. Mazumdar suffers a heart attack and as he hovers in the danger zone the progeny converges around him. Ray is a good spinner of yarns and he knows how to play the heartstrings. Here he gives us a taut drama about old age and family relations with the background of Bengali society of the eighties there is a family picnic and one of the cars is a Maruti 800.Unlike some of his more acclaimed films which are about youth and childhood this one is about aging with which comes cynicism and tolerance. He is able to turn an eye more understanding than indignant towards the corruption and rot in society. This somewhat lame anger is voiced through the youngest of the four sons who chooses to opt out from the bribe driven business world. Ray was often accused of not being sufficiently concerned about the ills of society. He is after all no activist or reformer he is a mere genius an artist and a truthful mirror of the society to which he belongs.Ray's women are more the expression of his ideals of humanity. The men are more often pathetic shadows as in this one. Lily Chakravati as one of the wives gives a bold and charismatic portrayal of a woman disappointed in her marriage with a mind and strength of self acceptance beyond her era and milieu.This is a more complex film which expands the canvas to depict an era and a society. It achieves a high level of dramatic tension even though it lacks the compassion and innocence of some earlier movies. It definitely limps at many places as Ray is affecting a piety not his own. It is not his nature to judge people as if to say that might have been me. On the whole a gripping film for all it's negligible weaknesses easy and enjoyable to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Home and The World is an excellent film by the great Bengali director Satyajit Ray. Based on a novel by Tagore the drama focuses on the personal and political dilemmas faced by a wealthy Bengali woman in 1907 as her husband and his best friend vie for her affection and her political loyalties.Very few films successfully focus on the ethical complexities of social movement organizing The Official Story Matewan and Mapantsula are rare exceptions The Way We Were has some brilliant flashes along these lines but then veers away from these themes all too quickly. We the viewers are initially drawn to the viewpoint of the charismatic political organizer just as the protagonist is drawn to him and out of the restraints of traditional purdah. Far from painting the husband as a vile monster to revolt against however the husband encourages the increasing independence of the protagonist and becomes the loving conscience of the film even as it exposes the limitations of his apparent passivity.As the attraction between the protagonist and the organizer mounts so does the tempo and the tension of the political struggles in the village. As the protagonist learns more and more about the world beyond the secluded part of her palatial home we the viewers begin to understand more and more the complexity of the crosscutting tensions between England and India modernism and tradition Hindu and Muslim rich and poor men and women leadership and rabblerousing means and ends and love and infatuation.All this could have been ponderous or didactic but it's decidedly not and one of the wonders of the film is that the political issues are woven so deftly into the story of a believable unfolding love triangle. Most movies have a difficult time portraying any motivation for two characters to fall' in love  this movie manages to portray changes in the relationships between all three main characters with such precision and intensity that I fully believed and cared deeply about each one.The acting is extraordinary and the cinematography as is usual in Ray's films is breathtaking subtly accentuating the movie's themes of liberation and loss and the interplay between the two.Ray said his goal as a director was the same as Renoir's to show that everyone has their reasons. As perhaps the most warmly compassionate of directors in all of world cinema he succeeds brilliantly with this film.".

'Based on the Nobel prize winner Ranbindronath Tagore's novel it focuses on the relationship of a woman with her husband and his best friend. Almost 10 years into her marriage she is happy with her husband but craves for something more. Unlike many women of the time her husband gives her complete freedom allowing her to live her life the way she wills. He himself is impressed by the British lifestyle and his his wife learn English. He's also very connected to his own Bengali route. Then enters his revolutionary and stubborn friend who is obsessed of having the country get rid of everything English. The husband and his friend have contradictory viewpoints. Yet he welcomes his friend and never objects to his motivations as long as he's within his limits. The wife is impressed and intrigued by his friend's political ambitions and is gradually drawn towards him or he draws her towards him until they embark in an affair and then the truth becomes more apparent...to everyone but it's too late.Ray really takes his time to tell us the story to let us get to know the characters and clearly display the relationships between them and explain the political situation. He does one hell of a job doing it. He shows the development of the wife's 'relationship' with the friend as her marriage becomes weaker while her husband is hauntingly passive yet trying to understand both his wife and his friend as he is the one who truly loves her and he tries to carry out his social obligations towards his people. We see that the wife learns more about the political dilemmas in the outside world but only from the friend's point of view. Then as one reviewer has pointed we are drawn into a web of dilemma's between England and India modernism and tradition Hindu and Muslim rich and poor men and women leadership and rabblerousing greed and sacrifice means and ends and love and infatuation.Master filmmaker that he is Ray puts it all together in one of the most remarkable way that it does not deviate from the main plot. Ther performances are superb. Victor Bannerjee gives a very intense but subtle performance. In the end one realizes that it is his character one feels most for. Contrastingly though Soumitra Chatterjee is more vocal he makes full use of his nonverbal language hinting the character's deceitful intentions. Swatilekha Chatterjee plays a very difficult part with tremendous ease. She completely owns the role. Supporting cast are all very good. Ray also makes adequate use of the background score and the cinematography is wonderful. Watch for the camera angles and movement.Truly a mindblowing film and I always thought that there aren't enough words that can do justice to describe the excellence of Ray's films. I've only made an attempt and I'm still far behind. Just watch it to see what I mean. Only those who appreciate real cinema will understand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me divide the discussion on the film into a few parts BACKGROUND AND ANECDOTES Ray had wanted to make a film out of this Tagore story for a long time right from the 1960s but somehow the project kept getting delayed. Initially Ray had casted Soumitra Chatterjee as Nikhil and wanted a young dbutante to play the role of Sandip but later in an example of inspired casting he cast Soumitra as Sandip instead as he felt there was no one who could give the long verbose speeches in chaste Bengali better than Soumitra and Soumitra delivers as usual with a flawless performance but we'll come to that later. Victor Banerjee who had earlier worked with Ray in Shatranj and Pikoo made the grade as Nikhil THE PUBLIC OPINION ON THE FILM Even though Ghare Baire remains a strong Ray film it does not enjoy the universal critical appreciation of the Apu Trilogy Charulata Aranyer Din Ratri Kanchenjunga Kapurush Pikoo Jalsaghar Devi Teen Kanya Asani Sanket etc. NOR does it enjoy the mass popularity of Goopi Gayen Bagha Bayen Sonar Kella Joi Baba Felunath Abhijaan etc. It remains somewhat underrated and under discussed amongst all Ray's films even more so than Ray's last 3 films Ghanashatru Shakha Proshakha and Agantuk which even though weaker films by Ray's unusually lofty standards were at least much more accessible to the public being more recent THE FILM Mild spoilers ahead Ghare Baire is set in pre Independence India and tells the story of a traditional but educated Bengali woman married to a wealthy liberal westernized Zamindar of a Bengali village. Her daily sojourns are confined to the inner part of the house as a strange but true custom for married women in those days. Is it then just a coincidence that her state of living is also an allegory to India in those times wanting to win freedom from its past. Hoewver truth be told her husband loves her and she's under no apparent stress due to her lifestyle and seems to have accepted it and thriving in it. Nikhil her husband is a calm composed pro feminist and liberal man who supports her wife's decision to learn English Classical music from a British Lady an interesting cameo by Jeniffer Kendall whom we know as Violet Stoneham from 36 Chowringhee Lane. In their peaceful lives enters a revolutionary named Sandip. Dark brooding idealist Sandip was an old college friend of Nikhil and is now the leader of the 'Swadeshi' movement or the 'Be Indian Buy Indian' movement and wants to extend his movement in Nikhil's village but Nikhil being a pragmatic man cannot allow this to happen because that would take away the livelihoods of many poor hawkers paricularly Muslim who get foreign made things CHEAPER than Indian substitutes and hence stand to lose their margins if forced to buy Indian raw materials for selling in the 'haat' a village market Another layer to this 'external' story is its 'internal' aspect that comprises Nikhil Sandip and Bimala. Nikhil is the man of the world Sandip represents an illusive Utopia as he is a die hard idealist and Bimala plays the woman who's torn between the two extremes The Home Nikhil and the World Sandip Ghare and Baire. Smitten by Sandip's fiery speeches and his vision of an independent India as contrasted with her own husband Nikhil's ostensibly indifferent attitude to the freedom struggle Bimala finds herself increasingly drawn to Sandip. Does Nikhil know or does he simply trust his wife too much and is a bit of an idealist himself? And does Sandip actually love Bimala or is he only using her as a tool to weaken Nikhil and subsequently persuade Nikhil to let the Swadeshi movement enter his village and also to take her financial help to continue his movement? And what about Bimala? Then when chaos erupts in the village due to the battle between the revolutionaries and the establishment Sandip has to leave and Bimala's dreams are shattered as reality strikes. Then the small things become more apparent to her like how Sandip always traveled by first class how he always smoked imported cigarettes even though he was a proponent of Swadeshi himself. Then she remembers what Nikhil's first words to her about Sandip almost as a warning That man is better to look at from a distance. Isn't that true about mirages and ideals too? Aren't they too accompanied later by a sense of disillusionment? AFTERMATH Ultimately 'Ghare Baire' is an extremely complex but rich story of idealism Vs. pragmatism that extends the concept to not only a Home i.e. a Bengali household through the love triangle but also to the World i.e. India during those times of strife and struggle through the depiction of the revolution and the Swadeshi movement. In both cases in the end we did get freedom but at what cost? Doesn't Nikhil's unfortunate death represent the millions of lives that were lost in our Freedom struggle and doesn't Sandip's escape represent the euphoria that quickly deserted us just as we became independent Ray's mastery is evident behind every frame Victor's monologue during dinner one night Soumitra's several soul stirring speeches during the film and the wonderful cinematography the last scene of Bimala morphing from a married woman to a widow is just awesome beyond words Ghare Baire would represent the end of a phase in Ray's career as he suffered a heart attack while filming this and subsequently his output became less prolific He only completed 3 more films and a telefilm in his last eight years. Also this was the beginning of a change of style from the ersthwile outdoor locations Apu Kanchenjunga Aranyer Din Ratri etc. to the primarily 'set driven' later films. 810 for me".

Dark brooding idealist Sandip was an old college friend of Nikhil and is now the leader of the 'Swadeshi' movement or the 'Be Indian Buy Indian' movement and wants to extend his movement in Nikhil's village but Nikhil being a pragmatic man cannot allow this to happen because that would take away the livelihoods of many poor hawkers paricularly Muslim who get foreign made things CHEAPER than Indian substitutes and hence stand to lose their margins if forced to buy Indian raw materials for selling in the 'haat' a village market Another layer to this 'external' story is its 'internal' aspect that comprises Nikhil Sandip and Bimala. Nikhil is the man of the world Sandip represents an illusive Utopia as he is a die hard idealist and Bimala plays the woman who's torn between the two extremes The Home Nikhil and the World Sandip Ghare and Baire. Smitten by Sandip's fiery speeches and his vision of an independent India as contrasted with her own husband Nikhil's ostensibly indifferent attitude to the freedom struggle Bimala finds herself increasingly drawn to Sandip. Does Nikhil know or does he simply trust his wife too much and is a bit of an idealist himself? And does Sandip actually love Bimala or is he only using her as a tool to weaken Nikhil and subsequently persuade Nikhil to let the Swadeshi movement enter his village and also to take her financial help to continue his movement? And what about Bimala? Then when chaos erupts in the village due to the battle between the revolutionaries and the establishment Sandip has to leave and Bimala's dreams are shattered as reality strikes. Then the small things become more apparent to her like how Sandip always traveled by first class how he always smoked imported cigarettes even though he was a proponent of Swadeshi himself. Then she remembers what Nikhil's first words to her about Sandip almost as a warning That man is better to look at from a distance. Isn't that true about mirages and ideals too? Aren't they too accompanied later by a sense of disillusionment? AFTERMATH Ultimately 'Ghare Baire' is an extremely complex but rich story of idealism Vs. pragmatism that extends the concept to not only a Home i.e. a Bengali household through the love triangle but also to the World i.e. India during those times of strife and struggle through the depiction of the revolution and the Swadeshi movement. In both cases in the end we did get freedom but at what cost? Doesn't Nikhil's unfortunate death represent the millions of lives that were lost in our Freedom struggle and doesn't Sandip's escape represent the euphoria that quickly deserted us just as we became independent Ray's mastery is evident behind every frame Victor's monologue during dinner one night Soumitra's several soul stirring speeches during the film and the wonderful cinematography the last scene of Bimala morphing from a married woman to a widow is just awesome beyond words Ghare Baire would represent the end of a phase in Ray's career as he suffered a heart attack while filming this and subsequently his output became less prolific He only completed 3 more films and a telefilm in his last eight years. Also this was the beginning of a change of style from the ersthwile outdoor locations Apu Kanchenjunga Aranyer Din Ratri etc. to the primarily 'set driven' later films. 810 for me";

While Nikhilesh is hurt by the change in Bimala's behaviour .. he says not a word. Slowly Bimala comes to know that the love respect admiration that she had read in books was actually Nikhilesh's feelings towards her. How he treated her as his equal which in those days was unheard of broadened her outlook towards life as a whole.

Nikhil decides to liberate her from the traditional role of housewife and introduces her to ex college mate and firebrand freedom fighter Sandip Soumitra Chatterjee who is currently campaigning for Swadeshi or the boycott of foreign manufactured goods. Ray clearly aims to portray the shallowness which underlies much revolutionary fervor. This is particularly evident in the ritualistic greeting of the Swadeshiists which is artificial and comic. Bimala is completely infatuated with Sandip till events disclose the duplicity and self serving motives which underlie his chest thumping patriotism.The film is not up to Ray's best. This is perhaps due to it's complexity and scope of ambition. Ray is not one to distort for the sake of simplification. He seeks here to portray some still continuing realities of India's multi religious and multi cultural society through the microcosm of a family living through a turbulent period of nascent nationalism.

As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion.

The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles. The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching.

Give me a break there is not a British character in the whole film why should any of them speak English well? The acting is not bad! It just isn't perfect! OK granted the script does sound like they google translated it the dialogue is awkward and sometimes doesn't really fit the character. But who cares? It is not an English film! I like the fact that they don't speak English very well. It gives it more authenticity as a whole. Why can't people stop their petty criticism and just enjoy a movie for what it is? I think that what people don't like is the R rating with no nudity or gratuitous sex. I can guarantee that if they showed some naked breasts there would be far less bad reviews altogether.

OK granted the script does sound like they google translated it the dialogue is awkward and sometimes doesn't really fit the character. But who cares? It is not an English film! I like the fact that they don't speak English very well. It gives it more authenticity as a whole. Why can't people stop their petty criticism and just enjoy a movie for what it is? I think that what people don't like is the R rating with no nudity or gratuitous sex. I can guarantee that if they showed some naked breasts there would be far less bad reviews altogether. Personally I didn't miss it!";

	schema:headline " A Dazzling Sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 33 years after releasePlot The kingdom of Hirak is under the rule of a tyrant who suppresses all mutiny by applying 'magajdholai' on the rebels. One such insurgent Udayan pundit becomes absconding by escaping the sentries. During this time he encounters Goopy and Bagha who promise to help him with their magical powers. But will they be able to combat the mighty king of Hirak who has all the wealth in the world courtesy his diamond mines has the assistance of a genius scientist and even possesses a pet tiger which guards the treasury?Review 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' 1969 directed by Satyajit Ray was one of his biggest commercial blockbusters. The characters of Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer had achieved cultstatus along with the kindhearted 'Bhooter Raja'. It was eleven years after delivering this masterclass Ray decided to bring back once again the delightful singerdrummer pair of Goopy and Bagha in 'Hirak Rajar Deshe' 1980.Sequels besides ensuring a ready viewer base also invite the burden of huge expectations. Many directors have faltered under this pressure. Ray himself had been quite a pro in creating film franchises. The 'Goopy Bagha' series was his fourth after the famous 'Apu'trilogy 'Feluda' series and the 'Kolkata'trilogy besides 'Aranyer Din Ratri' and the 'Byomkesh' series which were taken forward by other directors. Yet it's safe to say in all those instances Ray couldn't match the glory of the original with his sequels. But with 'HRD' it seemed the wait for the perfect sequel was finally over.In order to match the heightened expectations Ray undertook some necessary measures a bigger starcast conversion from black  white to colour specially created glossy sets in a Madras filmcity and the return of the tiger in real instead of the superimposed special effect in 'GGBB'. But the unique feature which can be easily considered the USP of this sequel is its rhyming dialogues. Most of the characters converse through rhymes across longwielding sequences comprising of simple words which convey the sinister policies and conspiracies of dictatorial politics. One of the few exceptions is the schoolmaster Udayan whose free speech represents his free thoughts unlike the rest whose ideas are restricted by the imposed policies of the dictatorship. It's notable even Goopy and Bagha spoke in rhymes when they remained confined in their palace. But once they went out in the open and came in contact with Udayan they also started speaking in a freetongue! A couple of words are even in English 'income' 'bookey' but that's understandable as the British are likely to have arrived in India by then. Even without considering the meanings the dialogues convey one must doff their hats to Ray who once again reveals a mostly unknown skill of poetry by scripting a screenplay which could remind of other poetic texts like Kashiram Das' 'Mahabharata'. And not just the dialogues who can forget the famous 'mantras' specifically created for the 'magajdholai'? Clearly poetry's loss has been cinema's gain!The new cast boasts of the addition of superstar Soumitra Chatterjee along with the veteran Utpal Dutta. Playing the righteous schoolmaster is a cakewalk for Soumitra but the character of Hirak Raja certainly presented one of the greatest challenges for Dutta. He brings all his thespian skills into play to 'recite' the lengthydialogues many of them shot in a single scene. It's highly creditable as the margin for deviation was nil. He successfully portrays himself as an epitome of dictatorship. Tapen Chatterjee and Robi Ghosh reprise their respective avatars and their chemistry has only smoothened and blossomed with time. A particular mention must be made of Ghosh's courage during his encounter with the tiger as unlike in the film the tiger was not hypnotized in reality! Like in 'GGBB' Santosh Dutta again plays a double role and his performance as the scientist is again a winner. In fact we get a peek into his real nature only near the end and it was quite surprising to see the diminutive fellow burst into such convulsions of fervor. It would have been nice to see this character explored a bit more.Unlike 'GGBB' which was based on a book by his grandfather Ray himself takes on the cudgels of flushing out a meaningful script this time. The treatment and the characterizations are not 'comical' like the prequel but the rhyming dialogues and occasionally funny behaviors make it an equally entertaining experience.

	onyx:emotionText "Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 33 years after releasePlot The kingdom of Hirak is under the rule of a tyrant who suppresses all mutiny by applying 'magajdholai' on the rebels. One such insurgent Udayan pundit becomes absconding by escaping the sentries. During this time he encounters Goopy and Bagha who promise to help him with their magical powers. But will they be able to combat the mighty king of Hirak who has all the wealth in the world courtesy his diamond mines has the assistance of a genius scientist and even possesses a pet tiger which guards the treasury?Review 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' 1969 directed by Satyajit Ray was one of his biggest commercial blockbusters. The characters of Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer had achieved cultstatus along with the kindhearted 'Bhooter Raja'. It was eleven years after delivering this masterclass Ray decided to bring back once again the delightful singerdrummer pair of Goopy and Bagha in 'Hirak Rajar Deshe' 1980.Sequels besides ensuring a ready viewer base also invite the burden of huge expectations. Many directors have faltered under this pressure. Ray himself had been quite a pro in creating film franchises. The 'Goopy Bagha' series was his fourth after the famous 'Apu'trilogy 'Feluda' series and the 'Kolkata'trilogy besides 'Aranyer Din Ratri' and the 'Byomkesh' series which were taken forward by other directors. Yet it's safe to say in all those instances Ray couldn't match the glory of the original with his sequels. But with 'HRD' it seemed the wait for the perfect sequel was finally over.In order to match the heightened expectations Ray undertook some necessary measures a bigger starcast conversion from black  white to colour specially created glossy sets in a Madras filmcity and the return of the tiger in real instead of the superimposed special effect in 'GGBB'. But the unique feature which can be easily considered the USP of this sequel is its rhyming dialogues. Most of the characters converse through rhymes across longwielding sequences comprising of simple words which convey the sinister policies and conspiracies of dictatorial politics. One of the few exceptions is the schoolmaster Udayan whose free speech represents his free thoughts unlike the rest whose ideas are restricted by the imposed policies of the dictatorship. It's notable even Goopy and Bagha spoke in rhymes when they remained confined in their palace. But once they went out in the open and came in contact with Udayan they also started speaking in a freetongue! A couple of words are even in English 'income' 'bookey' but that's understandable as the British are likely to have arrived in India by then. Even without considering the meanings the dialogues convey one must doff their hats to Ray who once again reveals a mostly unknown skill of poetry by scripting a screenplay which could remind of other poetic texts like Kashiram Das' 'Mahabharata'. And not just the dialogues who can forget the famous 'mantras' specifically created for the 'magajdholai'? Clearly poetry's loss has been cinema's gain!The new cast boasts of the addition of superstar Soumitra Chatterjee along with the veteran Utpal Dutta. Playing the righteous schoolmaster is a cakewalk for Soumitra but the character of Hirak Raja certainly presented one of the greatest challenges for Dutta. He brings all his thespian skills into play to 'recite' the lengthydialogues many of them shot in a single scene. It's highly creditable as the margin for deviation was nil. He successfully portrays himself as an epitome of dictatorship. Tapen Chatterjee and Robi Ghosh reprise their respective avatars and their chemistry has only smoothened and blossomed with time. A particular mention must be made of Ghosh's courage during his encounter with the tiger as unlike in the film the tiger was not hypnotized in reality! Like in 'GGBB' Santosh Dutta again plays a double role and his performance as the scientist is again a winner. In fact we get a peek into his real nature only near the end and it was quite surprising to see the diminutive fellow burst into such convulsions of fervor. It would have been nice to see this character explored a bit more.Unlike 'GGBB' which was based on a book by his grandfather Ray himself takes on the cudgels of flushing out a meaningful script this time. The treatment and the characterizations are not 'comical' like the prequel but the rhyming dialogues and occasionally funny behaviors make it an equally entertaining experience. Yet this film makes an obvious statement against the oppression of despotic misrule where else the antiwar message was conveyed with much more subtlety in 'GGBB' without ever making the situation grave. The whole concept of 'magajdholai' brilliantly metaphors the mentality of modernday politicians to confine the public into a false sense of prosperity by injecting fictitious bubbles of hope.'HRD' once again reveals the musical genius of Ray which was first displayed in 'GGBB' and was that film's USP.

The ending that was chosen was the better choice.I was immediately drawn into this movie with it's intriguing story. How each character approached the mystery of the captured ghost and their own agenda's made for more intrigue to see how each came together to finalize the story. On another plus for this movie was the lack of gore ... there was some but not of the type to ruin such a good movie. Of course one scene was a bit bloody but it was a necessary scene for emphasis. The two lead roles had seriously realistic depth regarding love hate compassion suffering and death. Due to the creativeness and imagination that went into developing the characters I lost myself into the film forgetting they were acting.All aspects were done very well ... good timing special affects lighting was a little too dark at the first of the movie music score cast ... everything was superbly done. Also it was nice that the movie had a good ending and wasn't one of those that leave you hanging with gee there'll be a sequel. The one thing that did not come out well for me on my regular television was the strands of silk. If I had not watched the Special Affects on the DVD to know there was supposed to be silk threads emanating out of a bowl of noodles I would not have known and didn't know when I watched the film that silk threads were present. Then again I watched this movie this afternoon when the television gets more daylight obliterating fine details such as this so I recommend watching this in a darkened room to fully appreciate it and maybe the first part of the film won't seem so dark. I recommend this movie and if more than a 10 rating could be given I would do so. It's one of the best horrorthrillers go light on the horror I've seen in a very long time with a story that's not been done before.".

OK so I know she starred in the Taiwanese popdrama television series Meteor Garden and am just curious to see her in yet another horror movie. And since I'm in postbirthday celebrations I also learnt she's a day older than me.OK so I'm digressing. Silk is a horror movie and quite a decent one at that. Although it uses the all too familiar ghostly boy character this boy unlike recent predecessor seen in Dorm is very much creepier and deadlier. He's the star ghoul and exhibits a strange behavioural pattern of staying in a particular room and speaking to himself or so it is thought.A team of modern day paranormal investigators cum scientists led by Japanese Hashimoto Yosuke Eguchi recruits a police hotshot with special powers of lip reading sharp shooting and that peculiar sixth sense Ye QiDong Chang Chen to unravel the mystery of the boy. However Hashimoto has an ulterior motive into his research which has spawned an anti gravity device called the Menger Sponge that can be used to entrap spirits and in liquid spray form allows the user to see the paranormal.The movie relies on some hokey physics theories to bring across some ideas and its premise. It tries to explain the phenomenon of spirits and ghosts and how they come about using some scientific explanation that they are forms of energy. Watch this movie to see if you agree to the conditions presented to turn someone into a spirit that roams the earth rather than to dissipate into nothingness upon death. But don't get me wrong it does make for some interesting story development hey it's fictionscience fiction anyway.At its core this movie dwells on themes of existence family and again the human emotions of love and hate. I thought Chang Chen did well in the role of the officer who despite his super abilities still find it difficult to grapple with new inexplicable experiences and at the same time the critical illness of his beloved mother and trying to maintain a relationship of sorts. The rest of the cast did OK but in my opinion noted more for their eye candy presence.There are truly genuine scary moments in this movie which was seriously lacking in recent horror releases. Although most are much ado about nothing or relied on the usual tricks up the horror sleeve with smart manipulation of editing and music it did provide what I thought was an explanation on how offerings to spirits are possibly handled through the use of well placed and polished special effects.In summary what works for Silk is its semblance of a decent story and the ending which was satisfactory given its at times hilarious build up during the tense final what's up with all these Ringu homages made plain ridiculous and full of cheese and unexpected twist of a logical flaw. It's also touching and sad at times and for those who are of softer hearts it might bring about some tears.Do take note though with its PG rating locally much of the gore were censored out in really ugly means. Very jarring to the entire flow of the movie.".

	schema:headline " Probably one of the best mystery films around you never heard of!";
	schema:reviewBody "Silk is a Taiwanese film with a mixed cast of Taiwanese and Japanese actors. And often the Taiwanese actors will talk Japanese to make matters even more confusing. It does add an international flair or scale if you will. Chances are however you haven't even heard of this title. It certainly deserves an International audience. Find out why.Silk very successfully combines science fiction drama and horror. The pacing of Silk is just right. From the start you want to know what is going on. There are certainly enough scares and surprises. However you should keep in mind that this only is the case if you go in blind. Meaning if you know very little or nothing about the film. It could be stated that Silk is a little too ambitious for it's own good where one is trying to deepen the themes and characters. And the attempt is admirable. Ultimately it distracts somewhat and even falls a bit short. One example is the subplot involving Chen Chang Tung. It's too melodramatic and illogical to make an impact. The horror elements of the story are subtle but scary when it needs to be. There aren't many characters involved and that is a good thing so it's clear you should put the focus on. There are quite a few pivotal matters that are not explained in the story. Like for example the cube they are using in the movie. It's not necessary for the outcome of the main story but it would have been nice had they actually given us a hint or two of what it's origins are. But what really makes the film worth it is the acting. The cast is great. Chen Chang really carries the film. The actor who plays Hashimoto also is wonderful. You can see in his eyes that he is too obsessed with the case. You aren't quite sure whether too trust him or not. Yet you do feel like rooting for him since you can sense he is at the brink of discovering amazing. It could be that some horror elements are a bit typical compared to other Asian horror films. Honestly I never had a problem with this since the few scares in the films are very effective. But these scares are secondary to the mystery. The mystery itself is very compelling and you very gladly want to dive into it. Even upon a second viewing the mystery elements remain strong. The horror ones little less so. However there is a little sense of dread and tension felt throughout.Overall this certainly will be worth your time if alone for the wonderful blend of genres.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have conflicted feelings about Silk. One the one hand the first hour of the film is easily one of the best and most original Horror premises to come out of Asia in a while. The only problem with the film is the second half which degenerates into a Juon ripoff with one of the worst death scenes and car crashes in cinema history.Silk tells the story of paranormal investigation team headed by a crippled man named Hasimoto Yosuke Eguchi. One day Hasimoto is able to trap a young ghost boy in a apartment room using a new scientific invention called the Manger Sponge A material that is able to trap the energy of entities. Hasimoto only has one problem he needs a man with sharp eyes who can read the lips of the ghost boy he has trapped. Thus enters Tung Chen Cheng a police sharpshooter who reluctantly takes the job with Hasimoto. Together the two seek to uncover the secrets of the supernatural.I don't know what Director ChaoBin Su was thinking when he made Silk. As mentioned above the first hour of Silk is a tight and concise supernaturaldetective thriller. One of the things that made the film work in the first hour was how all the characters could actively see the ghost forcing the Director to come up with different ways of scaring the audience without the usual clichs of the randomly appearing ghost. And in the first half of the film Chao is very successful with his scares. In the last 30 minutes the film introduces a longhaired woman ghost think JuOn and then the film catapults off the rails.I really wish the Director would have stuck to the original premise which was deliciously frightening and creepy instead of taking the film in the direction he did which was formulaic and predictable. It's frustrating because Silk should have been another masterpiece of Asian Horror. As it stands now it's just another copycat with great but wasted potential. The acting was good the plot interesting cinematography and score was nice... it's just the ending that needs a major fix.In particular two scenes helped ruin this film for me The ghost coming from the soup bowl and the ridiculously bad cg of a car crash depicted towards the end of the film. I actually had to back it up because I couldn't believe what I was seeing.Bottom Line Director ChaoBin Su could have had a masterpiece. The first hour is a great SupernaturalDetective story the last 30 minutes is a clichd and ridiculous.My Score 610 The beginning elevates this film to a slightly better than average ghost story".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not the best movie that I have ever seen but it comes very close. In fact I haven't had the experience of being at the edge of my seat for a long time now but for this movie I was constantly at the edge of my seat. And that's saying something.The idea is effectively new and interestingly captivating. The story itself is cohesive and very sophisticated something that recent movies lack. The writer uses science to explain supernatural phenomenons like ghosts no it is not the Matrix assimilating a program that is doing what it is not supposed to do. And it's no simple science we are talking about here. Although I could understand the story my friend who is a college IT lecturer couldn't. On top of that the writer can even anticipates what the audience will ask. Every time I came up with a question one of the characters onscreen asks that very same question. As can be expected from the writer who wrote Double Vision although I didn't really understand that movie as a whole  but it was a good story nevertheless. Characters developments were immensely heartwrenching although it was only focused on two characters. There was a scene where I actually closed my eyes and turned away from the screen and I was crying.The editing and plot were superbly done. For a movie that could have bored the audience easily this movie interlaced long explanation sequences with actions and scare scenes. This is the main reason why I was at the edge of my seat. I kept waiting for the answers but at the same time being caught in the action onscreen. Brilliant! The acting was the next commendable area of the movie. Chang Chen gave a very solid performance as both a cop and a son in distraught. Karena Lam also gave a memorable performance here as a woman who is willing to sacrifice for love. Yosuke Eguchi's performance reminds me of Tadanobu Asano's performance in Ichi The Killer. Although less masochistic Hashimoto's character gave you the sense of someone who has a strong hold on his own believes and he is willing to go further than most people to get what he wants. Yosuke Eguchi was brilliant as Hashimoto being able to bring out that pain and stubbornness within the character. The casting director should get an award for this alone.Art direction was very good. The building of the set was not only believable but also gave out the correct atmosphere to compliment every aspect of the movie. There are no overkills like those you see in Pulse. The backgrounds were nicely done and house decorations are kept to a realistic level. No unnecessary marks on the walls no abundance of abandoned furniture and definitely no worms squirming on leftover food or unwashed dishes. An abandoned apartment looks like an abandoned apartment. Just look closely on the beginning sequence and you will see what I mean.Camera works were good and innovative but more importantly there were effective. The lighting was perfectly done. I got goosebumps just from the atmosphere alone.With those said let's look at the negative side of the movie. Directing was not very strong here. No fatal mistakes were made by Su ChaoBin but there were nothing much to impress either. My only major complain is the scare scenes. They were by far the worst ideas I have ever seen. It was still good in the beginning but towards the end they were downright funny and unimaginative. Those who came up with the ideas and those who approved them should be shot in the kneecap. This movie can be really scary if only the scenes were done right. What an unfortunately and unnecessary weakness.The music was insignificant. I can't recall really if there were any background music to accompany the movie. They just don't register. It didn't help the movie but at least it didn't ruin it. Also I don't really like the multilingual dialogs. More often than not I find myself switching between listening to the dialogs and reading the subtitles which in this movie where many explanations were essentials and often very long it can be easy to get lost. Why? Because the characters often switch languages right in the middle of a conversation! Also I don't care much about the politics portrayed in the movie.It could work just as well with only one country being involved in the case. How many Japanese can speak perfect Mandarin and vice versa? Overall the movie was good very good but it could have been great. Maybe if I directed the movie...".

	schema:headline " This Unique Blend of Science and the Supernatural makes for Riveting Suspense";
	schema:reviewBody "Hashimoto Yosuke Eguchi leads a team consistent of Su Barbie Hsu Mei Janine ChunNing Chang and Ren Bolin Chen in an attempt to conquer Earth's gravity and achieve the ability to walk on ceilings and walls. This accomplishment is conceivable through the use of a device called the Menger Sponge which traps energies capable of making this dream a reality. However as with many science fiction films that employ elements of horror there is always a catch and in the movie Silk that comes in the form of a young boy whose ghost not only haunts an aged establishment but is the key to the experiment his inexplicably strong energies being capable of turning the science into reality.Trapping the boy inside a room the team invests the assistance of Tung Chen Chang a tactical expert sniper and lip reader who is able to read the lips of the ghost in an attempt to better understand his motivations and past. Mr. Chang is able to brilliantly carry the film alongside Mr. Eguchi although the focus on their characters renders the others less memorable.Tung is an interesting character to focus upon his military background causing him to become a strong driving individual as confident as he is capable though at the same time this attitude of his leaves him prone to some unemotional instances in the field. The subplot involving his mother whose sick in hospital is the paramount reason behind his dilemmas regarding death and the afterlife and the relationship he has with love interest Wei Karena Lam although portrayed over only a few scenes is as fulfilling as the rest of the plot providing the audience with an emotional story worth investing in.Out of all the horror movies I've seen Silk would have to be one of the most unique. Originally the film seems unsure of its directionality beginning with a stereotypical horror movie scene before introducing a shoot out between police forces and terrorists. These changes in tone are eventually combined producing an effective blend of entertainment.One of the pitfalls of focusing so strongly on the ghosts in this film which occupy more than half of the feature is that through humanizing them the sense of terror they exude is limited although that's not to say it's nonexistent with a couple of great unpredictable jump scares incorporated into the plot. What Silk does best of all though is suspense with many scenes where either ghosts or humans are pursuing one another resulting in many nail biting situations.Moreover the science is also effectively produced with much of it being intelligently portrayed and carefully discussed allowing this particular aspect of the story to be convincingly understandable and entertaining.The special effects offer a mixture of decent and fantastic visuals and the accompanying music during the scenes fraught with tension and emotion draw the viewer further into the plot until on many an occasion you are haplessly glued to the screen itching for a resolution to one of the many crises.Thoroughly entertaining suspenseful gripping and featuring a brilliant ending that fabulously concludes each of the stories developed over the course of the feature Silk is an unmissable blend of action science fiction and horror that deserves to be viewed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hashimoto Yosuke Eguchi leads a team consistent of Su Barbie Hsu Mei Janine ChunNing Chang and Ren Bolin Chen in an attempt to conquer Earth's gravity and achieve the ability to walk on ceilings and walls. This accomplishment is conceivable through the use of a device called the Menger Sponge which traps energies capable of making this dream a reality. However as with many science fiction films that employ elements of horror there is always a catch and in the movie Silk that comes in the form of a young boy whose ghost not only haunts an aged establishment but is the key to the experiment his inexplicably strong energies being capable of turning the science into reality.Trapping the boy inside a room the team invests the assistance of Tung Chen Chang a tactical expert sniper and lip reader who is able to read the lips of the ghost in an attempt to better understand his motivations and past. Mr. Chang is able to brilliantly carry the film alongside Mr. Eguchi although the focus on their characters renders the others less memorable.Tung is an interesting character to focus upon his military background causing him to become a strong driving individual as confident as he is capable though at the same time this attitude of his leaves him prone to some unemotional instances in the field. The subplot involving his mother whose sick in hospital is the paramount reason behind his dilemmas regarding death and the afterlife and the relationship he has with love interest Wei Karena Lam although portrayed over only a few scenes is as fulfilling as the rest of the plot providing the audience with an emotional story worth investing in.Out of all the horror movies I've seen Silk would have to be one of the most unique. Originally the film seems unsure of its directionality beginning with a stereotypical horror movie scene before introducing a shoot out between police forces and terrorists. These changes in tone are eventually combined producing an effective blend of entertainment.One of the pitfalls of focusing so strongly on the ghosts in this film which occupy more than half of the feature is that through humanizing them the sense of terror they exude is limited although that's not to say it's nonexistent with a couple of great unpredictable jump scares incorporated into the plot.

I personally found the opening scene to be probably the scariest scene in the entire show and I have to admit this opening scene was far better and much scarier than the opening scene in ringuthough overall ringu was a better movie. This movie share similarities with ringu i.e the people who died had twisted mouths and their mouths were being opened very wide. This movie is unique it explains the use of the merger sponge. It explains that ghosts does not hold grudges are in peace and vanishes into thin air. Whereas ghosts who holds grudges don't. I am a Singaporean and understand Chinese. So I do not need to look at the subtitles. This movie is acted by a very famous Taiwanese actress Barbie su who does a great job in this film. However the atmosphere of this film was not really scary. I did not like the atmosphere used in this film. I thought more information needs to be given about the boy and his mother as in why they held such a strong grudge. This film gets really complicating towards the end though it was still entertaining. Overall I think this was a really well done movie. If you love this movie you may also like to try out the Taiwanese horror movie called the heirloom which was also very well done. Score 810".

Ysuke Eguchi Chang Chen Karena Lam are praised for their acting while the remaining came to fame via idol dramas that require mostly pretty faces and good packaging. Thus whether by intention or design B0Lin Chen left out no potential audience. The first category would attract viewers who value nuances and depth while the second draws worshiping screaming fans to the theaters.In the movie crippled Japanese scientist Hashimoto played by Ysuke Eguchi heads a research team whose nominal work is in antigravity Menger Sponge. In reality the research direction derailed once Hashimoto realized that the sponge can confine ghosts as well as allow the living to see the dead. To uncover secrets of life after death the team captures the spirit of a young boy and drafts special agent Ye Qidong Chen Chang to find out his identity and cause of death.The film is often times fraught with tension and suspense. The boy's mysterious past and even more mysterious death greatly complicate Ye's investigation. The special agent found himself at odds not only with the forces that made the ghost child but also with others on the research team as differing motives cause members to fight one another for the possession of the young ghost. Together the supernatural conflict and the more secular disunity give Silk depth uncommon in normal horror movies. Rather than nonstop exploitation of gore or cheap scares the movie offers pensive reflections on life and death.Obviously Gui Si's premise is more involved than the typical horror movies on the market. In addition to an original plot line Scifi elements combined with traditional spirit lore puts a new spin on the familiar ghost story. Although this mixandmesh is refreshing jumps in logic are present. For example the failure to convincingly explain how living transforms into ghost made an otherwise touching ending appear like a deliberate move to manipulate tears from the viewers. Some of the lackluster ghost scenes also detracted from the latter half of the movie looking rather like washeddown parts from The Ring.In all Silk is a solid production that because of some details failed to become great. As a sidenote I also found the casting interesting. The amount of the time that each actor spent in the movie and hisher relative importance to the entire story is totally commensurate with the public perception of their acting skills.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a complex yet very creative film! It can best described as a combination of Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone and Vincenzo Natali's Haunter...with it's own original angle and a bizarre scifi twist.The basic premise centers around a group of international scientists who are responsible for creating the Menger Sponge a sort of cube made up of smaller cubes made of human protein that have the ability to capture and store electromagnetic energy...ultimately providing the user with antigravitational abilities though this has yet to be fully achieved. As one must find a source for electromagnetic waves in order to capture them.The group is led by a crippled Japanese man named Hashimoto the first person to create a scaled up version of the Menger Sponge. The rest of his team come from various other parts of Asia...and they hire a Canadian photographer to travel around the world to search for ghosts.They do this because Hashimoto believes that ghosts are made up of electromagnetic energy and thus they can be trapped inside a large scale Menger Sponge and harnessed for antigravity uses.They eventually find a ghost in Taipei and the Canadian photographer manages to capture him using film coated with Menger Sponges...but he doesn't make it out alive.So they send for a Taiwanese special forces guy named Tung to be assigned to their case for he possesses an uncanny ability to read lips and react in tense situations.Hashimoto wants to know who the boy is how he died where his body is and what is the source of his energy that allows him to kill people if they look directly into his eyes. And thus tasks Tung with the job of following the boy and uncovering this information.He successfully manages to achieve this but it turns out that Hashimoto has some ulterior motives for wanting to know this. Having suffered from birth he has always wanted to die. Thus he seeks to understand the nature of ghosts so that he can haunt when he is dead.But Tung notices something else as well. A silklike strand running from the boy to others. Others who have become marked for death.According to Hashimoto it is this silk that connects two energies together. Though his theory as to how this works is mistaken. For he believes the silk is indicative of the hatred held by the deceased individual.Meanwhile Tung is left trying to save himself and the love of his life who has become wrapped up in the whole affair while Hashimoto seeks to trap the boy's ghost in the Menger Cube for his own ends.Inevitably leading to the film's violent conclusion.When all is said and done this is a pretty intriguing film that has all sorts of drama mystery haunts and cool science fiction. For the most part it's style is pretty culty. And the acting is fair. But what the hell is with that CGI...it's so poorly done...especially in that car crash scene which is completely laughable and overwhelmingly noticeable.That aside however...this film has so much originality and creativity...that it just might renew your faith in modern ghost films.Wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood ended up remaking it.Recommended.7.5 out of 10.".

The science is completely absurd the acting is bad the effects are laughable.The idea is that this is a movie that tries to capitalize on the recent success of Asian ghost horror films. You have the ghost but this time it is analyzed in a scientific way. And when I say scientific I am thinking Van Helsing  Alas it is a bad film you can't sympathize with any of the characters and the twist of the end is obvious as a mile long silk thread.Bottom line it was an effort I give you that but it wasn't enough. Without being bad because it is full of clichs and it is anyway it is bad because of a not thought out script. And if you expect to get scared you will be sadly disappointed.".
