	schema:headline " An invitation for discussion a surrealist delight";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always felt that it was somewhat unfortunate that the concept of a cinema presented as art has been largely abandoned in the last sixty years or so in favour of a cinema of wanton commodity. The idea that a film is little more than a consumer product intended to offer passive entertainment that won't require any kind of further thought or challenges for the viewer is incredibly sad and inevitably leads to the endless regurgitation of codes conventions stories and images that we're currently seeing through the endless production of remakes literary adaptations and variations on TV. I suppose it depends largely on how you view the notion of art in an entertainment sense. I'd gather that very few of the people posting negative comments here would gladly spend the afternoon in an art gallery not simply learning something about the artist and their work but actually enjoying it. Many think of art as something incredibly serious there to be admired from a distance without ever attempting to form a personal connection or engagement with it on an emotional or intellectual level. It is this attitude that leads to the various implications of the term art film which now has a number of incredibly negative connotations that suggest something pofaced and pretentious the idea that these films should be sat through and looked at with no real appreciation for the sense of fun frivolity and subversive glee that the filmmakers bring to their work or the ideas behind it.As one of the previous reviewer already noted it was not Buuel's intention for this film to be looked at as something entirely serious though there are certainly serious ideas being expressed. Instead you could approach it as something radical like rock n' roll or punk music with the idea of a cinema of revolution and defiance that goes against all accepted conventions of what cinema is and what cinema should attain to as well as commenting on the nature of society  with all its bourgeois values and the then prevalent idea of religious hypocrisy  in a way that would inspire thought and provoke a reaction. You might not enjoy it as much as a more conventional film that offers a plot and a theme and characters you can believe in  and all presented in a way that is comfortable and safe  but the experience for me at least is as a hundred times more rewarding than the latest Marvel adaptation or exercise in Hollywood nostalgia. Look at the current films at the top of the US boxoffice and it becomes clear that films like L'ge d'Or 1930 and the proceeding Un Chien Andalou 1929 have become part of the minority. Nonetheless when we view this film within the context of something like KungFu Panda 2008 You Don't Mess With Zohan 2008 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 2008 and Sex and the City 2008  all currently top of the American box office  we can see the extent of how facile and meaningless much of contemporary cinema has become.It has never been my belief that a film requires a story or a character that we attach our own thoughts and feelings to but rather can survive simply as a platform for creative thought and artistic expression. The true power of cinema is in the sense that it is the only real art form that combines elements from every single separate artform that you can possibly think of from performance art to photography editing and design and of course the various literary traditions that gave us the ideas of narrative and character. So with L'ge d'Or we are presented with a mad jumble of images all flowing dreamlike from one scene to the next  sometimes boring sometimes fascinating  often without interpretation or any kind of greater context outside of the broader notions of surrealism for the sake of it. It's still seen as something radical  perhaps even dangerous  seventyodd years after it was first released but really its classic cinema in the traditional sense e.g. a collection of abstract but penetrating images intended to be viewed by as many people as possible at the same time to create a shared and sensory experience. In this sense the film is almost beyond criticism or at least beyond the higher intellectualinterpretative level of criticism that it normally receives with the film standing as an ode to cinema at its most simple and sublime. All notions of intellectualism or pseudointellectualism are therefore thrown out of the window as the film transfixes us with some stunningly imaginative images that flicker to life on the screen.To seek answers from the film is missing the point as there are no questions to be asked. The point of the film is not to entertain on the base levels of character narrative and simple human emotions but rather to present us with something that we've never seen before. It's artist expression. If you have no interest in this then you'll have no interest in the film  which although incredibly difficult and almost certainly not to all tastes is still as close to the purest sense of cinema as you can possibly get. Some of the images are intended to shock others to amuse and others to titillate and provoke thought even when there seems to be nothing to really think about. Above all else it is an experience like all films and one that is entirely visual and approachable on even the most immediate of levels. Don't think too much about it or attempt to see something that isn't there. The point of surrealism was to go beyond such notions of the real and mundane to present something illogical imaginative and devoid of rational thinking in order to find a new way of approaching the world. That's what this film represents.".

This collection of surreal scenes satirising every possible social value you can think of and revelling in anything considered by the aristocrats to be vulgar was made with a delicious sense for black comedy a taste for which would not become socially acceptable for sixty years. This movie caused riots on its first release in 1930 and was banned for forty years. If you see this on the program to be shown at an art gallery near you like i did you won't regret seeing it. Think of it as Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel sticking their finger up at everything everyone else takes seriously and laughing at their being offended. Seventy years later the art gallery audience i was with were laughing along with Bunuel and Dali. This is about the most modern feeling thing you'll see from early cinema. I'll give you a sample a couple are such nymphomaniacs whenever they see each other they can't stop from leaping on each other and writhing on the ground together. At one point in the movie they are kissing and all of a sudden he sees the foot of a statue behind her and is distracted by its beauty. He becomes dazed and zoned on the foot. She pulls away from him tries to talk to him he holds his hand up to her face as if to say hang on just give me a minute. Then he feels compelled to leave her. Left on her own mourning her momentary separation from her lustful partner she begins sucking on the toes of the statue as she was sucking on the fingers of her love a few scenes before. Camera cuts to a closeup of the statue's face as if to check its reaction. The entire audience broke up at this. It was all too much. An absolute riot which can only be appreciated today as taking the pss out of every form of conservatism you can imagine.WARNING it is at times disturbing. If you are at all feinthearted and can not separate movies from reality especially surrealist movies from reality then stay away.".

	schema:headline " The Truest Love Story Ever Told!";
	schema:reviewBody "Just a few days prior to viewing L'Age d'Or I had sketched out a few of my views on Surrealism and will begin by complimenting this review with them...Possibly the most accurate description of surrealism came from film director Luis Bunuel when he called it a rape to the conscious.'  This is how it is and how it should be for it is a form of art that forces the spectator into the paradoxical mind state that is surrealism.  To view a document of surrealism is to be simultaneously repulsed and delighted.  As such this is surrealism the blending of two or more contradictory emotions to form one emotion divorced from logic.   There can not realistically be a like or dislike of a piece of pure surrealist art for to like or dislike something requires decision and decision requires logic.  Surrealism is an art form to be experienced purely on a visceral level and not as many rational forms of art on an intellectual one. Likewise the creation of surrealist art requires the subversion of the intellect for it demands complete spontaneity unsuppressed by ego or superego dictatorship.   So in many ways surrealism is the most pure form of art.If surrealism is the most pure example of art then L'Age d'Or is the most pure example of cinema perfectly fitting the requirements stated above.  It is a delightfully subversive ecstatically liberating maddeningly offensive bid for individual freedom.  And most ironically the truest love story ever told!Though L'Age d'Or has a firmer plot line than Un Chien Andalou Bunuel's previous film a 16 minute marvel it is still more dreamlike. This is because while Un Chien Andalou's surrealist images are more contained one bizarre image after another forming a barely apprehensible link L'Age d'Or's are far more detached because they jut awkwardly out of a noticeable plot line.  Surrealism must accentuate the bizzare found in a perfectly normal situation and while Un Chien does this there is still very little normal in the film.  Not to say that it is any less inspired than L'Age d'Or quite the contrary but ironically it is L'Age d'Or's use of plot that makes it all the more surreal.The plot of L'Age d'Or is about how we compromise ourselves in the name of society more specifically how we compromise our sexual desire. Whether the man and the woman the centers of the film trying desperately to overcome social obstacles to consummate their love are actually in love is never made perfectly clear but they do suffer the same barriers couples find in society today.  The majority of the humor in the film comes from the ways its immortal couple disrespects this need to compromise and the sexual misplacements that occur when they are forced to abide by it the infamous toe fellatio scene is hysterically erotic.  Another recurring idea is that society is built on this compromise and due to it is always lingering on the edge of madness.Like he did with Un Chien Andalou in L'Age d'Or director Bunuel disrupts rational time and space continuum to satisfy his own flights of fancy.  In an early sequence a group of people dressed in contemporary 30's clothing step off some historic looking ships to lay the first stone of what is to be Imperial Rome.  We then cut to Rome in it's contemporary glory where we find the people looking no different and the main character's seen during the previous scene not really looking any older. What is Bunuel trying to say with this scene?  That things do not really ever change.  Maybe he's just once again indulging in the beauty of the irrational.The beauty of the irrational... That was something Bunuel clung to throughout his career but it was never again so evident so pure as it was in the days of L'Age d'Or.  I spent a great deal of time searching for this little treasure and now that I've found it I have no regrets.  Love it or hate it love it and hate it L'Age d'Or is the type of film that will never be made again.  It is too alive with the possibilities of it's medium too fresh to be reproduced.  And too brilliant audacious and liberating to be topped.".

	schema:headline " Like walking into Bunuel and Dalis' brains and going through the doors they have wide open";
	schema:reviewBody "Luis Bunuel was a filmmaker of great imagination and scathing wit and Salvador Dali was a magnificent albeit demented artist and painter. Combined they made Un Chien Andalou The Andalousian Dog a shortfilm that somehow made it through the decades to reach another generation after another. This is because surrealism the field they were working in was one that could be endlessly creative. Surrealists could and still can captivate startle amuse primarily provoke andor even delight an audience by the story elements and images that come right out of fantasy both on the bright and darkbleak side of things. L'Age D'Or was a chance for Bunuel to go further and if his goal was to enlighten the audience as well as to stir the sstorm he succeeded. In the first five to ten minutes of L'Age D'Or I didn't know whether I knew exactly what was going on or was totally boggled the first images Bunuel puts forth are of scorpions insects were one of his fascinations and how they're shaped and how ferocious they can be. Then he cuts to some men who have guns by their side walking through deserted rocks. THEN after this he cuts to a ship docking by the coastline where the guys with the guns were walking and he never goes back to them again.

I turned off the movie feeling breathless like being put through a washing machine of astonishing turns and emotions. At one point my jaw dropped and then at the next point I smiled. To sum it up I definitely want and need to see it again...one more note this is a very very hard film to find one that has been kept out of circulation on video it was also kept out of circulation in movie theaters for decades due to its controversies at the time of its release but to seek it out is to take a chance that could equally pay off or disturb a particular viewer.".

	onyx:emotionText "Luis Bunuel was a filmmaker of great imagination and scathing wit and Salvador Dali was a magnificent albeit demented artist and painter. Combined they made Un Chien Andalou The Andalousian Dog a shortfilm that somehow made it through the decades to reach another generation after another. This is because surrealism the field they were working in was one that could be endlessly creative. Surrealists could and still can captivate startle amuse primarily provoke andor even delight an audience by the story elements and images that come right out of fantasy both on the bright and darkbleak side of things. L'Age D'Or was a chance for Bunuel to go further and if his goal was to enlighten the audience as well as to stir the sstorm he succeeded. In the first five to ten minutes of L'Age D'Or I didn't know whether I knew exactly what was going on or was totally boggled the first images Bunuel puts forth are of scorpions insects were one of his fascinations and how they're shaped and how ferocious they can be. Then he cuts to some men who have guns by their side walking through deserted rocks. THEN after this he cuts to a ship docking by the coastline where the guys with the guns were walking and he never goes back to them again. Instead he focuses on one of the bourgeoisie men who is raping a woman and who is dragged off into the imperial city. If you look at this story structure it doesn't seem to make sense  what is it that Bunuel and Dali are trying to get at here?

All Bunuel's favorite themes and subjects have been stored in this relatively short 62 minutes but still shocking and amazing film. And as all Bunuel's movies it is a great fun to watch. I think the closest to L'ge d'or is his later masterpiece Le Fantme de la libert 1974 another excellent collection of satirical vignettes dark and comical.The irony starts in the title of the movie  In the ancient mythology the Golden Age emphasized the idea of original peacefulness innocence and harmony in all of nature including human society. In Christian tradition the Golden Age is identified with Eden but in the Bunuel's paradise there is no harmony or happiness and innocent are frustrated and rebellious by all kinds of obstacles social and religious that prevent them from fulfilling their desire for each other favorite Bunuel's subject that he would explore over and over in his following films. There are many disturbing and shockingly violent images in the paradise created by Bunuel's fantasy one is Lya Lys's face when she is sucking on the marble toe of the Greek goddess's statue desperately waiting for her beloved with whom she is never able to be together. It is agony and ecstasy which have not been matched on the screen since. The frustration and anger that always go together with Bunuel's unique humor culminate in the final attack on the organized religion of such vicious and darkly comical power that the toothless and harmless Da Vinci Code could only dream about.

	schema:reviewBody "A representation of the effect on individuality within the paralysed surreal society of Bunuel's L'age D'or. 1930It was Bunuel and Dali's utter disdain of the Church that actually led the film to be banned for 49 years released again in 1979. The absurd sacrament that proclaimed that no matter how much in love a couple are sex before marriage must always be forbidden. A small riot broke out on its initial release in 1930 due to the surreal scenes such as the antiCatholic messages that a slide show projected. The Vatican is viewed from an aerial shot with the less than subtle message The ancient city of Rome  Mistress to Pagan Times.' The representation alone of Jesus as a murderous impostor in the last 25 minutes would have provoked extreme rage. The upper class culture was depicted as a race of people too sexually inhibited and frightened by their peers to explore Bunuel's revolutionary ideas that in order to have your own mind you have to free yourself of the church and it's tightening grip. Bunuel's religious pessimism was caused by a strict regime of daily worship and a rigorous religious education in school. It forced him to have a unique perspective on religion where he probably conjured negative surrealist ideas and thoughts from his surreal' days at school and the product is this very cinematic and authentic masterpiece. It is through this film where he becomes the teacher of his own beliefs instead of being the educated a medium that no longer required the audience to be told what to believe but to make up their own minds on their own accord as opposed to Catholicism. The Man and The Woman Gaston Modot and Lya Lys as they are known symbolises Bunuel's radical sacrilegious' thinking and are his model couple. Contrasting the original Man and Woman Adam and Eve to his carefully chosen archetypes we have a greater knowledge about the director's surrealist tendencies and his interest in not the images but ideas they signify. When released it appeared to lack morals and the sexual innuendo and nature of the film was a topic of heated debate in 1930. We see the couple for the first time as they attempt to make love rolling around in the mud. This spontaneity was caused by the rare opportunity of having sex while the crowd representing society had its back turned. The public were too fascinated with a humorous commemoration of four holy men who humorously perished in the most meaningless fashion. The cultural variation of the crowd is significant however when compared to religion because their formation on screen represents the hierarchy in life. At the foreground we see the upperclasses with their bow ties top hats and jewellery the middle class are like the previous but without the aesthetics and the working class are in the rather unsatisfactory background as in reality. The poor and unimportant' have a less than adequate view from to what they've come to witness and the rich take their perspective for granted. Perhaps a representation of the Church prefers an alliance with the rich rather than the lower classes by the inclusion of the priests at the forefront? The crowd is ignorant to the couple but is alerted by a few people at the back the working class children too small and insignificant deemed fit to share in the glory' of this religious event. Young faces brighten up but sensing the displeasure from the upper classes and the pity of their own parents the image changes from a look of glee to that of the irate bourgeois culture that Bunuel and Dali despise so much. Through the direction and the cinematography old age and the upper classes are represented in The Man's dream as corrupted and poisoned because they are simply jealous that the lovers had the sheer freedom to act in such a way a group of archetypal actors and actresses theatrically shake their fists towards the couple. They are summarily separated and The Man is taken away by the police. This scene is extremely amusing because Bunuel and Dali both co writers are implying that society would imprison The Man for the most innocent of crimes to be free and in love. The couple have to surpass the very obstacles that Bunuel faced in making the film the church society and even his or their own psychological problems. In a dream the goal is almost always impossible to reach due to the cruel pitfalls of society and thus life. There is one scene where a surreal sequence a dream shows how The Man unconsciously deals with the dawning realisation that society and religion are completely against him. It is his attempt to make love and express his general freedom where he feels unfairly paralysed from doing so. In the same moment we view the archetypal father figure shooting his son over a small offence in the garden. The camera is positioned to follow the father on his impending arrival towards home he is walking on the dirt as the typical doting son senses his arrival and greets him. The father is smartly dressed wearing black with a rifle slung over his shoulder. The son is archetypal also in the scruffiness of his hair and clothes and his brazen and bold countenance. In this one scene we establish that the boy represents how The Man feels about himself he considers himself to be free confident and blissfully content it is his mind that perceives these images. The father figure however represents society that although seemingly friendly and assuring at first will severely punish the boy if he commits a sin. We have no idea that the rifle the father is carrying has significance but it is an image of potential danger. The boy seeks comfort from his parent and on his father's knee he is hugged and kissed as the two are composed entirely central to shot. The Man's guilty conscience conjures a representation of natural harmony not between only father and son but equally between society and The Man. Society is metaphorically welcoming for The Man because it can offer nurture in times of angst. To have the desire to make love is distinctly personal not sinful but natural in every respect. He feels trapped because in order to have sex with the one he loves he must oppose the dominant ideologies in his life his parents the upper class society he belongs to and ultimately religion. The boy is conscious of the rifle accusatory ammunition but never once suspects it will be used on him because having a young perspective on life he naturally feels slightly nave but confident enough to challenge society's out dated values. We then see the father reciting something of importance to his son' society is saying to The Man if you must behave in a particular way get married otherwise you will face damnation in this life and the next! He probably feels like a child because a symbolic parent is teaching him what he already knows but has actually chosen from his own free will to ignore what has been advised by his guilty conscience that originates from religion. The boy embodying The Man's feelings towards this patronisation laughs at him and hits an object from his father's hand to the floor. He runs off smiles waves to camera and seeks refuge in the long grass in the garden. His father stares at the cherished item the object of religious teaching  The Man's and the father's morals and values. He is angered to such an extent he instantly shoots the rifle not just once but twice into the poor boy's body.".

	schema:headline " Strange film by two Spanish maestros of surrealism and abstraction  Luis Buuel and Salvador Dali";
	schema:reviewBody "Surrealism and sour attack upon religion by the Spanish master  the great Luis Buuel .This is a typical Buuel film  as there are a lot of symbolism and surrealism  including mockery or wholesale review upon religion especially Catholicism . This film opens with a documentary on scorpions this was an actual film made in 1912 which Luis Buuel added commentary  later on  a man Gaston Modot and a woman Lyla Lys are passionately in love with one another but their attempts to consummate that passion are constantly interrupted by their families the Church and bourgeois society.This is a strange and surrealist tale of a couple who are passionately in love  but their attempts to consummate it are constantly thwarted  it is an absurd  abstract picture that was banned for over 50 years. This is the most scandalous of all Buuel's pictures . It is packed with surreal moments  criticism  absurd situations and religious elements about Catholic Church  furthermore Buuel satirizes and he carries out outright attacks to religious lifestyle and Christian liturgy . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  issues well shown in Age of Gold. Here Buuel makes an implacable attack to the Catholic church  theme that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . It is surreal  dreamlike  and deliberately pornographically blasphemous . Buuel made his first film  a 17minute longtime short film titled Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot  the following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  this scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes . Buuel's first picture has more of a script than Un Chien Andalou  but it's still a pure Surrealist flick . For various legal reasons this film was withdrawn from circulation in 1934 by the producers who had financed the film and the US premiere was on 1 November 1979 .

	onyx:emotionText "Surrealism and sour attack upon religion by the Spanish master  the great Luis Buuel .This is a typical Buuel film  as there are a lot of symbolism and surrealism  including mockery or wholesale review upon religion especially Catholicism . This film opens with a documentary on scorpions this was an actual film made in 1912 which Luis Buuel added commentary  later on  a man Gaston Modot and a woman Lyla Lys are passionately in love with one another but their attempts to consummate that passion are constantly interrupted by their families the Church and bourgeois society.This is a strange and surrealist tale of a couple who are passionately in love  but their attempts to consummate it are constantly thwarted  it is an absurd  abstract picture that was banned for over 50 years. This is the most scandalous of all Buuel's pictures . It is packed with surreal moments  criticism  absurd situations and religious elements about Catholic Church  furthermore Buuel satirizes and he carries out outright attacks to religious lifestyle and Christian liturgy . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  issues well shown in Age of Gold. Here Buuel makes an implacable attack to the Catholic church  theme that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . It is surreal  dreamlike  and deliberately pornographically blasphemous . Buuel made his first film  a 17minute longtime short film titled Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot  the following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  this scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes . Buuel's first picture has more of a script than Un Chien Andalou  but it's still a pure Surrealist flick . For various legal reasons this film was withdrawn from circulation in 1934 by the producers who had financed the film and the US premiere was on 1 November 1979 . This film was granted a screening permit after being presented to the Board of Censors as the dream of a madman . However  on the evening of 3 December 1930 the fascist League of Patriots and other groups began to throw purple ink at the screen then rushed out into the lobby of the theater slashing paintings by Yves Tanguy Salvador Dal Joan Mir and Man Ray .

	schema:reviewBody "In the Tate Modern's Dal  Film exhibition the fourteenodd rooms were mostly paintings but three or four had films of one kind or another. Having just seen Un Chien Andalou I decided to watch this one as well and was lucky to catch it just as it started. I say lucky because there is really nothing to tell you when these things are starting or ending. This is maybe OK with a short film that lasts seven minutes or a three minute clip from Spellbound but with a film that lasts an hour I really don't understand why the Tate didn't make at least a discrete effort to let us know start times  maybe it is beneath them to act like a cinema but it does mean that people were constantly flowing in and out and the implication is that the films can be just dipped in and out of.With this film though you do need to be in from the start because unlike Un Chien Andalou there is more of a plot here and the film has fewer of Dal's images across the running time. That said the plot here isn't any easier to follow if you did manage to catch it from the very start because this is still very much a surrealist film in structure and content even if it has fewer of the images that made the first film I'd seen so engaging. With Buuel forming more of the film than Dal the film does take on more symbolism in less surreal ways but yet it is still quite hard to follow. To me as a viewer this was a bit of a downside because there was less to stimulate me and more to frustrate me as I struggle to understand the meaning of what I was watching.Despite this I still did find it interesting and you can see why to a point that the screening did draw a reaction from those that saw it as attacking conservative values in its depiction of violent attacks etc. Quite why it was hardly screened for fifty years though I can't say. With a difficult plot to follow and an hour to watch the film asked a lot of me and I'm afraid I wasn't really up to the challenge and I did struggle to follow along. The scattering of surrealist imagery did help to hold my attention though and it is not without value  just a lot harder to watch than I would have liked it to have been.".

He is grabbed by two men and lead around the streets glaring into images which become animated. He is seeing his outcome all around him like a dream. The film has its funny moments and also its unpleasant ones one being where a man executes his little son for a minor offence another being where the man assaults a blind man crossing the road. But the savage Buuel humour is in evidence where a man throws various objects out of a window including a burning tree a priest and a giraffe. The primary assault as usual is on the bourgeoisie with a scene at a dinner party where a maid is burning in the kitchen and a horsedriven cart steered by peasants trespasses through. Of course all the guests are oblivious to this. It all concludes with a controversial religious scene which was the main reason it was banned for so long.

This time in 1930 for  L Age D Or the Age of Gold A scathing satire attacking the bourgeois state religion and the wealthy elite. The film concerns a man's quest for a women's unattainable love a common theme with Bunuel. The couple is caught making love and separated by authorities. Throughout the film the man tries to pursue the woman with no luck. He's repeatedly interrupted by different institutions. Finally the couple is reunited at a snotty high class party. Things go down hill from there as the film get's more and more crazy.  L Age D Or contains many bizarre surreal images such as crippled soldiers who use guns for crutches priest's that turn into skeletons a cow in the leading lady's bedroom toe fetishes and a giraffe and priest getting thrown out a window and harpooned. The dark humor was way ahead of it's time. Watch as a father shoots his own kid for not obeying him. In fact it's easy to see why it's festival premiere caused a riot. It was also extremely controversial for it's blasphemous images. Of course today it's less shocking and more hilarious. Bunuel and Dali were anarchic in their vision of society. Attacking every form of hypocrisy through surrealism they inspired many directors. This film is a must for anyone who's interested in surrealism or the history of cinema. Also check out The Phantom of Liberty for more crazy Bunuel madness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilers. You've been warned.Having previously seen Un Chien Andalou and Belle de Jour I went into this second BunuelDali filmic collaboration with high hopes but this brilliant film exceeded my wildest expectations. I can say that I was moved I can say that I laughed and without a doubt I can say that Bunuel and Dali's gleeful willingness to offend still shocks some seventythree years after the film was conceived. This film is like Un Chien Andalou toned down at least it gives that illusion for much of its length and spread out over an hour and even at scarcely over an hour the film has an epic feel that few films have ever captured. An early sequence in which a group of peasants attempt to scale a mountain in order to presumably kill a group of priests at the top must have been studied by Werner Herzog next to the jawdropping final scene of Heart of Glass it is perhaps the most powerful portrayal of man's impotence ever captured on film. After the bizarre sad and funny sequence with the peasants a group of aristocrats move in to I think found Rome on the site where the priests have died but are interrupted by an aristocratic couple trying to have sex and much of the rest of the movie concerns this poor young couple's attempts to make love while all the world seems to be against it happening. The sequences with the couple get some of the movie's biggest laughs cow? giraffe? maid on fire? I don't know either but also provide some stunning moments the sequence in which the man walks the city imagining his distant love underscored by Tristan and Isolde is brilliant Hitchcock and Herrmann were taking notes I am positive and the scene of consumnation complete with the couple whispering things to each other that are not said and crosscutting with an orchestra elsewhere in the garden is strangely hypnotic and moving. I had heard that this movie might offend the religious folk and until the final moments I had no idea why. But then the last scene happened. In order to explain I am a fairly religious person and thus am usually offended when artists of any kind take stupid shortsighted cheap shots at religion just in order for shock value. But the punchline of this cheap shot is so audacious so improbably welltimed that I had no choice but to applaud it. Does it really have anything to do with anything? I'm not sure but somehow I doubt it. But funny is funny is funny is funny and this last scene is hilariously shocking. I'll leave you to see for yourself what exactly happens here because to take the surprise of this scene would be to take much of the movie's sick power. For a movie running at 63 minutes L 'Age d'Or has more memorable moments than any movie I've seen in the past few months. There are so many scenes in which are sickest fantasies are realized for example what will that father do with that gun? what will the protagonist do to this blind man? and what is she thinking about that statue's toe? and so many where Bunuel and Dali provoke our deepest longings that each scene plays like a glimpse into the most extreme emotions lying dormant in ourselves. The two main actors portray their animal desire for each other so well that they create scenes as erotic as anything in Mulholland Drive without even having to take off their clothes. If you're looking for a film that defies every formula you've ever seen and cuts into raw bare emotion then you can't do much better L' Age d'Or. But if you're of a churchgoing disposition beware of the last scene. It's a doozy.".

However the films takes at least 3 times to completely understand Bunuel's symbolism the way I saw it as well as the ambiguous conclusion which is still a bit hazy for me. The film's pace is rather slow and can be dull at moments nevertheless it takes a lot of patience to even enjoy this film considering the irregular structure of the storyline. However that doesn't mean the film is a bomb it's definitely a standard in the history of artandfilm influencing a dozen surrealist filmmakers ie Cocteau Fellini as well as underground directors. In Short this film will start to grow on the viewer after several viewings.

Basically this French film is all about a loving couple the Man Gaston Modot and the Young Girl Lya Lys and their many attempts to embrace and consummate their feelings but all are interrupted and thwarted by various events and occurrences. These distractions often occur because of the families the church and generally bourgeois society and they find it very difficult to get away from these things and final sexual release and satisfaction there is even a scene where all the Girl can do is suck the toe of a statue. Also starring Caridad De Laberdesque as a Chambermaid and Little Girl Max Ernst as the Leader of men in cottage Josep Llorens Artigas as Governor Lionel Salem as Duke of Blangis Germaine Noizet as Marquise and Duchange as Conductor. Alright I will be completely honest and say that I didn't really understand anything going on and I did get a dozy because of this but I suppose I can see reasons why this film was banned for fortynine years from what I can recall and there are some humorous and erotic scenes so it is I suppose not a bad satire.

I have been told time and time again to go back to his early stuff that I'd be much more likely to enjoy those films. And those who pushed me were right. Of course when I sat down to watch it I didn't have the highest hopes. Immediately I began to nitpick. What is that supposed to mean?!?! What the heck is going on!?!? My favorite three letters became throughout the first half hour of this film WTF. But as much as its narrative or antinarrative was annoying me its technical aspects were very much delighting me. The cinematography is quite good the editing is fabulous and unique and the use of sound is simply fantastic. Eventually I just decided that the narrative wasn't supposed to make much sense and that Buuel's purpose was anything but a storyteller. He was after the absurdist image and the absurdist mood. After that I had a lot more fun and enjoyed it quite a bit. All good film watchers have to eventually train themselves away from depending on narrative. I'd still not call it a masterpiece or even a great film but it was very interesting and quite entertaining. I give it an 810. However I do plan to rewatch it since it is short and I do have it for another four days. Perhaps now that I can watch it entirely prepared from the very beginning I will raise that score.Upon watching it the next day Nope sorry. I didn't get anything new the second time 'round. I still liked it as much which is a huge compliment but I certainly didn't like it more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nevertheless this film can be frustrating as the series of vignettes comes tantalizingly close to resembling a plot while the outandout surreal moments appear less frequently than they did in Un chien andalou. Themes have carried over from that 1929 film but along with the length of the film symbols have increased in magnitude bound priests there becoming defenestrated bishops here.While it's true that people no longer attend church in quite the way they once did still I expect that anyone brought up anywhere in Christendom will get a shock from that one special scene conceived by Buuel and Dal. You'll know the one I mean.Bear in mind that the anticlericalism of the French Revolutionary period was of course well in the past when this film was made but that the religiously motivated atrocities and counteratrocities of the Spanish Civil War were a few years away yet. Religion and politics were seen as one. An established church was still a very serious target in 1930 for a pair of Spanish btes noires.

	onyx:emotionText "Nevertheless this film can be frustrating as the series of vignettes comes tantalizingly close to resembling a plot while the outandout surreal moments appear less frequently than they did in Un chien andalou. Themes have carried over from that 1929 film but along with the length of the film symbols have increased in magnitude bound priests there becoming defenestrated bishops here.While it's true that people no longer attend church in quite the way they once did still I expect that anyone brought up anywhere in Christendom will get a shock from that one special scene conceived by Buuel and Dal. You'll know the one I mean.Bear in mind that the anticlericalism of the French Revolutionary period was of course well in the past when this film was made but that the religiously motivated atrocities and counteratrocities of the Spanish Civil War were a few years away yet. Religion and politics were seen as one. An established church was still a very serious target in 1930 for a pair of Spanish btes noires. Those events lying ahead in Spain inspired conservative Catholic volunteers from several Western European countries to defend Christianity against godless Bolshevism anarchism and so on after 1939. Faith was something not to be fooled with in that time really not so long ago.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hats off definitely to Kino Video for not caring less about the bottom line and releasing L'Age d'Or on DVD for the cineaste's consumption. The picture still looks awful but I doubt it would've looked much better even if Criterion had bothered with it  this movie after all was nearly destroyed forever in 1930! The abovementioned cineastes and other devotees of Luis Bunuel will of course snap this DVD up but what can L'Age d'Or offer to the merely curious or to those who are willing to broaden their cultural intake? Hilarity primarily the movie almost incredibly still generates at least a halfdozen belly laughs by presenting vignettes that are sublimely absurd and bracingly offensive. Bunuel and Salvador Dali take their Surrealist picks and shovels and dig into the audience's nasty wipingboogersonthewalls subconsciousness in a manner that has hardly been imitated let alone bettered. Well Ken Russell tried it but his movies are boorish. L'Age d'Or doesn't tell a story so much as it blasts the trendy Fascism in Europe at the time it was made. At the outset we have to endure Bunuel's obligatory fascination with bugs  in this particular case scorpions which serve as a convenient symbol for human beings yadda yadda yadda. But the movie really gets going when artist Max Ernst leads a derelict platoon of warriors straight out of Sir John Falstaff's army on a mission to wipe out a bunch of bishops. Cinema has rarely shown futility and sheer tiredness in such a funny way.But as you'd might expect from a pair of demented Surrealists the movie veers off toward a whole series of non sequiturs. L'Age d'Or eventually decides to be about repressed sexuality we're introduced to a pair of lustmaddened lovers writhing and drooling all over each other in the dust during some sort of civic ceremony purporting to open a new golden age. The police and other good bourgeoisie separate the horny pair the Man Gaston Modot who film snobs will recognize as the jealous gamekeeper in Renoir's Rules of the Game gets dragged off to modernday Rome but he easily eludes his captors and winds up at a fancy party of a decadent Duke who happens to be the father of the object of his lust. He reunites with the Woman but not before slapping the hell out of her mother who has made the unforgivable mistake of accidentally spilling some liqueur on his coat sleeve. . . .Look  one can't summarize the plot of this madness one can only mention his or her favorite moments. My personal favorite when a father blows his own annoying kid away with a hunting rifle. Then after the kid's obviously dead he shoots the poor little bugger again and the force of the bullet shoves the body out of the camera's frame. What can I say  I find this sort of thing funny. Most will not undoubtedly. But I think everyone can appreciate the fevered eroticism on display when the Man and the Woman reunite in the Duke's garden. When they're not sucking on each other's fingers jamming their hands into each other's mouths as if their mouths were jelly jars they're sucking on the toes of an expressionless marble statue the Bunuelian obsession with feet was lifelong. This is all weird and funny but it does tie in with Bunuel's original point which is that we're as driven by appetites as your average scorpion. Fidelity is something we force on ourselves. Bunuel and Dali playing with symbols are free to make their characters free of constraint.Despite the anythinggoes ethos of the film it's still hard for modern audiences to understand why it caused such a stir 75 years ago. The images are startling discreetly pornographic even but hardly beyond the pale. But the movie was banned within weeks and Bunuel was virtually exiled to Mexico in the aftermath. Dali a cunning survivor disavowed the film soon after its release. Can it be that Bunuel and Dali brought all this trouble on themselves simply by making fun of rich people and bourgeois conventions? The answer is apparently Yes. No doubt the cretins who run the current government in the United States would've empathized with those longago Fascist arbiters of good taste who attempted to destroy this movie forever. After all who's richer or more bourgeois than the Bush Administration? Yeah  as long as religious hypocrites exist there shall always be a place for Bunuel's L'Age d'Or all right. 8 stars out of 10.".

Bunuel had a lifelong grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest almost like what you'd expect from a smartaleck 18yearold in film class. The last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nosethumbing at religion.If you read the scholars regarding this slowpaced occasionally amusing film it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church's fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.There are a few moments where you might cry Aha! surrealism! a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window a poor model a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pit...hard to tell in BW. The rest is forgettable selfindulgence. Unfortunately Bunuel was still chasing the same bogeymen through the rest of his career Viridiana Discreet Charm....

	schema:reviewBody "In Vietnam 1973 the military top brass is told to free all the P.O.W.'s. In order to do this effectively they call in Col. James Cooper Carradine who naturally is The Best. Of course he also has a bad attitude and is getting on in years. Once he finds the prisoners one of which is Johnston James all the men lead a daring escape through the jungles of 'Nam. Along the way they'll have to fight tons of NVA soldiers evil camp commander Capt. Vinh Mako among other pitfalls while fighting to stay alive and recapture some gold bars. Can they do it? By this time Cannon had already made Missing In Action 1984 so they probably figured 'why not try 'P.O.W.'? Instead of Chuck Norris or Michael Dudikoff their main staples they opted for David Carradine. He's not quite as belligerent and surly as he is in Future Force 1989 and Future Zone 1990 but roles like this where he's put in the driver's seat as an action hero with terse dialogue certainly paved the way for those. His dialogue pretty much consists of soundbites such as I'm going' back for 'em and Everybody goes home. This might be less noticeable if he had some nonbumperstickerlike dialogue anywhere else in the movie but he doesn't. As far as his attitude i.e angry it seems Cannon will just give you a more assertive demeanor at times. For example for Chain Of Command 1994 they probably just said to Dudikoff be angry. We're guessing they did the same here for Carradine.POW The Escape is your basic exploding huthelicopterguard tower movie where people are constantly firing machine guns under the green foliage. But you gotta admit those huts had it coming. There's the Prerequisite Torture as well. Not of the huts of the humans. Thus the movie is quite repetitive as there isn't enough material here to properly fill a 90 minute feature. Not that any of this is bad it just feels very very familiar.As far as the rest of the cast there are some familiar faces we are fans of Mako and he does a decent job as the commander who might secretly have an affinity for America. Steve James remains one of the most underrated actors of the 80's and beyond and his presence livens things up considerably. In the background doing small roles like G.I. 4 and Soldier at Fuel Depot are Willie Williams Henry Strzalkowski and Cris Aguilar. Among the smaller players is fan favorite John Barrett who is also credited as a stunt coordinator. If you watch any of these Philippinesset actioners these names will ring a bell. But none of them can possibly top Carradine when in a moment of inspiration he takes an American flag in danger of burning down  this is during a firefight no less  takes it off the pole puts it over his shoulders and continues killing badguys with his machine gun! He's literally draped in the flag as he fights those stupid stupid commies. God bless the 80's.Released by Media on VHS and laser videodisc! POW The Escape is standard jungle action with maybe a few blips of interest within that framework.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "As I write this review we are fortunate to have all three stars from Young Man With a Horn still with us. All three of them give magnificent performances. Too bad the story was such a cop out.The novel that this is based on has the character of Rick Martin die in the end just like Bix Beiderbecke on whom he was based does at the tender age of 28. It would have been so much more powerful and more effective had the film had that ending. It's such a let down after a great trio of players give their all.Doris Day gets to sing three great standards With A Song In My Heart The Very Thought of You and Too Marvelous for Words. I believe this is the first film in which she shows real dramatic potential as the band vocalist in love with the cornetist who can't find inner peace.Kirk Douglas is in a role that could have been written just for him on the screen. I can't imagine anyone doing it better. It's just his kind of part all the rage inside him because of the lousy childhood and unable to articulate it except through his horn. His heights and his downfall are believable and real but no one could have made the audience accept the tacked on happy ending.Lauren Bacall was a friend of Kirk Douglas's from New York when they were both struggling drama students. She encouraged him to come to Hollywood after she made it big. This is their only film together. It's also the first time she played a bad girl. She's a self indulgent heiress who looks at life as a series of kicks to be had. She makes Douglas fall for her big time and then treats him shabbily when they're married. This is one of the earliest examples of lesbianism portrayed on the screen. She leaves him to go off to Europe with a woman who she met in school and check out the glances Bacall gives her new flame.I don't think Bacall is a lesbian however. To her an affair with a female is just another thing to indulge herself with. My guess is when the novelty wears off this woman will get the Douglas treatment.To give it a real jazz flavor Young Man With a Horn also features Hoagy Carmichael who knew Bix Beiderbecke in real life and it is he who narrates the story from his perspective. Look also for good performances by Jerome Cowan as a character based on Paul Whiteman and Juano Hernandez as the jazz cornetist who teaches young Rick Martin as played by Orley Lindgren to play. Hernandez's character is based on a lot of people most probably King Oliver is the closest model.Young Man in a Horn is a stand up double of a film. It would have been an exciting in the park home run if they had kept the ending as is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Young Man With A Horn is inspired by the sad life of jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke a sad life because Bix would succumb to alcoholism and pass away at the age of 28.Rick Martin Kirk Douglas is the fictional character of the piece the film is told in flashbacks of Martin's life thru the nostalgic reminiscence of pianist Smoke Willoughby Hoagy Carmichael.Young Man With A Horn is very much a film of three parts the first half firmly establishes Rick's love of music from an early age his tutelage from mentor Art Hazzard Juan Hernandez is fully formed and completely fleshes out Rick's character. We are then privy to the middle part of his life as he forms a bond with Smoke and band singer Jo Jordon an ebullient and charming Doris Day Rick is happy his love of music taking priority over outside interests but then Amy North a swishing Lauren Bacall enters his life and here the film switches firmly into a melodramatic piece and certainly it's a switch that pays off as the end credit looms large.The directing from Michael Curtiz is very good and the photography from Ted McCord captures the smoke filled nature of jazz clubs perfectly whilst the acting from all is never less than above average. Some may find it hard to accept Kirk Douglas in the leading role and certainly at first glance he looks oddly out of place with a trumpet at his lips but he studied under trumpeter Larry Sullivan and convinces as a viable trumpet player the actual music is dubbed by Harry James. The music of course is excellent and as long as one is prepared for the melodramatic turn of events Young Man With A Horn is a very rewarding piece just remember that it is however far from being a true biographical story of the tragic Bix Beiderbecke. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Young Man With A Horn is inspired by the sad life of jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke a sad life because Bix would succumb to alcoholism and pass away at the age of 28.Rick Martin Kirk Douglas is the fictional character of the piece the film is told in flashbacks of Martin's life thru the nostalgic reminiscence of pianist Smoke Willoughby Hoagy Carmichael.Young Man With A Horn is very much a film of three parts the first half firmly establishes Rick's love of music from an early age his tutelage from mentor Art Hazzard Juan Hernandez is fully formed and completely fleshes out Rick's character. We are then privy to the middle part of his life as he forms a bond with Smoke and band singer Jo Jordon an ebullient and charming Doris Day Rick is happy his love of music taking priority over outside interests but then Amy North a swishing Lauren Bacall enters his life and here the film switches firmly into a melodramatic piece and certainly it's a switch that pays off as the end credit looms large.The directing from Michael Curtiz is very good and the photography from Ted McCord captures the smoke filled nature of jazz clubs perfectly whilst the acting from all is never less than above average. Some may find it hard to accept Kirk Douglas in the leading role and certainly at first glance he looks oddly out of place with a trumpet at his lips but he studied under trumpeter Larry Sullivan and convinces as a viable trumpet player the actual music is dubbed by Harry James. The music of course is excellent and as long as one is prepared for the melodramatic turn of events Young Man With A Horn is a very rewarding piece just remember that it is however far from being a true biographical story of the tragic Bix Beiderbecke. 810";

Director Michael Curtiz once again shows himself a master of screen biography albeit highly fictionalized in this case. His flair for capturing urban nightlife is sublime as he has an intuitive understanding of the lonely moods that city people go through their sudden changes in fortune for reasons they scarcely understand and the inability of anyone really to get a grip on modern life.Miscast as a musician though he is Douglas is quite good with the darker and more volatile aspects of his character's personality. Lauren Bacall is far less good as his society girlfriend with a lesbian streak Doris Day marginally better as his True Love. There are some excellent supporting bits by Juano Hernandez and Jerome Cowan. This is overall a satisfying film too slick for its own good in parts it's not the best of its director's works but it's in the high middle range.".

In a sense it's a case study of a man obsessed by the only true meaning he has found in life.Kirk Douglas plays Rick Martin who was an orphan left to fend for himself. His mother was an alcoholic. He would roam the streets at night looking for a sense of meaning. One night he came upon a nightclub and was taken back by the music. Through the window he heard the sound that would change his life.The trumpet player Art Hazzard played by Juano Hernandez Befriended Rick. He taught him to play the trumpet and became a father figure to him. From that point on Rick lived and breathed the trumpet.As he grew older he put his skills to good use and joined several bands. He never really found meaning in the style of the day. His true love was jazz. He would work all day then play all night in the black Jazz clubs. Along the way he made a few friends.One girl of interest was Jo Jordan Played by Doris Day. She was the lead singer with the swing band he was working for. Jo later introduced Rick to a friend of hers by the name of Amy North Lauren Bacall. Rick was fascinated with her. He really couldn't put a finger on it but there was something about her.Lauren Bacall was wonderful as a woman born into wealth yet totally empty inside. She is a woman with no direction who starts things in life but is never motivated to finish what she starts. That is a bad recipe for Rick who has found a calling in life but has become obsessed with it. The two are poison for each other. Amy's jealousy leads her to despise Ricks musical gift. The fact that Amy won't respect his obsession leads Rick to the bottle. Things go from bad to worse.This was a wonderful film with actors who were at the top of their game. It really doesn't get any better then this. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rick Martin is a young boy who finds the love for music after his mother dies. The trumpet becomes his instrument and he learns to play it from an old master called Art Hazzard. Young Man with a Horn from 1950 is directed by Michael Curtiz. Rick Martin is first played by Orley Lindgren then by Kirk Douglas. Lauren Bacall plays his troubled wife Amy North. Doris Day is the singer friend Jo Jordan. Hoagy Carmichael is the pianist friend Willie 'Smoke' Willoughby. Juano Hernandez portrays Art Hazzard. The cast is quite superb. Douglas does excellent job in the lead. Especially when Rick starts having problems with the alcohol then Kirk really has to act. And that he does really well! I think the movie becomes more interesting when it portrays all those problems this young man starts having. Problems with marriage drinking. When it's not just about music and how good he is at it. Bacall's performance is very film noir which works fairly good in this movie. Day is very touching in the caring she has for her friend. And she can really sing which we all knew! If you're a fan of the main trio if you like good music if you like drama you should see this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rick Martin is a young boy who finds the love for music after his mother dies. The trumpet becomes his instrument and he learns to play it from an old master called Art Hazzard. Young Man with a Horn from 1950 is directed by Michael Curtiz. Rick Martin is first played by Orley Lindgren then by Kirk Douglas. Lauren Bacall plays his troubled wife Amy North. Doris Day is the singer friend Jo Jordan. Hoagy Carmichael is the pianist friend Willie 'Smoke' Willoughby. Juano Hernandez portrays Art Hazzard. The cast is quite superb. Douglas does excellent job in the lead. Especially when Rick starts having problems with the alcohol then Kirk really has to act. And that he does really well! I think the movie becomes more interesting when it portrays all those problems this young man starts having. Problems with marriage drinking. When it's not just about music and how good he is at it. Bacall's performance is very film noir which works fairly good in this movie. Day is very touching in the caring she has for her friend. And she can really sing which we all knew! If you're a fan of the main trio if you like good music if you like drama you should see this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is pre Bacall and during and after Bacall. The pre part is much better. It's not Bacall's fault. The best part of this film comes near the end. If you recall shortly after Art's death and his breakup with Amy Rick embarrasses himself on the bandstand one night and the bandleader follows him to the dressing room to give him a severe reprimand. He tells Rick that the boys in his band don't drink while their working. Rick replies that he has to drink to listen to his kind of music or he'd go nuts. The leader retorts that Rick has done pretty well with his kind of music and who ever heard of him before he gave him a break. Then the leader says what do you think this is a spasm band like Art Hazzard's. Then Rick replies with what every real musician has wanted to say to every leader fan critic mother inlaw well basically anyone who just doesn't have a clue about music. Any music not just jazz.Symphonic musicians want to say the same thing to some idiot conductor for example. Rick says Why you stupid....if that tin ear of yours could really hear the kind of music that Art Hazzard was playing you'd go out and shoot yourself. That's what the story the characters of Rick and Smoke and Beetoven for that matter is really all about. Smoke sums it up later when he says something like you know who buys records 14 year old girls to learn the words. The only guys who care about the music are the guys who are doing it. Only a dedicated musician and that's the tragedy understands what's going on up there. That's the frustration. Of course it used to be a little different back when this film was made because at least then people put a priority on at least learning an instrument. It was considered important to a person's growth and education. Shari Lewis the late puppetteer creater of lamb chop once said that Music is not secondary. It is as important as the three r's reading writing and rithmatic. To further illustrate I recall viewing one of the local news stations in New York . On their own the stars and crew of the broadcast decided to make up their own top ten list of the greatest songs ever. There was not one song on that list that pre dated 1965. Imagine totally ignored were the songs of Gershwin Kern Rodgers and HartHammerstein Vernon Duke Cole Porter etc. By the completion of the list I was so disgusted I wanted to say the same thing to them that Rick said. Why you stupid.... One reviewer on this site expressed that he guessed you have to be a musician to really understand this movie. He is probably right but maybe you don't have to be a professsional some first hand knowledge might at least be helpful. I have known many horror stories like Rick's . Not only Bix died young but Fats Navarro and Bunny Berigan were also great trumpet players who died young of alcoholism. Let's not forget Mozart as well. A very young friend of mine Wes Norris piano player died at the age of 28 from the same affliction. I could go on. But you are probably glad that I won't. Musicians while on the bandstand have amusing ways of dealing with the ignorance of leaders fans etc. The musicians have substitute names for some of the songs they hate. When for instance the leader would call out Memories it is referred to as Mammaries. Feelings is known as Ceilings. Of course nicknames are also given to songs that they like. I only have eyes for you is I only have ICE for you and Cry me a river is FRY me a LIVER. And I can't tell you how many collective groans went up when ever In the Mood had to be played. Yes! In the mood was a favorite of many a musician in his youth but as they matured they grew out of it. Of course the groan was partly due to the constant requests for it. When sometime in the future  historians look back on the current period they will call itwith the exception of salsa the dark ages of music. Even the musicians or at least a great many of them don't know what they are doing. And you can take that to the bank. Many of todays artists wouldn't even be able to play what was heard in this film. That's because this film's music is so much more complicated than the music of the last forty years and it takes so much more virtuosity to play a non electrical instrument. The electronics of the new music is very limited in color tone dynamics and variety of sound. This relatively new emphasis on electricityakin to special effects in the movies is responsible for a good deal of the ignorance around us. It's like when some 14 year old reviewer says that the greatest movie of all time is Jaws or Star Wars III when he's never even heard of Sunset Bouelevard. In the movie Barbershop Cedric the Entertainer tells Ice T that's the trouble with your whole generation you have no history. The fine musician knows whom and what has come before him just like Rick knew Art. Miles knew Dizzy and Dizzy knew Eldridge and Eldridge knew Louie and Louie knew Oliver. Mozart knew Bach and Beetoven knew Mozart. etc. Charlie Parker knew Stravinsky and Leonard Bernstein knew the great Louie Armstrong. I wonder what Snoop Dog knows?".

It has a luminosity and a beauty that has rarely been equalled never excelled in blackandwhite picturemaking. This is one of the top ten most artistically photographed blackandwhite films of all time. In fact it is so consistently beautiful and lovely to look at and photographed throughout in the same consistently backlit style it's easy to pick out the two or three brief scenes Mr McCord did not photograph and were presumably added after the film was finished.The offscreen narration  a popular device when the film was made cf. Red Badge of Courage  was evidently an afterthought  and a poor one at that. The narration does nothing for the film and the quality of the writing is even more hackneyed cliched and given to overstating the obvious than some of the dialogue and equally important the obviously tacked on upbeat ending.The second major quality the film posseses is the trumpetplaying of Harry James so skilled it needs no further backing here.The third item is the quality of the acting  Douglas is ideally cast and Bacall making a late entrance comes across most convincingly in a rare unsympathetic part. The dramatic demands on Miss Day are much lighter but she too acquits herself honorably. Hoagy is good  his part has been built up his one song being added after the film had already wrapped  but the film's outstanding support performance comes from Juano Hernandez who runs the emotional gamut from confidante and advisor to dependant and admirer with his usual dignity and assurance.Cutiz's direction presents some admirable touches  the scene in which Bacall is introduced walking away from the camera and then having her face relected in a mirror as she turns around  but some of the acting is very obviously staged and stiff. The often florid dialogue doesn't help. Despite the earnestness of its acting the film often lacks interest and conviction. Sometimes it seems terribly wellmeaning but dull. It lacks that sense of involvement the feeling that we are seeing not a staged picture but taking a vicarious and involving part in reallife drama. It's curious that a movie so wellmade and artistically crafted in many departments should present itself at the same time as so obviously just a film.OTHER VIEWS Love to have that soundtrack in my collection! Notice the way McCord's lighting switches from the stark gray tones in the early Doris Day scenes to the black in Lauren Bacall's episodes as well as frequent effective use of mirrors in these sequences. Yes the craftsmen did their best to build up the film and it's not their fault that the script is just not as gripping in the Bacall interludes as it is in the childhood and Day scenes. Some great location filming the kid crossing the railway tracks contributes to making some of the film's most memorable images Douglas dashing down the hospital corridor collapsing on a street in New York etc.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will start off with a comparison that may seem strange in this movie Rick Martin is the Bobby Jones of music. Jones never turned pro because he felt that playing golf for money would compromise his sheer love of the game. Rick Martin did play for money but he hated it. He liked to play for the sheer love of the trumpet and the music he made with it. He was never happy being bound by the notes written on the sheet music.I came to this movie with a particular leaning because I have been a trumpet player for almost 50 years but I had never seen this movie in its entirety until today on a great copy on DVD with Dolby sound. It is all the more wonderful for the score and the trumpet playing of Harry James who always seemed to push music out of the horn rather than blowing it. It is also great to see Hoagy Carmichale as Smoke the pianist who narrates the movie and at the beginning talks straight into the camera. A fine movie best appreciated by those who know the struggle one has with music.Rick Martin was orphaned early and moved around with his older sister. Mostly aimless as a child one day he heard piano music in a church and that afternoon picked it up on his own. Soon after he was wandering into a music store and asked which instrument was the cheapest and it was the trumpet for 9 so he worked as a bowling pin setter to earn some money. About then he happened to hear a group of black musicians playing and the trumpet player took him under his wing taught him how to play and helped him buy his own trumpet.The movie is about the adult Rick Martin played wonderfully by a 30something Kirk Douglas in his prime. A trumpet player with a wonderful sound and a great style but not very well rounded and incomplete in his social graces. Two women come into his life the sweet Jo Jordan singer played by a 20something Doris Day and the harsh confused Psychiatry student Amy played by 20something Lauren Bacall.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Rick is fine although socially isolated as long as he has his horn and his music. Pretty and sweet Jo seems to be interested in him but he is oblivious. When Jo introduces him to Amy he doesn't understand a thing she talks about but is intrigued by this unusual woman. They even marry. But with Amy he becomes angry and confused and a drunkard and loses his way musically as well as socially. The death of his mentor is part of his wakeup call as is his messing up in a recording session backing Jo. He smashes his trumpet and wanders the streets eventually buying a damaged trumpet for 75 cents just to have a companion. With Amy gone and after alcohol rehabilitation Rick gets his chops back and the movie ends with him backing Jo beautifully in the recording session.".

	schema:headline " Day and Douglass give great performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I saw this film I didn't think of Doris Day as a serious actress so seeing her performances in both Young Man with a Horn and I'll See You in My Dreams gave me a pleasant surprise. Doris Day is perfect in this film for the character of Jo Jordan the bigband singer who falls for Rick Martin Kurt Douglass. This is almost a tourdeforce for Day. It is not a comedy and she acts accordingly. We see her anguish upon realizing that Martin who is the protagonist is smitten with her acquaintance Amy North Lauren Bacall. Douglass plays a trumpetplayer who is aware of his amazing gift and is careful with himself that is until he meets Bacall's confused character. The story is quite interesting based on the true story of a gifted trumpet player who died of alcoholism at the age of 28. The movie stays pretty true to the real story with a few elaborations. Martin is an orphan who is taught the trumpet and almost raised by a black trumpeter by the name of Art Hazzard Juano Hernandez. He grows up to be a great talent and plays in big bands for money then plays his own kind of music til the wee hours for himself. He is said to speak through his trumpet by the film's narrator Smoke Hoagy Carmichael. Martin carries his horn around with him everywhere and is lost without it. Day's character tells him that people will refer to him as the young man with a horn because he refuses to part with it. Bacall's character refers to the horn as Martin's alter ego.   The supporting cast is great  Day Carmichael and Hernandez are terrific. Douglass was not the first choice to play the main character but he does a good job. We see his naivete at the beginning and then his clear anguish at his downfall. Bacall is the antagonist of the film. Her character is not perfect but symbolizes wealth and everything that Martin is not. I was not blown away by her performance she seemed to me rather wooden. The viewer really is given no insight into her reasoning or her character. I couldn't understand her motivation at all and I think her portrayal takes away from how great the film might have been. However I think the performances of Douglass and the supporting cast are worth watching the movie for. The cinematography is also very interesting especially one scene at a train station. The film is not sappy but is not perfect either. Overall I would give it 2 and 12 stars out of 4.".

It looks wonderful with a stylish visual look with inspired film noirish touches. Curtiz allows atmosphere and emotional power to come through and come through they do. The music is one of 'Young Man with a Horn's' best assets being a singer and cellist this component has always been important to me and is always mentioned in my reviews. Not just the superb playing of Harry James but some great songs sung by Doris Day that are also beautifully staged. The Very Thought of You Too Marvellous for Words I May be Wrong and With a Song in my Heart all terrific as are the arrangements of The Man I Love and Get Happy.The film is intelligently scripted without getting overheated and never feels bland. The story is absorbing and enough of the sordid and sleazy nature comes through as well as the emotional power.Kirk Douglas is outstanding in the lead role particularly in the tormented scenes. Lauren Bacall also excels as does a cast against type Doris Day. Hoagy Carmichael is smooth and warmhearted and Juano Hernandez gives his role great dignity.All in all very powerful even when softened in comparison to what it's based on. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " The Greatest Film About Jazz";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never been able to discover why the title was changed from Young Man with a Horn to Young Man of Music when this film was shown in Britain. Did the British Board of Film Censors take exception to that rather obvious doubleentendre in the original title something which unaccountably escaped the notice of their American counterparts? Or was the change made in the interests of musical accuracy? The hero after all does not actually play the horn at least not in the sense in which Classical musicians would understand the term. I know that jazz trumpeters and also saxophonists sometimes refer to their instruments as horns but this is primarily an American usage which might have confused British audiences. In Australia it became Young Man with a Trumpet.The film follows the rise fall and rise again of a jazz trumpeter named Rick Martin. Besides Martin himself it also focuses on four people who play important roles in his life. These are Art Hazzard the man who teaches Rick how to play the trumpet his close friend the piano player Smoke Willoughby Jo Jordan a singer who falls in love with him and his wife Amy. It has been suggested that Rick was based upon Bix Beiderbecke.Unusually for a film from the early 1950s when Hollywood still operated an unofficial colourbar and black actors were mostly confined to minor roles often as domestic servants this one features a major black character in the shape of Art. Art himself an outstanding jazzman is not just Rick's teacher and mentor but also in a sense his adoptive father. Rick is an orphan who never knew his biological father and whose mother died when he was a child. The name Art may be short for Arthur but I wonder if its use here was meant to imply Art's artistic nature. A theme of the film is the schism between two very different forms of jazz. There is the predominantly white music of the big bands and dance orchestras. This is a conservative style in that the musicians need to keep to a strict rhythm that people can dance to and play exactly what is written in the score. And then there is the traditional jazz favoured mostly by black musicians much freer than the big band sound both in the sense that the rhythm is less strict and in the sense that it allows the musicians more scope for improvisation and experimentation. Although Rick is white the influence of Art means that he is instinctively drawn to this black music but he nevertheless has to earn his living playing in an orchestra. There is no money to be made from trad jazz. The differences between these two forms of music are reflected in the differences between the two women in Rick's life although the parallels are not always exact. Jo a sweetly innocent girlnextdoor type who shares Rick's passion for jazz can be seen as the safe predictable conservative option. The beautiful sophisticated Amy who is studying to become a psychiatrist seems to Rick to be more of a free spirit spontaneous unpredictable and dangerous even though she has little interest in music. Despite their widely differing personalities the two women are initially friends although their friendship does not survive their rivalry over Rick. Paradoxically Amy both looks down on Jo and envies her. She says of her It must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and know just which door you're going to walk through. She's so terribly normal.It is precisely because Amy is not terribly normal that Rick marries her and it is for the same reason that their marriage proves a failure. Even a free spirit like Rick needs some order and stability in his life and a woman like Amy who has deep psychological issues due to the suicide of her mother is precisely the wrong person to provide it. It is also suggested that Amy may have lesbian tendencies although the Production Code meant that this suggestion had to be very veiled. So veiled in fact that Lauren Bacall never realised she was supposed to be playing a lesbian. The failure of his marriage sets Rick on a downward spiral in which he abandons his career and descends into alcoholism.There are a number of excellent acting performances including Juano Hernndez as Art and Hoagy Carmichael as Smoke. Carmichael was best known as a musician but he made a number of acting appearances generally playing a musician. I have not always been the greatest fan of Doris Day but here she is excellent as the naive but wholesome Jo as is Bacall as the huskyvoiced sophisticate Amy. Both seem absolutely made for their roles to the extent that I could not imagine any other actress playing them. I could certainly not for example envisage Bacall as Jo or even less Day as Amy. And then of course there is Kirk Douglas as Rick this may not be his most celebrated performance but it is certainly one of his best seeming to prefigure another film Lust for Life about Van Gogh in which he played a conflictridden artist.Other excellent features include the jazz score the trumpeter Harry James actually performed the music Douglas is shown playing and Michael Curtiz's striking photography of the New York urban scene I wondered if this was an influence on Woody Allen's Manhattan. The one weakness was the ending the story of Rick's rise and fall is told in detail but the story of his rise again in which he kicks his drink habit and rediscovers his love of both Jo and jazz seemed very rushed something tacked on to provide the expected happy ending. Overall however this is the best film I know about jazz music. 910".

	onyx:emotionText "I have never been able to discover why the title was changed from Young Man with a Horn to Young Man of Music when this film was shown in Britain. Did the British Board of Film Censors take exception to that rather obvious doubleentendre in the original title something which unaccountably escaped the notice of their American counterparts? Or was the change made in the interests of musical accuracy? The hero after all does not actually play the horn at least not in the sense in which Classical musicians would understand the term. I know that jazz trumpeters and also saxophonists sometimes refer to their instruments as horns but this is primarily an American usage which might have confused British audiences. In Australia it became Young Man with a Trumpet.The film follows the rise fall and rise again of a jazz trumpeter named Rick Martin. Besides Martin himself it also focuses on four people who play important roles in his life. These are Art Hazzard the man who teaches Rick how to play the trumpet his close friend the piano player Smoke Willoughby Jo Jordan a singer who falls in love with him and his wife Amy. It has been suggested that Rick was based upon Bix Beiderbecke.Unusually for a film from the early 1950s when Hollywood still operated an unofficial colourbar and black actors were mostly confined to minor roles often as domestic servants this one features a major black character in the shape of Art. Art himself an outstanding jazzman is not just Rick's teacher and mentor but also in a sense his adoptive father. Rick is an orphan who never knew his biological father and whose mother died when he was a child. The name Art may be short for Arthur but I wonder if its use here was meant to imply Art's artistic nature. A theme of the film is the schism between two very different forms of jazz. There is the predominantly white music of the big bands and dance orchestras. This is a conservative style in that the musicians need to keep to a strict rhythm that people can dance to and play exactly what is written in the score. And then there is the traditional jazz favoured mostly by black musicians much freer than the big band sound both in the sense that the rhythm is less strict and in the sense that it allows the musicians more scope for improvisation and experimentation. Although Rick is white the influence of Art means that he is instinctively drawn to this black music but he nevertheless has to earn his living playing in an orchestra. There is no money to be made from trad jazz. The differences between these two forms of music are reflected in the differences between the two women in Rick's life although the parallels are not always exact. Jo a sweetly innocent girlnextdoor type who shares Rick's passion for jazz can be seen as the safe predictable conservative option. The beautiful sophisticated Amy who is studying to become a psychiatrist seems to Rick to be more of a free spirit spontaneous unpredictable and dangerous even though she has little interest in music. Despite their widely differing personalities the two women are initially friends although their friendship does not survive their rivalry over Rick. Paradoxically Amy both looks down on Jo and envies her. She says of her It must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and know just which door you're going to walk through. She's so terribly normal.It is precisely because Amy is not terribly normal that Rick marries her and it is for the same reason that their marriage proves a failure. Even a free spirit like Rick needs some order and stability in his life and a woman like Amy who has deep psychological issues due to the suicide of her mother is precisely the wrong person to provide it. It is also suggested that Amy may have lesbian tendencies although the Production Code meant that this suggestion had to be very veiled. So veiled in fact that Lauren Bacall never realised she was supposed to be playing a lesbian. The failure of his marriage sets Rick on a downward spiral in which he abandons his career and descends into alcoholism.There are a number of excellent acting performances including Juano Hernndez as Art and Hoagy Carmichael as Smoke. Carmichael was best known as a musician but he made a number of acting appearances generally playing a musician. I have not always been the greatest fan of Doris Day but here she is excellent as the naive but wholesome Jo as is Bacall as the huskyvoiced sophisticate Amy. Both seem absolutely made for their roles to the extent that I could not imagine any other actress playing them. I could certainly not for example envisage Bacall as Jo or even less Day as Amy. And then of course there is Kirk Douglas as Rick this may not be his most celebrated performance but it is certainly one of his best seeming to prefigure another film Lust for Life about Van Gogh in which he played a conflictridden artist.Other excellent features include the jazz score the trumpeter Harry James actually performed the music Douglas is shown playing and Michael Curtiz's striking photography of the New York urban scene I wondered if this was an influence on Woody Allen's Manhattan. The one weakness was the ending the story of Rick's rise and fall is told in detail but the story of his rise again in which he kicks his drink habit and rediscovers his love of both Jo and jazz seemed very rushed something tacked on to provide the expected happy ending. Overall however this is the best film I know about jazz music. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "As a teenager I had already heard about Emilio Fernandez and Gabriel Figueroa that together created the masterpieces of the Mexican cinema. They were legend. But for a long time seeing their films remained wishful thinking . Only later when it became possible to buy films through the internet that I decided to buy one of Emilio Fernandez's films. My informations were that his most creative period run more or less from 1943 to 1950 and Rio Escondido was one of his important films and was being offered for a cheap price. So I bought it and I had great expectations.I was disappointed! Why? There are so many good things to say about the film! The cinematography is gorgeous like other reviews already pointed out  the use of the arid landscape the sky and clouds filling the screen. People and landscape faces of peasants in closeup scenes of crowds in grief and anger  the individual the collective and nature the silent witness. Somehow it feels like a Rivera's painting transposed into a cosmic frame.The plot is also interesting a teacher Rosaura Maria Felix is called by the president. He gives her a mission  to go to a small village called Rio Escondido and teach the children the alphabet history etc and prepare them to be the citizens of a new Mexico. When after a long travel she arrives in Rio Escondido she will have to fight many obstacles and the principal one is the big landowner that practically owns the town. There will be a titanic fight with an ending worthy of Greek drama.This was a time when the heroic years of the Mexican Revolution were still fresh in the minds of the Mexican people. The political party in power was officially a revolutionary one and in fact that was its name Partido Revolucionario Institucional PRI and idealism in spite of all was still present in many people outside and inside the government. This film was clearly conceived as a propaganda piece and there lies the rub. A propaganda film and I mean propaganda not in a derogatory way can be excellent Ivan the Terrible can vouch for that as long as it is emotionally sincere and artistically accomplished. Well I can say that Rio Escondido succeeded in these two levels.But I think that Rio Escondido failed in its portrayal of the teacher Rosaura the character around whom all the action revolves. She is portrayed as a saint one could call her Saint Rosaura who is invested by God I mean the President of Mexico who is not shown in the film  we can only see his shadow or his grizzled head seen from the back of the chair  his solemn voice tells Saint Rosaura what her mission will be To Fight Ignorance and Evil. Saint Rosaura bathed in tears of emotion leaves for Rio Escondido to fulfill her mission. She is portrayed in such a saintly way that she loses her human traits  no traces of humor or human insecurity. When she speaks she seems to be delivering political speeches. And the worst of it is that it is not even funny. She's so virtuous that she becomes a bore. You need to have flesh  blood characters with whom you can in some way identify someone who is human who has made mistakes even Petro Infante himself in Nosotros los pobres is a womanizer and has his failures like the rest of us poor sinners. But Rosaura Salazar is a perfect human being and the film loses much of its punch as a result.Rio Escondido is a film to see just for its extraordinary visual beauty. If you want to see it turn off the sound and put some music of your choice on. I give seven stars because of the visual treat.".

She is portrayed in such a saintly way that she loses her human traits  no traces of humor or human insecurity. When she speaks she seems to be delivering political speeches. And the worst of it is that it is not even funny. She's so virtuous that she becomes a bore. You need to have flesh  blood characters with whom you can in some way identify someone who is human who has made mistakes even Petro Infante himself in Nosotros los pobres is a womanizer and has his failures like the rest of us poor sinners. But Rosaura Salazar is a perfect human being and the film loses much of its punch as a result.Rio Escondido is a film to see just for its extraordinary visual beauty. If you want to see it turn off the sound and put some music of your choice on. I give seven stars because of the visual treat.";

It speaks volumes for all the people involved in the production of this movie.The Great Depression was the right background when movies like this were made. In a way it was an escape from the harsh realities of the times America was going through. The public went to the movies to see their favorite stars that were shown in such a glamorous roles. How could anyone not admire the great Fred Astaire always impeccably dressed? Or how could not any woman in the theater envy Ms. Rogers's beauty and easy grace? That era made it right for Hollywood to show the world a sensitivity and sophistication that only few rich types were able to enjoy in real life while the rest was trying to eke out a life of whatever work they could find.The musical numbers are amazing. The Continental alone must have blown the budget of the picture. Imagine how much it would cost today to have all those dancers in a sound stage! Not only that but in that lengthy number there are at least four changes of costumes for the women. Also he is delightful singing Looking for a Needle in a Haystack.

Erik Rhodes is one of the best things in the film his Signor Tonetti injects a funny shot into the movie.

Don't miss it...this is one of the highlight AstaireRogers efforts.";

Ginger is her usual bouncy self all wisecracks and big eyes and good on her feet.  They're ably supported by Edward Everett Horton as 'Aunt' Egbert Alice Brady the towering matriach Rogers' aunt Eric Blore as an irritating waiter who likes talking about rocks and playing with words Erik Rhodes as a daft Italian and Betty Grable as a hotel guest who has a terrific number with Horton 'Let's Kknock Kknees'.As you might guess the story revolves around a divorce which might be a gay one in the 1930s definition of the word of course and as so often in this series mistaken identities.  Tiny roles go to William Austin as Rogers' blustering geologist hubby and Lilian Miles an Alice Faye lookalike who gets to reprise 'The Continental' all to herself.This is one of the better entries in the series ably directed by Mark Sandrich and featuring a mix of songs including Cole Porter's 'Night and Day' and the jaunty 'Looking for a Needle in a Haystack'.".

What a great pair the studio that would become defunct in a matter of years had on their hands!In 1933 the pair had proven themselves as second leads in Flying Down to Rio a musical heavily relying on special effects and little else. They stole the show proven with The Carioca the erotically charged dance number which started an American craze of pressing foreheads and even got the Best Song Oscar nod over the supposed show stopping title song. Before Ginger had 42nd Street to her name while Fred had the famous screen test analysis of Can't sing. Can't act. Can dance a little.The Gay Divorcee is the establishing musical of Astaire and Rogers. Silly dated slight even stupid to a certain degree is the entire story. Without a doubt high comedy and immense creativity make up for it. The mistaken identity plot was recycled for Top Hat the following year but it hardly matters. It is littered entirely with hilarity! Writing was never the strongest point of these musicals anyway. The performances were not Oscar calibre but they were publicly loved and it's obviously Astaire and Roger's singing acting and most of all dancing that makes the movie what it is.A top wealth of talent was assembled for the movie. Erik Rhodes is absolutely side splitting as the Italian guy Tonetti wielding the fabulous line Your wife is safe with Tonetti he prefers spaghetti!. Alice Brady is there as Aunt Hortense but Edward Everett Horton is another stand out performer as the lawyer. His fumbling voice provides a character of clumsiness and two seem to go hand in hand. He was definitely one of the best supporting comedians of the 1930s and 1940s in other Astaire and Rogers musicals and movies like Lost Horizon Holiday Here Comes Mr Jordan and Arsenic and Old Lace.Only one song was retained for the filmic version of The Gay Divorcee. The censors even crashed down on the stage's original title The Gay Divorce. Fred performs a great rendition of the immortal Cole Porter song Night and Day. The Continental the Best Song of 1934 is thrown there in the mix too. Other great numbers in there include Looking for a needle in a haystack Don't Let it Bother You and Let's Knock Knees. The latter is performed by a young Betty Grable. This is notable for the only time Edward Everett Horton sings and dances on screen. We can see from the results there's an obvious reason.The stylish period of courtship and even set decoration and costumes evoke great memories of eras gone by. RKO hasn't helped preservation of these technical elements by throwing what always appears to be mediocre sets but it doesn't matter anyway. The whole thing is irresistible spectacular and unforgettable. This is one of the forgotten musicals of the time which has it all.Rating 810".

	schema:headline " Fred  Ginger's first starring role as a team";
	schema:reviewBody "After their hit dancing of the Carioca in Flying Down the Rio RKO gave the teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers a star role in The Gay Divorce in 1934. With few exceptions the plots of the FredGinger films were excuses to get to the important part  the dancing  but the story lines were always pleasant and the casting good. The Gay Divorce was based on a Broadway musical of which the only number retained is Night and Day and it appears that a few of its plot devices were adopted in later AstaireRogers films as well. One such plot device is that of mistaken identity. In this movie Astaire reprising his Broadway role is mistaken for a professional correspondent hired to help Rogers get her divorce. Another device is that at first Ginger is never interested in Fred  that goes here too. And there's a stock cast in these films namely Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore and of course he's always the butler and always very funny. Horton plays Rogers' attorney whose major problem is Rogers' aunt Alice Brady.What can be said about the dancing except that it's glorious? Fred and Ginger dance to Night and Day after Astaire sings it to her. For a supposed nonsinger Astaire could really put over a song  his voice is pleasant and he's so musical  no wonder composers wrote songs for him. Ginger is beautiful and spunky as Mimi a young woman ducking Fred while she's trying to get a divorce. Betty Grable has a bit that showcases her in the number Let's Kknock Kneez. There's also I'm Looking for a Needle in a Haystack delightfully sung and danced by Fred. Astaire's dancing is fantastic throughout.It feels as if about half the picture is taken up with the elaborately staged production number The Continental. In later films of course the dancing would center more around Fred and Ginger but it's a great part of the movie and certainly solidified these two as a top box office pairing.For pure enjoyment there's nothing like watching Astaire  Rogers in these movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Gay Divorce RKO Radio 1934 directed by Mark Sandrich reunites the supporting young couple who supplied the comedy relief and very little dancing to the previous year's success of FLYING DOWN TO RIO RKO 1933. The couple in question are Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. With this being their first starring film musical as a team in reality they are virtually supporting players this time supporting the supporting character actors who seem to be on more than the stars themselves. Even several production numbers are performed by others but Astaire does manage to get at least one big solo spotlight to himself before doing his couple of twists and turns with Rogers. However this doesn't take away from the chemistry they have making this the one to set the pattern for their future films ahead.The plot centers upon Guy Holden Fred Astaire a famous American dancer traveling with his lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald Edward Everett Horton. After a brief stay in Paris they head for London where Egbert finds himself filling in for his attorney father who's away in Scotland. As for Guy he encounters Mimi Glossop Ginger Rogers traveling with her matron aunt Hortense Ditherwell Alice Brady. A situation involving a dress caught in her aunt's luggage leads Guy to help only to accidentally rip it and loaning her his raincoat to cover up her embarrassment leaving her his calling card where to return it. Later Hortense has her unhappily married niece Mimi seek divorce proceedings through Egbert Fitzgerald whom she almost married three exhusbands prior. Egbert takes the case and hires a gigolo Rodolfo Tonetti Erik Rhodes to act as Mimi's hired correspondent so to have her geologist husband Cyril William Austin catch them in the act and agree to a divorce. Before Tonetti accepts the job and not knowing who the client is he is given a secret password Chance is the fool's name for fate a line from one of Guy's shows. When Mimi meets up with Guy again Guy uses that phrase in conversation and stunned that the man she's been avoiding to be working for her attorney she reluctantly invites Guy to her hotel room about the same time Tonetti arrives further complicating matters to the situation.A drawing room farce if ever there was one sometimes amusing often silly with this being typical of 1930s musicals. While essentially a filmed staged play The Gay Dibvorcee does break away from drawing room settings with a car chase and brief street scenery. Taken from the hit play The Gay Divorce 1932 which also starred Astaire with Erik Rhodes and Eric Blore reprising their roles the film succeeds due to the presence of Astaire and Rogers. Of the songs from the stage production only Cole Porter's Night and Day remains.The musical program with new score by Mack Gordon and Harry Revel Con Conrad and Herb Magidson include Don't Let It Bother You sung by French chorus girls followed by a tap dance solo by Fred Astaire Looking for a Needle in a Haystack sung and danced by Astaire Let's Knock Kneez sung by Betty Grable and Edward Everett Horton Night and Day sung by Astaire danced by Astaire and Rogers The Continental sung by Ginger Rogers danced by Astaire and Rogers and others and The Continental finale.While some of the earlier songs are forgettable with Needle for a Haystack inventing the Astaire character Night and Day marks the first Astaire and Rogers dance on screen in its entirety. The Continental a lively song that would be the first Academy Award winning song is lavishly produced interestingly choreographed resembling The Carioca from FLYING DOWN TO RIO it focuses more on couples dressed in black and white attire dancing in montage sequences with time out for singing by Erik Rhodes playing his Constantina and another Lillian Miles who appears sings and is never seen or heard from again before Astaire and Rogers take center stage going into their dance of Spanish Hungarian Viennese and jazz steps before its conclusion.Of the supporting players Alice Brady comes off best with her amusing combination mixture of Margaret Dumont and Gracie Allen. She like her counterpart Edward Everett Horton would become typecast with such roles but later proved her ability as a dramatic actress with her Academy Award winning role of IN OLD CHICAGO 20thFox 1937. Other character actors in support include William Austin briefly appearing as Mimi's husband presenting himself close to the mannerisms of future character actor Billy DeWolfe Eric Blore as the waiter would have his share of comedic scenes with Astaire and Rogers in three additional musicals.Of the ten Astaire and Rogers musicals The Gay Divorce Top Hat 1935 and Shall We Dance? 1937  all with Edward Everett Horton were the most commonly revived from local television through much of the 1960s to the 1980s many substituting the Movietime or CC Television logos over the original RKO Radio during its introduction and closing credits. Aired regularly on American Movie Classics during the stations beginning to 2000 it's also shown frequently on Turner Classic Movies. Availability on home video dating back to the 1980s from the now extinct Nostalgia Merchant to Turner Home Entertainment has paved the way for future generations to discover and enjoy the legend of Astaire and Rogers. The Gay Divorce being one of the twelve feature films to be nominated for Best Picture of 1934 is vintage fun. Even as the latter Astaire and Rogers musicals started to wear thin namely CAREFREE 1938 they never ceased to amaze in what the team can do with their dancing feet. ".

Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her expecting to receive it back with a thankyou note with her name and address but Mimi returns the coat without any card.Meanwhile Hortense seeks out Egbert who is replacing his father in the office expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband the geologist Cyril Glossop William Austin. However Cyril advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accepting the divorce and he suggest to Mimi to hire the correspondent Rodolfo Tonettito Erik Rhodes to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonettito to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy  Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate. Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonettito arrives in her room the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy. The Gay Divorce is a great classic musical with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire shining and dancing. The long song The Continental was awarded with the Oscar of Best Music in 1935 and it is delightful to see the choreography of the dance. In IMDb Trivia there are interesting information about this film that I will not repeat in my review. In addiction Ginger Rogers drives the mighty Duesenberg Model J one of the most popular luxury cars as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe. This car that cost between US 20000.00 to US 25000.00 in 1935 was driven by Clark Gable and Gary Cooper the rare model SSJ 125 Al Capone Greta Garbo Howard Hughes Mae West Tyrone Power among others personalities. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Alegre Divorciada The Gay Divorce".

As the law in England then stood the only reliable way to get a divorce was on the grounds of adultery which required citing a corespondent not 'correspondent' who was required to have been discovered in flagrante delicto with the marriage partner i.e. having breakfast in the same room. This was usually delegated to a professional corespondent such as depicted in this movie who was certainly not a 'wouldbe Latin lover' at all but just a guy hired to do a job and be seen by a chambermaid at a legally appropriate time.Stunning movie perhaps my favourite of the series with the unsurpassed 'Night and Day' number and an excellent largescale production number for the Continental using every inch of a vast RKO Big White Set although it isn't quite as big as it appears in one shot look for a bit of matte work.".

This would eventually lead to a series of films starring them to mostly great box office results. As it was this would be the first time that Astaire would pursue Ms. Rogers with the latter resisting at first before a mistaken identity plot also takes effect. The comedy involving them and supporting players like Alice Brady Edward Everett Horton Eric Blore and Erik Rhodes was funny enough to me but it's really the songs and dances that really makes these movies enjoyable enough for repeat viewings. The Night  Day sequence especially really puts the AstaireRogers dance numbers in full force and the later one called The Continental provides some fun among other dancers not to mention a nowforgotten singer named Lilian Miles. Oh and Betty Grablewho was 17 at the timealso does a fine number called Let's Knock Knees with Horton who seemed game enough. Really all I'll say now is The Gay Divorce is well worth seeing for the emergence of the classic movie dance team of Astaire  Rogers! Trivia note William Austin who plays Ginger's husband she's trying to divorce eventually played Alfred the butler in the Batman serials in the '40s. His look there would eventually inspire DC Comics to change their previous physical look for Alfred to one that's thin and has facial hair.".

Basically in Brightbourne Brighton England arrives Mimi Glossop Ginger Rogers from America who seeks a divorce from her geologist husband Cyril William Austin who she hasn't seen for several years. Her domineering Aunt Hortense Alice Brady who has been married numerous times herself is there to give her guidance and get bumbling and slightly incompetent lawyer Egbert 'Pinky' Fitzgerald Edward Everett Horton to consult them he also happens to a former fianc. He tries to get an adulterous relationship started as they spend a night in the hotel he found them and professional corespondent Rodolfo Tonetti Erik Rhodes is who he has hired to try and make it happen. He forgets though to hire private detectives to catch them in the act leaving Mimi free to do whatever she wants and coincidently she again meets American dancer Guy Holden Fred Astaire they met briefly on her arrival. Guy is a friend of Egbert's and is now besotted with Mimi staying in the same hotel and he is also mistaken as the corespondent she is meant to be caught with. They are eventually caught by Tonetti who holds them prisoner as they wait to clear up the mess and Cyril also arrives to speak his mind about the situation but in the end Guy and Mimi escape to dance the night away and live happily ever after. Also starring Eric Blore as The Waiter Lillian Miles as Singer Continental Number Charles Coleman as Guy's Valet and Betty Grable as Dance Specialty. Astaire is lovable and charming Rogers is beautiful and innocent and together their scenes are filled with fantastic chemistry the film is has of course wonderful songs with the Oscar winning The Continental Night and Day Let's Knock Knees and A Needle In A Haystack the dialogue is witty and funny which creates most of the best jokes overall a delightful musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction Best Music for Max Steiner Best Sound and Best Picture. Fred Astaire was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars and he was number 5 on 100 Years 100 Stars  Men Ginger Rogers was number 14 on 100 Years 100 Stars  Women. Very good!".

The 1930s was a carefree and innocent time for American cinema and here I can assure the reader that the divorce indicated by the title is merely happy. The film my ninth from Astaire and Rogers was the pair's second collaboration and the first in which they were the stars. The story adapted from the musical play Gay Divorce pretty much forms the template for their next halfdozen outings a throwaway lovestory fraught with screwball misunderstandings and elaborate art deco hotel rooms. Ginger Rogers requires a divorce from her neglectful husband and so tries to fake a loveaffair as you do with a pompous Italian called Tonetti Erik Rhodes. Fred Astaire comes along falls in love with Ginger but she mistakes him for the guy with whom she's supposed to be faking a loveaffair.'The Gay Divorce' has an excellent cast. Fred Astaire of course exudes the same classiness and boyish charm that made him the standout in 'Flying Down to Rio 1933'  and just check out how gracefully he is able to dance and get dressed at the same time. Ginger Rogers ever the gifted comedienne shows wonderful composure effortlessly making the conversion from apathy towards her male costar to adoration. Edward Everett Horton whose constant huffiness bounces amusingly off the carefree Astaire is unfortunate enough to be given a dance number opposite Betty Grable through which he awkwardly and hilariously stumbles. Erik Rhodes who was the highlight of 'Top Hat 1935' again manages to steal the show his pompous Italian womaniser a constant source of amusement. There's also Eric Blore doing that butler thing he does best. Musical highlights include Night and Day and the Oscar winning Continental which briefly abandons the longtakes you'd usually find in an Astaire film instead lapsing into a rapidfire Eisensteinian montage.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie musical had been a Hollywood staple since the dawn of the talkies but after a few years the novelty of the allsinging picture was wearing off and the studios had to refresh the genre with new tricks and most crucially popular stars. Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image Bing Crosby was a freshfaced newcomer but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction.The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had twodozen movie credits to her name and had gained a reputation in small roles often as a catty antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that despite professional precision brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a nonmusical these two would seem an odd pairing  it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet and in The Gay Divorce they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right.This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For Needle in a Haystack the song is born out of a dialogue scene with the camera still in its place the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire who very unusually is framed in profile. After one verse the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the nonmusic scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made.One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorce seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era in that the romance basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until against all probability she falls for him and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy. The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy songanddance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy motherhen sidekick Eric Blore the chirpy intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling wouldbe Latin lover. These three are all excellent and with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? Yes I do dare say.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movies that paired Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers between 1933 and 1949 the last one being an unexpected MGM feature as the rest were all made by RKO remain one of the joys of movie lovers everywhere. The gracefulness of the pair as dancers was matchless although Astaire would later be said to have done better with Eleanor Powell or Cyd Charisse. The music remains fresh too. And they are amusing films for the most part except of course The Story Of Vernon And Irene Castle which ends tragically. But there is one major problem we have to overlook  the story lines are for the most part idiotic.Because of the casts especially with regulars like Eric Blore Edward Everett Horton and in only two films unfortunately Erik Rhodes we are willing to overlook the weaknesses of the plots. But occasionally the plot has a bit more meaning to us. Such is the case with The Gay Divorce.Here Rogers is trying to get out of a marriage to a leachlike husband William Austin who only pops up in the last five minutes of the film. She is wealthy and he knows she is a great meal ticket  so he will never think of divorcing her. But Rogers and her aunt Alice Brady think they can arrange for Austin to be forced to confront Rogers in a compromising position by hiring a professional correspondent. The idea is that this fellow will be caught at the right moment by Austin and he will have no way of avoiding divorcing Rogers if he has any selfrespect left. Small spoiler here This scheme is actually faulty because it is based on the scheming Austin having selfrespect enough to demand divorce it turns out he couldn't care less and even forgives Rogers!.The fact is that Astaire a professional entertainer connected with Horton is mistaken as the professional correspondent by Rogers and finds himself being romanced by her in a cool unromantic spirit. Rogers after all is clearly interested in her use of this fellow only for the necessary divorce. But Astaire likes her and slowly woos her into a more interested and romantic situation.Unfortunately at this point the real correspondent Rhodes shows up. This part and his subsequent role as the egotistical Bedini in TOP HAT are the two roles that ensured Erik Rhodes a capable performer of movie immortality. At the time of his demise in 1990 his obituary in the New York Times mentioned how whenever he showed up for a revival or either film he would start speaking in his clipped Italian voice to the cheers of the audience. Bedini is a pretty unsympathetic idiot but one likes Tonetti the part he played here and that Rhodes played in the original Cole Porter stage production of THE GAY DIVORCE a few years before  opposite Astaire. Tonetti is also all business and it is not monkeybusiness he happens to be happily married. His famous statement You can trust your wife with Tonetti he prefers spaghetti! happens to be true. But Tonetti does become unwittingly in part a pest as he keeps gumming up the romance that is developing between Rogers and Astaire. The latter even happens to try to divert Tonetti's attention at one point with a cut out of himself and Rogers apparently turning back and forth around the room the cut out is on a phonograph turntable with their shadows showing up on a window screen. But Tonetti keeps finding out the deceptions and turning up like the perennial bad penny.Still by the time the film is over Tonetti is fully supportive of the romance  and is still willing to help Rogers against Austin. The film is kind to Rhodes  he even joins in singing the song that wins the Oscar for best song The Continental.Except for one number of the original Porter score all the tunes here were not by Porter including The Continental. Porter one of the greatest of Broadway musical composers never won the Oscar that the Gerswins Berlin and Kern all got Highly ironic especially as Night And Day is the surviving tune of the original show that is in the film. But the tunes were lost including a number for Eric Blore about the disappearance of old England while The Continental and Let's Knock Knees were added  at least the latter gave Edward Everett Horton and Betty Grable a song together. Despite the loss of Porter's score it remains a first rate musical and an enjoyable look at the problems of divorce in the 1930s.".

When Astaire did it on Broadway the Cole Porter musical had been entitled The Gay Divorce. But that extra 'e' was added on lest anyone get the idea that divorce itself was something frivolous. Imagine anticipating Britney Spears by about 70 years.Actually Fred had also done Funny Face and The Bandwagon on stage as well. But on stage The Bandwagon was a revue and Funny Face had an entirely different plot than the musical made by Astaire in the Fifties. Only in The Gay Divorce was he asked to repeat a stage role.The basic plot is still the same the usual AstaireRogers case of mistaken identity. Ginger is the budding divorce going to London to get a divorce as Aunt Alice Brady hired a professional corespondent. Ginger mistakes Fred for that corespondent and it takes a while for Fred to warm her up.Fred's an American musical comedy star visiting London with his manager Edward Everett Horton who also happens to know Brady. This gives the excuse for the musical numbers.Cole Porter's score was cut completely from the screen other than the immortal Night and Day. In it's place came four songs three written by Harry RevelMack Gordon and one written by Con ConradHerb Magdison. Fred and Ginger dance divinely to Night and Day.Fred does a solo dance to A Needle in a Haystack and Don't Let It Bother You. Betty Grable got her first notice from the movie going public singing and dancing in Let's Knock Knees all of which were contributed by RevelGordon. But it was The Continental number by Con Conrad and Herbert Magdison that got the first Academy Award ever given out for Best Original Song in a motion picture. It's what The Gay Divorce is remembered for today. It's a rather long between ten and fifteen minutes of screen time but as magical as everThe Gay Divorce ran for 248 performances on Broadway during the 1932 1933 season. Sacrificed for romance are Porter's witty lyrics in the rest of the score containing their usual commentary on the social scene. Of all the American musical giants of the era I would say that Cole Porter wins hands down as the man that Hollywood butchered the most in bringing his work to the screen. Even before The Code was in place it seemed that the powers that be deemed that his work was way too sophisticated and naughty to be seen and heard as is.Still with the film being frothy romance instead of social commentary The Gay Divorce is still great entertainment. Also repeating their roles from Broadway are supercilious waiter Eric Blore and the real corespondent Tonetti who prefers spaghetti Erik Rhodes.Wit for romance you decide if it was a fair exchange.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a native New Yorker I always look askance at The Cowboy Way because that last chase scene involving our heroes Kiefer Sutherland and Woody Harrelson is geographically impossible. Anyone who has some knowledge of the New York City Subway System can tell you that. Still The Cowboy Way is rollicking good entertainment.The rollicking part is courtesy of its two leads. They play a pair of feuding rodeo cowboys. Sutherland is mad at Harrelson because of his general irresponsibility. But a good friend of their's is in trouble and Sutherland's got to put aside his attitude about Harrelson in order to help out. Harrelson of course doesn't make it easy.Tomas Millian has paid money to smuggle his daughter Cara Buono from Cuba and now the coyotes are holding him up for more. He goes to New York and gets killed for his trouble. When Harrelson and Sutherland discover that they're not about to wait for regular law enforcement to do its thing. That's just not The Cowboy Way.As a sideline fashion designer Marg Helgenberger thinks Harrelson has possibilities as an underwear model and maybe she'd like to explore that with him. They also have a wonderful scene at the Waldorf Astoria hotel and restaurant where these two think its just your basic motel a little upscale. The guy who carries the serious part of the film is villain Dylan McDermott and he's as serious as a crutch. But apparently he's starting to listen to his crotch before his head where Buono is concerned. It's a weakness of the film because when the good guys are closing in McDermott probably could get away if he wasn't dragging Buono along with him. Of course the highlight for me is that wonderful scene at the Central Park Petting Zoo where Sutherland and Harrelson teach McDermott henchman Luis Guzman the way Pancho Villa used to get information from people not willing to give it up. It involves a weaning calf and it's hilarious and a little frightening to the male of the species.Despite its story weaknesses The Cowboy Way is one hysterical film and you'll have a good time seeing it. And since this film is about rodeo cowboys this review is dedicated to the recently retired Justin McBride of the Professional Bullriders. A man definitely dedicated to The Cowboy Way in his sport and in life.".

It is the type of conflict you see in more light hearted films such as the City Mouse and the Country Mouse. Interestingly the country cowboy lifestyle while first out of place ends up dominating those who adhere to the city ethos and results in unique solutions to bad situations. There is a definite chemistry between Harrelson and Sutherland. One would hope Harrelson would be asked to star in future episodes of 24.".

	schema:headline " Oh I like this city.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sort of a buddy action film that's focal point is the rocky relationship between the two main protagonists who just happen to be modern day cowboys as they find out just how much they rely on each other. The friendship might consist largely of bickering between the two actors Woody Harrelson who mugs it up and Kiefer Sutherland but the combination naturally flows and their performances are truly fitting with amusing comical exchanges. And even heartfelt too. Two New Mexico rodeo cowboy friends strained at that Sonny and Pepper head to New York City to find a missing friend Nacho and his Cuban immigrant daughter Teresa. What they uncover is that Nacho had got himself in some serious trouble that seems him ending up in a morgue and his daughter working in a sweatshop. This Hollywood dross is something rather lightweight and blunt with a message to boot. Still rather enjoyable even with its sugarcoating and stereotypical traits. The script throws about priceless dialogues and sets up the situation with aplomb. These characters are right out their comfort zone but go about getting the job done the cowboy way and going all out. Had me thinking of the 1968 feature Coogan's Bluff. Atypical but amusing if a little a silly. Some good action setpieces standout namely the climatic chase and you can't beat good dummy work. Flavoured country soundtrack finds its way in. The rest of the performances are acceptable with a likable Ernie Hudson as a horse riding New York cop and Dylan McDermott as the sly criminal behind Nacho's death. Also popping up are Tomas Milan Marg Helgenberger Cara Buono and Luis Guzman.You cowboys are a dying breed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sort of a buddy action film that's focal point is the rocky relationship between the two main protagonists who just happen to be modern day cowboys as they find out just how much they rely on each other. The friendship might consist largely of bickering between the two actors Woody Harrelson who mugs it up and Kiefer Sutherland but the combination naturally flows and their performances are truly fitting with amusing comical exchanges. And even heartfelt too. Two New Mexico rodeo cowboy friends strained at that Sonny and Pepper head to New York City to find a missing friend Nacho and his Cuban immigrant daughter Teresa. What they uncover is that Nacho had got himself in some serious trouble that seems him ending up in a morgue and his daughter working in a sweatshop.

But Harrelson employs every good ol' boy clich ever imagined.

In the process Harrelson ends up at a posh fashion party. Naturally the hostess is so overwhelmed by the charm of this rube that she hangs all over him while ignoring the rest of her welltodo guests.Of course the good ol' cowpokes have a big ol' gunfight with the city slicker bad guys. And there are no legal ramifications. Ernie Hudson plays a mounted NY City cop. He is so enamored of the good ol' cowpokes that he abandons his patrol area to follow Harrelson through town on horseback. Later he rides his horse INTO the police station shouting some blather about forming a posse. Later still he gives away his horse and a horse of a fellow officer to the cowpokes so that we viewers can be treated to the sight of our good ol' boys galloping through NY City in pursuit of a train carrying the city slicker bad guys. Incredibly after galloping all over town the horses still have enough left to overtake the train. Also incredibly Hudson's cop is not fired for his bizarre and irresponsible actions.And just to make sure the point is hammered home that the good ol' countrified cowboy way is superior to the city slicker way our cowpokes save the day by employing their rope tricks.This movie is so unbelievable that it seems better suited to a cartoon. Maybe a Heckle and Jeckle plot. If you're the type that just has to have that notion validated that the good ol' boys are always better than the city slickers regardless of how absurd the story is then this one's for you.

Woody is a scream in his role and kiefer plays the straight man and while you know exactly how its going to end its a fun film from start to finish probably suitable for all the family too.

This is a very funny movie although the storyline with the girl getting held for ransom and her father getting killed does get a little drug out. The end is very funny and not predictable. I have this movie on DVD and have watched it over and over again many times. Keifer Sutherland Woody Harrelson Travis Tritt are the celebrities that I was familiar with in the movie but there may have been more. I never would have imagined Woody Harrelson playing the role of a cowboy but he really does fit the role of Pepper perfectly. Of course Keifer Sutherland looks the part and does a great acting job as well his character was not as fun or interesting as Woody's character though.".

Snappy dialogue and situations a common plot with the story of two modern cowboys dropped into The Rotten Apple on a mission of search and rescue this movie is best viewed on widescreen TV. It doesn't break down too much near the end which is usual for fictions of this type. The writers did a fine job blending the clash of cultures and the director manages to keep control of the project.

	schema:reviewBody "I've not had the opportunity to spend any time in a British prison but I doubt that the prison life is as nice in reality as it is portrayed here. But I think that's part of the comedy part of the suspension of disbelief for a bunch of happygolucky prisoners who encourage the prison warden called 'governor' to perform the stage musical Nelson that he has written while at the same time plotting an escape. It stars James Nesbitt an Irishman who is remarkably similar to George Clooney with a thick accent as Jimmy Hands inept bank robber. A very entertaining 103 minutes I enjoyed this movie more than such British comedies as 'The Full Monty' and 'Brassed Off.' some SPOILERS follow please read no further. Jimmy and his partner playing cops and robbers since kids attempt a bank heist that will set them up for life bungle it badly and are sent to prison. Jimmy is nice but headstrong spends most of his time in 14day solitary stints but finds 1 that the old chapel happens to be the ideal place to stage a break and 2 the warden would like to perform his musical in the old chapel because acoustics are ideal. So Jimmy encourages the warden feeds his ego while they devise a plan to use a rope ladder prop to go over the wall during the play. When a new prisoner a violent man shows up and tells Jimmy he will be included smart Jimmy devises a misdirection which ends up with the violent criminal being caught while his three friends escape with the help of the pilot wife of one of them. They simply dressed as theatergoers and walked out in the dark with the rest of the audience. At the last minute Jimmy stayed behind to serve out his two years and be with the pretty prison angermanagement psychologist who was his leading lady in the musical. He eventually got out she was there for him. As credits roll we see the former chief prison guard patrolling a parking garage for a living two of the escapees and the pilot wife partying in Rio and the final escapee selling maps to the stars in Hollywood.  This film is primarily a comedy but there are commentaries on love and devotion plus a tragic suicide after the gentle inmate finds out his wife may be running out on him.A decent DVD with a good soundtrack no extras worth mentioning.".

This entertaining black comedy carries some good acting and a marvelously understated sense of humor.

Unfortunately his second stint behind the camera isn't half as successful.  The main problem with this comedy is simple it's not funny enough.  Yes there's a few chuckles but my sides definitely weren't split... they weren't even creased.James Nesbitt from TV's Cold Feet in the UK is full of cheeky Irish charm but I didn't think he cut it as a leading man.  He's great on TV but he lacked something on the big screen.  The love interest is provided by the lovely Olivia Williams who plays the same same sort of role she's done before and is fine again here.  Christopher Plummer plays the Prison's Governor and it's always good to see him even if the film's not that great. The rest of the inmates were pretty good with Bill Nighy's scenestealing poncey Roger as the standout.Storywise it hit all the right notes but as I'd said wasn't nearly funny enough.  There are echoes of MONTY throughout but the production put on by the inmates at the end of the film didn't work nearly as well as the MONTY finale.  So overall I'd say it was a bit of a disappointment which is a bit of a shame.".

Additionallyas other commentators have accurately statedit is unbelievable too often.The only manwoman relationship is contrived a beautiful smart girl falling for an con? Of course the writer would like us to suspend our belief and accept that when people are in love anything is possible but like the Chris O'Donnell's cliff leap in Vertical Limit you simply cannot accept it. Why is it that writersproducers think that an audience will believe the unbelievable? Have the surveys behind the scenes shown that moviegoers are so desperate for escapism or have nothing better to do that the 'believability bar' can be set so low? Even if the movie were novel and wellactedwhich it is notif the writer develops the life of characters within the context of an improbable relationship then no matter how good the acting is or how well the sory is developed the effect will be diminished.There are some believable scenes especially when Spall is on screen. His desperation to get out of prison following the meeting with his wife and son is quietly shown in his eyes and the soft words to his cellmate even if what he was going to do next was still fairly predictable. And Christopher Plummer! The sad professional slide he is currently on Dracula 2000 makes me want to wither or jump up and yell why are you wasting your talent here?. It could have been Don Knotts or Leslie Nielsen almost anyone but Plummer. In other words the producers needed 'a name' and Casting went along with it. I also had the feeling that the cute accents were used a vehicle to sell the movie. The mixture of Oxford English nonOxford English and Irish is not enough to charm me into suspending my belief if the jokes are few and far between.

He convinces Governor Graham Mortimer The Sound of Music's Christopher Plummer to stage a musical based on the life of Nelson in the old chapel next to one outer wall. Rounding up volunteer actors and production members including Cliff Gumbell Timothy Spall Roger 'Rog' Chamberlain Bill Nighy and exrobbery partner Rudy 'Rud' Guscott Snatch's Lennie James and the leading lady played by new love interest Annabel Sweep Olivia Williams his plan seems to be going well. So after the arrival of nasty inmate John Toombes Frank Harper and the death of Cliff it comes to the night of the musical and Jimmy plans his breakout performance along with a couple of the other players but in the end Jimmy decides to stay for Annabel while the others get away with it and Jimmy is released in the end anyway. Also starring Ron Cook as Mr. Perry the Guard Julian Barratt as Paul Dean and Celia Imrie as Amy Chamberlin.

The first fifteen minutes have crappy dialogue bad jokes the bad guy is a clich and you realize you can already guess the ending. Hang in there though cause this film improves while it's going. James Nesbitt plays Jimmy Hands an amateurish bank robber. He and his mate Lennie James get caught and end up in jail. Obviously there's going to be an escape attempt as ALL prisonmovies have escape attempts. The jail seems a rather cosy place with tomato gardening and a director fond of musicals. Jimmy Hands realizes this might be his chance and convinces the director to put on a musical play about the great hero Nelson. Without female inmates the beautiful Olivia Williams who works in jail as a rehabilitation counselor has to play the part of the heroin. Here's where the fun starts rehearsals fights and sweet off key singing while romance is in the air. Lucky Break is a charming little comedy with a good cast including the inmates Bill Nighy and Timothy Spall. 710 would be a bit too much for this but it's well worth the time.".

But it made me laugh and it gave me a feelgood ending so I feel it did its job. People seem to dis a lot on predictability in movies but if it works why not use it. I like a nice happy ending.

An earthquake strikes as he's despondently walking back to the dugout which isn't surprising for Northern California. Suddenly Army of Darkness 1993style Calvin falls to Arthurian England wearing his baseball uniform and his backpack. It seems that Merlin has pulled Calvin back through time by mistake perhaps misled by Calvin's clothinghis team is called the Knights. Merlin was seeking help to vanquish a renegade courtier Lord Belasco Art Malik who desires to wed Arthur's daughter Sarah Kate Winslet and take over Camelot for ill purposes. Will Calvin be able to help Merlin anyway even though he's just a kid with low selfesteem? The basic idea of the film is a modernization of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court which was originally published in 1889 why didn't they have Calvin be from Connecticut and name his team The Yankees? The mistake and delivery device could have been rewritten. There are also relations and references to the number of film versions that have been made of Twain's book over the years including 1921 1931 1949 1955 1978 A Bugs Bunny version 1979 The Spaceman and King Arthur 1989 and even another 1995 a few other Arthurian films such as The Black Knight 1954 and Siege of the Saxons 1963 and even F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby originally published in 1925 from which comes A Kid in King Arthur's Court's villain's name Belasco which Fitzgerald meant as a reference to turn of the century playwright David Belasco Fitzgerald used the name metaphorically to mean something like illusionist with a strong sense of fakery or fraud.This Disney version is quite a pleasant take on the tale. It's a funny but also surprisingly serious fantasy with an appeal to families and a good message for kids. It helps to go into the film with limited preconceptionsexpectations as the film's tone takes many twists and turns.Of course it's especially important to not expect nonfiction. Not a few reviewers have complained about the plausibility of certain scenes in Arthurian England one saying that Disney underestimated the intelligence of its audience by showing implausible reactions on the part of the residents of Camelot to Calvin Fuller and taking little care in making the historical setting more authentic never mind that their notions of historical fact seem to be based on other fiction films rather than any historical research.I'm afraid that we'd be severely overestimating the intelligence of at least that section of the audience if we expect them comprehend that the film isn't intended as a documentary on Arthurian England nor is it intended as a sociological dissertation on what would likely happen given such a clash of these particular cultures. It remains a mystery why it wouldn't strike the parties in question that perhaps the entire film is a daydream of Calvin's while he's waiting on the bench and as such would be far from accurate in its portrayal of Arthurian England. At least the film isn't intended as realistic. However we interpret the visual information we're given fantasy is surely intended. After all the film literally concerns a teenaged boy traveling 1500 years or so King Arthur is usually placed around the latter half of the 5th to the first half of the 6th Centuries back in time through a crevice left in the wake of an earthquake. Did someone think that was plausible? That's a fairly large clue that you should switch your interpretational mode to fantasy.Like the other versions of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court the novelty is the cultural clash. Calvin wows his historical audience with his strange dress speech behavior and most concretely the technological gadgets he brings along. He arrives as King Arthur's men are pursuing the Black Knight falling right on top of the fugitive so that he acquires the box the Black Knight was riding off with saving the day. Shortly afterward Calvin is taken to Camelot where Belasco challenges him asking him to choose his weapon. Calvin says combat rock and pulls a CD player out of his backpack which he ingeniously connects to a couple horns as earphone amplifiers shocking and awing the crowd with blaring heavy metal. Later items such as candy bubble gum and a Swiss army knife prove fortuitous.But the most important character arc is a developmental one. In Arthurian England Calvin's selfconsciousness isn't interpreted negatively. To Camelot's residents he is merely a strange foreigner acting with decorumif he's even not threatening. The King's younger daughter Katherine Paloma Baeza takes an almost immediate shine to him which is important as Calvin is just at the age where he's strongly interested in girls. Even if he's not physically adept he is clever as demonstrated with the CD player gag. He further employs his ingenuity to instruct the royal blacksmith in making first a pair of roller blades then later a mountain bike both of which serve important purposes. While at court he's also giving knight training which improves his physical abilities. Eventually Calvin reaches his potential and sheds his selfdoubt fueling the climax and providing a denouement that is a Zenlike return to the market from the oxherding parable where Calvin proves successful and appreciated in his native environment.This is an important message of confidence not only for kids but for adults too. The point isn't the historical drama although that's a lot of fun even if it's more like a medieval section of Disney World than 6th Century England. The point at least in this particular instantiation of A Connecticut Yankee is the removal of conceptualenvironmental ruts that get in the way of selfactualization.".

	schema:headline " A fairly awkward family adventure film";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing the trailer for this film back in 1995 when I was just under nine years old and was interested in seeing it for a while but never did for some reason. I guess I forgot about it after a while and didn't think about it for a long time. Well it's been over a decade now and I've finally seen it not that it was really worth it. I probably would have liked it to some degree back when it was released whether in theatres or in stores but unfortunately it's too late for me now.Calvin Fuller is a fourteenyearold baseball player who lives in Reseda California. One day while up at bat during a game in the park and not doing so well an earthquake hits! Calvin falls down a chasm in the ground and after long fall he finds himself in an unfamiliar place! It turns out he has been pulled back in time to the mythical Camelot! The now elderly King Arthur is losing his power and the evil Lord Belasco is determined to to take over the throne so the kingdom is in danger! The 20th Century baseball player doesn't know at first that he is here because Merlin has called for a worthy fighter from another time to save the kingdom but was Calvin really the one he was looking for?! Around the beginning of the film before the earthquake I already noticed some cheesiness especially with Calvin's younger sister razzing him by saying if he dies she will get his room. Secondly I don't think I have EVER seen a movie rush into the story so quickly! A Kid in King Arthur's Court certainly doesn't take much time to introduce the main character and his life at all. After that more problems definitely follow including some rather cheesy quotes andor scenes. Also this movie is supposed to be a comedy but nothing made me laugh or even smile! Now there may be some reasonable moments in the film and I would be lying if I said I never felt any suspense throughout. It definitely could have been worse. However it is still a fairly unfocused family movie overall and I MIGHT be able to give it a 610 but no higher.A Kid in King Arthur's Court was aimed at kids and since I was in my childhood when it came out I'm obviously not anymore. If it wasn't for my interest in seeing it all those years ago I highly doubt I would have ever ended up seeing it at all. Watching it in my childhood may have been a missed opportunity for me. Since I see a fairly low IMDb rating for this live action Disney fantasy but one that doesn't suggest that it's generally considered abysmal I'm sure many kids would enjoy it and maybe their parents as well. However if you don't fall into either of those categories I suggest you skip this movie and watch a more widely appealing fantasy film if you're into that kind of thing.".

First of all if this kid managed to survive the first 5 minutes without getting an arrow put through him or beheaded by a broadsword and he managed to avoid being taken prisoner and made a gay soliders plaything he would most likely die of many diseases that his body wasn't accustomed to. Also even you do have a magical place to plug in a stereo you play rock and roll for guards at a middle age castle youll be labled as a heritic and executed.  but dying aside the middle ages just werent that cool disease and warfare were everywhere people lived in disgusting conditions that even mother theresa would run away from and there was no place for the weak you either fought or you died and if you werent tough you were probably killed. But enough about that what i have to say is for young kids that enjoy the kids outsmarting the stupid grownups genre like home alone that ones off the hook though still entertains me even at 19 and will continue to go see it but for older people that know what the middle ages were really like dont bother.If you want a closer to real life version of what a person time traveling would be like read the scottish highlander book series highlander the fiery cross etc or listen to the recorded books  tape or cd".

	schema:headline " Early dysfunctional family";
	schema:reviewBody "When we first meet Rodrigo Borgia at a papal election little prepare us for what this man would turn out to be after he gets to be Pope. His main rivals were Ascanio Sforza and Giuliano Della Rovere. The time was the last part of the XV century. Rodrigo who was born in Spain under a the name of Jofre LLancol changed the name to Borja after his uncle Alfonso Borja was elected as Pope earlier in the century. His ambitions were enormous and having served five different pontiffs before his own elevation gave him a taste for power. After his election Rodrigo took the name Alexander VI.It was common practice at that time that Popes as well as members of the Catholic elite had families on the side. No one objected because it was a reality as members of that select group came usually from rich and powerful families. Rodrigo was no exception. After being enthroned he set out right away to consolidate his power because his ambition was to rule the church as well as the rest of Italy. He sired four children Cesare Giovanni Goffredo and Lucrezia. For purposes of this film the names of the children were changed to the Spanish version thus they became Cesar Juan Jofre and Lucrecia. Rodrigo had formidable enemies but being a sly operator he decided to marry his favorite daughter Lucrecia to Giovanni Sforza a match that should have consolidated his powers. Rodrigo was rumored had incestuous relations with his own daughter. Lucrecia in turn seemed to be quite taken with her brother Cesar. In the meantime Rodrigo was happily distracted by Giulia Farnese a gorgeous creature. The Borgias were one of the earliest dysfunctional families in history. The behind the scene machinations were the order of the day in the Rome of those days. All what mattered was how much power anyone had and whose loyalties the people in power had. In turn their own ambition did them in. Rodrigo died poisoned and the children's fates are well known.Antonio Hernandez the director of this ambitious film centered the action around Rodrigo who had his hands in everything imaginable. This is a biographic account of a family that was doomed because they had it all but misused their power. Mr. Hernandez who cowrote the screen treatment presents a great spectacle to dazzle the viewer. Working with his cinematographer Javier Salmones he places the action in palaces and castles that lend themselves to the story. Sergio PerisMencheta makes a good impression with his take on Cesar. He casts a fine figure as the favorite son of Rodrigo. LLuis Homar's Rodrigo is perhaps the most dominant appearance in the film. Mr. Homar does a good job convincing the viewer he is the villain everyone felt he was. Maria Valverde makes a delicious Lucrecia but Paz Vega has nothing to do.Los Borgia is a spectacle for history buffs. Although running more than two hours it packs so much action so no one will feel bored.".

	onyx:emotionText "When we first meet Rodrigo Borgia at a papal election little prepare us for what this man would turn out to be after he gets to be Pope. His main rivals were Ascanio Sforza and Giuliano Della Rovere. The time was the last part of the XV century. Rodrigo who was born in Spain under a the name of Jofre LLancol changed the name to Borja after his uncle Alfonso Borja was elected as Pope earlier in the century. His ambitions were enormous and having served five different pontiffs before his own elevation gave him a taste for power. After his election Rodrigo took the name Alexander VI.It was common practice at that time that Popes as well as members of the Catholic elite had families on the side. No one objected because it was a reality as members of that select group came usually from rich and powerful families. Rodrigo was no exception. After being enthroned he set out right away to consolidate his power because his ambition was to rule the church as well as the rest of Italy. He sired four children Cesare Giovanni Goffredo and Lucrezia. For purposes of this film the names of the children were changed to the Spanish version thus they became Cesar Juan Jofre and Lucrecia. Rodrigo had formidable enemies but being a sly operator he decided to marry his favorite daughter Lucrecia to Giovanni Sforza a match that should have consolidated his powers. Rodrigo was rumored had incestuous relations with his own daughter. Lucrecia in turn seemed to be quite taken with her brother Cesar. In the meantime Rodrigo was happily distracted by Giulia Farnese a gorgeous creature. The Borgias were one of the earliest dysfunctional families in history. The behind the scene machinations were the order of the day in the Rome of those days. All what mattered was how much power anyone had and whose loyalties the people in power had. In turn their own ambition did them in. Rodrigo died poisoned and the children's fates are well known.Antonio Hernandez the director of this ambitious film centered the action around Rodrigo who had his hands in everything imaginable. This is a biographic account of a family that was doomed because they had it all but misused their power. Mr. Hernandez who cowrote the screen treatment presents a great spectacle to dazzle the viewer. Working with his cinematographer Javier Salmones he places the action in palaces and castles that lend themselves to the story. Sergio PerisMencheta makes a good impression with his take on Cesar. He casts a fine figure as the favorite son of Rodrigo. LLuis Homar's Rodrigo is perhaps the most dominant appearance in the film.

There is also some nudity but I don't think they abuse of it at all even more if we read about the morals of the Borgia family.The only thing I didn't like much about the film is that it narrates only the facts surrounding the Borgia family and their political interests buts speaks very little about the overall situation in Europe and the important changes in Europe's art and society during the 14th and 15th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Los Borgias' is a nice film to look at. The sets costumes and art direction are quite good and I think they fit with the time period. I also think director Antonio Hernandez has tried to make the film as historically accurate as possible. However even though the film spans more than 2 hours I felt that it was lacking in something. The characters aren't properly developed. The relationships between the characters are displayed quite well. It was rumoured that Rodrigo had an incestuous relationship with his daughter and the director too remains ambiguous in his depiction rather than 'taking sides'. I felt that the writer could have done more to delve into the psyche of Rodrigo and Cesar. Further on the technical side the cinematography is inconsistent and the soundtrack is very standard. The performances at times appear theatrical. Llus Homar is passable. Sergio PerisMencheta fits the part. The best performance comes from Angela Molina but her role is tiny and almost insignificant to the story. Mara Valverde performs decently. Paz Vega is wasted. As some have mentioned 'Los Borgia' may have work better as a longer feature film with adequate story and character development or a TV series. Hernandez's film is a good enough onetime watch that attempts to provide some historical insight. At least it got me interested in reading about this dysfunctional family.".

So here goes.First positive comment The male leads are really great looking.Second positive comment The female lead ain't bad either.Third positive comment Ummm...This film is incredibly long. IMDb has a running time of 120mins but I made it closer to 2 34 hours. This time dilation phenomenon was made even more noticeable by the fact that this was probably the most boring film I've seen since...since... Kingdom of Heaven last year. You know it makes my back creak to even think of that film again. The one difficulty I had apart from actually seeing the action past the members of the audience who kept leaving the auditorium in front of me was that I found myself completely lacking any sympathy for the main lead roles. At all. I just didn't care what happened to them. They could have conquered Europe or caught Malaria and shivered away to frost and bone and I wouldn't have batted an eyelid.Lucretia Borgia was a an absolute love and I did at least feel sorry for her as her brothers and fathers had successive husbands organised wedded to her and then murdered. Pobrecita! Also I couldn't work out if there was a deliberate incest theme going on between her and the males in the family There was lots of fulllipped kissing between them and her. I'm sure it's all been researched but it was a bit odd. And as all the women in the film ended up naked and all looked 'preraphaelite' it was hard to tell who was bedding whom at times.But the Guys? Come on! I was waiting for the father to die for the last hour and a half and hoped there'd be a rebellion a lot earlier in the film so it would all be over.Perhaps the director was trying to make the audience feel what it's like to live under an oppressive regime where you can't change anything. I too would have liked them all dead but surely that's not a good thing to say about the starring players whose every move you have to watch for 120165 mins.I would like to say something else positive...think think! The set's? No nothing special.The music? No irritatingly it repeated the same theme over and over again. No not just the same theme the same music! It's a shame the Borgias didn't conquer Germany or they might have learned what a variation was. OK I know I'm a few hundred years too early The costumes? I was thinking during the final scene how completely amazing the photography was on House of the Flying Daggers. It's a sad moment for a film when you think how much better other films are WHILE you're still watching it.Setpiece actionsequences? There weren't any! Fisticuffs in the church square that was 100 times worse than a firsttime amateur readthrough of Mercutio and Tybalt and then a bit of horse riding here and there.Food? Even the popcorn machine was broken. Not really a fault of the film but it didn't help! Nudity? If you're going to take someone's clothes off then make sure they're stunners please. Dove soap adherents make note So there you have it. In fact the best bit was when someone's mobile phone went off. The audience sighed with relief. When that happens you KNOW the film's in trouble.I thought Snakes on a Plane was dodgy but obviously I seriously misjudged the standard. Snakes on a Plane was unreservedly EXCELLENT compared to this. AND they had girls whom it was worth paying to see naked.Don't hesitate when you come to chose where your money goes.".

The movie is quite good in some aspects the costumes are very well designed and historically correct the setting is also very good I'm sure they filmed in the Vatican and actors play good parts. However the result is not a very good film. First of all it is about 150min long that is TOO much the story could have been told in about 45minutes less!! Many times when you expect the movie to end it just turns to be a new marrying to Lucrecia and continue! In addition to this the movie has another problem the main characters result not to be charismatic though the actors are good you don't get easily interested in the story things happen and well most of the time you don't mind. I must admit that it is a good attempt to make a good historical film much better than usual in Spain for these kind of films but the result is not totally good specially because of its lenght the fact that you soon get fed up by the characters doesn't help too. With more speed probably it would have been a good movie but now it is just decent.".

In my opinion most of the films produced in the last few years within this socalled revolution has been the same old stories and concepts that Norway has made from day one except the productions has become better. I have visited the theater for basically every new Norwegian film with high hopes and a wanting to like what they show and every time I walk out disappointed and with less hope for our present generation of filmmakers. This all changed today. I went to the premiere of Fritt Vilt expecting a nice slasher film and I walked out 95 minutes later with hope restored and a nice smile on my face. I actually felt good.The film is a slasher film through and through and that is both one of it's strengths but also it's weakness. The film contains basically every little slasher movie clich you can think of. It's just they do it so very well. It is a genre film and it doesn't bring anything new to the concept but it's fresh for us Norwegians. The film doesn't try to be anything more than a good horror film.The setting is excellent. An old abandoned hotel in the middle of nowhere up in the mountains. The back story is not exactly original but it works well enough to pull of some really scary scenes. The look and feel of the hotel and the isolation is all there and the evil that is lurking sure is creepy.Roar Uthaug does a few neat tricks early in the movie which makes you sit at the edge of your seat through out the film and his direction is good. The script is good enough for a horror story but sometimes especially in the opening scene the dialoges are pretty campy and lame. But they redeem themselves quickly when the sh hits the fan.The acting is excellent from most of the cast. I hope we'll see a lot more of Ingrid Bols Berdal in other films. Having her in the lead was a smart move. I would also like to credit Rolf Kristian Larsen. He had some funny commentaries and face expressions. The weakest actor and at times so bad it was annoying was Endre Martin Midtstigen. I'm not sure why he was in the movie. He must know someone in the production team cause he has no acting talents what so ever.A creepy horror film from Norway and one of our finest films in recent years. I hope to see more of Roar Uthaug in the near future. I think this is a director with much to come. Also Ingrid Bols Berdal we want more of you! Keep Up The Good Work!".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of friends go on a skiing trip... when tragedy strikes  one of them breaks his ankle. Taking shelter in an old hotel things seem to be okay for the time being and one of them leaves to go for help. But wouldn't you know it? They've taken up residence in the home of a brutal nasty killer.My past associations with Norway are varied. When I was much younger my family took in two Norwegian exchange students for a week. They were nice enough though they had a strange aversion to showering. Instead they relied heavily on Neutrogena not coincidentally a Norwegian product. I have never used Neutrogena myself but have a soft spot in my heart for it due to its spokeswoman being a huge love of mine...Later Norway arose again when a group of friends decided they would move to Norway following the 911 attacks to live in a more peaceful country with more progressive values. They went so far as to learn Norwegian and while I was not intimately involved in this I did supply them with some Norwegian books and read a few of them.A few years later a Norwegian film crossed my desk  Naboer Next Door one of the best films I had seen in a while and very psychological. My past experiences of Norway on film were with The Thing so this really opened my eyes. And that was the last I saw of Norway until now... with Fritt Vilt Cold Prey another winner.This film really revives the slasher genre. I enjoyed the new Friday the 13th but felt it wasn't anything special. Cold Prey brought the idea home. A group of young people in isolation hunted down and hacked to bits. That's horror gold people. You can quote me on that  horror gold. No clichs about drug use sexual promiscuity or anything else... this plot is sold on good storytelling and bloodshed.The film does start a bit slow and this is intensified if you're not into reading subtitles. But there's a good cast I especially enjoyed Viktoria Winge whom I can't wait to see in the sequel and the build up pays off. Even the killer stands out. He's not a mutant not a revenge addict... when you finally get to see him he's terrifying in his normality. Nothing supernatural here  you get trapped in the mountains and this guy might get you! This film should be available at all video stores and shopping centers. I strongly urge a rental and perhaps even a purchase. It hit home for me and I think many others will agree. I also suggest tracking down Naboer if you haven't seen it yet as the two would make a great couple for a Norwegian double feature. If this is what the Norse have to bring us I say long live Odin and long live Thor. I'm ready.".

	schema:headline " How It should be done";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay normally i'm not really into subtitled movies but when I came across this little gem the other day and after all the rave reviews that I read about this on web well I just had to see what all the fuss was about and I was pleased with the result.The Plot  Five people decide to take a snowboarding trip in the Norweign mountains but one of them falls and breaks his leg then they find refuge in an old abandoned ski lodge cabin this where the terror begins.Okay It's a generic plot but that doesn't matter and in no way makes this a bad movie whatsoever It's however one of the many strenghs of this movie that brings a certain realism to it's surroundings and characters. Okay It's a slow burner at first it takes about 40 minutes for the first murder to happen but when it does it really kicks in and in the meantime we get to know the main cast and it always keeps you interested all the way through.The eerieness and tension are all there in this the ski lodge was a geniue creepy place and when they start exploring the place and finding information and the killer works really well since he's just a regular guy geared up to handle the cold weather so his face is naturally covered by material to keep himself warm. Though his size is what makes him intimidating towering over his victims by a foot or two. Since he uses a standard pick as his weapon of choice we don't get a lot of gore but there's a decent amount of blood. However the movie's aim clearly wasn't to please us with gore but to chill us with tension and it actually works. My favorite part of the film involved a sequence in which one of the survivors runs outside in the pitch black of night with only a flashlight  short but awesome scene and the final showdown really packs a punch. The movie just shows that even if you have a predictable and clichd story you can deliver a decent watch.The cast were all top notch  Ingrid Bolso Berdal who plays the main heroine Jannike hit all the right notes she was fantastic and really stood out her emotions and logical thinking made her a very likable character too root for. Rolf Kristian Larsen Tobias was another stand out as the joker of the group who brakes his leg he made his character very real and sympatechic. Tomas Alf Larsen Erik was also another interesting addition to cast as was Viktoria Winge Ingunn the pretty blonde more than the usual bimbo they usually have in these movies she actually layers to her character and Endre Martin Midtstigan Mikal who also played the asshole role pretty well.All in all a decent slasher that hails all the way from Norway that actually brings realism and an interesting set up and beautiful scenery a definite must see the best slasher in years.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay normally i'm not really into subtitled movies but when I came across this little gem the other day and after all the rave reviews that I read about this on web well I just had to see what all the fuss was about and I was pleased with the result.The Plot  Five people decide to take a snowboarding trip in the Norweign mountains but one of them falls and breaks his leg then they find refuge in an old abandoned ski lodge cabin this where the terror begins.Okay It's a generic plot but that doesn't matter and in no way makes this a bad movie whatsoever It's however one of the many strenghs of this movie that brings a certain realism to it's surroundings and characters. Okay It's a slow burner at first it takes about 40 minutes for the first murder to happen but when it does it really kicks in and in the meantime we get to know the main cast and it always keeps you interested all the way through.The eerieness and tension are all there in this the ski lodge was a geniue creepy place and when they start exploring the place and finding information and the killer works really well since he's just a regular guy geared up to handle the cold weather so his face is naturally covered by material to keep himself warm. Though his size is what makes him intimidating towering over his victims by a foot or two. Since he uses a standard pick as his weapon of choice we don't get a lot of gore but there's a decent amount of blood. However the movie's aim clearly wasn't to please us with gore but to chill us with tension and it actually works. My favorite part of the film involved a sequence in which one of the survivors runs outside in the pitch black of night with only a flashlight  short but awesome scene and the final showdown really packs a punch. The movie just shows that even if you have a predictable and clichd story you can deliver a decent watch.The cast were all top notch  Ingrid Bolso Berdal who plays the main heroine Jannike hit all the right notes she was fantastic and really stood out her emotions and logical thinking made her a very likable character too root for. Rolf Kristian Larsen Tobias was another stand out as the joker of the group who brakes his leg he made his character very real and sympatechic. Tomas Alf Larsen Erik was also another interesting addition to cast as was Viktoria Winge Ingunn the pretty blonde more than the usual bimbo they usually have in these movies she actually layers to her character and Endre Martin Midtstigan Mikal who also played the asshole role pretty well.All in all a decent slasher that hails all the way from Norway that actually brings realism and an interesting set up and beautiful scenery a definite must see the best slasher in years.";

	schema:reviewBody "What exactly can I say about FRITT VILT that hasn't been said already. Well for starters in a world overdosed on allegedly scary slasher movies this Norwegian film actually delivers with a terrifying atmosphere and genuine suspense. It's an old and tried storyline take five teenagers and place them in an isolated location this being a long abandoned hotel with a violent killer on the loose inside. However what differentiates FRITT VILT from the rest of the pack is it's sharp direction by Roar Uthaug who manages to keep the same old clichs of the genre interesting. He does this mainly through the characters. Here we have five friends who emote a sincere affection for each other and for this reason we grow to like them. Unlike most other slasher movies where the characters are cardboard cutouts simply used to increase the bodycount and showcase gory effects these characters drive the story along and all have a purpose within the movie that serves the plot. So when we watch them die it becomes upsetting and genuinely disturbing. In particular the first murder is increasingly harrowing and while watching I felt a terrible pity for the person. Another reason it succeeds is the fluid cinematography by Daniel Voldheim who paints each shot with atmospheric lighting and shadow so the darker scenes generate true claustrophobia and tension. The soundtrack by Magnus Beite is wonderfully haunting moving and terrifying while the performances by all involved are incredibly accurate particularly Ingrid Bolso Berdal as Jannicke who provides a compassionate heroine whom we quickly grow to love and in the end we truly feel her anguish and pain. This is an outstanding movie within the slasher genre and a sterling example of Norwegian horror.".

The key is the setting and the killer. The setting an abandoned skilodge isolated in the middle of Norwegian snowy mountains miles upon miles away from civilization. A group of skiers young adults on their way to a lodge when deciding to snow board down and over potentially dangerous terrain leaves one among them with a broken ankle. Finding the the ski lodge as refuge the group will decide to spend the night waiting for morning to go for help. They however are not alone..a hulking menace hidden underneath pounds of protective clothing carrying a pickax he swings with a vengeance the group will find themselves in for one hell of a nightmare.Ingrid Bols Berdal is the final girl Jannicke who is placed in quite a predicament when her friends and lover are being stalked and killed having to protect her handicapped comrade Morten TobiasRolf Kristian Larsen the comedy relief of the picture whose broken ankle provides quite the detriment towards fleeing quickly as the menace draws near. As many final girls in slashers are Jannicke is resourceful quickthinking and courageous attempting to stay one step ahead of the killer who knows this difficult environment a lot more than she does. Her lover EirikTomas Alf Larsenwas on his way to get help when he is upended by the killer. Young couple MikalEndre Martin Midtstigenand IngunnViktoria Winge having been together only a short amount of time but are crazy for each other round out the cast of potential casualties. The opening of the film concerning a scarfaced kid possibly being buried alive as snow topples upon him by an unseen assailant and the dangerous manhunt to find him making headlines..this was in '75is set up for a reason understood later.Many will find that this slasher operates under the normal guidelines instituted since the 70's. It doesn't stray too far from what you expect all the way to the conclusion. BUT director Roar Uthaug despite this is able to create an incredible sense of terror and my nails were bitten to the quick even though I had a good idea how it'd all end. The menace just comes out of nowhere ready to plunge that pickax into bodies with a ferocity you feel when it seldom misses destroying objects in the vicinity. And the horrifying situation the characters are stuck in..thanks to the setting which echos THE THING and the feeling of no escape evoking WOLF CREEKreally grips you..well it did me. It might not be original but it's so damn well made with Uthaug squeezing every bit of dread he can get out of the cold and inhospitable skilodge and Jotunheimen's wintry mountainside..it does take a while for the killer to make his presence known with Uthaug carefully establishing the characters..he even shoots some angles as if through the eyes of the killer peeping in on their conversations before striking. Little things are also expertly presented for later use in the film like a shot gun shell and a keyring with a teddy bear. I hope to see more from this director because his action scenes are briskly filmed with exciting photography capturing the characters as they attempt to stay alive while being stalked extraordinarily well.".

The characters are unlikeable and the story is ridiculous. A bunch of young adults get stranded and find an abandoned hotel in the middle of nowhere where they get murdered one by one by a maniac with a pick axe. Of course they make dumb decision after dumb decision until they meet the uninspired mad man. The movie is tedious and boring. It looks like they had a decent budget for this movie the gore effects were good but the kills were nothing new and with the winter setting the movie is watchable but it is way too basic for me.".

When one of the friends crashes and severely breaks his leg the group is forced to seek shelter in an abandoned ski lodge. There they uncover some secrets of the longlost lodge and begin to fall victim to a pickaxewielding psychopath who seems more than a bit unwelcoming.While the Norwegians haven't ever been known as a real 'powerhouse' in the horror industry they have been making a name for themselves lately with a couple strong showings in the genre. One of these is the snowy thriller 'Fritt Vilt' aka 'Cold Prey.' While the title may sound like Chinglish for the British altrock band don't let that distract you from what is otherwise quite a scary little modern horror. The film starts out well with some truly breathtaking mountain scenery and well shot snowboard action. Moving from the wide expanse of the mountain terrain the fine direction  cinematography head indoors to capture the creepy interior of the mountain lodge. Utilizing the typical abandoned look along with some notsotypical emeents like the charred remains of one room the resort manages to be chillingly decrepit and strikingly beautiful at the same time. Regardless of the great visuals a film like this does need more to work well. Luckily it manages to work in those other areas too. First the story is pretty strong. It kind of felt like a sequel to 'The Shining' in which a group of kids head to the nowclosed Overlook and reap the ghostly vengeance of Jack Torrance. Actually that seems like an idea Hollywood would actually try so let's forget that. Back to this movie. . . the acting is good but not great and some of their fear is completely unconvincing. The writing while spotty in the dialogue on occasion flows well ad is never boring. But the most important element to a horror like this should always be scares and 'Cold Prey' has 'em. With a nice mixture of jump scares creepouts and suspense this Norwegian slasher is actually quite frightening at parts and well worth the look. Overall it is a worthy addition to the genre and should act as a great flick for those long dark winter nights.Final verdict 710.AP3".

But I would compare it to The Thing for the snowy isolation Susperia for the foreign feel and heartpounding suspense and sound effects Mute Witness for the unbelievable chase scenes and Halloween for the intense stalker moments.

	schema:headline " A supremely eerie and effective Norwegian slasher winner";
	schema:reviewBody "Five teenage snowboarders  mature composed takecharge Jannicke superbly played by Ingrid Bolso Berdal nice guy Eirik a fine performance by Thomas Alf Larsen jocular Morten Tobias a wonderfully engaging portrayal by Rolf Kristian Larsen amorous Mikal a solid turn by Endre Martin Midtstigen and Mikal's sweet sexy girlfriend Ingunn the fetching Viktoria Winge  are forced to spend the night in a remote abandoned ski lodge after Morten has an accident and breaks his leg. However there's a deadly and ferocious lunatic hulking behemoth Rune Melby residing in said lodge who naturally doesn't take kindly to any interlopers on his property. Director Roar Uthaug working from a familiar but serviceable script by Thomas Moldestad makes expert and inspired use of the desolate wintry setting both the dingy rundown motel and bleak snowy mountainside landscape evoke a very vivid and palpable sense of dread isolation and vulnerability. Moreover Uthoag takes his time to establish the premise and the genuinely likable main characters before delivering the expected gutwrenching thrills and brutal violence. While the violence featured herein isn't that graphic or gruesome it still manages to pack quite a wallop the protracted murder of Ingunn is especially strong and upsetting. What gives this film an extra edge over the usual slice'n'dice fare is its welcome emphasis on creating a powerfully spooky and unsettling tone the lodge registers as an extremely creepy and claustrophobic place and admirable lack of any dumb silly humor to diminish the severity of the stark and unflinching horror. The last third of this movie is truly tense gripping and harrowing stuff that culminates in a haunting and startling climax the killer even gets a poignant back story. Daniel Voldheim's striking cinematography uses both washedout colors and shadowy lighting well plus offers several breathtaking panoramic shots of the vast mountains. Magnus Beite's shivery score likewise hits the shuddery spot. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "Five teenage snowboarders  mature composed takecharge Jannicke superbly played by Ingrid Bolso Berdal nice guy Eirik a fine performance by Thomas Alf Larsen jocular Morten Tobias a wonderfully engaging portrayal by Rolf Kristian Larsen amorous Mikal a solid turn by Endre Martin Midtstigen and Mikal's sweet sexy girlfriend Ingunn the fetching Viktoria Winge  are forced to spend the night in a remote abandoned ski lodge after Morten has an accident and breaks his leg. However there's a deadly and ferocious lunatic hulking behemoth Rune Melby residing in said lodge who naturally doesn't take kindly to any interlopers on his property. Director Roar Uthaug working from a familiar but serviceable script by Thomas Moldestad makes expert and inspired use of the desolate wintry setting both the dingy rundown motel and bleak snowy mountainside landscape evoke a very vivid and palpable sense of dread isolation and vulnerability. Moreover Uthoag takes his time to establish the premise and the genuinely likable main characters before delivering the expected gutwrenching thrills and brutal violence. While the violence featured herein isn't that graphic or gruesome it still manages to pack quite a wallop the protracted murder of Ingunn is especially strong and upsetting. What gives this film an extra edge over the usual slice'n'dice fare is its welcome emphasis on creating a powerfully spooky and unsettling tone the lodge registers as an extremely creepy and claustrophobic place and admirable lack of any dumb silly humor to diminish the severity of the stark and unflinching horror. The last third of this movie is truly tense gripping and harrowing stuff that culminates in a haunting and startling climax the killer even gets a poignant back story. Daniel Voldheim's striking cinematography uses both washedout colors and shadowy lighting well plus offers several breathtaking panoramic shots of the vast mountains. Magnus Beite's shivery score likewise hits the shuddery spot. Highly recommended.";

It is not an action movie does not have any nudity no car chases no monsters no sex no love triangle no street fighting.. so the average moviegoer will find it lame slow and boring. I like slower movies lets you think as you watch. Diane Lane was good but not super. She has had better no... much better roles. Joseph Cross plays a really creepy bad guy with sick twisted emotions.The movie was not great but is surely was not a bad film. I believe if you are a real fan of Murder mystery police detective films with some thriller thrown in you would or may like this flick. With ONLY 1 Hr. and 40 Mins. if someone complains about length they need to get checked for A.D.D. or they need to stick to teenage comedies like Strange Wilderness or Meet the Spartans.Check this movie out with an open mind don't let the pessimists cloud your idea of this film. It is an innovative film with a good cast and the shots of Portland Oregon are not bad at all. I will actually give this film a 6 12 out of 10.".

Okay I bought this film not knowing what it was and for 3 it is one of the best DVD buys i have made. The story line is unique.... displaying the internet to be a dangerous murder weapon. And the acting is pretty good. The fact the film does not feature an alist celeb maybe puts the film down a bit in some peoples eyes. I think everyone would be buzzing if the bad guy was someone along the lines of Kevin spaceyJohn Malkovich. But thats been done before! People have to learn that a good film does not have to have the cast of oceans 11 to make it a great film.Give it a watch and tell me what you think...definitely deserves a higher rating!".

	schema:reviewBody "So I thought I'd take a break from the Festival and get down to some regular screening of what some would deem as the usual products from the usual assembly line. Untraceable became that movie because the poster here had Ebert giving it a positive rating but everyone else I heard had panned it. Directed by Gregory Hoblit who was at the helm of one of my favourite movies Frequency I thought I'd give it a shot.The premise was interesting enough to appeal to geeks at least some parts of it. A serial killer with the technical knowhow sets up a site and uses the power of the internet as well as the voyeuristic nature of the online denizens to aid in the kills meaning the more hits the site receives during an online live execution the faster the victim will die. Needless to say should he slap an ad on the site it'll rake him enough dough to retire. And the police can't do anything about it because of bureaucratic red tape in terms of jurisdictions and of course the killer being a gifted cracker.In the veins of torture porn movies it does showcase some rather sick though innovative ways of brutally dispatching someone although it doesn't resort to ramping up the gore element unnecessarily. There were some nifty visual effects and makeup but for those weaned on the Saw franchise and its wannabes then Untraceable doesn't provide anything new. So goes the usual clich storyline of cops led by Diane Lane's FBI Agent Jennifer Marsh Colin Hanks' Agent Griffin Dowd and Portland Detective Eric Box BIlly Burke going after the elusive killer whose only presence is online until it becomes personal and hits closer to home with the obvious plot development involving family and friends.But unlike its title there's nothing much untraceable about this hunter and prey game and provides you with very little connection or psychological challenge in outwitting outlasting and outplaying each other. It doesn't attempt to build up the great unknown about the killer in a whodunnit fashion and only weaves through a connection of convenience. However Untraceable does have genuinely tension building moments and you do find yourself sitting at the edge of your seat during certain segments but that's about it as the rest of the time it's just plain sailing in expected waters.I felt that while it had some message to say about online netizens and anonymous chatter in general it doesn't quite achieve what it had set out to do. You get to see snapshots of essentially a chatroom with its mindless discussions and terrible shorthand with typos which probably is something you'd be accustomed to should you visit any chatroom anyway. Also Hollywood still couldn't get away from designing some really snazzy login menus and user interfaces that end users in the real world will probably drool over or laugh at its cumbersomeness.What really plummeted the movie to Bgrade movie territory is the ending. No worries no spoilers here but really it ended with plenty of bravado and the cheese was just too thick to swallow. Seriously watching Diane Lane did whatever she did sent my eyeballs rolling upwards sky high. Promising premise which didn't allow for its plot to keep pace.".

They could have stopped the website by contacting the major internet providers or ICANN and have the domain redirect to a black hole similar to the Pakistani incident involving YouTube a few weeks ago. 2. The little girl has downloaded what seems to be a very obvious Playstation game onto a PC. You can see the fact it's a Playstation game from the control scheme on the screen Circle Square X Triangle. 3. Some of the computers used at work by the agents use trackballs instead of mice. I realize that trackballs look better and more techy but no real hacker uses a trackball. 4. What kind of internet security expert gives full administrator privileges to their daughter on the same computer they keep their work related files Classified. 5. What kind of servers were exploited by this guy. I mean they had like 23 million hits a minute with streaming video. I don't think that the dude infected a YouTube server farm. There is no way that a single server can handle all that traffic. And if there were multiple servers there had to be a way to balance the traffic which would be really tough. Exactly how many computers did he exploit that blocking traffic from all those IPs was not an option. 6. There is no way to hack into somebody's car by remote. It has to be done from the car itself and there is no way to program something like a power outage at a certain time. How did he power the satellite tracking if the entire car had no power ? If the car had no power how was she able to stop and steer the car ? It should be extremely difficult to control a vehicle without power steering and power brakes.I am sure there are other tech glitches I do not remember at this time but I am sure they were not as obvious.I did not enjoy this movie at all because it tried to hard to be technologically correct. I am sure other people will enjoy the movie I thought there was some hope for the movie in the less techy parts.

It was a mystery for about half of the movie but then they just flat out tell you who the killer is which surprised me very much. It changed the entire mood of the film. It went from trying to figure out who the killer is to trying to catch him before he got you first. The ending was excellent. It ended quickly all of a sudden it was over. But I liked it like that because it was shocking and then it was over. The ending was brilliant I would have it no other way.".

It went from trying to figure out who the killer is to trying to catch him before he got you first. The ending was excellent. It ended quickly all of a sudden it was over. But I liked it like that because it was shocking and then it was over. The ending was brilliant I would have it no other way.";

And I'm sure I've seen another movie British Indy made do this subject as well.Basically we've got a psycho killer using the internet to kill people. You've got a female FBI agent working in computer crimes whose stupid enough to be running a wireless network at home and doesn't seem to have educated her daughter towards downloads Trojans spyware or anything else.You'd think she'd at least have all remote access features turned off on her home machine? You'd also think at 8 years old her daughter would have taught not to leave the house in her pyjamas especially if it appears someones filming the house live from the outside.Clearly the very stupid apple doesn't fall very far from the extremely stupid tree.Her partner getting caught and killed is pretty dire to be honest. How did the killer even get a sample of the girlfriends voice? The partner had only met her once.To be honest the killers actual motive for killing the 2 people related to his dad is an extremely tenuous and weak link at best. He has NO motive to kill the FBI guy at all. He knows it's going to lead to his eventual capture.The Female FBI agent is a truly stupid idiot with no brain having called in for help she's told a police car is coming then she returns to her hijacked car and is captured obviously. The trouble there is once the killer takes her car they can track it anywhere using the Onstar system that's built into it whether he'd hacked it or not they could still trace the car  a fact they seemed to overlook.The he disabled the car computer line that's an incredibly huge copout on the writers part there. The fact that the killer is stupid enough to have parked under the bridge where the police can see him is an even huger copout. By now the writer is admitting I haven't got any ideas so I'm going to spoon feed you the ending no matter how awful it is.The idea he took her to her own house to kill her is a super weak idea and obviously she was going to escape. Why he was talking about poisoning her then started feeding her into a shredder?Very weak ending to a generally awful film that wasn't even an original idea or original genre. Done miles better in things like Saw or Cube.".

First is the not so subtle antipiracy theme that repeats a few times throughout the movie. But what makes it worse is that they paint a picture of movie pirates as being iniquitous enough to also steal people's credit card numbers and they are gay weirdos as well. Secondly and maybe not so many people picked up on this was the movie's implications that Net neutrality will lead to these type of sites being created. Third was the line from the FBI agents at the beginning when they found their internet thief based on the fact that he had Gasp registered guns.

It's very funny how the director portrays all American internet surfers to be thirsty for a glimpse of torturous death. Among the plus points Diane Lane performs well but her character is the typical crimefighting single momwidow which one has seen in n number of movies. Colin Hanks gives a natural performance but one wonders why an actor of his calibre chose to play a less significant role in a belowaverage thriller. The same question applies to Ms. Lane. Billy Burke is abysmally wooden and his dialogue delivery is laughable especially when he swears. The swearing while adding to another movie stereotype where the coppers swear a lot feels too forced. Joseph Cross horribly plays the typical teen psycho. There's really nothing else to say. 'Untraceable' has nothing to offer. The only thriller concerning snuff movies that is of high quality is Amenabar's 'Tesis' and 'Untraceable' is nowhere near that.".

Why? I dunno. Somebody capped his daddy or something. Anyway daddy's boy is pied and has his torture and killing devices rigged so that the more people tune in the more hits he gets the greater his victims suffer until they die.This is a movie that would have been more interesting 1520 years ago because then it would have seemed fresh. These days most of us have seen this idea and therefore if you're going to do it you need to recreate it with an interesting imaginative storyline add some fresh twists. Finally if you're not a Diane Lane fan it's quite possible your brain might tinker with unconsciousness during some parts of this movie. My advice is that you wait until you can see it for free. Maybe when it gets to TV sans some of the gore. In this instance you'll probably enjoy it better since we generally have lower expectations for TV. Love Boloxxxi.".

This movie does NOT bail itself out of situations with cheap scares e.g. bursting a loud noise out of nowhere do an extreme closeup so you can't see the surroundings. Also while a lot of scenes situations and decisions by characters in the movie are highly implausible the overall concept and even a few of the scenes are more believable than most of your contemporary thrillers and digital sci fis.Definitely not worth 10.

Despite not even being able to speak Cantonese his acting in this just using facial expression and body language is highly impressive conveying a man of great dignity and command above the real age of Jet Li answering the critics who considered him too young for the role. It must have been a difficult role for him to take on with Kwan TakHing played Wong Fei Hung in around 100 films and Jackie Chan Drunken Master I and II being his predecessors. The story is very complex  possibly a little too complex  and transcends a good many martial arts films whose plots can easily be summed up in a single sentence. Wong FeiHung has to deal with American slavers local gangs a renegade martial arts master and even his own wayward but wellintentioned students. On top of this he has to contend with his growing affection for Aunt Yee Rosamund Kwan which is important as it is set around the end of the 19th century when there were great social changes in China. This is typified with his relationship with his aunt who is not related to him by blood but with whom it would be taboo to marry. The fact that this is a series of films allows the relationship to develop also sets it apart from many Hong Kong films where any romances are usually very fastmoving and unrealistic.The rest of the cast is extremely good slightly more so than later episodes. The wonderfully athletic Yuen Biao plays Leung Foon a trainee actor who wants to learn kung fu to protect himself  it is a shame he allegedly fell out with director Tsui Hark over screen time as his replacement in subsequent films is comic but has not got the martial arts skills. Kent Cheng is perfect for the role of the largerthanlife Lam SaiWing who is Wong Fei Hung's head student. His other students are played with vigour by Jacky Cheung and Yuen KamFai.The villains are suitably colourful and the lead bad guy played by Yam SaiKun is interesting because he is not as twodimensional as he could have been and is almost a double for Wong FeiHung and what he could have become had he gone down the wrong path.The action is superb which is unsurprising considering it is choreographed by Yuen WooPing though critics will still fault the wirework and use of doubles. The final showdown is a masterpiece of editing as Jet Li was injured and had to be doubled for many of the shots that weren't above the waist but his fist techniques make up for this. The film has a long running time for a martial arts flick so for once there is plenty of time for story and action. An honourable mention has to go the music written by James Wong as it is one of the greatest and most memorable of all martial arts theme music.In short they don't come much better than this. People who enjoyed Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon would probably love this and it should also be seen by anyone who has seen Cradle 2 the Grave and thinks Jet Li can't act. The first 2 sequels for this are also warmly recommended.".

Tsui Hark's 'Wong Fei Hung' has already been stretched into several sequels of which I have only seen the first. 'Wong Fei Hung' has all the ingredients to make it an enjoyable epic movie. There is a story with a heart some very well crafted choreography good acting and enough action and culture. It's set on a historical backdrop of a preCommunist China. The characters are very well written with the exception of the nonChinese who act like caricature villains. Jet Li Biao Yuen Rosamund Kwan Jacky Cheung and Kent Cheng all act well. It also presents some taboo elements such as Wong's affection for his 'aunt' it was taboo during the time but this is all skillfully underused which prevents the film from appearing too preachy. The film has several layers but it tries to tackle too many things at once and becomes unnecessarily complicated at some point. The film slightly drags in the first half and the choreography of the action scenes without the main cast looked a little shoddy. Yet the characters are very likable and the story also offers a lot to enjoy that I am looking forward to its sequels. In my humble opinion it's certainly one of the better martial arts films and has a lot more substance than pretentious films like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. the only other Tsui Hark film I've seen is the magnificent 'Chat gim' and I've liked what I've seen so far.".

I think the reason why i initially didn't enjoy it was because i was expecting light entertainment and i just wasn't prepared for a multi layered film such as this. This film marks for director Tsui Hark the peak of his creative genius when he was making this film there was a lot of worry in Hong Kong regarding the 1997 hand over to China Tsui manages to transfer this tension and uncertainty into the film terrificly and he injects each shot with a passion for his nationality and his love for the chinese heros such as Wong FeiHung. The next element of this film that is truly magnificent is the cast each character is given sufficient screen time for complete character arcs Jet Li's acting is done with a level of honour and intensity that has been lacking in every performance he has done since. Yuen Biao has perfected playing these king of roles because he has played many similar roles in the past yet he still manages to bring something new to the role and gives it a fresh twist that is lacking in Max Mok's performance in the sequels. there are also strong performances by Jackie Cheung Rosamund Kwan and Kent Cheng. overall the character that steals the show is master yim i would say he is better than the rest of the cast combined. Now to the point that most people watch kung fu films for the fights the great thing about the fights in this film is that each fight improves on the one before it so there is a visible progression before the end ladder fight which i consider to be the best wire enhanced fight ever put on film.overall i would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a great movie but if you are looking for realistic fighting i would point you in the direction of Bruce Lee's films and the Prodigal Son . please note to get the most out of this film it must be seen in its original language and in its original Widescreen format and it must be seen no less than five times to get an idea of its multi layered complexities".

The angle placement of the camera was always effective and the fight scenes between the hero and his enemies are set up with admirable presence and dignity. Furthermore the editing was bold and crisp for the most part everything flowed very well from one scene to the next. Jet Li was unparalleled in his martial arts glamour. His stern demeanor accentuated his role as a leader and a man of principle.Jet Li played Wong Feihong a doctor who also happened to be renowned for his skill in martial arts. Against his will he became involved in combating the local gang whose rivalry and antagonism was set up by a flimsy pretext. Apparently gang violence usually are created over the most trifle of instances On the one hand Feihong had to deal with the local thugs on the other he had to deal with government officials and foreign mercenaries.Along for the ride were some touching characters playing Wong Feihong's students the stuttering Westerneducated nerd and the formidably huge pork merchant. The addition of Aunt 13 to the cast added shy romance providing a nice contrast to all the fighting and constant strife and chaos.The movie featured a convincing historical backdrop and captured the national Chinese character well at least the 19th century preCommunist era. The music score was very nicely done and complemented the film well. At times the movie evoked as much emotion as the characters themselves.The only problem with this film may be its overly ambitious goals of trying to tackle everything at once. There was the sentiment of saving China from foreign devils as well as the sentiment that China was rotting and corrupt at its core with the Chinese betraying the Chinese. There was also the strong sense of there being too few good men like Wong Feihong with a strong desire to do right by his country. Over all the movie's message was multilayered and complex and can be confusing to the unschooled audience.Still this movie made in 1991 showed off Jet Li's lyrical martial arts grace in full glory and in its best moments takes fighting to a transcendent level.".

Both have the fights much better integrated into the story than the typical action film' from the West. Both have a rather high quality of acting.What I liked about the Woo film was its more intelligent dynamic eye. The camera was choreographed as a character giving a completely different cast to everything. It changes the nature of the narrative and is much more cinematically sophisticated. The score adds.But so far as the sophistication of the story is concerned this is a much deeper and intelligent film. The story is framed in the context of the imposition of western technology into a mature civilization. Movies are a part of that intrusion in fact arguably the most intrusive. So we already have a selfreferential conundrum. It is handled here deftly. The main action is based on a literal stage. That stage incidentally is on a boat and boats figure in other elements of the story. The love interest who really is lovely in a Chinese woman who travels to the west and brings back  guess what  a camera!So we have a play within a play which is a rather wellknown device. I wish the play had been subtitled because I am sure it would have meant something apt. But we also have a much richer device pictures about taking pictures. Our first exposure sorry is Aunt 13 taking a picture which could have killed the subject were it not for the alertness of the hero. I understand the old man who would have been killed would have been understood by a Hong Kong audience as someone who straddles the Chinese and film worlds.Later the central institution is burned at least the building that houses it a combination Confucian healing place and martial arts academy from longstanding tradition. While it burns this woman takes a picture. It is an incredibly rich image intelligent rich lovely deeply bothersome. At another time she arranges for her shadow to caress his.Another element that makes this film rich Jet Li is a real martial artist not just a coached actor. The disciplines of martial art and acting overlap with one amplifying the other.If you've seen the 2001 remake of the Musketeer' you should see this for the original of the ladder fight scene.

This is not to underplay the plot of the movie which is a poignant view of China's cultural identity being chipped away by western invaders.

To say that the action in this movie is awesome is to commit the gross crime of severe understatement.  The final confrontation between Wong Fei Hong and Yen Zhe Don in the forrest of ladders within the American Fort is arguably most electrifying and intense action narrative in cinema history.  Painstakingly detailed and tightly paced it is Martial Arts Action at its finest thanks to the incredible talents of Choreographer Yuen Woo Ping.Most of all Wong Fei Hong is one of the rare films these made these days that is truly about honour and caring about people.  Master Wong represents the courage nobility honour compssion and the sorely lacking justice that our world desperately needs.  Wong Fei Hong is possibly the best role model for our children whose souls are constantly rotted by selfish nasty socalled heroes like Blade and Spawn.  The theme music of this film Be a hero truly brings out the spirit of this nobility and is one of the most moving tunes ever composed.

	schema:reviewBody "Once Upon A Time In China directed by Tsui Hark is often called a classic of the martial arts genre and a great action film. Both of these praises are true. The Cantonese title of the film is actually Wong Fei Hung. It's also the name of the film's protagonist. The story is set at the end of the 19th century in the city of Foshan in China. It's a time when there was great concern about the growing presence of Westerners from America Britain and France. Wong Fei Hung a doctor and martial arts master is approached by the general of the Black Flag Army who tells him that he should train a militia to help protect the coastal town. But things go badly for Wong when he begins to speak out against Western military presence. The local government official becomes angry with Wong. On top of that a local gang called Sha Ho Bang becomes a major nuisance for Wong. They terrorize local businesses and deal with the Americans. The Americans Jackson and his henchman Tiger are working for the SinoPacific company exporting Chinese people to America for slave labor. Another antagonist in the film is Iron Robe Yim a martial arts master who has come to the town to start a martial arts school of his own. To be known as the best in town he challenges Wong Fei Hung to a fight.What makes the film stand out is that it contains lessons in history and morality. Jet Li is charismatic in the role of master Wong. Not only is he righteous and brave but he also possesses great skills in martial arts and medicine. Master Yim on the other hand is almost the exact opposite of Wong he's overconfident corrupt and is not concerned about the wellbeing of other people to achieve his goals. The fights between Yim and Wong are truly spectacular. They have the right balance between realism and fantasy to make them memorable. In addition the fights are very well choreographed. Wirework was used but I didn't care since there's no way to show such fights without it. The film's action scenes influenced many other martial arts films afterward. In contrast to Wong's good practices the film also shows some of the worst of human nature. But in the context of the film it isn't unnecessary violence. We're shown how righteousness and dedication can overcome what's bad. At the heart of the film is a yearning for the old China a China that has withered away because of Western influence. People are blinded by opportunity and the promise of wealth while failing to see the good that's in front of them.Once Upon A Time In China is one of my favourite films. I watch it for entertainment and when I feel uncertain. It's an inspirational film. Since it's one of the most well known Hong Kong releases in the West you've probably already seen it but if you haven't then you should. It's the sort of film that will get you interested in Hong Kong and Chinese cinema.".

And I believe the point at some stage was to contrast soft 'chi' based awareness in the Jet Li character with hard 'iron body' kung fu in the rival master as the difference in karmas they set in motion.

Is there anything soft here internal? The woman. She has come back from the West straddles both worlds. She has come back with a camera which she uses to snap pictures.Her eye is 'soft' stills motion caresses the shadow of the one she loves.

	schema:reviewBody "When most people thinks of martial arts movies the immediate thought will be either a Bruce Lee film or one of his countless imitations that filled the screen through the 70s and part of the 80s. And while it's true that some great films were made in those years it's also sadly true that most were of average quality due not only to their lowbudget but also to the fact that most were cut and awfully dubbed when shipped overseas. Being a patriot and a nostalgic Hong Kong's legendary director Hark Tsui decided to resurrect the martial arts genre in the 90s using one of the most respected Chinese national heroes Wong Fei Hung. Hark's retelling of the life and times of the legendary healer and martial artist became one of the best epic stories ever filmed the series of films known in America as Once Upon a Time in China.In this first chapter of the saga we are introduced to Wong Fei Hung Jet Li and his China a land who by the late 19th Century is discovering the Western civilizations and is forced to open to the world. Made leader of a team of militia warriors Wong Fei Hung discovers that a group of Americans are kidnapping women to send to America as prostitutes. To make things worse another KungFu master Iron Robe Yim Yee Kwan Yan arrives to town and is decided to defeat Wong Fei Hung to prove his martial arts are better. Soon the skilled warrior Wong Fei hung will experience first hand the pros and the cons of the clash of cultures his people and the newly arrived Westerners.Written by Hark himself and his usual team of collaborators the movie is at first sight an overtly nationalistic story of patriotism and Chinese pride however Wong Fei Hung is not only about China as it's more about changes and adaptation than about traditionalism. Through the character of Wong Fei Hung we see a man that is at the same time intrigued and repulsed by changes but that has to make up his mind about if he wants to be the leader and the hero his people needs. Sure at its core it is a tale of the adventures of China's most representative hero but the way the story is written make the story a more complex and interesting one. Literally a story that transcends its own film genre.Wong Fei Hung showcases Hark at his best with his defined style influenced by comic books and the cinema of his youth reaching its full potential and enough creative freedom to make whatever he desired. Hark delivers a film that can not only be seen as another martial arts film but also as the epic journey of a hero facing his most difficult challenge an inner battle with himself. With amazingly choreographed scenes and a great vision for cinematography by a great team lead by Arthur Wong and David Chung Hark creates an epic film on the level of Sergio Leone or John Ford. Wong Fei Hung is a film that surely proves that Hark Tsui is more than a mere director of action films and that the films he did in the U.S. Double Team and Knock Off are not really a display of his talent.Jet Li excels at playing Wong Fei Hung one of the most portrayed character in movie history in a performance that captures the essence of the film without making it over the top. While not exactly faithful to the real Wong Fei Hung's fighting style Jet Li's skills showcase his enormous talent and ability as a fighter and choreographer and every move of his is perfect. Rosamund Kwan plays Siu Qun a young woman who falls in love with Wong Fei Hung but only creates more confusion as while not bloodrelated she is technically her Aunt he calls her Aunt 13th. She adds good humor to the film and makes a great supporting actress to Jet Li.Humor is indeed an important characteristic of the movie and Biao Yuen who surprisingly has little chance to show his fighting skills Jacky Cheung and Kent Cheng make great comedic performances. While not exactly a perfect cast it's safe to say that overall they give a good job although the dubbing for the Westerners is remarkably bad. Wong Fei Hung is probably one of Hark's best films and it's hard to find a flaw in it as it's also one of the best martial arts films ever made. Sure it may feel overlong at times but the film takes advantage of its runtime as almost every detail is of importance and very few scenes feel unnecessary.Once Upon a Time in China or Wong Fei Hung is a mustsee for every fan of martial arts films and a very recommended movie to those who dislike them. The way it transcends its own genre has proved to be influential now after the releases of Wo Hun Cang Long Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Ying Xiong Hero two films that reinvigorated the old Wu Xia genre in the same way this movie did for the martial arts genre. After this Hark found a difficult time in the U.S. and the flops of his two films done there but what he did in this film and its first sequel remains an accomplishment rarely equaled. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This film left me utterly utterly speechless. It completely blew my mind played with it threw it around kicked it beat it into submission and then completely destroyed my perception of all martial arts movies ever. Confused? Let me explain.When someone mentions a martial arts film most think of crap movies with nothing but fight scene after fight scene with no regard for plot or characters. Even if you hear about a 'really good' martial arts film it generally meant it was only as good as its fight scenes. And sometimes that was OK. Sometimes that was all you wanted. You weren't looking for Shakespeare just the stunts. But it also meant that they could never be made into legendary movies. Just immature little diversions. That was the case until back in 1991 when Once Upon A Time In China was released. It became legendary.This became the greatest martial arts movie of all time not just because of the martial arts but because of the fact that it is a genuine MOVIE. The characters are real people with real ambitions and real hopes and dreams. None are stereotypes presented just to be beaten up. The story is perfectly set to the characters. With China being slowly lost to Western culture as the backdrop it provides an amazingly epic and deep well of thought for a type of movie which you would expect to be as mature as an average Pokemon episode.The romance between Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan is also well handled thanks to a strong script and the capability of the actors involved. The music too is excellent mixing a traditional chinese mix with some adrenalin pumping beats to really help you get into the movie.But let us not forget the fight scenes as boy does this move have 'em! There are stunts and moves in this movie that you have never seen before and will never be seen again. How it was accomplished without the modern advent of computer manipulation defies belief but somehow they achieved it and what you see are the greatest martial arts scenes ever put to film. And i'm saying this postMatrix. Never have I seen choreography so perfect seen one brutally efficient swift and elegant move follow one one after the other for so long while I watched captivated drooling forgetting to breathe forgetting to think. forgetting to do anything until it stopped and I realised I had the hugest grin on my face and goosebumps on my arms from enjoying the scene far too much that I am ever possibly meant to. They are that good. And lets not even begin to say what they can do with the ladders. It has to be seen to be believed  no really.Every living human being. Watch this film. You'll wish they were all made this way.".

	schema:headline " This is much more than a Kung Fu Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Wong Fei Hung is a legendary Chinese hero like James Bond whoe has some 90 films about him before this movie.  In fact Jackie Chan plays Wong Fei Hung in Legend of Drunken Master.  So this movie is not merely a kung fu movie. This movie's main theme is of Chinese culture vs Western culture as it is embodied by martial arts vs guns.  How can China remain beautiful in its art that requires years of dedication to master when success can be so cheaply purchased with Western firearms?  Wong Fei Hung must make sense of it somehow and in the end shows that while you can't fight guns with kung fu that kung fu in the right hands can be just as deadly as guns.  It's not the gun... it's the bullets.Woven into this main theme is the theme of a lost sense of Chineseness and lack of communication.  The characters who cut off their queues their symbol of loyalty to the Qing dynasty because of desperation or confusion or ambition.  The ChineseAmerican who cannot read Chinese.  The mistaken Lion dance.Beyond this conflict the movie has countless inside jokes for the fans of Honk Kong cinema.  The trampolines at the end were a tribute to the early kung fu movies that used them before wire techniques were introduced.  The scene where the two disciples have to dress up in the Peking Opera Sammo Hung TV's Martial Law traditionally played the role of the butcher in this series.  He along with the other character who dressed up in the movie were originally trained in Peking opera and form there entered kung fu movies. So it was an inside joke.  The nerdy character is played by one of Hong Kong's most popular pop singers.This movie is simply incredible even though the kung fu is not as satisfying as in some of Jet Li's other movies The Legend and Fist of Legend.

	onyx:emotionText "Wong Fei Hung is a legendary Chinese hero like James Bond whoe has some 90 films about him before this movie.  In fact Jackie Chan plays Wong Fei Hung in Legend of Drunken Master.  So this movie is not merely a kung fu movie. This movie's main theme is of Chinese culture vs Western culture as it is embodied by martial arts vs guns.  How can China remain beautiful in its art that requires years of dedication to master when success can be so cheaply purchased with Western firearms?  Wong Fei Hung must make sense of it somehow and in the end shows that while you can't fight guns with kung fu that kung fu in the right hands can be just as deadly as guns.  It's not the gun... it's the bullets.Woven into this main theme is the theme of a lost sense of Chineseness and lack of communication.  The characters who cut off their queues their symbol of loyalty to the Qing dynasty because of desperation or confusion or ambition.  The ChineseAmerican who cannot read Chinese.  The mistaken Lion dance.Beyond this conflict the movie has countless inside jokes for the fans of Honk Kong cinema.  The trampolines at the end were a tribute to the early kung fu movies that used them before wire techniques were introduced.  The scene where the two disciples have to dress up in the Peking Opera Sammo Hung TV's Martial Law traditionally played the role of the butcher in this series.  He along with the other character who dressed up in the movie were originally trained in Peking opera and form there entered kung fu movies. So it was an inside joke.  The nerdy character is played by one of Hong Kong's most popular pop singers.This movie is simply incredible even though the kung fu is not as satisfying as in some of Jet Li's other movies The Legend and Fist of Legend.  I recommend seeing it on DVD.  That way you can see the original movie with subtitles.  Then you can go back and watch it with a running commentary.  Stay away from the English dubbed version as it cuts scenes from the movie.";

Having many Chinese friends I had heard that Wong Feihung was a really good movie by the way call it Wong Feihung and not Once Upon a Time in China the latter title has nothing to do with anything and the Chinese will have no idea what you're talking about if you call it that.  I saw that it was being released on DVD by Columbia TriStar so I preordered it on Amazon.com.  I had high hopes.  I waited for what seemed like forever for it to come.  It finally came today and I watched it.THIS MOVIE BLEW ME AWAY.I was expecting a really good kung fu movie.  Instead I saw a really good movie period.  Li Lian Jie is phenomenal in Wong Feihung.  Western audiences familiar with only Lethal Weapon 4 and Romeo Must Die have seen only the tip of the iceberg.  Li portrays Master Wong as a dignified and disciplined master and a deft and elegant martial artist.  His supporting cast was excellent as well especially those who did fighting like Yan Yee Kwan as Master Yim.  This movie had a very good plot as well. Stepped on by everyone from the Manchus to the Americans many in Canton rose up against their oppressors.  Wong Feihung despite sympathizing with his countrymen finds himself caught between both sides not to mention various other subissues.Technically this movie is outstanding as well.  The subtitling although it contains a few awkward constructions and isn't always entirely clear is relatively well done.  The cinematography is outstanding.  I always felt like I was a part of the movie a bystander watching events happen.  During combat scenes I never felt like I was straining to see the action.  It was very easy to see from a cinematic point of view Li however is frequently too fast to see regardless of cinematography!.This movie puts Hollywood action movies to shame especially by martial arts wannabes like JeanClaude Van Damme.  I hope that further releases of Li's material here in the US will help to gain him a spot in Western cinema. This movie proved to the East that he is a spectacularly talented individual and I hope that this and his other Hong Kong movies will do the same here in the West.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever flaws may be technically possible to dissect in this admirable epic its thematic quality is without dispute. It has heart logic a lighthearted and yet probing respect for its venerable past and while the violence is still way over the top its presentation of ideas ultimately redeems it excess in this area. While director Tsui Hark may or may not have intended to present this struggle between ideas and force to be this meaningful or open to interpretation from such various viewpoints this is nonetheless the case.This is the story of Wong FeiHung a great doctor martial arts instructor and Confucian. Naturally it is a glamorized version of a real man and his actual life. But there is a feeling that what we see on film for all its splendid choreography and the slapstick antics of its sometimes twodimensional characters as the supporting cast and its often one dimensional villains is deeply rooted in authentic detail regarding the texture of Chinese society and the truth of competing Western and Eastern cultural aspirations.One could easily conclude that ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA takes on too much and tries to do too much with its themes and multilayered plot and story. But quite frankly that is what I find most appealing and heroic about its aesthetic stance. That Wong FeiHung is a National Folk Hero comparable to Muhammud Ali and Albert Schweitzer is without question. He appears in history as a man of considerable ability and skills and I was surprised to discover that over a hundred films have been made about him from the early days of cinema until now. Therefore it is easy to see how he has evolved from a simple man wishing in his own way to practice healing and the martial arts with a philanthropic spirit to a figure of myth and legend.I found Jet Li to be quite excellent as this modern era version of Wong FeiHung. I noted that this film among its sequels is primarily responsible for what is considered a Golden Age in Hong Kong cinema. I can easily see why. It strains at the conventions of the traditional Kung Fu film and bursts through such bonds to leave something quite new in its wake. The fight scenes are all wonderful in their blood curdling awful symmetrical splendor and the ending is like something out of a silent Buster Keaton movie. Rosamund Kwan's portrayal of Aunt 13 is graceful and beautiful as she presents to us a lady of learning class and distinction. She in her own way comes across as much a heroine as WongFeiHung does a culture hero in this epic helping him to understand the attractions of Western knowledge and technology as well as the perils of its inclination towards destruction and death in the politics of the time.I found it a great thrill and honor to view a film that adventures to compare and contrast the customs and manners of Western and Eastern societies much as Confucius would. There is a dazzling showcase of many of the arts and modes of knowledge of China in this piece to festoon and decorate the martial valor on display. Besides the visceral enjoyment of the extravagant fighting one also gets the feeling one is visually learning a lot about China as a milieu in many respects. Much like the first IP MAN with Donnie Yen this film purports to be a martial arts flick but proves itself to be so much more. Perhaps as Wong FeiHung suggests at the end we are standing on gold right here.".

	schema:headline " Jack Smith's Masterpiece of Sexual Perversion and Dionysian Art";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack Smith's 1963 short Flaming Creatures might be one of the most sexual perverse film ever made.  It has ever amount of sexual deviance that made up the New York underground in the 1960's transexuals SM lines such as do they make a lipstick that doesn't come off when you s c? drug use and a radically innovative orgy scene that plays more like a Greek tragedy than a work of pornography. On the surface Flaming Creatures appears to be art at its lowest but a closer examination of the film proves that Flaming Creatures is not only high art but a siminal piece of film in the cannon of The New American Cinema.  Filmed on top of Smith's New York  studio on a basic 16mm camera Flaming Creatures embodies the true independent spirit of The New American Cinema.  The orgy scene in the film is perhaps the greatest combination of art and film.  The creatures as Smith puts them engage in a rapeorgy scene of sailors and a transexual.  The orgy plays like a tragic meeting the old America with the freshly  birthed new morality in America.  What is even more remarkable is the earthquake caused Smith's shaking camera at the end of the orgy.  It as if the world is opening up on Smith's creatures and swallowing them and all their perversions.  No one can deny that Flaming Creatures is a difficult film to watch both in its content and deep artistic meanings but the spirit of the film is the reason it should be preserved for generations to come.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jack Smith's 1963 short Flaming Creatures might be one of the most sexual perverse film ever made.  It has ever amount of sexual deviance that made up the New York underground in the 1960's transexuals SM lines such as do they make a lipstick that doesn't come off when you s c? drug use and a radically innovative orgy scene that plays more like a Greek tragedy than a work of pornography. On the surface Flaming Creatures appears to be art at its lowest but a closer examination of the film proves that Flaming Creatures is not only high art but a siminal piece of film in the cannon of The New American Cinema.  Filmed on top of Smith's New York  studio on a basic 16mm camera Flaming Creatures embodies the true independent spirit of The New American Cinema.  The orgy scene in the film is perhaps the greatest combination of art and film.  The creatures as Smith puts them engage in a rapeorgy scene of sailors and a transexual.  The orgy plays like a tragic meeting the old America with the freshly  birthed new morality in America.

Smith was something of a character in the NYC underground art and film scene of the 50's and 60's. He was also an out and proud gay man in both his life and art. Shot in black and white on overexposed stock and using a lot of roving soft focus closeups there's no plot at all here. It's just a lot of Smith's friends mostly men with at least one or two women in cheap dimestore drag posing and gyrating and laying in piles of each other on the floor. Oh and there's a ton of graphic male and female nudity and a lengthy sexual assault scene. This is rough Xrated stuff and I was rather stunned that it was on YouTube. This caused a lot of furor in the 60's with multiple arrests as a result of its exhibition.That notoriety may be a reason it's in the book although some critics state that it has a transcendent beauty. To me it was just selfindulgent garbage. It has also been posited that it's a precursor to the John Waters school of outrageous shockcamp. That may be but Waters does that material much better. This runs 42 minutes and only its brevity saved it from a 110 rating from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though every film on this list is supposed to have some kind of importance in the history of movie making I have struggled to find merit in a number of the pictures I have watched. Some films like Dog Star Man were made from interesting ideas. While others like Jack Smith's Flaming Creatures do not seem to have any redeeming qualities at all. Flaming Creatures is a film like none that I have ever seen. It is perverted trashy and important only because it helped define cinematic vulgarity.Flaming Creatures was directed and written by the provocative filmmaker Jack Smith. Here is a man that had no interest in entertaining the masses. I am not sure that his films could even entertain himself. He was a major proponent in simple aesthetics. He was the godfather of the underground film world and he is credited with creating the dragqueen culture as we now know it. Smith was also a major influence on the films of Andy Warhol and the movies of John Waters. All of his films with Flaming Creatures being the most incendiary were shot under incredibly small budgets. But Smith was never worried about how much money it cost to make a movie.According to underground legend Smith filmed Flaming Creatures on stock film that he had actually shoplifted. It has also been said that he paid his actors in either gay sex or drugs. True or not this still remains one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen. It is a parade of campqueens transvestites hermaphrodites and prostitutes mixed in with the occasional flaccid penis or saggy breast. There is no noticeable story being told but Smith had said that his work was showing you a comedy set in a haunted music studio. I must have missed this because all I saw was the showing of some very questionable acts amongst one of the cheapest looking sets I have ever seen.If I have to give this film any credit I will say that the images were exhaustively challenging for my poor Midwestern eyes. I was made uncomfortable almost immediately and I would go as far as to say I was disgusted at times. Flaming Creatures is one of the most emotionally disturbing works in film that I have seen. But it does not frighten you. It uses music and absurd imagery to make you uncomfortable. You would have to be a pretty weird person to not be challenged by Jack Smith.In one of the only secular moments of Flaming Creatures we see an actress getting raped by way of cunnilingus. We are treated to the intense visual of a woman being held down and violated by more than one male figure. Of course these men are naked and performing all sorts of hand acts on each others limp penises. This type of perverted sexuality becomes normality throughout the 45 minute running time. It is not an easy film to sit through.Obviously any film that features this type of rough imagery comes with loads of controversy. In fact Flaming Creatures was seized by New York police directly following its debut screening. Along with Jack Smith the film became a target of the infamous idiot Strom Thurmond during his crusade to end all pornography. Do not get confused  this is not a pornographic film. It is a classic work in performance art. And though we would all love to pretend that this genre does not existwe still know that it does. And in terms of successful endeavors in the genre  Flaming Creatures isn't really all THAT bad. I will never watch it again but some esteemed opinions like Frederico Fellini hail this picture as a masterpiece in trash cinema.Yes Jack Smith may be an under credited influence on the Waters' and Warhol's of the world but this does not make his films entertaining in any conventional sort of the word. This is the type of film that a pedophile would enjoy. And though I defend Smith's right to make trash I also understand why the backlash forced him to withdraw from making films. Smith would go on to become a major pioneer in surrealist theatre. He worked in this field until his death of AIDS related complications in 1989. He was 56 years old.".

Even for experimental underground cinema it comes across as really weird and unsettling.The first half is easily the highlight. The notorious rape sequence is one of the most fcking crazy and disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed. The chaotic atmosphere is only boosted by Smith's drunkenly soaring camera capturing the ear piercing shrieking of the film's creatures.The second half is less compelling but still interesting. It is the much more positive and comical half as the creatures joyously dance with one another behind old pop music. It is entertaining and amusing to an extent despite dragging on a bit.Most people probably will not enjoy this little oddity nearly as much as I have which is totally okay. This movie is so damn bizarre graphic unsettling confusing and chaotic that it is almost surprising that ANYONE could appreciate it that is not mentally ill. However I did manage to find much within Jack Smith's mad masterpiece to adore.".

	schema:headline " My Name Is Bruce Entertaining Funny A Definite Must For BC Fans!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was extremely fortunate to obtain a ticket to the very first screening of My Name Is Bruce during the Ashland Independent Film Festival in Southern Oregon. Bruce appeared there in person and he was as charming funny and charismatic as his alter egos on screen. It was a real privilege! Before and after the show Bruce talked a bit about how making a film in one's hometown how great it was for him to be able make a film and sleep in his own bed for the first time in 10 years and that you don't need a big Hollywood studio and a big blockbuster budget to make a good movie everyone can enjoy. He proved his point completely with the screening of this film. My Name Is Bruce was filmed entirely on located in the Rogue Valley casting locals in many of the major roles who all did a wonderful job. No big celebrity names exotic locations or blue screen studios were necessary in making this a real good movie. But enough patting on the back. If you love any of the Evil Dead movies if you've ever loved him as the dashing king of thieves in Xena Warrior Princess or if you've just been charmed by his delightful cameos in the Spiderman films you will LOVE My Name Is Bruce! Even if you don't know that much about Bruce Campell and you just happen to be a fan of BMovies I still think you will enjoy this movie. Everything we love about Bruce is played so well over the top you can't help but laugh yourself silly! Bruce takes no mercy in making fun of himself  in this film he's a washed up boozing Cmovie actor who's just finalized his divorce making horrible alien movie sequels while treating his devoted fans like crap the scene where he kicks a fan in a wheelchair down a hill  PRICELESS  but just one of many! This of course all done in comedic good taste. None of this could be considered is autobiographical and it's far from some cheesy Lifetime channel ohpityme the Bruce Campbell story special. As Bruce beats himself up we all laugh our bums off. Then there is of course the evil monster QuanDi who's chops peoples' heads off in a cool Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon style. I would also like to add by the way that this Chinese God of Bean Curd has his own folksong sung by two humble guitar players and it's a rather catchytune. Quite frankly if you don't leave the theatre singing Quan You Quan Me Quan Di... well then I just don't know what to say to you.  The violence in this movie is very much like what you may find in the Evil Dead movies. There's much homage from that. Something else in this movie that's ubercool and cult fans will enjoy Ted Raimi... Is... EVERYWHERE in this film. He has as far as I could count three different significant roles which are both delightful and hilarious to watch. The movie also takes some of its strength from the two main supporting roles the plucky fan boy who practically worships Bruce Campell whose name I can't remember at the moment and his mother played by Grace Thorsen. I should note that what I saw was a rough cut of the film not entirely finished so I don't know the names of all the actors because there were no opening and closing credits. So sorry for now plucky fan boy who worships Bruce Campell. I thought you were very good but I can't remember your name. And kudos to the actor who played QuanDi who's physical characterizations behind the mask made him more than just another monster. In conclusion when there is a final cut and it lands in theaters in October do go see it. It was quite an entertaining film and well worth seeing it on the big screen. I would write more because this movie ROCKED in practically every detail but I fear I'd be giving too much away. Just take my word for it it's groovy baby. Go see it.".

Before and after the show Bruce talked a bit about how making a film in one's hometown how great it was for him to be able make a film and sleep in his own bed for the first time in 10 years and that you don't need a big Hollywood studio and a big blockbuster budget to make a good movie everyone can enjoy. He proved his point completely with the screening of this film. My Name Is Bruce was filmed entirely on located in the Rogue Valley casting locals in many of the major roles who all did a wonderful job. No big celebrity names exotic locations or blue screen studios were necessary in making this a real good movie. But enough patting on the back. If you love any of the Evil Dead movies if you've ever loved him as the dashing king of thieves in Xena Warrior Princess or if you've just been charmed by his delightful cameos in the Spiderman films you will LOVE My Name Is Bruce! Even if you don't know that much about Bruce Campell and you just happen to be a fan of BMovies I still think you will enjoy this movie. Everything we love about Bruce is played so well over the top you can't help but laugh yourself silly! Bruce takes no mercy in making fun of himself  in this film he's a washed up boozing Cmovie actor who's just finalized his divorce making horrible alien movie sequels while treating his devoted fans like crap the scene where he kicks a fan in a wheelchair down a hill  PRICELESS  but just one of many! This of course all done in comedic good taste. None of this could be considered is autobiographical and it's far from some cheesy Lifetime channel ohpityme the Bruce Campbell story special. As Bruce beats himself up we all laugh our bums off. Then there is of course the evil monster QuanDi who's chops peoples' heads off in a cool Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon style. I would also like to add by the way that this Chinese God of Bean Curd has his own folksong sung by two humble guitar players and it's a rather catchytune. Quite frankly if you don't leave the theatre singing Quan You Quan Me Quan Di... well then I just don't know what to say to you.  The violence in this movie is very much like what you may find in the Evil Dead movies. There's much homage from that. Something else in this movie that's ubercool and cult fans will enjoy Ted Raimi... Is... EVERYWHERE in this film. He has as far as I could count three different significant roles which are both delightful and hilarious to watch. The movie also takes some of its strength from the two main supporting roles the plucky fan boy who practically worships Bruce Campell whose name I can't remember at the moment and his mother played by Grace Thorsen. I should note that what I saw was a rough cut of the film not entirely finished so I don't know the names of all the actors because there were no opening and closing credits. So sorry for now plucky fan boy who worships Bruce Campell. I thought you were very good but I can't remember your name. And kudos to the actor who played QuanDi who's physical characterizations behind the mask made him more than just another monster. In conclusion when there is a final cut and it lands in theaters in October do go see it. It was quite an entertaining film and well worth seeing it on the big screen. I would write more because this movie ROCKED in practically every detail but I fear I'd be giving too much away. Just take my word for it it's groovy baby. Go see it.";

If you're not a Bruce Campbell fan then you're probably not reading this post so I'll move on.An ancient Chinese deity is set free a small Southern Oregon town a town Bruce Campbell calls the sequel to Deliverance at one point and the townsfolk and yes they are folk decide to enlist the help of Bruce Campbell to stop the evil force. Bruce however believes the whole thing to be an elaborate hoax and plays along.This movie is funny but it's two kinds of funny here. There are the jokes that anybody can sit down and enjoy and then there are the in references that only Bruce fans can really enjoy. And there are a lot of ins I don't envy the person who has to do the trivia section for this one. Some are from his more famous works Evil Dead Army of Darkness etc. and will only truly be appreciated by the hardest of the hard core Mindwarp McHale's Navy.I can't really discuss much of the technical merits of the film since my screening was done on an early edit. There were no special effects the music was of the standin variety and some of the sound effects sounded like they had come from a Warner Bros. cartoon also standin. However the movie's slant toward the realm of the Bmovie makes these quirks seem perfectly in place. I still enjoy myself despite them and the movie might have taken on a whole new charm because of them. I'll have to check out a clean version to be sure.In conclusion if you're a Bruce Campbell fan you're going to see this movie regardless of what you read here however I'll save you the anxiety and say you won't be disappointed in the least. If you're not a huge fan this movie is still worth a viewing since it's comedy could be seen as ripping on the horror genre in general and in a far superior way than the Scary Movie trilogy ever did.".

Some of the injokes are slightly clever having Sandweiss play Cheryl the same character's name she had in Evil Dead while others are just too blunt and insult the audience's intelligence. Other references such as I worked with Sam Raimi just seem thrown in for good measure. I understand the point was to reference Campbell's past films but it wasn't subtle at all and seemed poorly thought out.Bruce Campbell is Bruce Campbell so if you like him you will like this film. That's pretty much all there is to say about that. He directed it he stars in it and he had a strong guiding hand in the writing process. You get the best of Campbell and the worst in this film... and don't forget for every good Campbell film Army of Darkness there are at least two bad films.I had the privilege of catching a screening in Madison with Campbell himself on hand for questions and answers. This really made the experience special but did not make me feel any better about the film. The audience generally seemed to laugh more than I did so maybe I'm in the minority. But when Bruce answered questions he didn't offer any reassurance that he cared much about the film... if anything his appearance seemed to suggest he felt he couldn't sell tickets without a gimmick.I received a DVD copy in the mail as part of my reviewing duties and gave it a second viewing. In all fairness I en joyed the film much more the second time having a better sense of what sort of humor and style the film would be going for. My suggestion is this if you're a Campbell fan pick up a copy. If not you'll want to see other Campbell films first to really appreciate this one. Luckily for the people who made this film there are plenty of Bruce Campbell fans to see this one with a smile on their face.".

Dumbst teenagers whom are messing around in a graveyard built for Chinese people who mined gold in the town of Gold Lick Oregon unleash the Chinese war deity Guan Di.The film then cuts to Bruce on the set of his latest movie Cave Alien 2. A fan then kidnaps Bruce thinking he is the only one who can stop Guan Di and brings him to Gold Lick in order to save them from the monster. Bruce thinks this is an elaborate joke and plays along until he finally sees Guan Di.The movie is filled with laughs which I think only Bruce fans will enjoy. But if you are a Bruce fan as I am you will be laughing throughout the whole movie.Although this was an unfinished version I saw it was still incredibly satisfying.

I won't say that I'm quite a part of the crowd that idolises the Evil Dead star but I am a fan of his and his mere presence is generally enough to make me want to see a movie no matter how bad it sounds. I decided that I was going to go into My Name is Bruce and rate it solely on how good it is rather than based on the fact that Bruce Campbell is in it and overall I certainly wasn't disappointed as My Name is Bruce is a thoroughly entertaining and hilarious comedy horror that is sure to delight anyone that is willing to enjoy the movie for what it is or for the fact that Bruce Campbell is in it. The film focuses on Bruce Campbell who plays an over the top version of himself. He's down and out and tired of starring in rubbish low budget horror. Meanwhile a young kid who loves Bruce Campbell so much that he uses Army of Darkness quotes to pick up women without much success unwittingly unleashes a vengeful demon and the townsfolk see the actor as their only means of survival.Much of the movie's humour is focused around Bruce Campbell and the actor is certainly willing to laugh at himself. I doubt the actor in real life much resembles his character in this film but even so I don't think there are many Hollywood stars or 'stars' out there that would for example drink liquor out of a dog bowl while playing themselves. The fact that its Bruce Campbell playing Bruce Campbell is the brunt of the movie to such an extent that the rest of it almost comes off like an afterthought but since most fans will go into this movie wanting that and Campbell clearly made this movie purely for those people that was always to be expected. The monster in the movie is a Chinese demon and it really looks ridiculous but in a fun campy sort of way. The film features plenty of death scenes although unfortunately most of them are not particularly bloody. I have to say that the film doesn't really capture the manic style of the Evil Dead trilogy despite featuring some lines of dialogue actors and scenes from said films but the film has its own style and it works well. Obviously the story has no depth at all but it just wouldn't be proper to criticise it for things like that and overall I have to admit that I really liked this film a lot and I'm sure that my fellow Bruce CampbellLow budget horror fans will too.".

I have to say that the film doesn't really capture the manic style of the Evil Dead trilogy despite featuring some lines of dialogue actors and scenes from said films but the film has its own style and it works well. Obviously the story has no depth at all but it just wouldn't be proper to criticise it for things like that and overall I have to admit that I really liked this film a lot and I'm sure that my fellow Bruce CampbellLow budget horror fans will too.";

You just got to let go and have a good time and ride with the movie. Don't get deep or analytical just enjoy it.

	schema:reviewBody "I found it mildly entertaining but I wouldn't pay to see it again and I would have certainly felt cheated seeing this in a theater. So we have infamous Bmovie actor Bruce Campbell playing a parody of his reallife self who gets recruited despite himself to stop a real Chinese demon in a small hick town by people who believe he's a real hero. One should give Campbell props for portraying himself as an egocentric boozing jackass living in a rundown trailer car but it seems like a missed opportunity not to have had other real life actors portraying parodies of themselves. We recognize Ted Raimi Joxer from Xena but he's playing fictional characters 3 of them 2 of them ethnic caricatures.What I liked most was the so bad they're good pick up lines by Bruce as well as his usual corny wisecracks. The physical humor wasn't so great and often felt forced. However the part just after his first real confrontation with the Chinese demon and the ensuing shooting was pretty funny. The stuff with the old lady also. The actress playing the country barmaid played it straight and was rather impressive. No one else really came out as memorable. What I liked the least were the musical interludes by two guys singing the obligatory exposition plot points. For those into that the movie is far from gory no spurts of blood even but there are plenty of funny quick decapitations. It's not really scary in any way but I don't think it was intended to be. The Chinese demon looks rather cheap at first but weirdly he grows on you with his red eyes and flowing white beard. If you're a fan of Bruce Campbell in any way he's done much better stuff. You're probably going to be disappointed but it could be worse. If you don't know Bruce Campbell at all then I don't think this movie would appeal to you unless you love Bmovies even C I'd say and you watch it with a bunch of friends in the same mindset.Rating 5 out of 10 average".

The Evil Dead 2... The Army of Darkness... Bubba Hotep... the guy who cameos in all the Spiderman films... the portly alco in Burn Notice. If you don't know the legend that is Bruce stop reading this review right now! Do not pass Go. Do not collect 200. Do not attach a chainsaw to your severed hand and sliceup zombies with it.My Name Is Bruce is definitely a film for the fans.The plot is simple. When an obsessed Bruce Campbell fan Jeff Taylor Sharpe unwittingly unleashes the Chinese God of War and bean curds go figure upon the small Oregon town of Goldlick the teenager attempts to enlist his screen idol Campbell into fighting the monster. Of course in typical Campbell style our smartaleck actor is under the impression that the whole thing is just one giant birthday prank set up by his agent Mills Toddner Ted Raimi. Hilarity is bound to ensue  at least that would be the plan.The film opens with a brief country tune from the mayor and police chief of Goldlick outlining the legend of GuanDi a scene reminiscent of the indie zombie comedy Dead and Breakfast. From this point we are thrust into the Bgrade schlock that is My Name Is Bruce  immediately introduced to our diehard Bruce Campbell fan Jeff a guy so obsessed that he can't seem to get laid due to 'the Bruce Cambell factor'. You'll know exactly what that means once he opens his mouth... well that and the fact that he dresses like a emo tool. Within the first few minutes I almost wanted to eat a gun  every word that came out of Jeff's mouth was just a rehash of a Bruce Campbell line lines that had already been rehashed about a million times in popular culture over the last decade. It was 'groovy' this and 'give me some sugar baby' that. Christ it was so bad that I was almost about to reach for the remote control  I knew that it was meant to be a spoof but man this was painful. Fortunately I endured. Once you make it through the godawful setup My Name Is Bruce starts to become a lot of fun.Jeff finally drops the annoying dialog the monster goes about its job of decapitating anyone it can find our hero Bruce is introduced the love interest Grace Thorsen is introduced the injokes start flying and even our old mate Ted Raimi pops in to pull his usual multicharacter caper. Clearly the screenwriter Mark Verheiden has done his Bruce homework. While I'm not sure how much of the final product was influenced by Bruce Campbell's direction the film has all the trappings of a dodgy Bgrade piece of crap  the sort of junk you would embarrassingly rent from your local video store wearing a brown trench coat baseball cap and a pair of dark sunglasses. Yes that scary bottomoftheshelf territory inhabited by the likes of Dolph Lungren Steven Seagal and yep you guessed it Bruce Campbell. It's all there bad acting cheesy dialog cheesy special effects an even cheesier monster the semihot love interest the reluctant antihero. It's the bread and butter for men like BC. Some of the most memorable scenes and lines from the film derive from a sort of Simpsonsstyle humor.  START POTENTIAL SPOILERS There's an amusing scene where the townsfolk confront GuanDi in the forest and once Campbell finally works out that the monster is real he decides to retreat  fleeing as he fires his gun wildly behind him. In the process he accidentally takes out a heap of innocent townsfolk with each shot often to the screams of 'arg my ear!' or 'I got hit!'. Worth a chuckle. There's also another classic Simpsonsstyle scene where Campbell jumps into the back of a random passing truck in order to flee town all the while cursing the idiots who live there only to have the truck pull into a car park about ten metres down the road.  END POTENTIAL SPOILERS It's not exactly highbrow but you could do a lot worse. Combine this humor with numerous selfdeprecating digs at Campbell ala 'and McHale's Navy sucked!' there's certainly enough laughs to fill the running time.Like I said at the start of this review My Name Is Bruce is wholly and solely aimed at Bruce Campbell fans. Don't even think about renting or watching this film if you've never seen one of his films  there's just so many selfreferences and injokes packed into eightodd minutes of running time that at least 80 of the fun will go straight over your head. Sure it might be a mildly amusing but really your time is probably better spent familiarizing yourself with the masterworks of Bruce Campbell i.e. go watch The Evil Dead instead.www.youseenthat.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a scary Bruce Campbell fan but enjoy seeing him in really anything as he always is everready to inject some humor into whatever vehicle he stars in or even just appears in. After seeing BubbaHoTep I soon found out that he has real acting talent though it is not so evident in this film that parodies Campbell's lifea fictionalized one and his career and his fan base I might add. In a small mining town called Goldlick a Chinese demon is freed by curious teens in an old cemetery. One of the boys is a huge Campbell fan and eventually sets off to Campbell's abodea dilapidated trailer in the middle of the woodsyes it is indeed a fictionalized account of his lifeto bring Campbell to Goldlick to defeat the demon. It is a fun movie and really nothing else than a chance to see Campbell give his fans what they want to see  him mugging his way through each and every scene interacting with the other actors in some real funny dialog and plot scenarios that at least incorporate some of the Campbell mythos if you will. This film is for Campbell fans as they are the only ones that will get much of the humor. That's okay. It is for them. Some I suspect will be disappointed at the really tame and almost sweet nature of the film. Campbell says and does inappropriate things but you never get the feeling he is meanspirited in any way. Much of his humor is solely lampooning himself and more often his very real work resume. I found myself laughing regularly throughout though the film is silly throughout. Campbell delivers as does most of the cast. The gal playing his love interest Grace Thorsen is a real looker to boot. Campbell shows he has ability for creativity beyond his acting as he also directs the movie. The Chinses demon is impressive for the special effects usedobviously not a huge budget here. The best part of the film for me doesn't even have Campbell in it. The two minstrels that open the filmthe mayor and the sheriff of the town playing guitars and singing the Ballad of GuanDi and periodically pop up throughout the picture had me rolling as they sand so seriously and one in foreground and one in the background and walked and sang through the woods. Very clever and very funny!".

To escape this fate I employ little tricks to slip under the radar. Tricks such as not putting a picture of myself on my website paying for everything with cash avoiding jury duty and stealing cookware from Sears when I ran out of cash last weekend.Alas I was still recognized.I was at the Department of Motor Vehicles where I go every six months to update the photograph on my driver's license. I had an arrangement with the lady behind the counter that when my license was ready instead of calling my name she would call once like a Wood Owl and thrice like a Sagehen and then wink across the room at me. Yet when it was time she bellowed Tom Thayer loud and clear as day.She was probably taking revenge on me for calling her chunky. I accepted my license and as I turned to leave the DMV my path to freedom was blocked by a chunky man with black hair. The man inquired about my name and about the website.Actually I told him It's pronounced 'Guy Who Reviews Movies.' And yes that's me.Wow this is incredible. Everyone in the industry loves you.And what industry would that be? I silently prayed for garment industry.Uhh... film.Damn. Maybe next time.I don't like wasting time especially if the chances that our interaction will yield insider deals on garments are slim to none. I made up an excuse to leave.I have to leave because... I need to get... a new... hamburger?I'm not very good at making up excuses.Wait. My name is Bruce Campbell. He paused as if he expected me to recognize his name. Maybe we had met at a party. I talk to a lot of people at parties mostly to solicit loans. I find that people are more willing to give you loans at a party. Maybe he was coming to collect on a loan.I'm sorry I don't have money...Once again he appeared confused. I'm an actor and director.Uh huh.I'd love it for you to see an advance screening of my new movie My Name is Bruce.I quickly agreed desperate to get out of there as I suddenly found myself craving hamburgers. I regretted my decision later that week when I found myself sitting in the theatre wondering what kind of megalomaniac names a movie after himself.My Name is Bruce is the story of a sad blackhaired chunky man and his darkhaired chunky friends and their misadventures in the modern world. That lady from the DMV was also in it as one of the chunky friends. In fact I think the entire movie was actually shot at the DMV. The production value was practically nonexistent. The plot was mediocre and not very funny. And although it was presented as a true story it was very hard to believe.Visit me at httpguywhoreviewsmovies.blogspot.com".

A lot of reviews are of the just turn your brain off and you'll have a good time variety. I respectfully disagree. Knowing you're making a silly unbelievable movie doesn't absolve you from making the funny funny and the scary scary. Midway through the movie it felt like Bruce was telling us through his movie that he thinks we're all idiots and he wasn't going to try to make this movie as interesting as it could be because we'll sit through anything...without recognizing that his usual attempt to elevate what he does is WHY we give him the benefit of the doubt.

The townsfolk think he is the answer to all their problems but it only takes one confrontation for Campbell to realise that the monster is very real very deadly and very much not his problem.It is only recently that I was taken totally by surprised by JCVD which is similar it concept to My Name is Bruce in how it twists reality into a film but also keeps it reality. JCVD was pretty good and I was looking forward to Bruce Campbell's film hoping that it would be good in a different way. From the start it is clear that the focus here is on selfmockery rather than selfexamination as we get ourselves a cheesy monster bmovie in the mould of Campbell himself. The potential for selfreferential fun is high but sadly the film never really gets to it as it settles in at a much lower level. The focus is on simply pratfalls and gags and the digs at Campbell are affectionate and general rather than barbed. I'm not saying that the film needed to be Deconstructing Harry because it didn't just that the material is far too broad to make it stick in the memory.Verheiden's script is mostly to blame but having Campbell as director doesn't help a great deal as he isn't Sam Raimi and he does inject much into his film to raise it above the basics. This is not to say that I didn't find the film to be quite enjoyable but just that it is pretty base considering what it could have done. The good thing is that many viewers will be coming to it out of affection for Campbell and this sense of affection will carry them far enough to make the film feel OK. The monster effects are suitably cheesy and the narrative arch is OK. Campbell does a good job as himself playing to the Ash personae as well as being an ass in a way that I'm sure he is not. The supporting cast are not that good but do the job and I suppose they do fit with the overall creation of reality as a bad bmovie.My Name is Bruce is sadly not a great film but it just about levels out at being OK if you are in the mood for it. The concept is great but the delivery is too basic with a heavy reliance on physical comedy and basic jokes that are not that funny. The affection many viewers including myself will feel for Campbell will help it but it is not as smart nor as funny as it should have been.".

The only problem. . . after years of seeing the news  clips  trailers many hopes have been inflated. It wouldn't take much to disappoint them. Luckily with Bruce in front of and behind the camera we all had confidence we would be perfectly satisfied. While it wasn't the 'perfect' satisfaction we were looking for it's still quite good. When it comes to comedyhorror films you need to look at the film from both angles The horror  the humour. In many cases the horror will be forgotten and it will become a comedy with horror elements see 'Scary Movie'. The best horrorcomedies to me are ones that master both see 'Shaun of the Dead'. With 'My Name Is Bruce' I don't think it even made an attempt to capture any horror as the horror elements were almost nonexistent. Throw in a few more demons or some zombies or something. . . I mean one little old god? That's all we get? Yeesh. Regardless without horror it still plays well as a comedy mostly through Bruce's interaction with the people. It's his dialogue  facial expressions that get the laughs since many of the visual jokes fall flat. Beyond the writing it's hard to judge this film on much else. The direction seemed purposely cheesy as the film was purposely cheesy. . . so we'll ignore the many flaws of it. The acting was pretty bad outside of Bruce  Ted Raimi who was a riot but who needs anyone else other than those two? All in all it's nowhere near a film to be taken seriously and it is an entertaining  fun ride.

	schema:reviewBody "Fanboy is a term used to describe any individual who is devoted to a single subject in an emotional or fanatical manner or to a single point of view within that subject often to the point where it is considered an obsession.There was a day when I considered myself a Bruce Campbell fanboy. I've seen 90 of his movies own posters and even a talking Bruce Campbell doll. Hell I just remembered my ringtone to this day is quotes from Army of Darkness. But I realized after watching this movie I'm not one. I never really backed up his weaker movies and honestly I didn't even enjoy Running Time. Which Bruce I guess holds some love for. Anywho after only the beginning scene of MNisB I instantly realized this wouldn't be my cup of tea. And the biggest reason why the amateur level seriously shows. The supporting actors most of them and the writing are just so damn unimpressive. The flick completely relied on Bruce to save the day. But with writing this weak that's no easy chore.The story itself is kinda cool especially when we heard about it 5 years ago....or whenever the hell it first got buzz. Bruce is called upon for help but fails miserably to live up to his legendary hero status. That's funny and still is. But the movie didn't do that justice very well. I can only remember myself smirking a handful of times and that's no joke. And probably a couple of the smirks were because of Grace Thorsen's massive boobs. Talking about a total babe.This isn't to dismay anyone from seeing it especially Bruce fans since there are tons of nods and hidden jokes but if you also can control your giddiness and fanboyisms ? you'll see this film isn't a Bruce classic And the moron who said if you like Bubba HoTep you'll love this. Wow that is so off. Bubba HoTep is ten times the movie this is. Which is a damn shame because Bruce fanboys waited a while to see this one. I may still be a Bruce fanboy to some people but I'll be the first to say this was one weak Bruce outing. 6 outta 10 for the Bruce swearing the big bouncing bosoms on Grace and the handful of jokes that worked.".

The music written by Bruce Broughton is just awesome and it completely sets the perfect tone for the many different scenes.  I especially love the music when Fox's character is walking down the subway steps after leaving work.  This is a great movie to watch with someone you love.  I would definitely recommend it.".

Its happy ending comes from the heart not from the formula. Part of the reason the movie works so well is the screenplay which has got it right at all the right points. Some people say it's not funny enough well as far as I am concerned for the genre of romantic comedy it's very humorous my personal favorite line is how did my secretary get here?  priceless!!.Second the sincere and very endearing performances of the cast. The WHOLE cast. As for the lead Concierge happens to be my favorite MJF's film. He is so natural in this it doesn't even feel like he is acting. Gabrielle Anwar gives a pretty solid performance as well and the chemistry between Andy and Doug is overwhelming. Well pretty much every character is well written and acted and stands out on hisher own  Mr. Drinkwater Milton Mr. Himmelman Julian Russel Mr. Wegman... I find the DougWegman plot line particularly dear and I shed a couple of tears every time Mr. Wegman tells Doug he is going to invest the money and make Doug's dream come true.I also think this movie has one of the best turning points or one hour crisis points ever. Again my heart starts beating faster every time when Doug tells Andy about the hotel of his dreams as he narrates the unfortunate story of his father. I am not going to be a 59 year old bellhop says Doug. Concierge...  corrects him Andy. The roles are reversed here before Doug had insisted to be called concierge instead of bellhop and now Andy calls him that. We see how for the first time Andy realizes that Doug is not her lover's puppet but an individual a person with a great hope and a great dream.Overall it's a wonderful family film to watch on a rainy day right between The Apartment and Sideways. Well you can enjoy it even it you haven't got a family. It still works.".

An incredibly sweet story with no logic and...quite frankly...a very dark message. I see what director Barry Sonnenfeld was doing. He's balancing the line between slapstick and fairy tale. Not much different than what Billy Wilder did except...I know now why those films only exist within their time.Fox plays a concierge who has bigger dreams beyond the bellhop mentality. He gets in business with a man who and I'm not ruining it since it's in the trailer whose affair with a younger woman is now Fox's duty. Unfortunately for him he has a flirtatious history with her. You see where the script borrows from The Apartment. He's crestfallen that his feelings towards her may or may not trump his dreams. I can see Fox channeling his inner Jack Lemmon but something is greatly amiss. I think it's because there's so much fat in the story that you are just always waiting for something interesting to happen. Take for example the candy shop lady who is pestering him about his love life. The inexplicable banter between a Chinese food delivery boy and himself perhaps to illustrate his loneliness.Then you have the obligatory Barry Sonnenfeld wide angle collective shot. It's very uneven where he places these moments. Works fantastic in Men In Black somehow falls short here. The very lovely Gabrielle Anwar seems SO uncomfortable playing the other woman. She has the look just not the depth. Something missing but I can't put my finger on it. Somehow the Shirley MacClaines's Fran Kubliak sweetness was suppose to be injected here. But Anwar doesn't seem to commit. In fact there is a vomiting scene in this movie reminiscent of when she attempts her suicide.I like the fairy tale quality of this movie. And the music as usual leaves a swell in your heart. It's not terrible. It's perfectly fine for its time.".

He is the concierge at a Manhattan hotel who is totally sympathetic to the people working there.The story basically revolves around the fact that Fox likes the perfume girl behind the counter only to find out that she is the mistress of a wealthy nasty frequent visitor to the hotel. Shall we say that Fox and the guy continually do each other favors.The Bob Balaban role as an IRS agent quickly falls apart and Fyvush Finkel as an elderly employee make the film shine.The film does go down in the sense that there are too many intricate situations occurring. This is not the 1967 Hotel film.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this movie is certainly not one that stands out about all other Fox movies it's entertaining nonetheless due to Michael J. Fox's innate charm and it's fun to see his attempts at juggling a demanding investor eccentric clients and an eclectic group of coworkers all while trying to figure out if he should go for the girl... or the property he wants. The script is really quite weak but the way it's shot is brilliant and Sonnefeld's direction makes it flow quite effortlessly. It's an hourandahalf and change movie that only feels like it takes an hour to sit through. I agree with the others who said it's a good movie to watch on a rainy day or just when you're in the mood for a feelgood though granted not laughoutloud comedy. The funniest scenes are with the elderly bellhop and the parrot. Incidentally the parrot was almost as good as Michael J. Fox in this movie that's not an insult to Fox by the way the bird is just that funny definitely something you have to see to believe. I recommend it but will everyone like it? No in fact some won't be able to sit through it because it can get slightly boring in parts. If you have patience though and a true love for Fox's work you'll find it quite charming. 610 stars.".

Kindly police officer Mike Damon Darren McGavin tries to straighten him out by putting him through police training.The role of Damon was earmarked for regular Lewis partner Dean Martin but Martin allegedly refused to play a copper and the role was given to McGavin. Thus the film became notable for being the first solo film for Lewis away from his regular partner. They never worked together again. Written and directed by Don McGuire who works from a script based upon the Greek mythology legend of Damon and Pythias the film also stars Martha Hyer Robert Ivers and features a rare dramatic turn from comedianimpressionist Frank Gorshin. After the tremendous success of the MartinLewis partnership the big question of course would be if Lewis as a solo performer would be a big draw? The Delicate Delenquent was a massive success made for under half a million dollars it went on to make almost 6 million. Thus launching Lewis on a lucrative solo career encompassing many more film's in the decades to come.Very much a send up of teen rebel movies that were knocking about in the 50s delinquency amongst teens was becoming a hot topic in the decade Lewis' movie is gentle blend of comedy and drama. Tho he doles out some of the gurning buffoon antics that were his comedy trait Lewis does get to play it more restrained for much of the piece and it works none more so than with the warm and uplifting finale. With that in mind newcomers to the movie should not expect a raucous Jerry Lewis piece. The comedy is good with some scenes during the police academy training portion of the film particularly enjoyable. While Jerry sings By Myself in cheeky recognition of his splitup with Dino. The romantic interest in the film comes via the beautiful Martha Hyer who married Hal Wallis in 1966 the producer of the Dean MartinJerry Lewis films. And tho it's not a fully formed character there's just enough material to let Hyer leave a favourable mark.A long way from Lewis' best solo film The Nutty Professor but engaging enough on both its comedy and dramatic fronts. 6.510".

Meant to partially be a spoof of the delinquent films of the time Jer does quite well in mixing his usual goofy persona with that of a more serious learner when he gets mentored by a friendly cop named Mike Damon Darren McGavin. In fact this was originally supposed to be Dean's role but either he balked at actually playing an authority figure or he simply just had enough of his former partner's ego to continue on with him. Anyway whenever McGavin has fights with a female council member named Martha Henshaw Martha Hyer there's still some traces of the Martinlike attitude especially when he reveals to Sidney Lewis' character his feelings for her. Officer Mike not only has to deal with the punks that hang around Sidney like Monk Robert Ivers and Artie Richard Bakalyan but also his superior officer Capt. Riley Horace McMahon who has plenty of doubts about Mike's methods. Like I said this was a good mix of comedy and drama and also Jerry has a nice number by himself in which he drops his usual whiny voice for his more normal one which he also does in the more serious scenes. So on that note I highly recommend The Delicate Delinquent.".

He finds himself walking a fine line between his friendship with Officer Mike DamonDARREN McGAVIN who has taken a personal interest in him and believes in him and the local gang of neighborhood delinquents headed by MonkROBERT IVERS and his sidekick ArtieRICHARD BAKALYAN. Lewis' exposure to the police academy provides most of the film's humor as he fumbles and stumbles his way through his coursework. The funniest sequence here is when the recruits are given a class in handtohand combat by a Japanese sumo wrestler who picks Lewis to demonstrate the techniques on. The interpreter tells Lewis he was picked because the wrestler says he looks Japanese! After getting karatechopped numerous times and twisted into a pretzel Lewis pleads with the martial artist to let him live in Japanese! This is what makes the sequence so hilarious that Lewis would be able to speak Japanese considering who he was and where he was living. It's a riot to watch these two men walk off the mat with their arms around each other conversing fluently in Japanese. In one critical scene Monk and Artie pay a visit to Lewis in his basement apartment. These guys are poster boys for AntiSocial Personality Disorder. Monk tells Lewis that before he leaves this world he going to make a lot of noise. Lewis tells him that there are lots of good decent people in the world who are not looking to break anyone's back and that he wants to be one of them. When they leave Artie asks Monk why he didn't let him rough Lewis up and Monk clearly affected by what Lewis told him says I got confused... He made sense. As part of their final evaluation before being graduated from the academy the rookie cops are paired with veteran officers to go out on armed street patrol and Lewis gets paired up with his buddy Mike. Called to a burglary in progress the two buddies and other officers confront Monk and his gang and a freeforall ensues. A gunshot rings out and Artie falls to the ground a bullet in his leg. The discharge is quickly traced to Lewis' revolver and Artie accuses him of deliberately shooting him. It looks like Lewis' police career might be over before it even starts but someone from an unlikely corner comes forward to speak up for him and tell the Precinct CaptainHORACE McMAHON what really occurred. Someone who had firsthand knowledge of what happened with Lewis's gun and how Artie wound up getting shot. Someone who vindicates Lewis and himself. This is a wonderful film that still holds up 50 years later. I give it a 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's this with the trivia section on IMDb for this film? While I knew that this was Jerry Lewis' first solo effort after his breakup with Dean Martin I have no idea what this comment in the trivia section means regarding Dean Martin not wanting to wear a police uniform. Did he hate cops or think he looked bad in black or was this just the excuse he gave because he couldn't stand the thought of making another film with Jerry?! I'd love to know more about this.With the absence of Dean Martin the studio decided to pair Lewis with Darren McGavin. And since you've never heard of the great comedy team of Martin  McGavin you can assume the results did not set the world on fire. The choice of films was pretty odd though as Jerry was now in his 30smaking him an incredibly old delinquent! And for the first time this delinquent got to produce his own film.During an amazingly nonviolent rumble Jerry is accidentally picked up by the police as they think he too is one of the punks. The team of cops is led by McGavina cop who has been trying for years to rehabilitate these juveniles instead of just locking them up like the Captain recommends. In a rather nonsubtle but funny scene Jerry is thrilled that he is being let go by the police...you just have to see it. But McGavin sees Jerry and decides he can rehabilitate this boy! And since Jerry is a completely incompetent janitor McGavin is able to eventually interest him in a career in law enforcement. But the road is long and a lot of stuff happens in the meantimesuch as constant runins with local hoodlums who delight in harassing him.Along the way McGavin meets a knowitall social worker Martha Hyer. Naturally they hate each other so you know they'll be in love by the end of the film! Wow is this lady stupid and annoying! I think her character was very poorly writtenno one can be that that opinionated and that clueless! Aside from looking nice she was a major deficit in the filmpossibly due to bad acting or a badly written character or bad direction or all three.So how does this all stack up compared to a typical Martin  Lewis film? Well it's pretty obvious that the roles were originally written for the team but most of the musical numbers have been removed. While it caught my wife by surprise Jerry sang one of the songs that Dean would have sung in the filmand did a very nice job. Too often in the early films he deliberately sang badly and people assumed he couldn't sing. Jerry once again also mugged a lot more for the camerathough less than in many of his previous or later films. However I also noticed that when he wasn't overacting Lewis also had some nice scenes where you could see he could actually acttoo bad he occasionally chose shtick instead of acting as I think his acting skills are often underappreciated and which weren't as apparent until some of his later noncomedic roles. My wife who is definitely not a fan noticed that he was a lot more human in this filmand was very easy to like when he wasn't hamming it up. Surprisingly she even liked the filmand she's a hard sell indeed. I'd say the film is actually better than most of the Martin  Lewis films as it's a lot less comedy and more a wellrounded film.By the way there is a scene towards the beginning where McGavin tries very hard to befriend Lewis. I am sure it played well in 1957 but seen today it sure looks like McGavin is trying to make a pass at him! You can see what what might be seen by some as a gay subtext a few other times too. See it for yourselfI am sure you'll see what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fich man's daughter Angela Pastorellli Anna Maria Rizzoli decides to go back to school after spending some years in Africa. The first thing she does is fall head over heels for the local Fonzie Leo Colonna who as usual goes by the name of Carlo in the picture. And since he proudly proclaims to be doing the same term for the third time in a row they are conveniently the same age. But Carlo starts playing hard to get as soon as he find out who's daughter Angela is. He tells her she'll have better luck hitting on the school principal Rodolfo Calabrone Lino Banfi. Naturally Angela does just that although instead of actually seducing him she starts babysitting his little boy Tonino. The principal has enough trouble as it is coping with two insufferable pranksters amongst his students and bossy colleague Monica Zappa Ria De Simone. Also thrown into the mix is Alvaro Vitali playing a science teacher rather than a student for a change. His character Beccafico is hopelessly in love with Monica as well as the constant butt of his students' jokes. Carlo takes advantage of the fact that Beccafico is living across the street from Calabrone by stirring up all of the teacher's emotions. Meanwhile Angela's friend Lisetta Loredana Martnez grabs her chance to get herself a piece of Carlo. It appears that everybody in the picture lives in the same apartment block.Released in 1980 this sexy comedy is threading familiar water and by this time the sex part had become pretty tame. Moreover the characters by now were all quite predictable and the gags repetitive. Interestingly the film was released in two versions in Germany where all the various school based comedies were released under the 'Flotte Teens' title. First in an edited version that was dubbed then a complete version with the deleted scenes reinstated but still in Italian with German subtitles. 6 out of 10".

Naturally Angela does just that although instead of actually seducing him she starts babysitting his little boy Tonino. The principal has enough trouble as it is coping with two insufferable pranksters amongst his students and bossy colleague Monica Zappa Ria De Simone. Also thrown into the mix is Alvaro Vitali playing a science teacher rather than a student for a change. His character Beccafico is hopelessly in love with Monica as well as the constant butt of his students' jokes. Carlo takes advantage of the fact that Beccafico is living across the street from Calabrone by stirring up all of the teacher's emotions. Meanwhile Angela's friend Lisetta Loredana Martnez grabs her chance to get herself a piece of Carlo. It appears that everybody in the picture lives in the same apartment block.Released in 1980 this sexy comedy is threading familiar water and by this time the sex part had become pretty tame. Moreover the characters by now were all quite predictable and the gags repetitive. Interestingly the film was released in two versions in Germany where all the various school based comedies were released under the 'Flotte Teens' title. First in an edited version that was dubbed then a complete version with the deleted scenes reinstated but still in Italian with German subtitles. 6 out of 10";

The main sub plot involves keeping his simple frind Albert from joining the local hoodlums since Albert was once in a boys reformatory and has picked up some rather unsavory company.When the king of Hedy's country dies she becomes Queen and has to return at once to her native country.Being a generous queen she invites the bellboy to come back with her and for one mad moment the bellboy thinks she is in love with him and he might even become king!!.Hedy is courageous and participates in a bar room brawl even getting arrested by the cops then giving the other arrested dames a valuable diamondstudded cigarette case as a keepsake of the evening.Her American boyfriend is also startled to see her carted off in the police wagon.Of course we all knew from the first that the bellboy would end up with Leslie his crippled girl friend whose incapacity the doctor informs us is probably psychosomatic and not a purely physical disability.She just needs love don't we all!.In a moment of truth Robert Walker sees the light and tactfully declines Hedy's offer of a passage on the boat back to her country.This inspires the new queen to abdicate at once as she wishes to live for love in the U.S. as well and become just a plain Mrs with the man she loves.So of course it all ends happily ever after.Hedy is of course utterly gorgeous to look at and in her prime.That genuine Viennese accent perfectly convincing us of her central European pedigree.She is attended by a duchess lady in waiting played by Agnes Moorhead who puts on a passable accent.Robert Walker is very effective in the role of the bellboy and his real love June Allyson warms to her part and even shows us a little dancing sequence.There is a very imaginative scene where she dreams that she can walk and meets her prince charming who transforms from a frog to a prince in a court presided over by a kingly Albert!I wonder did Michael Powell get his idea for the dreamlike never ending stairway for A Matter of Life and Death 1946from the one shown in this sequence?Everyone is portrayed in a very sympathetic light so no one goes to bed unhappy.Good old fashioned Hollywood story telling at its best.I rated it 710.".

Here he is energetic fasttalking and adorable as Jimmy a clumsy bellhop assigned to Princess Hedy while she's in New York with her aunt Agnes Moorhead. Hedy is fantastically beautiful as always though her part isn't very showy compared to the others. June Allyson plays an invalid who lives upstairs from Jimmy and his buddy played by Rags Ragland. She's very young pretty and sweet as a lonely young woman whose life is brightened by the constant entertainment of these two men. She's in love with Walker and when he develops a crush on Lamarr her heart breaks. Lamarr is in love with a columnist a wooden Warner Anderson.This movie seemed on the long side but it's very warm and entertaining fare. Six years later Walker will look as if he's aged 20 years.

	schema:reviewBody "If a movie gives you Hedy Lamarr to look at it seems churlish to complain. But even the presence of one of the most beautiful women who ever lived plus the adorable June Allyson and the endearing Robert Walker do not begin to compensate for the hideously vulgar and phoney goingson.This routine princessfallsinlovewithordinaryAmerican comedy is joined with a love story between Walker and Allyson the woman he really loves without realising it. Nothing wrong with that but she is paralysed from the waist down. Why? Becausethe doctor gives us his medical opinionin childhood she was not loved enough!Can you imagine the feelings of parents of crippled children on hearing such a thing? Back in the Forties most people would have thought such a question absurdly oversensitive but now it's a matter of common decency. Not only that there is a long dream sequence in which Allyson imagines herself in a feathered evening gown dancing with Walker. Worse yet at the end she actually begins to walk! and starts dancing with him! In the absence of a FAIRY princess to wave a magic wand this is repulsively vulgar and cruel.Not only that but Allyson is portrayed in a manner right out of cheap Victorian sentimentality.

Positively decadent! One man punches another leading to the kind of phoney freeforall that happens only in the movies. I have always wondered why if two men start fighting in a saloon other men should suddenly start fighting each other all over the place and women should whack them over the head with bottles.

	onyx:emotionText "If a movie gives you Hedy Lamarr to look at it seems churlish to complain. But even the presence of one of the most beautiful women who ever lived plus the adorable June Allyson and the endearing Robert Walker do not begin to compensate for the hideously vulgar and phoney goingson.This routine princessfallsinlovewithordinaryAmerican comedy is joined with a love story between Walker and Allyson the woman he really loves without realising it. Nothing wrong with that but she is paralysed from the waist down. Why? Becausethe doctor gives us his medical opinionin childhood she was not loved enough!Can you imagine the feelings of parents of crippled children on hearing such a thing? Back in the Forties most people would have thought such a question absurdly oversensitive but now it's a matter of common decency. Not only that there is a long dream sequence in which Allyson imagines herself in a feathered evening gown dancing with Walker. Worse yet at the end she actually begins to walk! and starts dancing with him! In the absence of a FAIRY princess to wave a magic wand this is repulsively vulgar and cruel.Not only that but Allyson is portrayed in a manner right out of cheap Victorian sentimentality. She does not sit in an ugly wheelchair but reclines on a couch rising from it only when Walker visiting her in the evenings carries her to the roof for some fresh air.

	schema:headline " A Forgettable Fair Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Warning This film is a lighthearted comedy which takes on the air of a fairy tale. In fact it jumps right into the fairy tale motif with a once upon a time narration that tenuously connects a princess from an unnamed kingdom of ambiguous origins to a grand city that is unmistakably New York. The plot centers on a love triangle or love quadrangle to be more precise between the lovable bellboy Jimmy Dobson his physically handicapped friend Leslie a presumably European princess and a brooding European baron. The plot unfolds into a welltraveled trope the princess is mistaken for a commoner spends the day with a working class Joe falls in love with him and ultimately has to choose between a life as respected royalty or one where she follows her heart and marries beneath her station. Jimmy and Princess Veronica's fairytale ending is challenged not only by the significant difference in social standing but by the Veronica's dour examour and by Jimmy's guilt for ignoring his sick friend and potential partner Leslie. In addition to the awkward love triangle the film weaves through many mostlyunnecessary subplots and features a heaping helping of Albert Jimmy's dimwitted porter friend. The film is largely forgettable in all contexts. Neither its romantic pairings alternating between Jimmy and Veronica Veronica and her baron Jimmy and Leslie and Albert and Leslie nor its comedic bits ranging from cringeworthy oneliners to fights scenes meant to be humorous but evoking the dullest of physical comedy work. The subplots are distracting the dream sequence bizarre and the ending unsatisfying. This is one fairy tale which should have been left on the shelf.The plot itself is bloated with so many unnecessary and distracting subplots perhaps as filler for the lackluster main plot that it is hard for the audience to care deeply about what happens. Examples of these distractions include Albert's penchant for petty crimes and Jimmy's desire to keep him out of the employ of a particularly brutish street thug Leslie's illness which has left her crippled and Jimmy's desire to help her get better apparently according to the doctor she is just sad and Jimmy's love can help her legs work again Jimmy's financial woes and his desire to buy an expensive radio Veronica's mysterious past with her exhusband and exlover the success of Leslie's Santa Claus painting business really that is really a subplot and the exploits of a newspaper journalist writing a story on Jimmy and Veronica. Most of these distracting scenes are simply excuses for quips and oneliners or zany physical comedy such as getting into an intendedly humorous fight with street thugs which was indistinguishable from a rugby scrum at worst they are unexplained and jarring departures from the story. The main story focuses on the relationship between Princess Veronica and Jimmy and explores the clichd scenario of a princess being mistaken for a common woman. This storyline has a proved track record and has worked to great effect in Roman Holiday and even the animated film Aladdin and excellent variations of this princess and the commoner theme where a huge gap in social or cultural standing exist include The Princess Comes Across Ninotchka Here is my Heart and It Happened One Night. To varying degrees these films worked and ranged effectively from screwball comedy to heartfelt romance. The same cannot be said for Her Highness and the Bellboy. The fault for the film failing to match the artistic success of even its lowbudget contemporaries lies with the script but also with Hedy Lamarr's turn as the princess. Lamarr's princess lacks the spunk charm and exuberance of Audrey Hepburn's later portrayal of the archetype in Roman Holiday yet she doesn't have the humorously distant detachment and ignorance of common culture seen in Greta Garbo's Ninotchka. Instead she falls somewhere in between the two not quite sober and reserved enough to be a funny foil for Robert Walker's Jimmy and not quite excited or chipper enough to appear changed or affected by her romance with a bellboy. She is in a word boring. The fact that the princess maintains a servile relationship with Jimmy throughout the film hamstrings any attempt to make their love story believable. Similarly Jimmy's unabashed altruism leaves his character a bit onedimensional and renders his romance with either Veronica or Leslie problematic he is always trying to save the girls Leslie from her paralysis and Veronica from her responsibilities as a ruler.The film also feels cheap and technically deficient with poor direction even when compared to lowbudget contemporaries. The lighting for the film is distracting the film apparently used full frontal flood lighting which created an array of glints and glares throughout the picture led to awkward shadows and destroyed any illusion or reality. The sets for the castle are remarkably fake looking and the static city skyline in various scenes looks cheap and lazy. Leslie's dream sequence is a mixed bag the fading technique and shots creating the illusion of her dream and ultimate ascension to the castle in the sky were well done nothing revolutionary but a believable sequence of movie magic. The dream sequence itself complete with a handicapped June Allyson dancing away with giant frogs Santa Claus chorus girls and Rags Ragland's goofy king seems jarringly and bizarrely out of place with the rest of the film. The real strength of the movie is Robert Walker's performance as Jimmy. Walker is charismatic likable suave and approachable. He shines through the film's weaknesses and shows chops as a leading man. Rags Ragland's performance as the oafish Albert likely garnered laughs when the film first aired but his irreverent japes and madcap physical comedy routines have aged very poorly. At one point Albert tells Leslie that he didn't mean to make her laugh. I don't think he will have to worry about that with modern audiences.".

Examples of these distractions include Albert's penchant for petty crimes and Jimmy's desire to keep him out of the employ of a particularly brutish street thug Leslie's illness which has left her crippled and Jimmy's desire to help her get better apparently according to the doctor she is just sad and Jimmy's love can help her legs work again Jimmy's financial woes and his desire to buy an expensive radio Veronica's mysterious past with her exhusband and exlover the success of Leslie's Santa Claus painting business really that is really a subplot and the exploits of a newspaper journalist writing a story on Jimmy and Veronica. Most of these distracting scenes are simply excuses for quips and oneliners or zany physical comedy such as getting into an intendedly humorous fight with street thugs which was indistinguishable from a rugby scrum at worst they are unexplained and jarring departures from the story. The main story focuses on the relationship between Princess Veronica and Jimmy and explores the clichd scenario of a princess being mistaken for a common woman. This storyline has a proved track record and has worked to great effect in Roman Holiday and even the animated film Aladdin and excellent variations of this princess and the commoner theme where a huge gap in social or cultural standing exist include The Princess Comes Across Ninotchka Here is my Heart and It Happened One Night. To varying degrees these films worked and ranged effectively from screwball comedy to heartfelt romance. The same cannot be said for Her Highness and the Bellboy. The fault for the film failing to match the artistic success of even its lowbudget contemporaries lies with the script but also with Hedy Lamarr's turn as the princess. Lamarr's princess lacks the spunk charm and exuberance of Audrey Hepburn's later portrayal of the archetype in Roman Holiday yet she doesn't have the humorously distant detachment and ignorance of common culture seen in Greta Garbo's Ninotchka. Instead she falls somewhere in between the two not quite sober and reserved enough to be a funny foil for Robert Walker's Jimmy and not quite excited or chipper enough to appear changed or affected by her romance with a bellboy. She is in a word boring. The fact that the princess maintains a servile relationship with Jimmy throughout the film hamstrings any attempt to make their love story believable. Similarly Jimmy's unabashed altruism leaves his character a bit onedimensional and renders his romance with either Veronica or Leslie problematic he is always trying to save the girls Leslie from her paralysis and Veronica from her responsibilities as a ruler.The film also feels cheap and technically deficient with poor direction even when compared to lowbudget contemporaries. The lighting for the film is distracting the film apparently used full frontal flood lighting which created an array of glints and glares throughout the picture led to awkward shadows and destroyed any illusion or reality. The sets for the castle are remarkably fake looking and the static city skyline in various scenes looks cheap and lazy. Leslie's dream sequence is a mixed bag the fading technique and shots creating the illusion of her dream and ultimate ascension to the castle in the sky were well done nothing revolutionary but a believable sequence of movie magic. The dream sequence itself complete with a handicapped June Allyson dancing away with giant frogs Santa Claus chorus girls and Rags Ragland's goofy king seems jarringly and bizarrely out of place with the rest of the film. The real strength of the movie is Robert Walker's performance as Jimmy. Walker is charismatic likable suave and approachable. He shines through the film's weaknesses and shows chops as a leading man. Rags Ragland's performance as the oafish Albert likely garnered laughs when the film first aired but his irreverent japes and madcap physical comedy routines have aged very poorly. At one point Albert tells Leslie that he didn't mean to make her laugh. I don't think he will have to worry about that with modern audiences.";

Too bad they didn't give Agnes Moorehead a bigger part..has a smallish speaking part as Lady in Waiting. Her Highness has some elements of Queen Christina from 1933 and maybe even Sullivan's Travels '41. Seems to have been remade as Roman Holiday 1953 with a few changes. Weird dream sequence by Leslie June Allyson which didn't really add anything to the already long plot. Leslie is unable to walk and works from her apartment and may require more than medications to be able to walk again. This is a love triangle rectangle ? story involving a Princess from a foreign land who falls for Jimmy the bellboy Robert Walker . Of course both Jimmy and the Princess Hedy Lamarr already have admirers in their lives so things get complicated. Also a running gag where Jimmy spouts the names of cities in rapid mumble which gets them out of a couple jams. And I SWEAR that's Shemp Howard that brings them to their table when they go back to Jake's for a night on the town although he's not mentioned in the cast list. They look at each other and the Maitre D' keeps doing double takes. Lots of fun stuff going on. The drunk in the bar was Jack Norton who made a career by playing the drunk in Bank Dick Day at the Races and Jezebel and so many more. The only really serious side of the plot is how Albert Ragland gets mixed up with a bad gang and Jimmy keeps trying to get him to keep better company.... this part of the plot is never really resolved but the princess seems to learn a lesson in love right at the last minute. Like Rags says they all lived happily ever after although its ironic that he says this since he is the only one sitting down while everyone else is up dancing. A good MGM show directed by Richard Thorpe who had just directed Lamarr in White Cargo. Both films play now  then on Turner Classic Movies.".

	schema:headline " Love ? Marriage ? When your youth has deserted you !";
	schema:reviewBody "Love and marriage are two very significant issues in the life of humanbeings. As far as love is concerned it may happen at any stage of a person's life. It is said that love just happens not deliberately accomplished Pyaar Kiya Nahin Jaata Ho Jaata Hai. Hence whatever is your age or situation you are destined to fall in love with someone of opposite sex you can't do anything about it. You may not express your love to him or her but love for him or her is bound to exist in your heart.But marriage ? Marriage is an altogether different business. Why ? Because marriage involves commitment marriage calls for shouldering responsibility and marriage means a lifelong association with the spouse. It is much more than love and hence marriage cannot just happen. It is to be carried out deliberately after investing a lot of thought in the decision. That's why when a male or a female is past his  her reasonable age to enter into wedlock the decision to marry someone is not that easy even when the concerned person is in love. You may be an eligible bachelor or an eligible maiden but if your age does not entitle you to be called a boy or a girl then ? Prem Vivah 1979 is a family drama that deals with this issue. As the title suggests the story involves both love Prem and marriage Vivah. The story deals with the life of four characters only. Asha Parekh and Bindiya Goswami are two unmarried sisters. Bindiya is quite young whereas Asha is well past her marriageable age. Their parents being dead long back Asha has been more like a mother to Bindiya than her elder sister and for the sake of fostering her only she had neglected the issue of her own marriage. Now Bindiya herself has attained marriageable age and she is in love with an eligible bachelor Mithun Chakraborty. The twist in the tale comes with the entry of a matureage bachelor Utpal Dutt.Utpal Dutt who is almost double the age of Bindiya Goswami comes across her and falls for her charms. However he is under a false impression that Bindiya also loves him whereas the fact is that Bindiya only respects him. Through Bindiya he is introduced to her elder sister Asha Parekh. Now with his regularly meeting the sisters renders an impression to them that he is in love with Asha. Asha also starts liking him and starts dreaming to marry him when her younger sister ties the sacred knot with her beau. Misunderstandings continue and when the truth dawns upon the characters of this story the issues has become too complicated to handle. Since Mithun Chakraborty has to move abroad after marrying Bindiya who is ambivalent due to being concerned for her elder sister it's Utpal only who has to take a compromising decision to cope with this cruel jest that destiny has cracked on them especially him.Personally I believe and almost everybody will agree to it that if at all one has to marry he  she should ensure that the marriage takes place at an appropriate age. However now the trend is that people continue to remain unmarried till they are in their thirties. Well late marriages bring many problems with them but the other side of the picture is equally important. Since a majority of marriages in India are more or less a gamble with life one may win one may lose if someone waits for Mr. Right or Miss Right there is no harm because bachelorhood is a much better option that remaining unhappy after marriage and restlessly longing to break free from its shackles.The second issue is the love emerging for someone who is much younger or much older in age. In this movie mainly the complication is due to Utpal Dutt's attraction for a much younger Bindiya Goswami who cannot guess in the wildest of her dreams that Utpal visits their family for the sake of his love for her only and always remains under the impression that his feelings are for her elder sister who belongs to his agegroup. Well in my humble opinion in such a situation the concerned people should not allow any communication gap to creep in and give rise to misunderstandings. Communication gap is a highly undesirable thing when it comes to relationships. Straightforward talks should take place and everything should be clarified without a hitch else things can go from bad to worse only.The movie has been directed by Basu Chatterjee very well but being a serious movie it's not the cup of tea of those who watch movies for fun. There remains an undercurrent of tension in the later half of the movie and this tension makes the movie burdensome. Only those who are able to relate to any of the characters and the situations shown may find themselves as engrossed. Though the curiosity regarding the climax remains it is more or less a forgone conclusion.The narrative has been lifted by the admirable performances of the lead actors. All the four principal artists have delivered mature performances as per the demand of the story.All in all Prem Vivah deals with a significant issue but does not offer any solution. Even when a person male or female remains unmarried till his  her forties the age does not affect the tender feelings for someone which may emerge at any stage of life because humanbeings are bound to love because they need love for them too. However marriage may be performed as a compromise with life. In my opinion the challenge which is much bigger that making this compromise is to love the person whom you have married without love. It may prove to be a Herculean task but it is mandatory if the marital life is to survive.".

Straightforward talks should take place and everything should be clarified without a hitch else things can go from bad to worse only.The movie has been directed by Basu Chatterjee very well but being a serious movie it's not the cup of tea of those who watch movies for fun. There remains an undercurrent of tension in the later half of the movie and this tension makes the movie burdensome. Only those who are able to relate to any of the characters and the situations shown may find themselves as engrossed. Though the curiosity regarding the climax remains it is more or less a forgone conclusion.The narrative has been lifted by the admirable performances of the lead actors. All the four principal artists have delivered mature performances as per the demand of the story.All in all Prem Vivah deals with a significant issue but does not offer any solution. Even when a person male or female remains unmarried till his  her forties the age does not affect the tender feelings for someone which may emerge at any stage of life because humanbeings are bound to love because they need love for them too. However marriage may be performed as a compromise with life. In my opinion the challenge which is much bigger that making this compromise is to love the person whom you have married without love. It may prove to be a Herculean task but it is mandatory if the marital life is to survive.";

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is a slice of the life narrative which is dominated by an exciting battle of wits between two suitors over a girl. Amol Palekar plays Arun a diffident simpleton who likes a girl from a neighboring office but isn't able to profess his adoration for his object of affection and attention. They meet in the most mundane circumstances on the bus while on the way to their respective offices. On some days he follows her and on some days she notices. Is she interested in him? Is she playing the mind games? How can one be certain? The problem of the girl's inexplicable behavior in Arun's mind is further increased by the entry of a third factor a glib talking over smart and overbearing character of Asrani who happens to be a colleague of Prabha and is therefore ostensibly at an advantage. And yes he is a keen enthusiast in two sports Chess and Table Tennis whereas Arun sucks at both those disciplines. Oh and Asrani also has a lime green Lambretta which Arun is envious of. In the first act itself there ensues a battle of wits between Arun and Asrani. While Arun's motives in winning over Prabha are pretty unambiguous Asrani's motivations are not that apparent to the audience. We are left guessing whether he is really trying to woo Prabha or is he just a compulsive flirt with a big mouth and terrible etiquettes? But those very vices seem to be helping him in the beginning. He emerges as a roadblock in Arun's journey of love and in a memorable dream sequence several of which are used very innovatively throughout the film Arun imagines himself murdering him and then facing the jury proudly after his belligerent deed. However that's just one of Arun's many daydreams. In reality he is unable to express his feelings of love for Prabha. Whener she's around he gets tongue tied. A Beatles Song most accurately describes his psychology at that point of time I want to tell you. My head is filled with things to say. When you're here all those words they seem to slip away That Harrison Song from 1967's legendary 'Revolver' album perfectly captures Arun's inner torment and turmoil in the first half of the film. Disillusioned and disappointed with his repeated failures in the war of love he turns to astrology and divine intervention but no avail God helps those who help themselves. Therefore he decides to seek help and finds that in the form of Col. JNW Singh of Khandala a confident worldly wise old man who is said to have the best advise for everyone who come to seek it and the advise is available on various topics love career tax planning etc. He takes a special interest in Arun's case the reason for which is revealed later. Under Col. Singh's tutelage Arun learns the art of courtship. Through a complex training process comprising body language courses table etiquettes chess and table tennis apart from of course the mandatory knowledge about the birds and the bees and the wondrous art of deciphering the intentions of womankind by the wave of her hand the curled smile on her lips the placement of her feet the position of her face and purse the movements of her fingers the contact of her eyes her laughter her touch the color of her mascara the size of her earrings the strength of her handshake the tone of her voice etc. etc. After all this Arun returns back to Mumbai a changed man. He is accompanied by his mentor Col. Singh who wants to check on his progress. The new Arun has a leap in his stride a mild confidence about his countenance and knowledge of his new craft. Slowly he starts turning the tables on Asrani and uses his own tricks against Asrani himself much to the secret glee of Prabha who by this time seems to have developed an affection of her own in Arun. They enjoy spending time together. Then one day he calls her to his place. What are his intentions? Does he really love her or can it be that.? No Prabha decides to go and find out for herself the truth about Arun's character. What happens in the end? Does Arun trick Prabha or do we get a happy ending? And where does Asrani fit into the scheme of things? The situations are so believable and the characters are so relatable that this film is an instant favorite of mine. The technique used is brilliant. The use of voice overs flash backs and flash forwards are innovatively used. And the songsthey are mind blowingmost rendered soulfully by Yesudas 'Jaaneman Jaaneman' ' Yeh Din' and the beautiful and haunting 'Na Jaane Kyun'. Amol Palekar excels in a role tailor made for him. Asrani gives an effortless performance. Vidya Sinha is adequate. Ashok Kumar is brilliant in his depiction of one of the most memorable characters Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh. A thoroughly entertaining film and one that can be watched again and again CSB is my favourite Basu Chatterjee film followed closely by Rajanigandha which is worthy of being hailed a classic too and is on certain levels even more masterful than Choti Si Baat as Rajanigandha looks at the matters of love through the eyes of a woman and touches a point even deeper in our psychology.".

The bell bottomed Male modelsthe polka dotted saris and the large ortem fans are what one sees in the movie.Amol Palekar and the lead heroineI think Someone named Vidhya are delightful to watch as the quintessential young shy middle class people with a feeling towards each other.The villaincomic Nasrani is also irritating to the right degree and begging for a comeuppance from the meek hero.Amol Palekar's revenge dreams are awesome in their humour. This movie is a must for everyone who likes classic clean comedy.Amazing stuff.Why don't they make such movies now in Bollywod?".

CSB is is one of those simple experimental fantastic films from 70's which Indian filmmakers have not tried in the last 25 years. I think Golmal and Angoor were the last of this genre. Script of CSB is unbeatable and doesn't deviate for even a second from its aim. Casting is perfect. Vidya Sinha is very good as a good looking middle class office going woman in Mumbai. Male cast is brilliant. With Ashok Kumar Amol Palekar and Asrani you don't need anyone.Do you? In case you need then there is ever dependable CS Dubey. Dialogs are funny and situation are unique. Music by Salil Chowdhray is fantastic but I wont guarantee if its original. SalilDa was also good at inspired music I couldn't stop noticing vacant Mumbai streets. 'Janeman' is very well shot with extras doing there own stuff while Amol and Vidya romancing around. Fantastic idea. I just loved the scene where Arun have his first conversation with Prabha and Nagesh just turns everything upside down. It captures the concept that when things go wrong they go wrong in quick succession. Its very well done. Colonel's analysis or Arun is hilarious 'improper conditioning and defective verbal communication' 'unstable self evasiveness' 'love labor lost case' 'unstable para nautical frustration'. Damn funny. Asrani is so good in his downfall scenes Sala Peter Kaam Chod Ke Chala Gaya? Kahna Nagesh Sahab Ka Order Hai. Amol's best line is Khade Ho Or Kaho Good Morning. Fantastic film. definitely in the top 25 Hindi films and of course best Basu Chatterjee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chhoti Si Baat is for me the ultimate romantic comedy of those times  simple funny and totally charming. Basu Chatterjee was an amazing talent. Like Hrishikesh Mukherjee he used to make films that reflected the lives of people from the middleclass. Everything in this film is kept simple and contributes to its authenticity including dialogues characters sets props and costumes. Chatterjee brilliantly captures the world of Arun an ordinary and rather insecure fellow who is deeply in love with a young and beautiful girl named Prabha. The story follows Arun's trials and tribulations and his later attempts to get her through the help and guidance of a loveguru when another guy enters the picture. It's amazing how the viewers are given a chance to witness and experience every thought yearning and disappointment that the character of Arun is going through and yet the movie remains consistently humorous lighthearted and comic.I think that's what makes both the film and particularly the character of Arun so easy to relate to. I think everyone has been at some point secretly in love and could not express his feelings. And clearly this would not be so believable without Amol Palekar's great portrayal. Palekar's comically melancholic performance is wonderful. He never tries to do more than required or overexpress his deep feelings. And yet it is always understood. This is easily one of his best. Vidya Sinha is beautiful and ever so graceful that it's easy to understand why she is the love interest here. Asrani is not the type of guy who would really look like a serious rival who could undermine one's confidence but he is inevitably funny and suitably annoying. Ashok Kumar is just outstanding in a role which is quite different from his usual ventures. As the witty and kind Colonel Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh he is hilarious likable and memorable.Some of the film's scenes are still remembered today including the sequences showing Arun daily following Prabha on her way to her workplace. The lively streets of the yetunconjested Bombay are efficiently shot and are nostalgic to look at. The scenes involving Arun and the loveguru Julius are of the best moments in the film while Arun's transformation afterwards and his renewed interaction with Prabha is incredibly entertaining. Salil Choudhury's soundtrack for the film is beautiful. In another evident attempt to keep the film realistic the songs are not visualised as one would expect in a Hindi film. The songs either play over montage sequences Na Jaane Kyun and Yeh Din Kyaa Aaye or appear as part of a film the characters go to see in the cinema the wonderful Jaanemann. In either way they express the characters' state of mind brilliantly. Overall Chhoti Si Baat is one classic gem to remember. Go now.".

In the midst of all them a film was released which might not get that much attention but which is equally deserving called Choti si baat.I remember watching that movie for the first time on TV when I was in my 10th standard but i din't able to see the complete movie So recently after 10 years i downloaded and watched it again and came with the Conclusion  Choti si baat is perhaps the best Comedy movie of that70's decade and What makes it Class apart is it's simplycity. It masterfully tells one of the most important stories of the 70's which is about middle class.I normally do not write about movies and I do not think movie like this should be critiqued.it should just be appreciated. Choti si baat is the most impressive movie by the director Basu Chatterjee his other movies like Rajnigandha Manzil and Ek ruka hua Faisla that also shows his directional sensitivity. But this is a movie which speaks more than it scripts. It tells us more than its characters narrates the story.Choti si baat is set to give the audience an intimate look at the very soul of Arun's Character.Ashok kumar is fantastic as Col. Julius Nagendranath You cannot think of any other actor in this role.Asrani is also very impressive and according to me this is his finest performance. Vidya Sinha was better in Rajnigandha but it does not mean she is not Good in this She Performed the character of Prabha very well.But it's actually Amol palekar who set aside everyone in the acting departmenthe played the role of Arun exceptionally.Choti si baat tells us how a man decided not to live like a Coward. The music of the movie is its another strongest part. I don't remember how many times I have watched this movie since then but each time is an experience in itself.Choti si baat belongs to the genre of movies which gives you more than what you expect in the 120 minutes.".

In my opinion bad editing weakens the impact of the movie greatly. It feels as if no attempt was made to keep the cinematography crisp although some scenes have conspicuously been shortened as evident from the 'jumps'.

	schema:reviewBody "The harsh truth of this cruel world is that simpletons lag behind in the race of life due to ditto traits of themselves. To win in the different races of life and get better of the opponents a person has to shed the tag of being a simpleton and acquire the tag of being smart. Smartness counts everywhere even in love. And that's the message of this comedy of the seventies.Chhoti Si Baat trivial thing is the story of a shy accountant  Arun Amol Palekar who is not smart and just too simple to find things his way. In the office of his company his subordinates do not listen to him. His boss is not very happy with him. In his colourless life his fascination towards Prabha Vidya Sinha is the only thing which enthuse him. She works in a neighbouring office in Mumbai and Arun loves her in his heart seeing and deliberately coming across her in the most mundane situations of life. However his shyness and simplicity blocks his path whenever he has to express his feelings to her. Prabha knows it and discusses these things with her colleague Deepa Nandita Thakur. The shy and hesitant advances of the boy are a source of fun for Prabha. She likes him and wants him to express himself. Now comes the twist in the tale.Arun faces a rival for Prabha's companionship and love in the form of Naagesh Asrani who is oversmart more resourceful than Arun and now our hero i.e. Arun is struck by the fear to lose the bet called Prabha to Naagesh. The competition with annoying and irritating Naagesh compels him to commit some silly errors and get cheated by a motor workshop owner. Finally he takes a month long leave from his office and moves to Khandala where Col. JNW Singh Ashok Kumar lives whom he expects to play his troubleshooter. Col. Singh is not only a loveGuru but also a personality development expert. Under his tutelage and guidance Arun's personality is groomed in the right direction. Now he is ready to take upon his rival Naagesh as well as win his ladylove Prabha.Here in Mumbai Prabha has got restless by not seeing Arun for so many days. That reveals that she also loves him but being a girl has been expecting the boy to initiate the things. Arun's return fills her with joy. Now a smart and renovated Arun not only outwits Naagesh but also the cheating motor workshop owner paying him and his gang in the same coin and sets the undisciplined subordinates in the office also right. Prabha is glad to see the change but she is apprehensive of his true intentions now. Col. Singh also arrives at Mumbai to check where this lovestory is heading and whether his tuition has indeed helped Arun or not. In the climax Arun does not go exactly according to the coaching of Col. Singh which was not required also and wins Prabha over through his original self only.This movie scores at several places and provides a feelgood experience to the watcher. It's a movie which most of the middle class Indians can relate to. It's a comedy but not meant for generating laughs only. It touches a chord in the viewer's heart at many places. While watching the viewer effortlessly gets attached to Arun and starts praying for his ultimate success.This movie tickles entertains and inspires all at the same time. The climax is toned down but it's always been the style of Basu Da to keep a low profile climax in his movies. Entertainment prevails throughout and there is no boring moment in the movie. It appears to be the love story of any ordinary youth and hence a layman can relate to it. It was made when the term RomCom was not used in the cinecircles. But it's an excellent romcom with a perfect mix of comedy and romance. It's the simplicity prevailing in every nook and corner of this movie that goes deep into the heart of the viewer.Amol Palekar had mastered the art of playing a straightforward and simple hero having boy next door looks during the seventies and created his own fanfollowing. Chhoti Si Baat is one of his such kind of movies only with the role being a tailormade one for him. He makes the viewer get attached to his smiles and sadness and his triumph in the end appears to the viewer as his own triumph in the battle of life and love. Vidya Sinha was the perfect choice for the girl next door kind of roles due to her simple middle class looks and natural acting in such type of roles. Asrani is marvellous like always. However the showstealer is Ashok Kumar the seniormost actor of Bollywood during that era. The scriptwriter and dialoguewriter have immensely helped this seasoned actor in delivering a memorable performance.Yogesh beautiful lyrics of high literary quality have been strung in heartsoothing melodies by Salil Choudhary. The best song is the title track  Na Jaane Kyun Hota Hai Ye Zindagi Ke Saath Lata. Jaaneman Jaaneman Tere Do Nayan Asha and Yesudas Ye Din Kya Aaye Lage Phool Hanse Mukesh etc. are also unforgettable ones for the melody and literature lovers alike.The filmmakers of today can learn a lot from this classic romcom as to how to make neat and clean family movies containing stories of laymen. I opine that a lady may lose her heart to a simpleton but she wants her man to be a simpleton for herself not for the world because she can never tolerate the love of her life losing out to the others in different spheres of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "A BEDTIME STORY Paramount 1933 directed by Norman Taurog is a cute and simple story about how fate steps in and changes the life of a Frenchman playboy for the sake of an abandoned baby. The Frenchman in question is Rene Maurice Chevalier whose introduction to the story being the focus of his straw hat twirling on top of his cane exiting the train onto the station in Paris after spending some time away big game hunting in Africa. Because no one is aware of his early arrival Rene makes arrangements to spend an hour with not one but three attractive young ladies at separate times Suzanne Betty Lorraine a florist Gabrielle Leah Ray a night club singer and Paulette Adrienne Ames now married to the ever jealous Max Earle Foxe who makes no qualms about remaining friends with him. Although engaged Rene does not let his arrival be known to his fianc Louise Gertrude Michael so to have a little fling before getting married. As he telephones the aforementioned ladies Rene's luggage is being packed into his car while at the same time a poor couple Frank Reicher and Ethel Wales formerly maid and butler find they are unable to care for their now deceased employer's child attempt to find him a good home by placing the orphaned baby Baby LeRoy in the back seat of Rene's car. That night in Rene's apartment the baby is brought to the attention of his servant Victor Edward Everett Horton. Rene decides to unload the child by calling the authorities but rather than having the boy placed in an orphanage Rene decides to keep the child he calls Monsieur Baby. By doing this Rene forgets about his ladies in waiting all awaiting his arrival that never happens. With the baby in the care of the two men Rene calls for a governessnurse who turns out to be a stranded American showgirl named Sally Helen Twelvetrees whom he hires. All appears to go well until Rene attends a function hosted by his fianc Louise who becomes humiliated not so much by the presence of Sally and Victor but with the baby and makes it known that she doesn't want that M'sieur Baby into their lives.A musical that might have played as either a straight light comedy or drama the writers inserted some songs into the scenario all sung during the first hour so not to take away from Chevalier's image. Unlike some of his earlier works on film Chevalier doesn't sing directly into the camera but to the ever attention of Baby LeRoy. With music and lyrics by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin songs include Look What I've Got? sung by Leah Ray M'Sieu Babysung by Chevalier to LeRoy In the Park in Paree sung by Chevalier as he strolls LeRoy in his baby carriage and Home Made Heaven sung by Chevalier to Helen Twelvetrees. With Home Made Heaven being the film's best liked tune the most memorable happens to be the one not sung by Chevalier. Look What I've Got might not sound like a familiar song title but the score is having been used as background music in one of the funnier scenes of the most revived comedy of INTERNATIONAL HOUSE 1933 involving Peggy Hopkins Joyce and W.C. Fields taking separate showers in the same hotel room. M'sieur Baby as sung by Chevalier to Baby LeRoy might have been inspired by Al Jolson's lullaby of Sonny Boy to his threeyearold son in THE SINGING FOOL 1928 but M'sieur Baby never became noteworthy. Unlike THE SINGING FOOL A BEDTIME STORY is geared more towards comedy than drama. There is a touch of sentiment however in a scene where Chevalier kisses his new found son followed by him lifting his head up proud and holding back tears of joy.Baby LeRoy making his movie debut is best remembered today as the comic foil to comedian W.C. Fields in such notable comedies as TILLIE AND GUS 1933 THE OLDFASHIONED WAY and IT'S A GIFT both 1934. His career ended by the time he reached the age of four in 1935. Helen Twelvetrees in her only performance opposite Chevalier has charm but lacks the sort of charisma found in some of his other leading ladies as Claudette Colbert and Jeanette MacDonaldt. Gertrude Michael steps in once again on screen playing one of her many unreasonable jealous characterizations a sort of role she specialized in at that time.Virtually forgotten today and a lesser achievement to some of his best films especially those under the direction of Ernst Lubitsch A BEDTIME STORY is Chevalier's movie from start to finish though Edward Everett Horton and Baby LeRoy come close to nearly stealing it. Baby LeRoy gets all the cute closeups and dubbedin baby sounds as well acquiring watches to break by crashing them onto the floor. When being taken for a stroll the baby looks directly at the big clock attached to the street pole leaving Chevalier to reply Be reasonable! Be reasonable! Horton as Chevalier's manservant brings all his familiarity into his role. One amusing scene has him giving Rene a shave and during their conversation learns that one of his employer's many girlfriends happens to be his wife leaving Rene to sit motionless as Victor coldly uses the razor blade shaving around his neck leaving Rene to sit back and wonder if he'll do anything drastic. Cleaver touch of suspense comedy.There have been several movies over the years bearing the title of A BEDTIME STORY but while the story has been revamped in different ways this screenplay by Waldemar Young has never been remade nor has it ever been distributed on video cassette. However it did have limited revivals on the American Movie Classics cable channel from February to November of 1989. With this being the only pairing of Chevalier and Baby LeRoy this is their story captured on film. ".

	onyx:emotionText "A BEDTIME STORY Paramount 1933 directed by Norman Taurog is a cute and simple story about how fate steps in and changes the life of a Frenchman playboy for the sake of an abandoned baby. The Frenchman in question is Rene Maurice Chevalier whose introduction to the story being the focus of his straw hat twirling on top of his cane exiting the train onto the station in Paris after spending some time away big game hunting in Africa. Because no one is aware of his early arrival Rene makes arrangements to spend an hour with not one but three attractive young ladies at separate times Suzanne Betty Lorraine a florist Gabrielle Leah Ray a night club singer and Paulette Adrienne Ames now married to the ever jealous Max Earle Foxe who makes no qualms about remaining friends with him. Although engaged Rene does not let his arrival be known to his fianc Louise Gertrude Michael so to have a little fling before getting married. As he telephones the aforementioned ladies Rene's luggage is being packed into his car while at the same time a poor couple Frank Reicher and Ethel Wales formerly maid and butler find they are unable to care for their now deceased employer's child attempt to find him a good home by placing the orphaned baby Baby LeRoy in the back seat of Rene's car. That night in Rene's apartment the baby is brought to the attention of his servant Victor Edward Everett Horton. Rene decides to unload the child by calling the authorities but rather than having the boy placed in an orphanage Rene decides to keep the child he calls Monsieur Baby.

No further description needed. Maurice sings some songs written by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin not quite up to the standard of what he usually sang in his films but serviceable enough for the film.Chevalier was not happy with this film or his next and last one with Paramount The Way To Love.

Tawaif remains relatively an underrated and unnoticed film by him. Tawaif stands for a courtesan or a prostitute and the film depicts prostitution is due to some unwanted circumstances of life and even under a prostitute dwells a lady who wants to live and love. The theme just beautifully unravels in the film with some touching sequences. The best thing of the film is the Urdu language it uses which feels just mesmerizing and the formal presentation of the setting and character just makes it a film to treasure. Rishi Kapoor Rati Agnihotri and Sushma Seth were the ones to give the best ones in the film. However it couldn't also avoid the regular characters of formulaic movies played by Kader Khan or Asrani. Few songs are also good. Overall it's the simplicity and the sensitivity with which the story is dealt makes this film even a treat to watch. I had watched this film over 15 years and still today I'm touched with certain sequences of the film.Rating 2 stars out of 4".

She is beautiful and talented and enacted the role of a tawaif prostitute superbly. This movie is among Bollywood's underrated films which won only 2 awards that year.

It was good to see them together again though there was far less chemistry than they enjoyed in the first film.The stunt work was fairly good though some was a bit overthetop and not particularly believable. All in all though it added a bit to the overall story.The most disappointing aspects of the movie were select portions of the scripting and casting. For example young Joaquin speaks in 2005 language  150 years too early. Those creating the script should have restrained themselves and used a bit more time to research the language of the era being portrayed in the story.As to scripting unless my eyes deceived me one of the padres in the film actually Joaquin's teacher appeared to be one of the Dons from the first film. I am unsure why this would have been a choice by the casting folks  and further unsure why it would be approved by the producer or the director.Finally the film seemed to drag out a bit  didn't need to be 2 hours long in my estimation.With all of this said it is worth seeing.

	schema:headline " Decent follow up is at least oldschool cool";
	schema:reviewBody "As a more than passing fan of the Zorro movies that span the decades I had been waiting since 1998 for a sequel to Martin Campbell's 'Mask of Zorro.' That movie took much though not everything of the best of the various Zorro films serials and series and then stole from other sources such as Dumas 'Monte Cristo' etc to concoct a sexy swashbuckling action adventure that had great pacing and strengths with high production values and actors. Mr. Campbell and those high standards at last return to the story begun and we now follow our heroes and their son as California fights to join a struggling Union. Zorro's character is not quite so impulsive and cool as he once was but simply comfortable and ultracapable while his wife Elena complains that the man behind the mask knows not who their son is growing up to be. None of these character 'upgrades' felt wrong to me it was natural extensions of them from the first film despite how adventurous Elena claims to still be and for the most part isn't but it does make the first act of this movie a bit tiresome after the initial awesome action sequence. This time though as the story and its many plotpoints begin to move the writers borrow heavily from Hitchcock to keep things interesting. It doesn't always work as there's a lot going on but never QUITE coming perfectly cohesively together but ultimately it makes sense and spins a good yarn for the fighting to take over. Meanwhile the stunt coordinators take what has already been done in the best Zorro flicks and then go wild with it giving us stunts and action of oldschoolcool caliber such as stagecoaches leaps and horses jumping on to explosiveladen locomotives. Unfortunately there is not quite enough action and while I do like the overall story  with its subtle bits of murk and dirty grays underneath the battle of white and black hats  it doesn't actually pace perfectly giving us bickering Vega family exploits and Zorro failures for a rather large portion of the picture. The sword fights are fewer and more farbetween than I would have liked sometimes degrading to fisticuffs instead of proper dicing but then the explosions almost make up for it all. The humor is a bit silly provided mostly by the horse!! and the sometimesannoying kid but the audience ate it up. The villains are good if never entirely fleshed out and the themes are handled well. It's the lag caused by the idea which I never understood that 'once a couple gets together they're not interesting anymore' that slows things. Regardless of my small issues the movie DOES deliver as a Zorro film with a good ending for certain and while it doesn't completely live up to its predecessor it is a worthy sequel  just not entirely the direction I would have gone.".

But those who opposed California becoming a state in the Union are planning a new threat that might change their plans.The Mask Of Zorro was a pretty good film. The sequel isn't as good yet it's still enjoyable. I personally would rather have the PG13 rating but surprisingly the sequel didn't actually suck. I have to give credit to the cast and director. Martin Campbell knows how to direct action and he made this film very entertaining to watch. The story is a little weak and there isn't really anything new to found here but the action makes up for that.The acting is solid just like the first one. Antonio Banderas takes the role of Zorro again and he does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones returns as Elena and she also does a pretty good job. These two have a lot of chemistry together and they are interesting to watch on screen. The new addition to the cast and the person who almost ruined the film is Adrian Alonso. He plays Joaquin the son of Zorro and Elena. He has a few funny lines but for the most part he is really annoying. His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.Many people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying nothing too major though. In the end if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed. However if you want something in the vein of National Treasure a safe family action film then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too. Rating 610".

They have combined Civil War 18611865 with California becoming a statethat never happened. California was a state way before the Civil War was a reality. They even have the wrong American flag when they signed the paper making California a state. There are so many mistakes that make this movie a total complete fiasco. Maybe the makers of the movie should have made this movie an 'alternate history' movie even that would not save this movie. This movie was just horrible. As a movie this tries to make Zorro a legend. He and his wife undergo a divorce and here reality takes a complete leap into unbelievability. Divorce did not exist back then as it does today. Divorced his wife works for the Pinkertons as an undercover agent for the U.S. government. In reality Pinkerton was a private detective agency and did not work for the U.S. government at this time it only worked for the U.S. about 12 years later during the Civil War. Zorro exposes the nefarious plot saves the day and helps California to become a state. The railroad was not as big back then and not big at all until after the Civil War when the Continental railroad system was made in the 1870's. Even using the Henry rifle in California was wrong. The stunts do not save this mess even Antonio and Catherine were not able to save it. The original 'Mask of Zorro' was better than this mess.".

The movie's attempt at comedy came across as just plain goofy. There was just enough violence to ruin the movie for younger children one child in the theater started crying. Anthony Hopkins lent the lat movie a touch of class that is lacking in this film.

Of course less then 100 years before these ludicrous events the French were very much the allies of the fledgling US but never mind.Shades of the UN security council I think  transparently so.

The minime Zorro son was fine with me also and got lots of laughs from the audience. Good villains and great scenery from San Luis Potosi in Mexico. Good stunts especially with the horse. While some of the plot may seem unbelievable you must suspend belief and just sit back for a good time. The audience applauded at the end. Nice music too!".

Highly predictable uninspiring storyline lock stock and barrel stereotype characters poor dialog over the top laughable stunt scenes...I could go on forever but I can't waste more time with this movie.

Also it wasn't that easy to get a divorce in 1850 like Elena did. Three months after she kicked her husband out of the house and divorced him she was engaged to another man which was highly scandalous because Catholics didn't remarry at that point without being excommunicated.

The ultimate version Slayers fields death row convicts as gladiators in a desperate dim bid for survival which noone made yet. The champion John 'Kable' Tillman was scheduled to die just before he'ld gain release but he persuades his teenage 'handler' to hand over the reins so he can fully use his talents and experience. Thus Kable escapes to freedom only to be chased illegally by Castle's men yet fights back all the way to his HQ and challenges his evil hidden plans.";

If you want Gerald Butler running around shooting people fighting people baring his muscles and looking tough like action heroes do go ahead and see it. If you want Michael C. Hall playing an evil guy trying to take over the world and baring his muscles and even showing off his Broadway background a little bit go ahead and see it. but you'd be a little disappointed since he shows up less than you'd expect as this is quite a short movie only 1.5 hours. Even if you want to see some hot lesbian actions probably imagined by very nonlesbian people or a cute teenage boy who probably isn't supposed to do anything other than being a cute teenage boy...go ahead and see it.But If you want go in and find some surprise and twistfilled plot some complicated multilayer character development or some brilliant insight into society or even humanity then no don't go see Gamer.The problem is if you are really expecting the later things I mentioned I think it's partially you fault that you are going to spend one and a half hour of your precious time sitting in a theater suffering from this movie and then hate it with a passion. Because really those aren't what Gamer is meant to be even though some people may actually believe that they are.The reality is that while not what many would call a great or even good movie Gamer could be thoroughly enjoyed as long as you know what it should be. Because I think it's everything it set out to be. You just need to maybe grudgingly accept what it's supposed to be and either enjoy it for what it is or realize that it's not a movie for your high level of intelligence and ignore it completely.".

	schema:reviewBody "The previews of Gamer didn't terribly appeal to me. However after reading some initial reviews and seeing that the people over at Joblo found it to be pretty decent I thought I would check it out. Was it what I thought it would be? Kind of. Was it entertaining? Sure.Gamer is first and foremost mostly a brainless action film in the vein of Crank and other hyperkinetic actioneers which is presented in fast somewhat jittery cuts. There's plenty of ultraviolence here and a world of ubertech that revolves around mind control and the next phase in adult entertainment. While the premise seems a bit silly with some people subjecting themselves to more demeaning elements it is a bit thought provoking which is kind of nice in an action film. It does edge close to Schwarzenegger's Running Man although this film stands on its own with a stern Gerard Butler and overthetop Michael C Hall.Still you can't help but feel detached from everything. The film rushes itself finally slowing down to a decent pace at the end with an ending that is very fitting and entertaining. However most of it is a mix between speedy action and lackluster dramatic scenes. Why Leguizamo is in this film I have no clue. There is enough action and technogunk here however to make for an entertaining 90 minutes. There's also plenty of TA which is rare in films these days although I found most of it to be not veyr attractive. The interesting thing is that the film does do a good job of creating a world that could potentially exist. No matter how disturbing some elements in the film may be they seem to have an air of truth and that elevates this film justaboveaverage.Although it is certainly a film with many short comings it's entertaining and presents an interesting world with some scary realizations. Let us hope that in our lifetime we don't see this sort of thing happen.".

It's stylishly made with lots of tense action from the beginning to the end to keep one satisfied. The motion picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectaculars scenes . The tale packs unstopped movement and is extremely entertaining for action lovers and videogames fans . The battle scenes are made with authentic stunts but also by C.G.I . This story about a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad is professionally told  though it results to be a postmodern version of The running man 1987 by Paul Michael Glaser and based on a Stephen King's novel . Directors writers  producers Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine present an eyepopping glimpse at the television of tomorrow . This witty slice of sociological future world keeps the action flowing throughout and presents us with some bizarrely fascinating villains  especially played by Michael C Hall  as well as the usual action frolics. One query however  is over the high level of violence and some erotic scenes that contain this exciting film . Rating  55 . Acceptable and passable .".

This movie takes video gaming to the extreme and makes you wonder if there are any boundaries to what man will do to amuse themselves! Michael. C. Hall is a hoot to watch and the singing and dancing scene was hilarious and genius in a movie like this. It had the feel of the MatrixRunning Man and didn't take itself too seriously which is why I loved it. Also if you play video games you will enjoy the scenes in Society and the characters that are portrayed. This is without doubt a modern day action blockbuster with hints of the 80' and 90's classics.

On the other hand if you want to see a rehash of some of my favourite tongueincheek scifi movies but without the story then be my guest....but don't say I didn't warn you.310 purely for the mention of teabagging";

The movie being abstract worked very well for everything besides the slayers sequences but those were surprisingly short. Something that I thought they did very well though is showing how the user interacts with their character. In MMO's today you have aholes who will screw up other people's fun and during one of the society scenes there is an example of this with the roller blading. Its made even more powerful by people laughing at other people 's injuries disgracing of dead bodies etc. because its the icons avatars getting abused not the users.From an academic standpoint this movie is great since it shows off how sick and uncaring people can be when its not their bodies being abused or shot at.Anyways if you want to see this movie I warn you that there it is rated R for good reasons. It made me think that they should separate the Rrating into R1 and R2 or R and RR. This is because many R movies are liteR's some swearing some nudity some blood but nothing outofcontrol so to speak and many other R movies are heavyR's i.e. saw many cheesy horror flicks and this movie".

The commentary on things such as people living reality through gameplay and the depths to which society will sink for entertainment are on the mark. Aside from Slayers Castle also created an earlier game called Society which is sort of like Sim City only with real people. Gamers control people in the game and make them do whatever disgusting act they want such as burning themselves sex fantasies and the like. I personally felt these were the most effective segments in the film including a perfect use of the song The Bad Touch.Michael C. Hall was a big draw for me as he is terrific on one of my favorite TV shows Dexter. As expected he was the standout among the cast. His Ken Castle is an overthetop megalomaniacal nut case and I enjoyed every moment he was on screen. Alas he wasn't on screen as often as I expected going in. We naturally get much more of Gerard Butler who isn't much of an actor from what I've seen. He's tolerable here but nothing special. We also get a few smaller roles for the likes of Kyra Sedgwick Pathology's Milo Ventimiglia Terry Crews who feels out of place in a noncomedic role and terrific Drag Me to Hell actress Alison Lohman.The action itself is underwhelming as it suffers from the all too common quick cuttingshaky cam routine. I have to admit that doesn't bother me as often as it does most people but it did here. There's also one ridiculous scene involving Kable filling up a truck's fuel tank with something other than fuel. Regardless while a flawed film it does have some solid material to offer.

I had only seen one short preview which made it look like any other postRunning Man fightyourwayoutoftrouble action flick that sees the protagonist trapped in a game showlike fantasy going through army's of bad guys like Pacman through so many of those little pills. I didn't know however that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the writerdirector duo that brought us Crank and Crank High Voltage were at the helm of Gamer. The first minutes of the movie made that distinctly clear though as high powered action and fast paced kinetic camerawork introduce us to the world of Slayer a firstperson shooter that has its inmate characters live and die at the controls of real world gamers. Movements of both players and camera and the feel of the game are right on the money if you've ever seen shooters like Counterstrike or Call of Duty.The world of Gamer is a not too distant future where Castle an overnight software giant shying the likes of Microsoft and Google reigns supreme. Its young manager media mogul Ken Castle couldn't be more offspring of Generation X or Michael C. Hall's joyfully overacted and clearly Dexterbased part would be played by Coupland himself. The immense riches brought on by his revolutionary gaming technologies make him a haveitall loner who has lost all contact with the everyday reality spawned by Taylor and Neveldine. The virtual world is slowly replacing the tangible one as more and more people hook on to games like Society where you get to control an actual human being in a moreorless fictional setting best described as Sims at a Mad Maxthemed rave dressed by Brno. It is in these aspects that the directors are at their best using internet and other digital references to portray these future playgrounds hyper technological media and the next generation of adult entertainment. The kind of future not quite as dark as the one imagined by Orwell but pretty scary nonetheless like we're all trapped in the Ministry of Virtual Reality.If Castle's virtual world Society laid the first bricks for his soontobe world dominating company second invention Slayer certainly paved the rest of the way captivating a loyal audience the world over. The hero of the game is Kable a contemporary Ben Richards if you will or John Tillman outside the map of the game played by Gerard Butler. A prison inmate who gets a fighting chance for parole if he successfully completes thirty missions in Slayer. Which means the seventeenyearold professional gamer that controls him has to beat a world full of other gamers most notably Terry Crews' Hackman an allkilling alldancing beast of man whose impressive physique neck short singing routine 'I haven't got any strings' and the fact there's noone in the real world controlling him make him more fierce than Dynamo Fireball and Buzzsaw combined. Rich background casting is provided as well seeing supporting parts for Ludicrous John Leguizamo Alison Lohman Milo Ventimiglia and Keith David among others although some in a blinkandyou'llmiss'em capacity but this is clearly an allout Butlershow. Quite possibly due to the fact the makers intended to put moviegoers into the perspective of his character as well.Tillman's wife Amber Valletta and daughter on the outside are what keep him going but we soon find out he hides an important secret as well one that Castle would very much like to remain hidden. In the end that gambit combined with the somewhat rushed climax are what amount to Gamer falling short of being a true original but other than that I highly recommend you go see this movie. The extremely detailed look at a possible future makes it eerily clear we may be closer to an alternative 1984 than we are past it.".

Rich background casting is provided as well seeing supporting parts for Ludicrous John Leguizamo Alison Lohman Milo Ventimiglia and Keith David among others although some in a blinkandyou'llmiss'em capacity but this is clearly an allout Butlershow. Quite possibly due to the fact the makers intended to put moviegoers into the perspective of his character as well.Tillman's wife Amber Valletta and daughter on the outside are what keep him going but we soon find out he hides an important secret as well one that Castle would very much like to remain hidden. In the end that gambit combined with the somewhat rushed climax are what amount to Gamer falling short of being a true original but other than that I highly recommend you go see this movie. The extremely detailed look at a possible future makes it eerily clear we may be closer to an alternative 1984 than we are past it.";

I am not a fan of Gerard Butler in general I find his acting terribly limited but he was fine. Logan Lerman and Michael C. Hall were great and there is a musical number in the film that is pure genius. Made me want to stand up and cheer. The whole film is like an explosion right in your face. Everything is over the top  the style the violence the story. It is a real fun ride while being incredible edgy and dark. There is also quite a bit of social criticism layered in there dealing with voyeurism cocooning the culture of video games. Leaving the theater I didn't know if I wanted to rush home and get my XBox going or never play a video game again. Great job NeveldineTaylor! Can't wait to see it again with all the special effects done!".

Apart from inducing a headache they pretty much view like a clockwork orange style compilation of extreme violence and random bizarre images.I'd love to see the work done in post production. OK let's put that clip there of the guy in the white coat pushing a broom getting his head blown off then cut to Kable looking determined quick shot of kid in weird videodrome quick cut to Kable looking determined cut to fat guy cut to guy getting neck snapped cut to white noise cut to explosion cut to blurry dotted image of man getting large spray of blood across his face cut to Kable looking determined  oh yes that's great work right there. But I think we need another shot of a guy getting his head blown off....It really is a mess and leaves you wanting to turn away from the screen or hoping for the next slow mo explosiontruck rampact of extreme violence just to give the eyes a break.Now to the story.The story is  the running man  yes the film made 20 years earlier that still looks better than this has been mercilessly ripped off for pretty much the entire storyline. Oh no sorry I forgot in this case a guy controls the guy in the show sorry game  or does he? There is some convoluted dialogue regarding this but to clear up any further problems that this creates with regard to Kable's exceptional ability the plot device of cutting him loose to reduce his ping is deployed halfway in.As far as I'm concerned that really did highlight the pointlessness of the avatar controller who seemed to add nothing at all to running man's excellent premise and story.Anyhow here's the spoiler I warned about so don't read on if you want to avoid it.....Arnie... whoops sorry.... Kable busts out of the game and meets the leader of the resistance  the ultimate computer geek hacker perfectly cast as hip hop rapper Ludacris.The dialogue is at times extremely comical at this point with references to some seriously off the hook low ass ping response times being met with a grave expression of concern by Kable.But this is where I have to give the director some real credit. The film has really not gone well up to this point and it would take something special to redeem it. Luckily he has a trick up his sleeve.Kable goes to confront the evil software engineer behind the slayer series Ken Castle and enters a dimly lit room with no exits. Slowly a dozen burly henchmen file out and at the centre of them is software hardman Ken. Now I thought I knew what was coming and boy was I wrong. Here the director displays a stroke of true genius by entering Ken and his henchmen into a song and dance number!At this point I was truly bewildered.Anyway cue the traditional We've reverse hacked you and I've hacked you back no I've hacked you really craftily...etc etc and then them driving a car through a tunnel.Absolutely sterling stuff.".

	schema:headline " Soso at best more notable for missed potential rather than what it does";
	schema:reviewBody "At one point during this film my girlfriend commented that it looked just like Modern Warfare 2  a game she has seen me play all too much and all too frequently. Indeed it does look very much like a FPS at times and this is the point of what is essentially the concept of The Running Man updated for the modern world of online gaming and living other lives out via the internet. Although the idea is farfetched in terms of controlling people and indeed killing them it is not a huge step for a fantasy film and it stays close to the world of Second Life The Sims and the Call of Duty online shooter franchise. So to my mind this film had potential to be relevant interesting insightful or at least have loads of good action.The problem is that while it does a very small amount of all those things it doesn't really do anything particularly well. The makerswriters clearly know the world they are entering here witness a fat man playing a hot woman online or a soldier teabagging a fallen enemy in the middle of all the action but they don't seem to have an opinion on it all or if they do then it doesn't come across very well in the writing. I say this because the social commentary here is minimal. OK there are certain things shown that are exaggerated versions of where we now are but that in itself is not enough to count  there is no opinion behind it nothing for the viewer to think about either then or later on that evening. This leaves the action to carry the film.On this front the film is OK as it has noise and a sort of plot for us to follow. Problem is that the way both are delivered actually detracts rather than enhances. I get the idea  the rapid editing and regular static touches to the footage meant to suggest the world of broadcast and online media. Problem is that it is all too frantic and too excessive to really engage. The Second Life sections are just too OTT to not seem daft and it doesn't feel like an established online game but rather everyone enjoying the novelty of it which is not where this part of the film is. Again the hot pants regular nudity and general female sexuality is all part of the gaming world but done to excess like it is here it spoils things a bit rather than being a fair observation  it feels the film is overdoing it on purpose to play to these viewers. Similarly the action is hampered by two things. Firstly the same frantic editing makes it all too chaotic and too hard to get into in terms of being an action movie. The second thing to note is that by being so close to a FPS in terms of look it forgets that generally video games are best when played and actually make for pretty dull viewing when you're waiting for your turn. The action scenes are mostly soso where really these should have been the place where the viewer is gotten into the film. Perhaps the style worked with Crank because the whole film was nonsense but here the concept doesn't suit it.The cast were maybe attracted by the concept hoping for more intelligence but nobody has much to do. Butler remains to be nothing more than a solid presence to me  not sure why he is seen as a big star lead all of a sudden but here we are. He is OK I guess but his performance cannot find the humanity or comment that is lacking from the script. More irritating is the way Hall is wasted. So great in Six Feet Under and Dexter he has very little to work with here  although he still works with it well. Sedgwick is equally wasted while Ludicrous appears to have done all his stuff in about two days and has no character to speak of. Crews is a physical presence but again his part in the film is so poorly thought out that he might as well not be there. Nobody really excels here and it is all about the delivery  which sadly isn't great either.Overall Gamer is a distraction that works on that level but never gets close to the potential it has. At moments it seems like it will be excessive craziness like Crank was  but it doesn't ever follow through on that even if it does produce a great moment for Pysch fans. It has a concept that suggests social commentary but doesn't have anything to say. Finally it sells itself as an action movie but is put together in such a way that the action doesn't have a flow to it that draws the viewer in. For all it offers Gamer is sadly average at best  distracting and short but that's about the height of the praise I can offer it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leaving the theater after seeing Gamer I truly felt as if my brain had been tossed into a meat grinder. Neveldine and Taylor the directing team behind the Crank series is back again with an action movie that only further shows that this directing duo are the supreme rulers of the 21st century action genre. Dear god this movie is just..........holy mother of.........indescribable. How can mere mortal words explain just how amazing this movie is? Gerard Butler plays Kable a death row inmate wrapped up in a cruel game that has captivated the minds of the entire human race. Convicted death row inmates are given a choice in this depiction of a notsofaroff earth future rot in jail or take part in a game in which you must fight your way through thirty rounds of mayhem to be set free. But there's a catch.....when you are in a match a gamer has complete control of your physical movements. It's an interesting plot that is thrown out the window in favor of massive gunfights and explosions. Seriously watching this movie is an absolutely insane experience from start to finish a fulfilling movie for the mind and soul.Gamer is the movie that Michael Bay has tried for over a decade to make and has failed miserably each and every time. Neveldine and Taylor just know exactly what action fans want to see and have succeeded in reviving the dead action genre three time out of their three directing attempts. The action scenes in this movie are simply stunning in every sense of the word. Cars do barrel rolls through the air while engulfed in flames body parts are mangled human corpses are thrown across the screen like ragdolls.......it's truly a spectacle to behold. The constant action pulls viewers in thanks to being coupled with great effects and a hardcore musical score.Another great aspect of the film is the cinematography which is nothing short of genius. Normally shaking the camera this violently only helps to hammer in the nails on a movie's coffin but here it is done so well and with such brilliant direction that it enhances the tense feelings given off throughout the movie. Sure there is the occasional obvious green screen effect but that's all part of the fun that Neveldine and Taylor are known for with their Crank series which Gamer takes quite a few notes from.Random cameos are in no short supply either in Gamer but it's many lesser known stars such as James Roday and Maggie Lawson from Psych and Milo Ventimiglia from Heroes. Even John Leguizamo has an important role in the movie in which he performs very naturally. As far as the supporting cast is considered Michael C. Hall and Kyra Sedgwick are both phenomenal and despite them seeming to be odd choices for a movie such as this the casting decisions were nothing short of excellent.What can I possibly say that will assure that you go see Gamer in the theaters? Seriously if you are looking for an action movie in a time when action movies tend to suck look no further than Neveldine and Taylor's latest action masterpiece. It's an electrifying and explosive flick that is pervasively loud and violent and that's all we action fans could ever ask for. One of the best action movies of the decade and one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Two thumbs up and expect to have your mind splattered across the theater walls.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first run around I turned Gamer off after thirty minutes. The directing and editing was so bad  with no single shot seeming to last for more than half a second  that I could barely follow the story and found the action unintelligible and boring. It is shot like a 2hour long music video. No establishing shots nothing subtle rapidfire editing overuse of shakycam and not one single shot that isn't angled weird or pointing up someone's nose.Only three movies I can recall had directing and editing this distracting annoying and selfcongratulating. Those were Catwoman 04 Vidocq 01 and Transporter 3 08. If you could handle those movies then you might enjoy Gamer.So yes I turned it off but then I decided to review it anyway to perhaps save a few folks like me people who can't stand this new era of ADHD movie directing some time. So the next day I sat down and suffered through the last two thirds. And yes suffer is the right word.It's a pity as I see it. Michael C Hall was a fabulous bad guy. Gerard Butler is a tried and tested action hero. The concept and script weren't altogether losses. But boy do these directors yes it took TWO of them to make something this awful need to get over themselves and learn how to visually tell a story without getting in the way of it. It worked for Crank because the style matched the frantic subject matter and almost became part of the theme of that movie.

	onyx:emotionText "The first run around I turned Gamer off after thirty minutes. The directing and editing was so bad  with no single shot seeming to last for more than half a second  that I could barely follow the story and found the action unintelligible and boring. It is shot like a 2hour long music video. No establishing shots nothing subtle rapidfire editing overuse of shakycam and not one single shot that isn't angled weird or pointing up someone's nose.Only three movies I can recall had directing and editing this distracting annoying and selfcongratulating. Those were Catwoman 04 Vidocq 01 and Transporter 3 08. If you could handle those movies then you might enjoy Gamer.So yes I turned it off but then I decided to review it anyway to perhaps save a few folks like me people who can't stand this new era of ADHD movie directing some time. So the next day I sat down and suffered through the last two thirds. And yes suffer is the right word.It's a pity as I see it. Michael C Hall was a fabulous bad guy. Gerard Butler is a tried and tested action hero. The concept and script weren't altogether losses. But boy do these directors yes it took TWO of them to make something this awful need to get over themselves and learn how to visually tell a story without getting in the way of it. It worked for Crank because the style matched the frantic subject matter and almost became part of the theme of that movie.

He has done that to every person because he wants to control them. But Kable gets out and starts doing a bunch of stuff including trying to find his wife. Now as I said the plot of the film is kind of interesting. But the movie is just plain stupid. The film has appearances by John Leguizamo and even Allison Lohman. Kyra Sedwick also stars as a talk show host. The moments with those stars actually had me interested. But the film was really stupid. This movie is just a dragging mess. That is the last time I will ever let my sister choose a movie again. Oh my god this movie was so horrible. I originally thought Land of the lost was the worst movie of the year. But it is official. Gamer is the most dreadful movie of the year. They could've done it a lot better because it had a good story. Instead they made it blow. This is a game I would never rent.

Bare with me I am still trying to determine a proper format for film commentary. Look at this film gamer its a great movie as far as game related films go. It had that drive that was derived from the action that pushed the story without faltering or coming off as filler. Although action was the drive it was not always front and foremost when the time came the action drifted to the bottom and became the undercurrent on which other aspects of the film would ride on. And ride on that undercurrent is exactly what the story of this film did. It left a few open ended questions like where exactly everything took place when how did one gain access to control a player and a myriad of other questions that could have been answered with a next to no story telling. The story was a familiar format action history conflict twist climax and resolution. But without telling too much about the film I can say the story leaves a bit to be desired. But the execution was magnificent the directors made sure to dig into the literal gaming world and pull out various aspects of it that the gaming demographic would recognize. First few scenes there are some classic fps tea bagging and crouch jumping. And during the Sim like scenes it brought up many things that players actually do when playing seems and you definitely feel that if your Sims really had a mind in the real game there would be a few issues with playing the game. For the demographic the movie lacked some comedic packaging and that fact really effects my view of the message of the film.What I think of the message is neither here nor there. But I do think highly of this movie even if it will keep me from enjoying Sims for some time to come. I believe the film is a satire maybe not in it's entirety but in some parts on humanity. The film pokes and prods at us and how morbid we can become when we are able to detach from the experience of murder bloodshed and carnage. How as we pursue a better gaming experience and story lines of ethics can become blurred very much an allusion to roman gladiators and Colosseum if you ask me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen the begining of this film and I've seen the ending of this film but not both at the same time due to its presentation at unusual time schedules on tv. Nonetheless I've seen enough to know that it's a pretty fair Tarzan lowbudget action film.Lex Barker plays Tarzan with Johnny Weismuller's pidgin English but with a California accent. Vanessa Brown plays Jane with a lot of spirit just the way Jane should be played. Let's face it if a woman is going to be running around the jungle with an ape man and chasing slave hunters she better have her wits about her and Brown's Jane certainly does.The story opens with Barker and Brown riding their elephants through a Hollywood jungle when they hear screams. Everalert to danger Tarzan swings down off of the elephant and runs to a local village thinking that the screams came from there with Jane and the monkey sidekick Cheetah close behind. When they get to the village inhabited by people who look more Middle Eastern than Central African they find the witch doctor performing a ceremony but the chief says that they did not scream so Tarzan darts back to the river to check on the local village girls who were there gathering water. When they get there they find a bowl one of the girls was using and Tarzan gets hot on the trail. Tarzan catches up to a group of three slavers who look vaguely Egyptian. He subdues one but the other two escape after conking Tarzan on the head.The villagers take the captured slaver back to the village to make him talk but he's infected with a disease and can't stand up grabbing his knees and falling to the ground. Soon other villagers are grabbing their knees and falling to the ground so Jane tells Tarzan to go to a mission to get a doctor. Tarzan goes and brings back the doctor and his voluptuous assistant who looks very European and speaks with a French accent but wears a sarong.At some point in the story Jane and the voluptuous assistant Lola are captured by the slavers and taken to a lost city along with the other village girls. Presented to the ruler of the city the girls are informed that they are to be either sold as slave girls or will join the harem. Naturally Jane and Lola resist and must be punished eventually being sealed inside a pyramid to die. Tarzan learns where they are and he tries to save them. I won't go into too much detail here because I don't want to ruin the drama but essentially Jane comes through at Tarzan's darkest hour and together they free the slave girls and escape from the city.Now even though the title has slave girl in it don't think for a second that there's going to be nudity or anything prurient like that. However we do get to see Vanessa Brown in a twopiece leather outfit rare for a Jane character it seems that reminds me of a cheerleader costume  full cut shoulder straps Vshaped neckline longer top gathered in the middle with a midthigh cut skirt. This has the effect of making Brown look very athletic which she is and really shows off her perky figure well. And as I mentioned earlier Lola comes in a sarong and has the full figure to pull it off nowadays she'd never make it as a Bmovie actress but back in the 50s I'm sure she was a ticket. The other actresses look quite lovely in their sarongs and later in their harem costumes too. Some of them look like they could've modeled for Vargas paintings or nose art on WW2 bombers.This film certainly isn't a high point of modern art but fans of Tarzan and cheap weekend movies will appreciate it for what it is a piece of 1950s nostalgia and good clean fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "This may not be a great film by anyone's standards. But apart from Tarzan speaking in short words this film I suggest after more than fifty years of reading and considering Tarzan properties is the closest any filmmaker has come to capturing the essence of Tarzan as Edgar Rice Burroughs created him. Consider this unpretentious little film's many assets. It features a very attractive and ethical young Tarzan and Jane in the persons of Lex Barker and Vanessa Brown. The feel of the film is jungle outdoors hot humid on the fringes of a rather rough civilization at best a zone on the edge of danger. There are very fine supporting performances by a cast that includes Arthur Shields Robert Alda Denise Darcel Anthony Caruso Robert Warwick and Hurd Hatfield Mary Ellen Kaye Peter Mamakos and others. The storyline involves Tarzan and the others with a somewhat alien civilization whose desperate servants ethicallychallenged leader and villains put the whole surrounding group of tribes as well as Tarzan and the others at risk by their illegal actions. The script is wellabove average the characters are quite welldeveloped and often multidimensional and the climactic escape from living death in a temple engineered by Tarzan I found to be at once exciting important and decently filmed. The plot line in Tarzan and the Slave Girl is at first sight unusually rich for an adventure story. The Lionians and their king have grown desperate. They are not producing children. Under the bad advice of Sengo played by Caruso they have begun capturing young women from surrounding peoples in order to solve their dilemma instead of seeking help through other means. Tarzan becomes involved with the problem when he tries to singlehandedly stop a raiding party from carrying off yet another victim. Finally it becomes necessary to try to reach the Lionians' capital city via an expedition through a country populated by people who disguise themselves as trees and fire blowdarts as weapons. The disease attacking the Lionians is discovered by a doctor Arthur Shields fending off amorous advances from his nurse a sexy halfcaste played by Darcel Tarzan and his trusty brave but drinkprone helper Aldaand Shields reach the city of the Lionians and find the imprisoned girls thereand also Jane and the nurse who have also been captured during their roundabout journey to the city. They fail to move the king Hatfield and Caruso convinces him to seal Tarzan and Jane in their temple as dangerous enemies to his rule. Tarzan climbs to the top of the structure and overturns the idol sealing the aperture there thus escaping the trap. Meanwhile the High Priest of the civilization Warwick is being fed to the lions for daring to speak out against the King's unethical scheme. Trazan's prowess in battle with help from his friends wins the day and Caruso falls into the lions' den Warwick being freed. Shields finds a cure for the malady and the King embraces amicable relations with all once more. The enslaved girls are returned to their homes and Alda convinces Darcel to take care of him alone and forget about seducing Tarzan. Having said so many good things about the film it is necessary to report that apart from some good action scenes especially those involving boats emerging from or reentering a swamp with islands in it a very Burroughsian touch and the city's palace interiors the production by Sol Lesser's production company in BW suffers from lack of richness. The tribes involved in the danger mostly resemble Mexican villagers with strange wigs inflicted upon them and director Lee Sholem who does well with his very fine cast of actors has no means of overcoming the budgetary handicaps under which he labors. Lesser was able to produce several muchricherlooking later Tarzan efforts to his great credit but this transitional film introduced a postJohnny Weismuller Tarzan in Lex Barker solved some of the problems that needed solving in order to improve the MGMfamilyoriented domestic barriers that kept Tarzan from seeking out important adventures and incidentally the film provided an attractive and veryBurroughsian realization of the original adventure vision the author had dreamed up as an antiCommunist argument for genetic human worth as against conditioned obedience four decades earlier. Nearly a verygood film.".

This tribe used poison blow gun darts and quite effectively. Very nicely staged.Still this was an Africa that never existed outside Hollywood sound stages.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan and the Slave Girl 1950  out of 4 Incredibly flat entry was Lex Barker's second stint as Tarzan. This time out he must do battle with some weird lionworshipers who are kidnapping women from local tribes because they are dying of a mysterious disease. Instead of getting proper medication the tribe instead plans to repopulate their village with new women including Jane Vanessa Brown. This second entry in the new RKO series is a pretty boring and uninteresting affair because the silly story could have worked as camp but sadly the material is just so poorly directed that you can't even laugh at it. I think the film gets off to a rather good start but this all goes down the tubes as soon as you see one of the men dying of some sort of fit. I'm not sure if the director could only film this scene once and they were stuck with whatever they got but the acting by this person is just so bad and his flopping around on the group so laughable that you can't help but wonder why no one ordered a second take. Things don't get much better from this point on as we see Tarzan and his friends including Cheetah walking down one trail after another trying to locate this mysterious tribe. This is part of the problem because this little adventure contains no excitement no energy and certainly doesn't make for a very good time. The entire story involving the lionworshipers is rather silly but I don't fault the film for this. After all most of the plot lines in this series were rather silly but what really kills the picture is that the director simply doesn't add any life to what's going on. Baxter is just soso in his role of Tarzan which really isn't good considering he's the star. In an introduction I saw to the film it was said that Brown had an I.Q. of 165 but you certainly couldn't tell that by her performance. She comes off incredibly dumb like as Jane and it's easy to see why she wasn't brought back for a second picture. Hurd Hatfield is pretty forgettable as the main worshiper but Denise Darcel does bring some life and fight to the picture as the doctor's assistant who falls for Tarzan. TARZAN AND THE SLAVE GIRL runs a sluggish 74minutes and sadly there's very little to be found here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actually the second Lex Barker outing as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Lord of the Apes should have been called Tarzan and the Slave Girls rather than Tarzan and the Slave Girl. Of course the action unfolds in darkest Africa and it has a largely incidental quality. Tarzan and Jane are riding an elephant through the jungle with Cheetah following close behind them on a smaller elephant. They enter the land of the Nagasi  natives that Tarzan is friendly with just as some intruders abduct one of the village girls out picking fruit. The villains are the Lionians and they are led by Sengo Anthony Caruso and capturing one village maiden is not enough for them so they try to snatch Jane as a prize. Predictably Tarzan thwarts them. Along the way our heroes discover that the Lionians are afflicted with some deadly disease. Tarzan has to fetch a doctor to save the day. Barker makes a hard charging Tarzan and Superman and the Mole People director Lee Sholem likes to show Barker scrambling through the foliage like a linebacker on the prowl. Indeed Sholem prefers to have Barker run toward the camera and leap over it and uses this setup on several occasions. Fans of the NBCTV show The ATeam may remember how all kinds of vehicles used to drive over the camera. Well Sholem constantly has Tarzan jumping over the camera running toward it or leaping over it from a reverse angle. Clocking in at 79 minutes Tarzan and the SlaveGirl follows the Ape man as he plunges into the jungle and follows the Lionians to their stomping grounds. Along the way Tarzan and company encounter some creepy natives that used poisonous blow darts and disguise themselves like the bush around them. Anthony Caruso is the chief villain and all his efforts are aimed at usurping the High Priest so he can take over. This Tarzan outing has future sexpot Denise Darcel as a native girl who wants to make out with Tarzan. At one point Darcel tangles with Tarzan's mate Jane Vanessa Brown in a twopiece outfit over Tarzan. The feverish action Barker's straightforward but muscular performance and a solid supporting cast bolsters this predictable fare. Yes Tarzan belts out his signature yell at the end when he gets trapped in a tomb and he needs an elephant to knock the walls down. Cheetah has a couple of good scenes. One of them has the chimp guzzling liquor while in the second one he is knocking out Lionian guards during the finale.".

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN AND THE SLAVE GIRL RKO Radio 1950 directed by Lee Sholem returns Lex Barker to the role made famous by Johnny Weissmuller in years past. After a promising start with TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN 1949 that introduced Barker as Lord of the Jungle along with acquiring Weissmuller's very own blonde Jane Brenda Joyce in the process this second edition finds Barker as well as the series going through another period of adjustment not so much for the stories or character development but in selecting the right actress to play Tarzan's mate. Although another blonde in the physical resemblance to Brenda Joyce might have helped fit the bill a darker redheaded type of Vanessa Brown in two piece attire in the physical manner of Maureen O'Sullivan's interpretation back in the MGM days 19321942. Regardless Brown is no threat to either O'Sullivan or Joyce.Scripted by Hans Jacoby and Arnold Belgard the writers keep the story going by inventing new tribes and situations for the jungle man to encounter. As Tarzan Lex Barker and Jane Vanessa Brown accompanied by Cheta and companion riding down the path on their elephants their peaceful venture is interrupted by the scream and abduction of one of the tribal Nagasi girls gathered together by the pond. The kidnappers are revealed to be warriors of the Lionian tribe who've been abducting girls throughout the surrounding area. With a deadly disease found among the Nagasi's that could spread and kill within a few hours Tarzan comes to the village seeking help from Doctor Campbell Arthur Shields who happens to carry a special serum that can both vaccinate and cure those infected. Campbell is assisted by Lola Denise Darcel a temperamental halfbreed nurse with flirtatious intentions on Neil Robert Alda a drunken big game hunter. She soon takes an interest in Tarzan causing Jane to become jealous.

	onyx:emotionText "TARZAN AND THE SLAVE GIRL RKO Radio 1950 directed by Lee Sholem returns Lex Barker to the role made famous by Johnny Weissmuller in years past. After a promising start with TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN 1949 that introduced Barker as Lord of the Jungle along with acquiring Weissmuller's very own blonde Jane Brenda Joyce in the process this second edition finds Barker as well as the series going through another period of adjustment not so much for the stories or character development but in selecting the right actress to play Tarzan's mate. Although another blonde in the physical resemblance to Brenda Joyce might have helped fit the bill a darker redheaded type of Vanessa Brown in two piece attire in the physical manner of Maureen O'Sullivan's interpretation back in the MGM days 19321942. Regardless Brown is no threat to either O'Sullivan or Joyce.Scripted by Hans Jacoby and Arnold Belgard the writers keep the story going by inventing new tribes and situations for the jungle man to encounter. As Tarzan Lex Barker and Jane Vanessa Brown accompanied by Cheta and companion riding down the path on their elephants their peaceful venture is interrupted by the scream and abduction of one of the tribal Nagasi girls gathered together by the pond. The kidnappers are revealed to be warriors of the Lionian tribe who've been abducting girls throughout the surrounding area. With a deadly disease found among the Nagasi's that could spread and kill within a few hours Tarzan comes to the village seeking help from Doctor Campbell Arthur Shields who happens to carry a special serum that can both vaccinate and cure those infected. Campbell is assisted by Lola Denise Darcel a temperamental halfbreed nurse with flirtatious intentions on Neil Robert Alda a drunken big game hunter. She soon takes an interest in Tarzan causing Jane to become jealous. As Tarzan Campbell and others head for the Nagasi village with the serum Jane and Lola remain behind in the tree house where they are soon taken by the Lionians as their latest slave girl victims. After Lola is whipped brutally for refusing the Prince's Hurd Hatfield advances she and Jane soon break away from their captures. As Tarzan and the safari have their own troubles avoiding poisoned darts from attacking natives and misplacing the bottled serum in the process Jane and Lola discovered hiding in the dead king's mausoleum become trapped inside as the evil Sengo Anthony Caruso gives orders to have the tomb sealed leaving the girls to be buried alive.As the Tarzan formula proved popular enough to resume a new film annually the story used for TARZAN AND THE SLAVE GIRL which plays like a chaptered serial or Saturday matine is satisfactory enough to hold interest for 74 minutes.

Again RKO added more punch in production values with top professionals in all key departments Barker took off the slippers worn in his first incursion in Burroughs' territory and all the women in the cast are beautiful although Denise Darcel makes herself a bit ugly playing her role of Lola as if she were in a vulgar sex comedy looking out of place in a Tarzan movie. The story as lineal and easy as usual is a bit intriguing when an Egyptianlooking kingdom in the African jungle or so it seems... is being affected by a strange disease Tarzan guides a doctor with a serum to the capital without knowing that the crown prince has ordered his henchmen to kidnap women from nearby tribes among whom there is Tarzan's mate Jane Parker. What Tarzan does is a lot of fun leading to a satisfactory resolution. As in the first Barker entry Cheetah steals every scene he is in.".

	schema:reviewBody "While trying hard not to be too condescending to Americans of today who somehow think the world was always as they now see it around them  this movie was made in 1943 in the darkest midst of the horrific World War II when America was engaged in a global struggle of epic proportions against the mighty Japanese Empire and other very powerful allied nations all over the world and when Manchuria China and most of Asia were occupied by the very brutal Japanese invaders. The film was released to the public more than a year before that terrible war began to reach a conclusion.In 1944 America's victory in the Second World War was by no means assured yet the US was trying to do whatever it could to assist the Chinese against the Japanese while the main US military forces fought the Japanese directly island by island westward across the Pacific. Of particular note is the fact that Japan had invaded Manchuria in 1931 and China in 1937 and that both suffered under merciless Japanese occupation for years before America formally entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The Japanese forces committed brutal atrocities against Chinese civilians and prisoners of war in the Rape of Nanking slaughtering as many as 300000 civilians within a month. Before it was over more than 10 million Chinese were mobilized by the Japanese army and enslaved for slave labor and at least 2700000 Chinese died. Japanese occupation atrocities against the Chinese included mass killings by airborne gasses on hundreds of separate occasions.The film which was being made while all this was going on but before most of the details were fully known therefore reflects the American and western thinking at the time as depicted through the keen expert eyes of the great China observer American Pulitzer Prizewinning novelist Pearl S. Buck. It also reflects what was available to Hollywood filmmakers at that desperate moment. Given the time and the circumstances the movie does quite an adequate job  all of which undoubtedly explains the involvement in it of the great American actress Katharine Hepburn. The film helped Americans at that time to understand China's desperate situation why the Chinese were worth assisting and why the US military and most Americans at home were trying hard to do just that at truly great cost. Hepburn's name on theater marquees also ensured that many more people would see the film than otherwise.Americans in 1944 didn't care one bit that the Chinese characters were being played by Americans audiences could easily imagine empathize and understand. Very many of them had already read Buck's novel with the same title published in 1942 and knew that the famous author who had written many novels about China had been a very vocal proponent of American understanding and support of China in her struggle with the Japanese. Pearl S. Buck had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938 mainly on the basis of her great China trilogy The House Of Earth including its first part The Good Earth.The Japanese surrendered unconditionally to the US on August 14 1945 and Japanese troops in China formally surrendered to the Chinese a month later but by then most of Manchuria and China had been destroyed. The people portrayed in the film had seen what the Japanese had done in Manchuria over the previous six years and then experienced Japanese brutality directly for another eight years. The 14 years of China's monumental struggles in World War II were a pivotal point in China's history. Before the Japanese invasion China had suffered nearly a century of humiliation at the hands of various imperialist powers and was relegated to a semicolonial status. However the war greatly enhanced China's resolve strength and international status. After the war the Republic of China became a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member in the Security Council. China also reclaimed Manchuria.The movie therefore helps Americans today to understand a most critical moment in China's and their own common history and why it all was and remains important.Old American Soldier".

	schema:headline " Beautiful story of the Chinese under Japanese occupation";
	schema:reviewBody "Pearl Buck's novel Dragon Seed was made into a film in 1944. Back then for reasons known only to themselves the studios did not cast Chinese to play Chinese in major roles. Looking at the film now I guess it's important to remember that to the 1944 audiences there was nothing unusual about this.Taking the nonChinese casting out of the equation for just a moment The Dragon Seed is a powerful story of what happened to the Chinese during the barbaric occupation of the Japanese. The story focuses on the family of Ling Tan Walter Huston his wife Aline McMahon and his sons Lao Er Tan Turhan Bey and wife Jade Katharine Hepburn Lao San Tan Hurd Hatfield and Lao Ta Tan Robert Bice. Jade is a modern thinker and part of the story deals with the struggles between the new times and old traditions and the role of women. The other part of the story is how various people deal with the occupation. There is submissiveness resistance and collaboration.I'm most moved by a review on this site by a man who has a Chinese fatherinlaw. His fatherinlaw loved the film. No one in China knew that America was on their side they were taught to hate the western world.So if a Chinese man can overlook the casting I suppose I can too but I can't. The acting is fantastic but one wonders what was wrong with Anna May Wong Keye Luke Sen Yung and why only the extras and children seemed to be at the very least Asian. For me the most egregious casting was that of Katharine Hepburn. Her acting came alive in the second part of the film. She once said that Spencer Tracy made her seem very feminine. He's not in this movie. In the beginning in the love scenes with her husband it doesn't come off. She's better when the character shows strength. Her finishing school accent and wig don't cut it either. Very difficult to watch. Also she seems oddly matched with Turhan Bey.This film is still well worth seeing. It's very dramatic and emotional with a very big and poignant ending.".

It contains excellent performances by the entire cast and deals with a part of the war that is rarely mentioned the Japanese occupation in China in the late 1930's.

As a vieweryou see a family courageously surviving turmoil the best way that they can. The film is entertaining all the way through. Katharine Hepburn gives one of the greatest and most underrated performances of her career.She should have gottenat leastan Oscar nomination for it. Walter Huston and Aline MacMahon are equally brilliant as the wise heads of the family. Agnes Moorehead gives a fascinating performance as a nasty inlawwho will do anything to get what she wants. Of course this film has the usual high MGM production values. I give it a 9 out of 10.".

Film's chief flaw is the fact that Pearl Buck's story is overlongand so is the film.Chinese villagers have to flee the enemy Japanese soldiers during the 1930s and WALTER HUSTON and ALINE MacMAHON are the sturdy head of a family that includes daughter KATHARINE HEPBURN as Jade. None of the three principals are particularly convincing in their Oriental makeup but it's still fascinating to watch them perform.HURD HATFIELD TURHAN BEY AKIM TAMIROFF JACQUELINE DeWIT and HENRY TRAVERS are further examples of offbeat casting but the grim story of survival of the fittest under cruel exploitation by the enemy is well crafted and always interesting to follow.The film is photographed in meticulous BW crisply produced in the handsome MGM mannerwith main attention going to Huston and MacMahon who do nicely in the leading roles. Hepburn thankfully is less mannered and less on display than usual. One of the most interesting scenes involves her decision to poison her brotherinlaw during a banquet at his mansion. Summing up Admirers of other Pearl Buck works like THE GOOD EARTH should find this unusual drama well worth watching. MGM should be commended for producing a very tasteful version of the novel. Story ends on a fever pitch with a graphic simulation of the scorched earth policy as practiced by the Chinese villagers.".

Akim Tamiroff Lu Lien becomes friends with the Japanese and is really a traitor to his Chinese family.

Led by Walter Huston as the familial patriarch the cast also includes the Russianborn and Stanislavski trained Akim Tamiroff Turhan Bey the Viennese born son of a Turkish father and Czechoslovakian mother New England patrician Katharine Hepburn the Englishborn Henry Travers and the Irish American J. Carrol Naish as a Japanese kitchen overseer.On the other hand the film must be approached in context as a propagandist flagwaver designed to highlight the Japanese menace while emphasizing the importance of the global fight for freedom. In these terms Jack Conway and Harold S. Bucquet's epic works extremely well the Japanese are portrayed as sadistic brutes who will stoop at nothing to achieve their aims  shooting dogs raping and killing innocent women while relishing the thought of getting Hepburn's Jade Tan into bed. With the aid of Chinese traitor Wu Lien Tamiroff they set themselves up in a grand mansion and enjoy elaborate meals prepared by slave cooks while capturing locals as slave labor.Pitted against them are the local Chinese part of a farming community dedicated to centuriesold rituals. Nothing it seems can disturb the peace of their lives. When the Japanese invasion occurs they are pitifully underprepared to cope Ling Tan's Huston's eldest son Lao Er Tan Bey and wife Jade Hepburn leave to help build a city in the hills dedicated to making weapons while another son Lao San Tan Hurd Hatfield goes off to join the Chinese army. Ling Tan and his wife Aline MacMahon are left behind to forage for themselves often living on scraps.While the film emphasizes the importance of rituals as the foundation of a stable society it also looks forward to the future. Jade wants to teach her newlyborn son to read for it is only through reading that enlightenment can occur. Lao objects at first  he favors more traditional pastimes such as lovemaking  but as the action unfolds he understands his wife's concern. DRAGON SEED also preaches a doctrine of sexual equality Jade spends most of the action working alongside her husband in manual labor dressed in overalls rather than the traditional attire of a rural peasant.In the end even Ling Tan comes to realize the importance of fighting for his country's future despite his love of peace. The film ends with a climactic sequence reminiscent of MGM's GONE WITH THE WIND as the Chinese community decamps from its longestablished village to make a new home in the hills.Based on a bestselling novel by Pearl S. Buck Marguerite Roberts's screenplay contains a few clunky lines where the propagandist elements assume more significance than plot coherence but the film offers the role of a lifetime to Turhan Bey hitherto associated mostly with Bpictures and horror films for Universal. He takes the opportunity with both hands proving as competent as Hepburn in delivering lines with lan as well as convincing us of the character's sincerity of purpose.DRAGON SEED is certainly long  perhaps too long at 144 minutes but it certainly fulfills its purpose especially for those forced to fight the Japanese at firsthand during the midForties.".

The most annoying thing about this movie is the odd sounding chinesey English being spoken by everybody. It's a struggle to follow and a grind to listen to. It's not just the flat accent but it's more about the way the dialog is written. The acting is also pretty bad as if the actors were inspired by a Chinese opera. It makes the movie feel unnatural.

Other than the fact they are movies I just don't see any other rational comparison.So why did I give the film the ridiculously low score of 2? Well it features the very worst job of casting of any filmwith the possible exception of THE CONQUERER with John Wayne as 'Gengis Khan' and Susan Hayward as a Mongol princess. In DRAGON SEED Katherine Hepburn red haired and possessing a very prim and proper New England accent and Walter Huston are among the cast playing Chinese people!! Now it was unfortunately common in the 30s and 40s to have such parts played by Westerners but at least some had the ability to almost carry it off well. Heck Warner Oland and Sidney Toler were MUCH closer to being believable as Chinese detective 'Charlie Chan' than either Huston or Hepburn!!! As for the rest of the story it's a relatively dull and uninspiring Pearl Buck story with none of the impact or style as THE GOOD EARTHa fine film from a decade earlier despite the all Anglo cast once again. Instead it's an antiJapanese film made to promote the war effort in the Pacific.By the way as a bit of trivia the red haired Agnes Morehead deserves special recognition as she not only played a Chinese lady in this film but Genghis Khan's mother in THE CONQUERERproving that horrendously stupid casting can be infectious.Also for more fun casting decisions featuring the most ridiculous Westerners playing Asians try watching Edward G. Robinson in THE HATCHET MANan amazingly good film despite having 'Little Caesar' pretending to be Chinese. Other odd ones humorous because they were so very very offensive were Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON and Mickey Rooney in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S.

Buck novel. Anges Moorehead tried to put on a Chinese accent and Turhan Bey relied on his dark looks to convince audiences he's Chinese even though he was really Austrian. Besides that everyone else acted like they were in some movie set in Vermontwith the exception of Akim who spoke in his normal Russian accent. Since Katharine Hepburn is the lead it's to be expected that this film will have a feminist message with the underlying theme of obeying one's husband. Walter Huston is the patriarch and he and Aline worry about the younger generation. Kate longs to read which is taboo at that time and she speaks her mind in public often embarrassing her husband. But since it's Kate she's going to continue to be herself with the understanding that when it comes right down to it she'll stand by her man anywayremember Spencer Tracy folks.The first hour really drags and you might even turn it off as I did. I turned it back on the next day to support the cast and then the plot picked up a bit. Japanese soldiers invade the village and Kate and Turhan try to lead an underground resistance. Still even though the audience is forced to watch as terrible things happen to the family it doesn't elevate the film to classic status. Dragon Seed is not another The Good Earth. Yes a Chinese family deals with soldiers farming and family but it's not nearly as dramatic as Buck's earlier story. If you're looking for that keep looking or just rent The Good Earth a second time and endure Louise Rainer's singular expression. Whatever you do even if you're ridiculously excited to hear Lionel Barrymore narrate a film don't feel you have to rent this one. What is Lionel doing narrating a Chinese movie anyway?".

Seems when life is just a bare existence and immensely challenging women are treated with great respect to carry the load as well. Who knows but reading books especially the Bible was an executionable offense back in the day. I certainly remember my husband complaining he wished I never went to college so he would maintain his superiority. Ha! Like that routine would have lasted very long.So now we are worried about the potential invasion of China here while our debt is so precipitous and fear incites such a divisive destabilization of our country. You wonder how people survived such cruel inhumane treatment but this is no different than our treatment of many peoples we have occupied and conquered. I would appreciate those foreign films that address the reality of the Western Devil. Let's face it men everywhere throughout the ages are mostly responsible for this mess and if women were to take over we could likely take advantage of the situation as well. Perhaps that is why there is such a concerted effort to maintain inequality because payback is going to be a b itch!I was able to move beyond seeing Clarence the Angel in his Fu Man Chu glasses and whiskers as well as Kate Hepburn with her Yankee accent. It is not difficult to take away sympathy for all oppressed people and be thankful for the many friends family security and those ever vital material possessions.High recommend for the scene of a great Chinese smrgsbord of Duck Soup and the many wild and crazy ingredients that make this film memorable.".

But in The Good Earth both Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were well suited to ethnic roles. A lot of the members of the cast of Dragonseed were not.Walter Huston at least to his credit never tried an accent in playing a Russian in North Star or a Norwegian in Edge of Darkness also films about resistance to Axis invaders. He's once again the voice of reason driven to do unreasonable things against his nature by war. Still he doesn't come across as Chinese. Neither does Henry Travers as his scholarly cousin.But most of all Katherine Hepburn just doesn't make it as an oriental. When Luise Rainer played Olan the part was written with minimal dialog and she won that Best Actress Oscar for her facial expressions which said more than pages of words. Hepburn unfortunately sounds like the peasant from Bryn Mawr.Seeing real oriental players in smaller parts like Philip Ahn and Benson Fong only draw attention to how ridiculous some of the occidentals look.It's not a bad story maybe it would have been better if they cast Anna May Wong though.".

	schema:headline " The Japanese invasion of China gets an exciting treatment from MGM";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a story of a woman facing a brutal enemy in a war on her home turf. Few war movies come at it from this angle  other than Gone With The Wind. Moreover this is a very modern woman who resists the traditions of her upbringing and because it needs to be done leaves her village along with her husband and joins a band of resisters transporting heavy machinery across the country in the most grueling conditions  while she's pregnant! Though the film leaves it ambiguous as to whether these are Communists or Nationalists one would be hard pressed not to be lost in admiration for their grit and guts. One day Jade decides she really needs to take a day or two off as the baby is due and proceeds to bear a healthy child who eventually is brought home by her in a large basket the child having grown she carries on her back.But this is not Jade's story alone it's much more of an ensemble piece about an entire family of farmers facing the invasion of the Japanese in the 1930's. Their various tribulations and joys are for the most part grippingly and entertainingly depicted. The father and mother of this family Jade's inlaws are brilliantly played by Walter Huston and Aline McMahon. Turhan Bey Henry Travers Robert Bice and Frances Rafferty also have major roles. A duplicitous character is played by Akim Tamiroff his faithful wife by Jacqueline DeWit and Travers' selfish wife by Agnes Moorehead. Hurd Hatfield plays the gentle favored Third Son who becomes bloodthirsty and abhorrent to his parents.The film ranges very well from intimate human drama to spectacle and back again. The production design is really splendid and the penultimate scenes of scorched earth are both heartbreaking and exhilarating. I marveled at what these people had to go through and how they faced it. It was truly grueling and incredible.As for Caucasian actors in Asian makeup. This is not a documentary. I believe the Chinese staged a production of Death Of A Salesman. And the Japanese had a very longrunning stage production of Gone With The Wind. In a similar spirit this particular film was a tribute by Americans to the bravery of another people and I didn't find it inappropriate. Not that it works all the time but overall it was carried off extremely well.As to the casting of Hepburn someone said her New England accent was wrong for the part but since in real life the characters would be speaking Chinese not English we're already suspending disbelief and her accent didn't bother me. She actually does an awesome job and gets inside the role. Certain parts of the film are a little too broad but these aren't frequent. Lionel Barrymore narrates the film and he has one of the most marvelous voices ever. His narration adds something significant to the film.When you have seen this motion picture you will feel like you have witnessed a truly human emotional story a piece of history and it may leave you wondering about man's inhumanity to man as it is one of the most unflinching films made during the war years. But it will give you hope and inspire you as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is just as terrible as you've always heard it is. But it has a few points of interest especially for those who want to revisit the peculiar politics of the WWII era. At the same time that Japan was invading China DRAGON SEED depicted the Japanese as ravening monsters while glamorizing the Chinese Communist guerrillas fighting them. War made for strange bedfellows and just a couple of years later portraying Communists in a sympathetic light would have been a dangerous careerkilling thing to do.The film itself has all the production values one imagines MGM would bring to bear on a bestselling novel by Pearl Buck. And as a piece of wartime propaganda every opportunity is taken to make the Japanese seem like inhuman monsters  indeed the way that violence especially sexual violence toward women is portrayed here is surprisingly harsh and lurid for this period and would only have been considered acceptable because it demonized The Enemy during wartime.Criticizing old movies for being racially insensitive and politically incorrect is selfdefeating. We are all products of our time and place. However regrettable it seems now it was inconceivable in the Hollywood of 1944 that Asian actors would have been used in lead roles. And a few film critics and writers of the time criticized the film for this finding it as ridiculous as we do. From our own vantage point it is always useful for us to revisit the mores of another time even when we are appalled by them so that we can see how far we've come. And how far we still need to go. We can't turn back the clock and redo the past so instead of reviling it let's learn from it.Is there entertainment value here? Sure some though in many ways this is a stilted potboiler and more of a political tract than a movie. And there is one good sequence though it is as contrived and melodramatic as something in a bad silent film. Katharine Hepburn giving one of the worst performances of her career is holding poison that she hopes to use against her turncoat brotherinlaw. Instead she finds herself in the kitchen of his mansion where a banquet for the Japanese invading army is being prepared. While pretending to be a woman willing to barter her body to the Japanese she looks for an opportunity to poison the feast. The tension and crosscutting as the attempts and the reversals pile up is fun  the only really memorable scene in this very phony picture. Aline McMahon got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress and though she is the only one in DRAGON SEED who suggests a real feeling human being one imagines she would have given the same performance as a Russian Greek or French peasant  it is a generic 'ethnic' performance and as full of baloney as everything else in this curious movie so much a relic of it's time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan's Savage Fury 1952  out of 4 Fourth installment in Lex Barker's turn as the legendary ape man. This time out Tarzan and Jane Dorothy Hart are fooled by a man pretending to be Tarzan's cousin who claims to be from the Greystoke family. It turns out that the man wants Tarzan to lead him to a valley full of priceless diamonds and the ape man goes along for the ride but soon realizes that he's been lied to. TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY is another mildly entertaining entry in the series which was clearly running out of ideas. The one new thing is that this film offered up Tarzan's connection to the riches which had been left out of the previous three Baxter films as well as all twelve Weissmuller films. Who knows why they decided to bring it up at this point but it does add for some mildly entertaining scenes and especially some early stuff where Tarzan talks about how he ended up being raised by apes. The rest of the film is pretty much B movie material as we get your typical action scenes poor stock footage and even some very sloppy moments here. The sloppy moments happen during a scene where Tarzan is trying to prevent a rhino from charging. Of course Baxter is in the frame with the rhino thanks to rear projection but take a look at the footage being shown. There are a few seconds were the footage is missing some frame which gives the rhino these weird movements. Even worse is when the scene is over and the rhino basically disappears right in front of your eyes! Whoever knew Tarzan could do magic? There are some pretty campy moments to be found here including one sequence where some natives are using young boys to lure crocs into the river so that they can be caught. This entire sequence of boys being chased by wooden crocodiles is rather silly and especially how fake the crocs look. Barker is certainly in fine form as the ape man and he manages to get a few good laughs here. The actor was clearly into character and he has some nice chemistry with Hart who was playing Jane for the first and last time. Patrick Knowles THE WOLF MAN adds some nice support in his role as does Charles Korvin as another one of the bad guys. Tommy Carlton plays Joey a kid Tarzan finds at the croc hunt and who he brings home. He was clearly meant to be a replacement for Boy and the actor does a nice job in terms of charm and bringing some life to the material. The action scenes are mainly cheap and there's no question that the budgets kept getting cut down but there's some nice material to be had with some of the campiness including the before mentioned fake crocodiles. TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY certainly isn't going to make anyone forget CITIZEN KANE but at the same time there's enough cheap charm if you enjoy B movies or jungle adventures. At the same time it's clear that the series was never going to return to those early MGM classics.".

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY RKO Radio 1952 directed by Cyril Enfield is an acceptable entry to the long running jungle adventure series starring Lex Barker in his fourth goround as Edgar Rice Burrough's legendary King of the Jungle. Not since the early silent screen adaptations has Tarzan's background ever been depicted least of all his relation to the Greystoke family of England how he was orphaned raised by apes to become jungle man of Africa. Aside from revealing more about Tarzan's family history this edition makes several attempts in recapturing the fun and excitement to the more popular Tarzan MGM editions 19321942 starring Johnny Weissmuller notably its presentation of an orphaned boy as its latest addition. Filling in the void formerly enacted nine times by Johnny Sheffield as Boy Tommy Carlton gets his screen credit introduction as the latest junior Tarzan. Though not quite a remake or even a rehash to Sheffield's debut of TARZAN FINDS A SON 1939 it starts off that way then shifting over a different direction taken from TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE 1941.With the plot development bearing two separate stories before connecting to a basic formula the opening first brings forth Lord Oliver Greystoke Lex Barker on an expedition locating his long lost cousin Tarzan. Moments later he is shot and killed by the evil Rokov Charles Korvin letting his weakling associate Edwards Patric Knowles to assume Greystoke's identity. Next comes Tarzan Lex Barker and his pet chimpanzee Cheta on their venture home after six days away from Jane Dorothy Hart. It's never fully explained where Tarzan has been during that time. Maybe on his vacation from marriage or settling some business deal with Edgar Rice Burroughs. Shortly afterwards Tarzan witnesses abusive native tribes using boys as crocodile bait. As Joey Martin Tommy Carlton a white boy comes close to a crocodile attack Tarzan swims to his rescue. Learning Joey to be the son of American missionaries recently killed Tarzan an orphan himself takes Joey along with him. Before returning to the tree house and Jane Joey wanting to become jungle man like Tarzan is shown methods of jungle survival and how to conquer his fear when approached by dangerous animals such as lions. After Joey becomes an established member of the Tarzan family a safari consisting of Rokov and Greystoke enter the scene. Rokov a magician gains their confidence showing off some magic tricks while Tarzan's cousin presents the diary written by Tarzan's father dating back to 192223 explaining how Tarzan's missionary parents lived among the Wazuri tribe when he was a little boy. Because of the tribes richness in diamonds Rokov wants Tarzan to lead him over to their village so to obtain and use those diamonds for the good of England's military safety. Thanks to Jane's insistence Tarzan at the same time tracking down his roots to where he lived as a boy heads the expedition on a long and prosperous journey through mountains and desert before facing both a deadly tribe and the truth behind Rokov's mission.Often dismissed as a lesser entry to the Lex Barker entries mainly due to some slow pacing by the midway point TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY does resume its usual doses of action and adventure through the stock footage andor rear projection screening of wild animals cannibal attacks the traditional good versus evil theme and the climatic Tarzan yell. Charles Korvin the accented talking villain is one not to reckon and stops at nothing to get what he wants. After killing a tribal leader and doing away with Greystoke Korvin's Rokov manages to trap Tarzan to where he lies helpless with heavy rock resting on his back while only a few feet above a pit of hungry lions below. As for Jane and Joey they face dangers of their own as they are held prisoners of an angry tribe some distance away.Lex Barker resumes his role in the usual manner with an added bonus briefly playing Lord Greystoke for its prologue. One notable drawback to the Barker series is its constant changing of actresses playing Jane. Dorothy Hart ranks one of the finer and prettier substitutes thus far. Featured in one piece jungle attire and dark hair down to her shoulders looking very much the way Maureen O'Sullivan was presented in the MGM days Hart speaks softly in the manner of Donna Reed but most importantly not impossible to dislike. With prior screen roles to her credit this was Hart's only venture as Tarzan's mate. Tommy Carlton age 10 or so in fine physical build and hair always perfectly in place acquires enough camera closeups to assure enough attention as Tarzan's newest boy. Interestingly his character would not return in future installments thus adding further contradictions to this series. With such a promising start of the hero worshiping youngster alongside the legendary Tarzan Carlton's character is suddenly reduced to limited viewing seen mostly in the background before reminding viewers of his existence before the film's fadeout.TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY along with others in the series that played on commercial television as part of Tarzan Theater did get cable TV exposure in later years first on American Movie Classics 19972000 and later on Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere July 23 2011. Never distributed to video cassette this and other Lex Barker editions were later placed onto DVD by the TCM Archive Collection. Regardless of pros and cons TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY should make satisfying viewing for fans of the series. Next installment TARZAN AND THE SHEDEVIL. 12".

Firstclass actress Dorothy Hart is lovely as Jane and does most of the real acting in this Tarzan household. She was a truly gifted actress who soon quit movies for roles in prestigious television productions and other activities that utilized her worthwhile abilities. There is also a little boy character well played by a lad named Tommy Carleton although this character seems superfluous to me and was subsequently dropped from the Tarzan series. Former leading man Patrick Knowles does a great job as a vacuous baddie a weak willed character whose actions are essential to the plot.The overall story of Tarzan's Savage Fury is wholly inconsequential but the movie is directed at a nice crisp pace. It is definitely above average for a bmovie adventure flick. I can recommend this film for the action and physicality that Barker brings to the Tarzan role and for Dorothy Hart's luminous presence and fine acting.".

The Cold War shadow is still present in this production with a Russian villain named Rokov Austrianborn actor Charles Korvin who wants to get hold of the diamonds of an African tribe. As in Tarzan's Peril a murder happens in the first minutes leading to the impersonation of Lord Greystoke Tarzan's cousin by the villain's weak colleague Patrick Knowles and Jane convincing Tarzan to help them. Here Cheetah's compulsive stealing is also a main ingredient of the plot and little Joey also plays a key role in the proceedings. Considered by some specialists as one of the best Tarzan movies it was directed by Cy Endfield an American leftwing filmmaker who had a promising career but when blacklisted by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee he went to England in 1951 where he made television advertisement and a few good films as Mysterious Island Sands of the Kalahari and Zulu before retiring and inventing the Microwriter. Possibly it was Endfield who introduced several sleightofhand routines performed on screen by Rokov who uses them to trick gullible natives. Known as a master of the art of micro magic Endfield had worked in Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. Last but not least this is probably the only Tarzan movie to include two blacklisted film professionals Endfield and Korvin.".

It tells of the friendship between a nomadic Siberian native and a Russian army explorer and how the former is able to help the latter and his team to negotiate the many obstacles presented by the Siberian wilderness. We see how traditional survival methods and intrinsic common sense can help the more urbanised army men to cope with the extremes of climate and geography. Eventually the nomad is persuaded to join the general on his trip back to a town. His ignorance of urban life is apparent but interesting nevertheless as we do not imagine such people nor meet them in everyday life today. Kurosawa is on top form here letting the camera take in the vastness of Siberia and still allowing the viewers to observe the characters closely. The story is interesting too with a sadly ironic ending won't say any more!. I think everybody should watch this film because everybody will have something to learn from it.".

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Simplicity can sometimes be painful as well as majestic";
	schema:reviewBody "Dersu Uzala is not just the quintessence of pristine cinema or a landmark in art cinema but is also a living proof that brilliance can be achieved with absolute simplicity. Storytelling is undoubtedly one of the most potent tools known to man from the Illiad and Odyssey of Homer to the tales of Jataka to the 1001 nights of Arabia to the tales of Panchatantra to the plays of Shakespeare man has always found ways to amuse himself by spinning the yarn of his imagination. These tales though picturesque fantastic and resplendent mostly overlooked the potency of austerity visvis grandeur as an element of revelation powerful enough to transcend the effects of all other affects know to man. Only a handful of storytellers like Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit Ray have shown the grit and perspicacity to use simplicity as the weapon to incite and hence portray the deepest of the human emotions on the celluloid. Kurosawa demonstrated the might of simplicity as an element that can pack a punch for the first time in Ikiru and followed it up with an unending list of pristine cinematic masterpieces including Seven Samurai. But even Kurosawa's greatest critic would not find it hard to concede that cinema does not get any purer than Dersu Uzala. Dersu Uzala is a poignant tale of human bonding of trust friendship and adoration between two contrasting individuals a nomadic hunter and an army explorer. Captain Arseniev and his troops are on a topographic expedition and while camping during a night they come across Dersu who happens to be an aboriginal Goldi tribesman. Being fully aware of the handicap of being in a remote and tricky territory and of the indispensability of having an indigene in the ranks Arseniev asks Dersu to be their guide. Dersu being humbled by Arseniev's courtesy obliges his offer almost immediately. We soon witness a great sense of camaraderie developing between the two of them as Dersu rises in status from being a comrade to a stalwart and a friend in the eyes of the captain. The long years of experience had equipped Dersu with a great sense of intuition and psychiclike abilities to anticipate change and danger. Dersu uses his skills to good effect as he maneuvers captain and his troops through the harsh Siberian terrain sheltering and guarding them from the cruelties and wilderness of the Tundra. Behind the faade of a rugged hunter we see a man of profound intellect and deep compassion in Dersu which is most conspicuous in his respect for the old Chinese and his selflessness in rescuing Captain Arseniev and one of his men. After the expedition is over Arseniev embraces Dersu and bids him farewell as Dersu returns to the wilderness. Few years later when Arseniev returns to Siberia on another expedition he once again encounters Dersu who again proves to be handy only this time round he appears to be aging really fast as time which can be a great healer as well as a great leveler had begun to take a toll on the Goldi. His eyesight deteriorates under the superstitious effect of a selfimposed curse after having killed a Siberian tiger which the Goldis worship in an act of selfdefence. Arseniev in his pitied adoration for Dersu takes him to the city to live with his family. Arseniev's son gets greatly attached to Dersu and his storytelling abilities but Dersu finds it difficult to adapt to the relatively restricted and significantly tamed urban life and soon realizes that his life has been reduced to that of a captive. He implores the captain to let him return to the wilderness of the woods. With great reluctance Arseniev grants him the permission to leave but not before presenting his savior with a brand new rifle as a parting gift and a souvenir. Few months later Arseniev receives a letter informing him that a dead body of a Goldi has been found with no identification on it barring Arseniev's visiting card. As Arseniev pays a visit to the place of burial he identifies the dead Goldi to be none other than Dersu Uzala. The investigating officer speculates the Goldi's brand new rifle might have lured someone into killing him.Dersu Uzala is not just a movie but is an experience of a lifetime. Dersu Uzala is the only movie that Akira Kurosawa shot in a language other than Japanese and he proved it once and for all that cinema at its most pristine knows no bounds or barriers. Kurosawa uses his auteurist mastery to bring the memoirs of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev to life as he inexplicably metamorphoses cinema to new levels of poignancy and pristineness. The cinematography is breathtakingly picturesque and it evokes a sense of melancholy that makes the majestic Siberian wilderness appear hypnotic and at times surreal. The panoramic shot of Dersu and Arseniev looking at the horizon caparisoned with the juxtaposition of the setting sun and the rising moon is also indicative of their respective lives Dersu is long past his prime and there is no hope for revival but Arsieniev's is still in his prime and has a promising career ahead. Dersu Uzala is strongly suggestive of the sole consistency in human life change. It also demonstrates the might of nature as an unforgiving force strong enough to humble even the most savage of the creatures. Dersu Uzala can also be termed as an allegorical account of the environmental imbalance that unrestrained human intervention is causing. Dersu Uzala besides being one of Kurosawa's greatest masterpieces is one of those rare cinematic gems which can be relished again and again each time with a completely different perspective. It's a must watch for everyone who loves and understands cinema. 1010For more on cinema visit httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I own many of Akira Kurosawa's films. I have Ran Throne of blood Seven Samarai Roshomon Dreams Hidden Fortress Jojimbo Snajuro Red Beard and even Kurosawa the documentary. I guess you can say that I like his work. The Kurosawa documentary narrated by Sam Shepard and produced by thirteen  WNET I recommend for anyone at all interested in Kurosawa's films as it will really wet your appetite.Of all of his films Dersu Uzala is my favorite. It is also one of my favorite films by anybody. It was done shortly after Akira had went through a very dark time in his life and had attempted suicide. It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals and that is what feels good.Many of Kurosawa's films have a great deal of spectacle and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films he could not feel that he was living. As a result he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director's true personality. Just perhaps it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again it is my favorite.".

It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals and that is what feels good.Many of Kurosawa's films have a great deal of spectacle and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films he could not feel that he was living. As a result he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director's true personality. Just perhaps it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again it is my favorite.";

	schema:reviewBody "For a variety of reasons that are well known in the darker period of the director's history at this time Akira Kurosawa left Japan to make a film in Russia Siberia to be exact. Instead of an epic action picture he went to one of his other passions as a storyteller the drama of pure humanity like Ikiru and Red Beard this film follows in that vein. The film runs two hours and twenty minutes but it is a kind of epic story that does have that pulse of adventure from his other films. But this time he combines that method of a big spacious environment in the wild with a deep character study. His craftsmanship as a 'painter' of the frame is topnotch as always all pretensions aside he is one of the masters at finding the textures and moods in a scene's look as in its character and action and the use of locations brings a quality that directors today would brush aside with via special and visual effects. Simply put it is one of if not the ultimate testaments to man vswith nature with a character that remains one of the most memorable that Kurosawa's envisioned.To give an idea of who Dersu Uzala is to someone who hasn't seen the film picture Yoda without the ability to lift objects with his mind and to kick ass with a lightsaber but still contains all of the direct wisdom and strength that make him one with his surroundings and as well uses his own kind of 'force' for knowledge and defense and for attack as an ultimately final resort. As a lonesome hunter and drifter with a family tragically lost Dersu comes upon a team of explorers led by Captain Aseniev Yuri Solomon not the best performance but sturdy enough to sustain the physical scenes. He goes along with them as a guide of the sights and smells and feelings that the others just can't sense out of lack of experience. Aseniev and Dersu end up becoming friends as they brace a torrid windstorm over a bare wintry landscape as Kurosawa brings out one of his towering sequences topping anything David Lean could've drummed up for sure.It's always of interest to me to see characters doing things on screen having to go against the elements that almost dwarf them in the face of nature i.e. Cast Away's hour and a half second act. Dersu Uzala seems to be of few words and mostly actions and soon gains respect and admiration after an odd introduction to the team he shoots with a keener than keen eye he spots tracks he sets up protection in the harshest of conditions and is always a step ahead of the pack. And bringing all this out is actor Maksim Munzuk who appears here like Falconetti in Passion of Joan of Arc in the performance of a lifetime out of an otherwise obscure and small career. Munzuk never brings anything to Dersu that isn't in his character and he makes at least a quarter of the film's success a reality the other threequarters could be attributed to Kurosawa alone. He can be tough smart funny in an offbeat way and if nothing else humble. But more than anything Munzuk makes Dersu seem alive in a way no other actor could've accomplished and also brings out the better in Solomon's performance.The story itself has a superb appeal most of the way but it is in it's last act that 'Derzu Uzala' reaches an intensely tragic plane. Dersu does something which I won't reveal here and has been discussed elsewhere on the message board that brings great shame to his own selfworth. In this part of the film Kurosawa brings out what can be said to be some of the saddest moments in any of his work however not without logic. While it was likely a major dramatic function in the novel Kurosawa doesn't just throw these last twenty minutes or so to let steam flow out of the picture. I sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes that rose the qualities of the rest of the story to a higher level to one of almost spiritual in nature. It's hard to really pinpoint to one who has not seen the film and indeed I have seen the film all of one time. But once its over you may feel you have seen a work far more rewarding than imaginable even in awe.".

The landscape is filled with the change of the seasons of great autumn colours lakes that mirror great reflections smoke over fire in a blue hue to winter desolate landscapes and sheering sun that sets on the fateful band of men who dare to pass through the dangerous terrain.Throw in a great bond of characters and a lesson about a time when humanity was more in touch with nature instead of trying to dominate it a classic Kurosawa ending and you have cinematic gold.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1902 a Russian army expedition is assigned to explore Siberia under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev Yuri Solomin. He befriends the Goldi Nanai hunter Dersu Uzala Maksim Munzuk and invites him to guide the explorers through the stark forest up to Khanka Lake. Along their journey Arseniev discovers that Dersu Uzala is a man with a beautiful soul and they become close friends. When his assignment ends Dersu Uzala says goodbye to Arseniev. In 1907 Captain Arseniev is assigned for another expedition to the Ussuri River when he meets Dersu Uzala in the forest the lonely hunter joins his team and guides the group. However he is older and has problems with his vision and Captain Arseniev invites Dersu Uzala to live with his family in Khabarovsk City. But the old man does not adapt to the urban lifestyle and decides to return to the forest. In 1910 Captain Arseniev is called to Korfovskaa to identify the body of a man that has his calling card and might be Dersu Uzala.Derzu Uzala is a simple and unforgettable tale of friendship between a Russian Captain and a lonely hunter with a beautiful soul. This wonderful movie has one of the most beautiful cinematographies I have ever seen and the camera work is impressive with awesome angle and locations that seems to be of pictures in movement. I had watched most of Akira Kurosawa movies and I do not know how I could forget to see this magnificent mustsee movie of his amazing cinematography. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Dersu Uzala".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though in many of the other writeups there is said that it is a sad tale and not real easy to watch. I don't think so. It is my belief that the story of Dersu had to end as it did. The alternative the broken down old Chinaman at the beginning of the story. How far do you think he got walking out of Siberia in the winter? I belive the Chinaman knew exactly what was going to happen. And as so often in the character of Dersu Uzala you find that he thought of others instead of himself. I believe that the Chinaman surrendered his home to otheres because he knew his time was at an end anyway. He could no longer support himself in the woods.That character trait is what made Dersu so appealing to us and to his Captain. Dursu was completely in tune with his humanity even though most people would look at him in Russian society as a barbarian. He always knew what to do and what was best in the woods. Which is actually a great deal like what the rest of the world really is and what is best for the whole world. However modern society as we all know will not embrace Dersu's beliefs. We will not give even though we have no use for the item Dersu did. And Dersu gave often when he could have used the item remember the leaving of food in the shelter for others who might be in need.SLIGHT SPOILER The death of Dersu Usala was somehow correct. It is well that it happened as soon as it did as he went to converse with the Chinaman. Dersu didn't have to suffer. Dersu could no longer survive in the woods. Modern society had no place for him as he could not support its behavior. Dersu was honest about life about himself and saw things absolutely clearly. It is sorta sad that a gift caused his demise but as I said above he possibly gave him a more humane death that the slow starvation he was facing.  The only real sadness is that his grave was lost to someone who truly loved him.  It is an absolutely beautiful story that is true to its characters. It is really sad that Hollywood cannot bring out stories about the goodness in humanity rather than how to kill each other with as much flashy aplomb as possible.  As near a perfect film as I have ever seen.".

I would like to report that its a great film but its not. I enjoyed it but to me the story was lacking I wanted to know more. I also had problems with the second half of the film which seemed to be straining to go into a man made direction instead of one that flowed naturally.The first half flows. I was just going to take a peak at the film only to find that 45 minutes had passed as if in a blink of an eye. The second half of the film is less natural it moves in fits toward a conclusion we know from the outset of the film but which is arrived at via a journey that doesn't seem natural. the events are fine its the foreshadowing and thrust to the end that doesn't work. Technically this is a beautiful film...

The film aroused curiosity because of the way it was received outside the country.

Juan gets out of the car to see the condition of the cyclist. Noticing he is in bad shape he tells Maria Jose who is horrified. She prefers to leave the man on the road to fend for himself as they flee the scene of the crime.The accident is a catalyst in their illicit relationship. Maria Jose cares more about her good name and her status in society and what it will do to her and her husband. Juan on the other hand struggles with his own conscience. To make matters worse Juan a university professor makes the mistake of shutting up one of his female students who is working a math problem. Maria Jose's life takes a turn when Rafa a critic that moves in her circle insinuates he knows about her affair without coming out in the open.Their guilt play tricks on the lovers.

Maria Jose in her frenzied state almost hits another cyclist in avoiding hitting the man she ends up going off the bridge.Mr. Bardem who contributed to the screen play of the film with Luis Fernando de Igoa wanted to show the hypocrisy of the upper classes in their collaboration with Franco. He also pointed out to the nepotism that was rampant during those years the way that Juan gains a position thanks to his influential brother. Matilde the young female student and her class mates at the university point out to the new type of citizen that would question the system under Franco.The sublime Lucia Bose one of the most beautiful faces in the Italian cinema of the years after WWII is one of the best things in the film.

Carlos Casaravilla makes a wonderful villain Rafa the man who is a parasite and envies the moneyed types that tolerate him and use him. Bruna Corra who is seen as Matilde has some good opportunities.The black and white cinematography by Alfredo Fraile shows us the Spain of the 1950s that evokes some of the best Italian masters of the era.

It is a marriage of convenience she has everything she wants materially but nothing of love or emotion left in the marriage. She spends her days in a circle of bored friends attending lunches but wishing to be with her lover Juan Fernandez Soler Alberto Closas.The cinematography here is intriguing and sinister. Stark landscapes cold winter yet the people involved are comfortable and corrupt drinking and dining.Of course the character of Rafa Sandoval played by Carlos Casaravilla is excellent and elemental to a pivotal part of the story. He has seen the couple in their car on the highway but just how much he has seen he will not divulge to Maria Jose. It is an ongoing teaser that we watch in suspense...we are not certain what each character will do.Juan Fernandez a professor of mathematics is merely existing he resents his job which was acquired through his inlaws. He is tired of keeping up appearances.There is a twist and you should watch this film more than once for the subtle nuances and character actors who play a part in the mood.It begins with the death of a cyclist but evolves into study of society politics and how people act out to endure their mortality or the prison of their mortality. In the end it is their choice. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent film and I've enjoyed the comments and observations. There's really not a lot I can add that hasn't already been written other than the followingFor the most part I don't see how the ending of this film can be classified as either being 'overthetop' or as a 'deus ex machina'. I simply see it as the logical function of the analytical geometry motif Bardem employs throughout the film. Remember Juan is an assistant professor of Analytical geometry and Bardem finds a number of ways to reinforce the idea throughout this fine crafted 1955 Spanish BW film. In the opening scene we see a lone cyclist ride away from us and essentially out of the frame but he never really leaves the film as he provides both a question and an answer to some of the many riddles this film presents to us. Early on we see a mathematical formulation written on blackboard which shows a completed albeit circular construction it is a wrong that is eventually righted but as in life there is a cost attached. The music itself has a certain geometry and it too plays a role in the film. I may be wrong here but I don't recall Rafa ever completing an entire piece of music while at the piano.Juan eventually realizes his mistake thanks in part to the incident set in motion by the blackboard scene and wants to do what he thinks is the right thing by trying to correct the mistake but there are just too many outside factors at play here for his solution to work.However the geometrical motif is eventually completed  in its own ironic fashion  at the end of the film when the bicyclist apparently does the right thing and reports the accident.Sowith that in mind I think the ending is appropriate. Please note that I'm not saying that its the right ending or even the wrong one just that its appropriate.But if I've learned anything from watching Film Noir and I'm not saying this is one  although it does has a number of similar elements sometimes you just have to let the idea of a clean  tidy plot go and allow the story find its own way home.Besides there are just too many other great cinematic elements going on here  lighting camera angles acting atmosphere  to enjoy rather than wondering whether or not the plot will be wrapped up in a nice pretty bow at the end.Symbolism plays a major role here as well angular barren trees at the scene of the initial accident athletes being timed while running around a circular track along with the ritualized marriage ceremony and funeral service  which in and by themselves can be seen as a form of circular geometry as well. And of course there is the central issue of political allegory but that's been discussed already. Sometimes thanks to Hollywood I think we tend to expect a story to have a 'neat and tidy' conclusion. As for me I enjoy movies that are like life because to my way of thinking I can't imagine all my big questions will get answered when my 'movie' ends either. peaceDavidOne thing led to another and then he led with his left  The Dark Corner ".

Bardem endured multiple battles with Spanish censors and as many know he had to completely alter the ending in order to release the film in Spain.The corruption and lack of ethical and moral character of Spanish bourgeoisie is a main theme throughout. The two primary characters Juan and MariaJose refuse to deal with the moral consequences of hitting a cyclist and leaving him to die. In the beginning both are too caught up in the selfishness of their own spoiled lives to be troubled by the nuisance of the cyclist's death. While Juan eventually has an epiphany that involves 'purifying' his corrupt ways by coming clean to the police MariaJose is keen on keeping her wealthy and privileged position intact at all costs even if it means murdering her long term lover Juan.Many viewers have commented Muerte de un ciclista's end was simply too compromised by Francoistic constraints put on Bardem the 'bad' lady dies after she murders the 'good' man but I feel he did extremely well considering the dictatorship surrounding him as he made the film. With regards to the ending I think Bardem's angle was more subversive and futurethinking than merely 'righting a wrong' to pacify conservative falangeCatholic values. Notice the intertextual elements of MariaJose's extreme close up shots when she's hanging from her car. As Jo Evans noted in the article Sex and the censors the femme fatale in Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista this cinematic moment can be considered a reference to Mussolini's executed mistress Carla Petacci hanging upside down in the Piazzale Loreto next to her lover Franco's former ally. Bardem could have shot Maria Jose's body in a variety of creative death poses but he chose this one in particular to include in the film. Thus Bardem shows in these final moments his wish for death to the corrupt bourgeoisie and the possibility of death to Francoist Spain Italy's one time fascist mistress.".

Like all great art it works on many levels. The lead actress is not just selfish she represents the life force  the will to succeed accompanied by the corruption that goes with all success. By the same token the hero could be seen as finally possessed by a death instinct the urge to purify oneself by relinquishing all desire to live normally.I was rocked by many little surprises during the film. I liked the moment at the end where the actress plays with the different options open to her as she turns the key. This is no doubt farfetched but I remember a scene in King of Marvin Gardens when the actress plays with the gun and chatters about what might be done with it.The criticblackmailer was an amazing actor and it was a pleasure watching the change of attitude in the woman who was failed in the course but who came to admire the teacher responsible for her failure. I liked the hero's talking about our repeating mistakes like bugs running into a mirror but how the glass had been broken.

At the height of the cold war almost twenty years under the Franco regime Spain a country fiercely divided by poverty and societal division prepares with the support of the United States to enter into the United Nations. American investors arrive in Spain for the chance to buy into the developing Spanish economy. Meanwhile on a cold winter's day dusk is falling and the Sun's dying rays hit the highway. Enrique Arzaga cycles past and off into the outlying horizon. Almost as soon as he has gone out of sight a screeching of brakes is heard in the distance and a black car slams to a halt around the bend the cricket chirps. A man jumps out and rushes over. On observing the cyclist is still breathing he calls over to the woman inside the car. She gets out and calls back over to him. The woman beckons him again to desert the scene of the accident leaving the cyclist to die. The car moves off again disappearing towards Madrid.In the immediacy of its establishing sequence Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista Death of a Cyclist already outlines the foundations and circumstances behind the film's plot. An adulterous couple Juan Alberto Closas and Mara Jos Lucia Bos run down a cyclist on their way back to Madrid after a clandestine meeting in the outskirts. Rather than call for help the couple fearful of the discovery of their adulterous relationship flee the scene of the accident. Bardem's film focuses on the tribulations and strains on the characters' relationship from that point onwards and the lengths they go to keep their crimes of adultery and murder under cover.Spanish director Juan Antonio Bardem 19222002 explored and made use of a variety of genres within his early career. In Esa pareja feliz 1951 and Bienvenido Mr Marshall! 1953 both joint ventures with contemporary Luis Garca Berlanga Bardem through the conventions of comedy was able to develop a structure of parody and political satire. In Cmicos 1954 Bardem was heavily influenced by the genre of Hollywood melodrama in particular that of films such as All About Eve 1950 a convention he would continue to develop throughout later films including Calle Mayor 1956. Throughout Muerte de un ciclista Bardem develops a compound of contrasting style and genre to represent key issues within Spanish society. Prominent themes and genres within the film include film noir and the femme fatale mould the Hitchcock suspense thriller Italian neorealism and soviet montage. Bardem uses these contrasting elements directly after one another in order to create what Marsha Kinder refers to as a 'rupture' within the centrality of the plot of the Hollywood melodrama. In the same way as the unnatural cutting and contrasting imagery Bardem uses the film is able to ideologically expose corrupt and immoral elements of the Franco regime. The focus of this essay is to explore and to investigate these various elements and analyse the way in which they come together in forming a hybrid that is unique within the history of Spanish cinema.Through the usage of a variety of contrasting elements and genre Bardem is able to ideologically expose the corrupt elements of the Franco regime. Today Muerte de un ciclista stands as a critique of the conformist values that it ridicules and attempts to tear apart. It breaks all the rules and shows the power of cinema to revolutionise daily life. In the same way as Bardem's characters of Mara Jos who breaks the conformist gender rules of Francoist Spain Matilde who rebels against the institutional system and Juan who goes against the corruption and falseness of his class background so too does Muerte de un ciclista rebel both by taking a stand against the corrupt Franco regime and also by breaking the rules of mainstream conventional cinema in order to present something vitally fresh and unique in Spanish film. Alfred Hitchcock once noted that it is important to know the limits of commercial cinema. Bardem is able to successfully use a clash of genre to stretch the viewer close to an absolute limit and is subsequently able to breakdown and underline the key political issues surrounding contemporary Spanish society. In the same way as the moral courage that the character of Juan is able to attain Bardem seeks to signify the same moral fibre that the Spanish regime strove to repress. Like the broken window imagery that Bardem puts forward towards the end of the film so too does a hole within the melodramatic centrality serve as a central element within the film's plot in order to be clashed with and torn apart. It is through this hybrid and rupture of genre that Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista has been able to create a quintessential feat in Spanish cinema.Harrison CohenWhat need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account?

I especially appreciated how the lady and man responded so differentlywith one eventually rising to the occasion and the other sinking deeper and deeper into evil. So as a character study it was wonderful as well as very dark.However in the last couple minutes a good ALWAYS triumphs over evil ending is tacked on the film that just doesn't work at all and undoes almost all the greatness of the film. The director apparently did NOT want to give it this cheap and horrible ending but he was forced by the fascist Spanish government to include this ending against his wishes. And true to the director's vision the ending they used did destroy the impact of the film. What exactly the bad ending is you can see for yourself. It's really a shame because just before this final scene is one of the BEST scenes when one of the two criminals turns on the other onea brilliant piece of film making.PSIt's interesting that after only a few weeks this review has gotten three negative comments. If they score it this way because I didn't like the ending and found it took away from the film this is ALSO the way the director felt about it as well. It was wonderful but that ending just was a letdown and the director was understandably angry that he was forced to make this concession to the government censors. On the other hand if the negatives are because I am dead wrong then I willingly accept them.".

	schema:headline " Powerful examination of morality and an effective 'thriller'";
	schema:reviewBody "A mix of noir psychological thriller and political examination of class and privilege in Franco's Spain this reminded me as much as anything of Antonioni's 'Story of a Love Affair' although I liked this even more. For me there were more thematic and emotional levels explored in more interesting ways. The film is beautifully made with a striking use of transitions to keep us off base and an alternating mix of neorealist and slick Hitchcockian camera work that evokes the separation of class in society. The story is simple. A pair of upperclass lovers accidentally hit a cyclist on the highway and leave him to die for fear of being discovered as lovers and losing all they have in society and with each other. The rest of the film is about both the moral questions of responsibility and ego versus a sense of communal responsibility and the gut wracking tension as to whether the two will be discovered. I was occasionally bothered by the heavy handedness of some of the film. Sometimes it was just a too onthenose politically ironic line but particularly an important subplot about a student the male half of our antihero couple has treated unfairly. This subplot while beautifully shot and well acted feels like it exists only to make political and thematic points and pulled me out of identifying with the film on a human level. Likewise a couple of crucial character twists while interesting feel forced or sudden  more there to make a point then to honestly continue the narrative. But these are small flaws compared to the film's great strengths and it is very much worth seeing.".

Despite these quibbles I loved the way this movie made paranoia and obsession virtual characters in the plot.

The story is concise  a couple having an affair hit a bicyclist who dies. They are troubled and ambivalent about it.In their society circle there is an individual Rafa who knows or suspects their affair. He tries to blackmail them and this is very well handled in the movie. The troubled couple do not know the extent of his knowledge.The man having the affair is a professor and due to the stress he is under humiliates a female student in the classroom. This became less credible as she eventually starts to like him and almost becomes his confidante. There is a small riot at the university due to this public humiliation of the student  this riot starts and finishes rather abruptly  it all seems a rather contrived and an unnecessary subplot.The music is very obtrusive at times but this goes with the film era.Also what I found particularly annoying was I could not tell the woman's husband and her lover apart. They both looked alike with small mustache's. So in scenes with the woman it took time to distinguish who she was with  lover or husband it was even more confusing when they were all together! The woman is strikingly beautiful  looking almost like Ingrid Bergman. The acting throughout was good  but sometimes given to philosophical musings. I could not help thinking that if a remake was made today it would be full of histrionics and gory accidents.The ending is somewhat over the top  but it is conclusive.".

	schema:headline " A name can be tarnished by some unseemly act";
	schema:reviewBody "Having gone on bicycle tours across parts of America and China I was immediately interested in this story about a couple involved in an illicit affair who accidentally kills a cyclist on the way home from a shady rendezvous and decide to leave the man still alive to die on the road rather than take responsibility for their actions. You see they would face not only the criminal repercussions of vehicular manslaughter whatever that implies in Franco controlled Spain but also the destruction of their reputations which is presented as the worse of the two consequences.I studied Spanish cinema when I was in college several years ago but a lot of what I have learned about Franco's stifling regime and its effect on the film industry has faded somewhat. Mostly what I remember from that class is that Pedro Almodovar films are just not my thing. But the social commentary about upper class life in mid 1950s Spain is still pretty clear and my understanding is that it was a scathing indictment of parts of the upper class at the time of its release and I always appreciate movies like that. Maria and Juan are involved in an extramarital affair and after the accident they agree to cover it up but their guilt evolves in different directions allowing for some almost Hitchcockian suspense through much of the movie. There is a man named Rafa who apparently saw something and there is a wonderful device for suspense as Juan and Maria try to discover if he just saw them together in the car which would have been an unseemly act in itself because they are both married and not to each other or if he also saw the accident. They don't know and neither do we and you can feel the strain that it puts on them as their normal worlds gradually crumble.It's interesting the way the police involvement is portrayed. There are two motorcycle cops discussing the dead cyclist and hypothesizing about how he was killed. The prevailing theory seems to be that it was a truck and they laugh at the suggestion that it was a couple on an illicit affair. Maybe they don't realize how strange truth can be sometimes. The development of the story involving Rafa is also beautifully handed. He holds this threat of exposure over Juan's and Maria's head finally in a drunken rage telling Maria's husband the whole story about the affair. This is a frightening occurrence but he doesn't believe Rafa basically condemning him as a liar but clearly looking at his wife in a slightly different way from then on. It is uncertain at this point whether Rafa's revelation of what he saw and Miguel Maria's husband not believing him will cancel out the Rafa threat or only serve to pull the rope tighter as now Miguel will be watching both of them even more closely.The social commentary is at it's most obvious in two particular scenes in the film. One is one in which the students at Juan's school where he teaches gather en masse outside of his office organized to demand his resignation because of a supposed love affair that he had with one of his students. That student comes upstairs to talk to him and he tells her that the demonstration doesn't bother him at all. It doesn't matter if they want him fired or promoted he explains to her. They just want to shout. Later after the threat of Rafa seems to have been removed and after he inadvertently let them know that he didn't see the accident after all Maria becomes visibly relaxed and tells Juan that she hopes they can do something for the victim's family Now that we're safe. Juan however wants them to turn themselves in leading to a great tense scene near the end where he is trying to convince her that they should go to the police while she is sitting behind the wheel of her can contemplating running him down. One of the things that the movie does best is to show that lies beget more lies and covered crimes can also lead to more crimes.Unfortunately the end of the movie drags a bit running too long for the tension to remain high giving it a feeling that it is spread a little too thin. There is a nice piece of symbolism in a beautifully framed shot near the end of the movie that is so good that it seems automatically to become the iconographic image of the film. It's an interesting story of deception and murder and the subsequent effects of trying to get away with it in an oppressive society. A fascinating depiction of disintegrating upper class Spanish life!".

It is uncertain at this point whether Rafa's revelation of what he saw and Miguel Maria's husband not believing him will cancel out the Rafa threat or only serve to pull the rope tighter as now Miguel will be watching both of them even more closely.The social commentary is at it's most obvious in two particular scenes in the film. One is one in which the students at Juan's school where he teaches gather en masse outside of his office organized to demand his resignation because of a supposed love affair that he had with one of his students. That student comes upstairs to talk to him and he tells her that the demonstration doesn't bother him at all. It doesn't matter if they want him fired or promoted he explains to her. They just want to shout. Later after the threat of Rafa seems to have been removed and after he inadvertently let them know that he didn't see the accident after all Maria becomes visibly relaxed and tells Juan that she hopes they can do something for the victim's family Now that we're safe. Juan however wants them to turn themselves in leading to a great tense scene near the end where he is trying to convince her that they should go to the police while she is sitting behind the wheel of her can contemplating running him down. One of the things that the movie does best is to show that lies beget more lies and covered crimes can also lead to more crimes.Unfortunately the end of the movie drags a bit running too long for the tension to remain high giving it a feeling that it is spread a little too thin. There is a nice piece of symbolism in a beautifully framed shot near the end of the movie that is so good that it seems automatically to become the iconographic image of the film. It's an interesting story of deception and murder and the subsequent effects of trying to get away with it in an oppressive society. A fascinating depiction of disintegrating upper class Spanish life!";

At the outset both Maria Lucia Bose and Juan Alberto Closas were equally culpable for leaving the man to die on the road though Juan gives the impression that his guilt must be dealt with. As time goes by circumstances intervene that threaten disclosure of the accident thereby creating a domino effect that would destroy Maria's marriage and societal status. The character of Rafa Carlos Casavarilla is an interesting one watching him one is never sure how much he knows and whether his remarks to Maria are simply innuendo or coincidence.The picture makes use of elements that both Hitchcock and Serling would find fertile for the imagination. In fact Rod Serling did utilize a similar theme in a fifth season episode of his landmark series The Twilight Zone titled 'You Drive' though his story takes an absurdist tone by having a vehicle extract it's own brand of justice. What I found most ironic in the way this story concluded and maybe I read too much nuance into the reaction of the bicyclist who Maria swerved to avoid was that he felt remorseful for the woman who lost her life trying not to hit him almost as if he caused the accident himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "It may be a social commentary on the Spanish bourgeois but there's just enough passion murder and betrayal to counterbalance the sermonizing in Muerte de un ciclista. On an empty road an adulterous couple hit a bicyclist with their car. To avoid revealing their affair Juan and Maria Jose abandon the man who subsequently dies from his injuries. What follows is their struggle to keep their crime and relationship a secret. Several themes are predominant. The tragedy wrought by war which in this case was the Spanish Civil War. The striking disparity between the wealthy and poor. The condemnation of the corrupt elite. The just punishment of the wicked. Director Juan Antonio Bardem is to be commended for creating a film that criticized Spain's ruling class during the repressive era of Franco. That said the movie comes close to preaching occasionally hitting us over the head with Juan's realization that he must break free of the conformity that his wealth and status restrict him to. However the plotting is tight and consistently suspenseful from all the intrigue and scheming going on. One pivotal scene that builds suspense while also displaying the Spanish bourgeoisie in all its glory takes place in a flamenco club. Using no dialogue Bardem masterfully increases our apprehension that the pair's sins will be discovered cutting back and forth between tense faces and panicked eyes in close up camera shots. The characters are also well developed. Maria Jose is particularly fascinating. Beautiful privileged and as we ultimately discover a cold mercenary and deadly femme fatale. Her death by bicyclist may strike some as being too trite in its irony but for those who like their movies wrapped up at the end it is satisfying to see that the evil are punished.".

The movie takes as a central point the way in which Fernando Carrera's case was set up the manipulation and alteration of evidence at the scene the manipulation by the police of the testimonies of the few witnesses called to declare the manipulation of national media by Rubn Maugeri key witness and president of the 34th Precinct Friends Association. On the other hand we show how Fernando Carrera lives his days in prison knowing he is another victim of police excesses and of a legal system that unjustly convicted him.";

Enrique Pieyro often referred as the Argentinian Michael Moore did a documentary on a doubtful case of a shooting a the bonaerense neighborhood of Nueva Pompeya. Some cops dressed as civilians shot and almost killed an innocent man who is now in jail accused on charges of robbery and homicide of three people. Pieyro works on the irregularities of the case the lack of convincing evidence lack of witnesses etc in an great effort to throw some light in a very difficult case of police corruptionbrutality. Some time ago I read here in IMDb a review of a guy complaining on a documentary done with an political agenda which means nothing less than a director trying to prove something and I thought a documentary is like a thesis you begin with an hypothesis you do some research and then you use the research you have done to prove or not your initial hypothesis that's the way this documentary is done. A lot of resources backstage special effects recreation etc the unbreakable conviction of pursuing justice of the author and his particular mix of humor and cynicism makes this one into a great interesting and very well executed documentary.I sincerely recommend you try to watch this movie. You will not regret. Thanks I hope I'd been helpful!".

Fernando Leon films not avoiding the beautiful scenery of Uganda many of the children and their stories and also those who take care of the shelters where the night commuters go looking for protection every night.Mariano Barroso departs slightly from the usual documentary format to mix the way big pharmaceutical corporations work and the way many citizens of Africa suffer the consequences of their policies or the lack of any policy.The final piece by Javier Corcuera follows a group of farmers from Colombia who lost their lands to the guerrilla and other para military forces and which are now trying to gain them back to recover their lives.This movie is a must.

This piece has been scored and has been recorded several times under the title of Artie Shaw's Clarinet Concerto but no other clarinetist popular or classical has brought the same excitement to the piece that Shaw did. It's worth renting for that sequence alone.It's a real shame that the director couldn't work out a sequence in which Astaire dances to Shaw's clarinet  playing say Begin the Beguine or Frenesi or Traffic Jam or any other his many other hits.

That's what he does best so it was disappointing not to see much of that in Second Chorus.Although I thought Charles Butterworth's character was stupid I really enjoyed seeing a young Burgess Meredith and it's always a treat to see Paulette Goddard one of the real beauties of the 1940s. Overall this was a good hearted story and when Astaire danced he was fantastic as always.The songs are in here are good and bandleader Artie Shaw even showed he could act too. I liked this despite poor tape quality. I see that this is out on DVD so I might consider purchasing this even though Astaire himself has been quoted as saying Second Chorus was his worst movie.

	schema:reviewBody "After Fred Astaire finished his RKO contract in 1939 with The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle he freelanced for the rest of his career. His first film under the Paramount banner was Second Chorus which had him costarring with marrieds to be Paulette Goddard and Burgess Meredith and big bandleader Artie Shaw. There seems to be a consensus among the reviewers that this was Astaire's worst musical film and I'm not going to dispute that.Of course second rate Fred Astaire is better than most and he does have some nice dance numbers but even they're not up to his usual creative genius. I think Astaire realized he was in a turkey and walked through it to collect his paycheck and move on to something better.Poor Paulette Goddard however. She was just beginning her career and she had gotten good notices for Modern Times and The Women. She had been in stage choruses before so it wasn't like she didn't have any musical training. The following year she was in another musical disaster the independent United Artist film Pot O' Gold with Jimmy Stewart. That was with another bandleader Horace Heidt. Something about Paulette and bandleaders. Anyway she got a long term Paramount contract for the Forties and much better parts including three DeMille films.As an actor Artie Shaw was a great clarinetist and bandleader. Of course he joins other great contemporary thespians like Glenn Miller Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman all who made Hollywood films at the time. His band has a few great numbers though I would have liked to have seen Shaw reprise his all time classic instrumental hit Begin the Beguine.The film starts off kind of dumb to begin with. We're asked to believe that the 41 year old Fred Astaire and his pal Burgess Meredith are a pair of perennial college students who keep flunking courses to stay in college so they can advertise their band as a college orchestra. Even Jack Oakie didn't stay in college forever.After horror of horrors Meredith graduates they have to start looking for work and they keep trying to get a break with Artie Shaw. Of course it all works out in the end but for those interested in seeing the film I shan't say how.Charles Butterworth is on hand to play another of his droll eccentrics and he gets a few laughs. But unless you like Fred Astaire andor Artie Shaw you might well skip Second Chorus.".

His roommate and fellow bandmate is played by HankBurgess Meredith. Fred  Burgess are vying for the affections of the lovely Paulette Goddard Ellen who meets Fred at a dance and later takes a job as his booking agent and secretary.Ellen is hired away by Artie Shaw and the remainder of the movie takes place in New York.  Danny  Hank have both followed Ellen to New York and are trying to get on with Artie Shaw's band.  A series of mishaps and problems follows as both men try to win Ellen and a job with the band while knocking each other out of Ellen's affections.  Charles Butterworth plays the unfortunate Mr. Chisholm who is the butt of many of the jokes and mishaps.Not very original and on the DVD I saw pretty muddy but still it's Fred Astaire and there is one nice dance number featuring Fred as a band conductor who just busts out dancing. There are also some nice big band numbers and Paulette Goddard makes a nice foil for Astaire.Worth seeing if you are a Fred Astaire fan or just love big bands and Artie Shaw.".

Maybe in 1940 Paulette Goddard was considered leading lady material but even Joan Fontaine who costarred with Astaire in A Damsel In Distress was better than this. It's possible also that back in 1940 moviegoers wouldn't have questioned two middleaged guys who keep deliberately flunking courses in order to stay in College and play in a band  BUT did no one wonder about the OTHER band members? Theoretically the band would change personnel every year given that the average College degree takes four years to obtain and presumably when the band was founded it contained members from Freshman Sophomore Junior and Senior Classes. On the plus side there is of course Artie Shaw who ran one of the Greatest bands of the Swing era and far outclassed Benny Goodman as a clarinettist. It's one of the few pictures where Astaire has no real excuse to dance  by which I mean the storyline makes no mention of him as a hoofer as is often the case in his movies  so that the few dances have to be contrived and even then they pale by comparison to his hoofing in other films. If you're an Astaire completist you'll want to see this but there's not an awful lot to make you want to own it.".

First of all as a 42 year old college student who has stayed in school simply for the fact that as a student he continues to have gigs as the college's band leader along with Burgess Meredith! is already a ridiculous setup. Then how the two best pals try to sabotage each other for the love of their young manager Paulette Goddard who would end up marrying Meredith in real life! during a public audition with Artie Shaw's band isn't realistic considering the alleged closeness of their friendship. I'm surprised that they didn't have Meredith didn't sit up front sucking on a lemon while Astaire played his solo. Toss in Charles Butterworth as the mandolin playing benefactor of a concert Shaw is giving and a plot to keep him off stage with his mandolin during the performance and there's little to do but groan.In spite of the fact that next to Joan Fontaine Goddard was considered Astaire's weakest dancing partner she actually does good in their one number together. He may have worked her hard and given her some fairly easy steps but she manages to pull it off. Goddard does have some romantic chemistry with Astaire not as light on her feet as Ginger Rogers but equally as sexy. The big band sequences feature some fun if unmemorable jazz music and Astaire's dance while conducting Shaw's band seems strangely out of place. Still there are some moments of amusement and any film where Astaire dances can't be all that bad.".

As far as disposable comedies go this film is leagues ahead of what passes for said genre today.  Effervescent and hip the film never strikes a false note the jazz is hot and while the songs may not be familiar standards they mesh well with the plot and have a comic touch that is absent in a lot of musicals.

The whole premise of the college band does not work for a moment and there is never a time when the viewer is not overly conscious that the whole situation is contrived.To be sure some of Astaire's most enjoyable pictures have lightweight plots which allow him and the rest of the cast to be the center of attention.  But the good ones are much more creative than this and they also come with much better characters and dialogue.  As slight as the story lines may be in Top Hat or Swing Time you don't think about it while you are watching them because everything else is of such high quality. Second Chorus on the other hand seems thrown together as if they just hoped that Astaire could keep it afloat by himself.That's not to criticize the rest of the cast who do their best.  Paulette Goddard can be very charming but her character here gives her very little to work with.  She does manage to get a couple of nice moments out of it anyway.  Burgess Meredith is stuck with a character who is both illdefined and annoying so he never has any chance to show what he could do.It's worth watching once as is practically anything that stars Astaire.

It's a shame that these reviewers missed the musical subtlety of the performancea slightly different but equally powerful direction for Fred.For example there's one number where Astaire dances a fabulous romp while conducting a band. Priceless! Anyone who's played in a band even if it's your high school marching band should get a thrill out of this routine. The beauty is that most conductors are stereotypically the most lifeless brooding noseinthescore dead weights you've ever seen. And to see Astaire conducting the band with pirouettes arabesques and fancy footwork is just classic.Another musical inside joke happens early on when a trumpet solo is sabotaged by a rival trumpeter. The rival scribbles out the proper notes and pencils in the most horrifically atonal arrangement you've ever seen or heard. Again musicians will recognize and hear what is about to happen just by looking at the butchered score. The hilarious payoff comes at the actual performance. It's a fear all musicians have when blindly sight reading a sheet of music. Once again CLASSIC!Then there's poor Mr. Chisholm and his lazy mandolin. Anyone who's ever played in a band knows about the hangeron who's not very good at his instrument but for whatever reasons the band leader doesn't boot him out into the street. Btw if you don't know the guy I'm talking about chances are IT'S YOU.All in all this was a fantastic hilarious  inspiring experience for me and I'm sure anyone who has dabbled on an instrument may feel the same. It has certainly motivated me to pick up my old trumpet and squeak out a few notes much to the despair of my upstairs neighbour I'm sure.Musicians don't miss this.

Astaire sings and dances with this wonderful flair.

Even more surprising there is virtually no dancing  with more scenes instead focusing on Astaire doing a very bad mime of playing the trumpet.The characters all come across as selfish and things which are meant to be viewed as harmless pranks appear nasty and needlessly hurtful. By the end of the movie you have not developed a level of empathy for any of them  except perhaps for Paulette Goddard who really shines in this movie as a great comic actress and foil for much of the movie.

Their characters are also dis likable double crossing schmucks who never miss a chance to screw each other over sometimes in the nastiest ways possible.Artie Shaw however does shine. Okay he wasn't the best actor ever but then he never pretended to be or I'm sure even wanted to be. He was by all accounts portraying a man named Artie Shaw a clarinet playing band leader and no acting was really required. He was in the film purely to showcase his music and his orchestra and it must be said he fulfilled his contract perfectly.Only two or three scenes save this already obscure picture from the deeper obscurity it would so otherwise deserve.1 The scene where Astaire having had his Trumpet solo completely rewritten by Merideth for his long awaited life changing and career defining audition with Artie Shaws band starts blasting out bum notes and discordant musical passages that foul up the entire song. Hilarious almost pant wetting comedy expertly acted by the confused Astaire made even more funny by the fact that he obviously attach's the blame of the bum arrangement to the great Artie Shaw himself before realisation dawns.2Artie Shaws great if somewhat shortened Concerto for Clarinet which not only proves that he the best clarinet player the world had known before or since but that his band was truly the premier big band orchestra of the day. It is a shame his music and talent could not be showcased a little more than it was. In this film it seems he talks more than he actually plays.3 Astaire again conducting Shaws band to Poor Mr.Chisolm while tapping his merry little head off. Again like Shaw Astaire was the very best at his chosen craft and this film apart from this moment does little to showcase it.With input from top quality entertainers like Astaire and Shaw this film could have pulled such wonderful feats out of the hat yet apart from the three scenes mentioned it failed at almost every single level and every opportunity was missed.The plot was weak and the dialogue far from clever and as a motion picture alone it fails to stand up but for lovers of Astaire and fans of Artie Shaws music may find them like I did the saving Grace of a spent force. Definitely one black cloud with two silver linings.".

There are great sequences a swing number between Goddard and Astaire is the highlight. I also enjoyed Astaire tackling a cossack dance more of the above dance scenes would have improved the movie. The story is awkwardly constructed though and frankly unconvincing. Artie Smith is good but the music lacks sparkle overall.

Instead there are just three lacklustre routines a brief mock Cossack dance a decent tap routine at the end but nothing he hadn't done far better in other movies and a routine with Paulette Goddard who simply was not a dancer which shows in both the performance and the limited choreography presumably intended to keep within what she could do dancing apart she is probably the best thing in the film beautiful and sparkling.In addition what songs there are by Artie Shaw and Johnny Mercer are below par. Even the best one Love of my Life is pretty mundane. Shaw's band makes up for this with some good numbers and Shaw unexpectedly turns out to be a respectable enough actor albeit in some undemanding scenes.But I can't help wondering if it was the presence of Shaw who wrote the score that resulted in the limited amount of Astaire routines  the big band numbers may not have left enough time for dances.

	schema:headline " The Trumpet Blows";
	schema:reviewBody "SECOND CHORUS Paramount 1940 directed by H.C. Potter from an original story by Frank Cavett was an unlikely production for which songanddance man Fred Astaire ever appeared. In spite of its backstage musical sounding title Astaire doesn't enact the role of a dance director which wouldn't have been a bad idea actually. Unlike some of his earlier works where he would play a dancer by profession SECOND CHORUS provides Astaire with a new kind of role that of a college student ! with a flare for trumpet playing. While much of the plot devotes itself to the current phase known as the big band era featuring band leader Artie Shaw as himself and with more emphases on comedy during the non musical portions for a Fred Astaire film this might prove disappointing for having the least amount of dancing of any Astaire musical up to this point.The story starts off with a social function of a New England university where students and guests are being entertained by the band called Danny O'Neill's University Perennials. Roommates Danny Fred Astaire and Hank Taylor Burgess Meredith trumpet players who've remained in college for seven years to take advantage of lucrative college band bookings take notice of their friend Stu's Frank Melton date a young brunette named Ellen Miller Paulette Goddard. Danny immediately believes Ellen to be interested in him until given a piece of paper by her that turns out to be a summons from the McKinley Encyclopedia Company for unpaid bills totaling 110. Coming to Dunn  Dunn Collective Agency Danny and Hank meet up with Ellen where she works as secretary for Mr. Dunn James Conlin. Instead of straightening out matters about the bill the boys manage in getting Ellen fired instead only to hire her as both their secretary and manager. Under this newfound profession Ellen succeeds in obtaining the boys interviews with bandleader Artie Shaw in New York. Instead of landing them jobs Ellen is offered a position as Shaw's personal secretary instead. As Danny and Hank each compete for both Ellen's attentions and a job in Artie Shaw's band misunderstandings occur as Ellen becomes involved with a middleaged man J. Lester Chisholm Charles Butterworth.With music and lyrics by Johnny Mercer Hal Borne Bernie Hannigan and Artie Shaw the motion picture soundtrack includes Second Chorus Sugar instrumental Everything's Jumpin' I Ain't Hep to That Step sung by Fred Astaire danced by Astaire and Paulette Goddard The Ivy Shuffle Sweet Sue Love of My Life sung by Astaire I'm Yours Double Mellow Poor Mr. Chisholm The Moon is Shining Hoe Down Swing Concerto and Poor Mr. Chisholm Marked by none of the visual scales of the RKO Radio musicals where Astaire peaked during his six year screen partnership 19331939 with Ginger Rogers for his Paramount debut the script finds him along with dramatic actor Burgess Meredith in their only pairing enacting that as friendly rivals in something much better served by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope playing tricks on one another in order to either get the girl or land the job in Shaw's band. One amusing scene occurs where Hank Meredith rearranges the musical notes of Danny's Astaire song sheet prior to his audition with Shaw and trumpet playing out of synchronization with the other players to offbeat tunes causing him not to get the job. There's also another scene where Astaire dressed up like a cossack singing with a Russian accent sounding very much the way he had spoken in SHALL WE DANCE? RKO 1937 in a sequence where he poses intends on fooling a girl Ginger Rogers by pretending to be Russian dancer Petrov. As for the dancing sequences which are very limited Astaire does a jive number with Goddard. While her dancing was adequate but no match to the style of Rogers Goddard never danced on screen again and the Swing Concerto finale where Astaire not only conducts the band but tap dances and plays the trumpet simultaneously. Charles Butterworth in his usual droll manner even has a song Poor Mr. Chisholm dedicated to his character. Later reissued in 1947 by Astor Pictures SECOND CHORUS became a public domain product during the birth of home video in the early 1980s most distributors acquiring poor quality prints taken from its reissue. Around that time SECOND CHORUS turned up as an overplay product on various local or public TV stations as well as cable Television notably on Nickelodeon's Nick and Nite Movie during the aftermidnight hours prior to 1992. There was even a motion picture soundtrack of this film distributed in record stores at or about 19791980. The best available print to SECOND CHORUS however with original Paramount logo intact can be found on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered June 14 2004. Regardless of its reputation being one of Fred Astaire's lesser efforts SECOND CHORUS is still watchable especially when fortunate enough to view it from a crystal clear print. ".

Instead of landing them jobs Ellen is offered a position as Shaw's personal secretary instead. As Danny and Hank each compete for both Ellen's attentions and a job in Artie Shaw's band misunderstandings occur as Ellen becomes involved with a middleaged man J. Lester Chisholm Charles Butterworth.With music and lyrics by Johnny Mercer Hal Borne Bernie Hannigan and Artie Shaw the motion picture soundtrack includes Second Chorus Sugar instrumental Everything's Jumpin' I Ain't Hep to That Step sung by Fred Astaire danced by Astaire and Paulette Goddard The Ivy Shuffle Sweet Sue Love of My Life sung by Astaire I'm Yours Double Mellow Poor Mr. Chisholm The Moon is Shining Hoe Down Swing Concerto and Poor Mr. Chisholm Marked by none of the visual scales of the RKO Radio musicals where Astaire peaked during his six year screen partnership 19331939 with Ginger Rogers for his Paramount debut the script finds him along with dramatic actor Burgess Meredith in their only pairing enacting that as friendly rivals in something much better served by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope playing tricks on one another in order to either get the girl or land the job in Shaw's band. One amusing scene occurs where Hank Meredith rearranges the musical notes of Danny's Astaire song sheet prior to his audition with Shaw and trumpet playing out of synchronization with the other players to offbeat tunes causing him not to get the job. There's also another scene where Astaire dressed up like a cossack singing with a Russian accent sounding very much the way he had spoken in SHALL WE DANCE? RKO 1937 in a sequence where he poses intends on fooling a girl Ginger Rogers by pretending to be Russian dancer Petrov. As for the dancing sequences which are very limited Astaire does a jive number with Goddard. While her dancing was adequate but no match to the style of Rogers Goddard never danced on screen again and the Swing Concerto finale where Astaire not only conducts the band but tap dances and plays the trumpet simultaneously. Charles Butterworth in his usual droll manner even has a song Poor Mr. Chisholm dedicated to his character. Later reissued in 1947 by Astor Pictures SECOND CHORUS became a public domain product during the birth of home video in the early 1980s most distributors acquiring poor quality prints taken from its reissue. Around that time SECOND CHORUS turned up as an overplay product on various local or public TV stations as well as cable Television notably on Nickelodeon's Nick and Nite Movie during the aftermidnight hours prior to 1992. There was even a motion picture soundtrack of this film distributed in record stores at or about 19791980. The best available print to SECOND CHORUS however with original Paramount logo intact can be found on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered June 14 2004. Regardless of its reputation being one of Fred Astaire's lesser efforts SECOND CHORUS is still watchable especially when fortunate enough to view it from a crystal clear print. ";

You should watch this only to see Fred Astaire do a couple of great numbers one as a Russian another while he conducts the Artie Shaw band yes he's in a tux for that one.What's fascinating for modern audiences is to see Artie Shaw not so much for his acting either but because he plays a couple of great numbers here and he was terrific on the licorice stick. He's young here too 30 years old. One number he was famous for not here though is Stardust and it featured a trumpet solo by Billy Butterfield. Butterfield actually plays for Burgess Meredith here who like Astaire fakes poorly on the horn. We also see Buddy Rich in the orchestra playing drums next to Artie Shaw. What a combo! Shaw was a huge sensation in the 30's and 40's an equal to the more famous now Benny Goodman. He sold more than a hundred million records. He brought along talent like Billie Holiday Mel Torme Buddy Rich and Ray Conniff. He also played classical music with Leonard Bernstein. In this movie he plays Concerto for Clarinet. This film also brought him 2 Oscar nominations one for Best Score and one for Best Song Love of my Life.Astaire once called this the worst movie I ever made and for him that's true. But it's great to see Shaw play and how he could play! Shaw admired Astaire but said he was a tireless worker the opposite of the kind of debonair image he presented in top hat and tails.".

So I set my DVR to record his films. Mundin has a large part in the film still listed last on the title card but that is probably not a good thing since he seems to play subservant help roles but this one wasn't in a Jeeves or Eric Blore amusing way perhaps the film needed some of that to make it work for me. I could tell I didn't like this flick when I timed when Charlie gets on the screen is at 19 minutes so he doesn't show up until into 13 of the film's total run time! His introduction is lame what was that big build up for? I was not impressed. Then there is a scheme where rich people are banking him to gamble for 200000 in losses during the depression. Just seems so preposterous. And those cabins in the ship look just like a Hollywood mansion. I turned it off. I didn't care how it ended I wonder if Charlie is really alive and pulling a big con on everyone? Who cares not me. Champagne Charlie is being played a lot on FX Retro in case you are looking for it. That's a station I never heard of before so I have CC to thank for that usually finding old movies only on Turner Classic Movies. It's great that the old programming is getting greater access.

Already engaged to fellow socialite Tod Hollingsworth Thomas Beck I didn't get the fascination for Charlie other than his charm good looks conversational ease and breezy manner. Maybe I'm missing something.The hook in the story is the wrangle between Miss Linda and Charlie's valet Phipps Herbert Mundin over who gets to be declared the killer of gangster Gorini Noel Madison. If I'm the captain of the cruise ship I'd be pretty skeptical about the idea that Gorini fell on his knife during a struggle with Phipps after Phipps confessed to murder to protect Miss Craig. But that's what they went with to save the day for both. For a minute there as the story about the pendant that Charlie had given Miss Craig's mother years earlier I was waiting for the bomb to drop that Charlie was her father!

If I'm the captain of the cruise ship I'd be pretty skeptical about the idea that Gorini fell on his knife during a struggle with Phipps after Phipps confessed to murder to protect Miss Craig. But that's what they went with to save the day for both. For a minute there as the story about the pendant that Charlie had given Miss Craig's mother years earlier I was waiting for the bomb to drop that Charlie was her father! For this story at least it seemed like anything was possible.";

After World War I there was a general downsizing of the military. There were only limited opportunities to create a carrierbound air capability. The aircraft were not designed specifically for landing on a flat top and several death occur during training. Over the years however Scott is one of several men who pursue their dream of aircraft carriers and aircraft specifically designed for that purpose. Their worth is proved in World War II at the Battle of Midway and throughout the war.";

The second is the Court Martial of Billy Mitchell where he plays the real life Army Aviation pioneer.For today's fans if one wants to see where Tom Cruise and the gang from Top Gun all got their start take a look at Task Force. The idea of a floating flattop ship from where airplanes could take off and land was one that was scoffed at post World War I. Pilots didn't have the skills yet for that. What Task Force shows is Gary Cooper and a whole bunch of other people who believed in an idea living and dying to prove that idea.Task Force was memorable in the career of Gary Cooper for two other reasons. It was the first film he did after leaving his original studio Paramount at Warner Brothers where he worked for about five years. It was also the last film he did with good friend Walter Brennan. They made eight joint film appearances including some memorable ones in The Westerner and Sergeant York where they got Oscars Brennan for The Westerner and Cooper for Sergeant York.Jane Wyatt is Cooper's leading lady playing the part of the faithful wife where if this had been made at MGM June Allyson would have had the part. She's the widow of one of Cooper's early Navy flier friends who is killed trying to land on a new aircraft carrier.Director Delmar Daves made good use of actual combat footage both black and white and in the last 15 minutes color. Lent a real air of authenticity to what we were viewing. Look for some good supporting performances from Brennan Wayne Morris Bruce Bennett and the best being an obtuse United States Senator played by Stanley Ridges.The final shot of the film shows Cooper now in civilian attire with jets passing overhead. That was a whole new skill that had to be learned by the next generation of Top Guns. Very graphically demonstrated in The Bridges at TokoRi.I'd like to think that Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast of Top Gun saw those two films and realized the great heritage they were now going to portray.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have Turner Classic Movies it would behoove you to take the time to watch Task Force a fine passionate and patriotic film about the advent of the aircraft carrier as the principal weapon of the US Navy in World War II. Although it is a product of the timesand the Production CodeTF delivers the story of how flattops superseded the battleship as the principal tool for in Navyspeak projecting power. With the skillful use of lots of film footage which helped tremendously in avoiding the use of cheesy ship models TF tells the story of a young naval officer played believably here by a much older Gary Cooper. As Cooper advances in his skill as an aviator he runs afoul of bureaucrats and bullies both outside the navy and in. This results in his being disciplined and scolded for speaking his mind about naval aviation and his frustration with a lack of personal advancement and the navy not being prepared for future conflict. Cooper is a lanky metaphor for the advent of the carrier as the Queen of the Seas.With Pearl Harbor Cooper's Scottie Scott is thrown into battle against an enemy that is much better prepared for air combat and with the aid and leadership of his father figure Walter Brennan he as metaphor gains the recognition and ultimate victory he deserves.I read somewhere that Gary Cooper surrendered his chance at ultrastardom when he made certain decisions about parts that robbed his film persona of the sort of sex appeal that would have guaranteed his place as a film starsex symbol. The reviewer said something about Cooper being more of a big brother than a lover.I don't know if all this is true but Cooper's image of being a friendly decent human hero is clearly seen in Task Force. Heand Brennancarry this movie. The chemistry Coop has with his audience and his onscreen friend and C.O. Brennan puts real blood and muscle into a movie that at times gets a bit too documentarian. Add in a sweet loving performance by Jane Wyatt as the graceful and gracious military wife and you have a really human movie that works as history lesson war film political essay and love story.Finally what I love about this film is its innate patriotism. There simply is no questioning of America's place and motive in the years leading up to and during the Second World War. We were a democracy threatened by tyranny. We were unprepared for war because we despised it so very much once confronted we prevailed. The stock footage of Cooper's carrier in real life the badly damaged USS Franklin arriving at New York with her flight deck and upper hull twisted into scrap metal by Japanese explosives is startling a metaphor for the cost of not being prepared with the sort of cuttingedge technology training and will that might have reduced the bloodiness of the war or prevented it all together.".

The film just shows Americans in their best light fighting against the odds and their own superiors at the same time. Not like Operation Overlord and the Ardennes Offensive battles more often depicted which by comparison were cakewalks where the outcome was never in doubt. In this movie the Japanese are also seen as being a creditable and respected adversaries.Gary Cooper is much more convincing as a WW2 leader than say Ben Affleck. The leaders at the time were modest men just doing a job. There was also a lot of technical planning involved in WW2 not just gungho American soldiers and sailors in continuous and unrealistic action. It is also far more dangerous at sea than on land as you can't go anywhere. The danger element and the general communication between the CVs was bought out well in this movie.This film is a historical recounting of the greatest naval episode of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This past week I watched Task Force on Turner Classic Movies. What a great movie about US Naval Aviation before and during WWII. For starters the actors play their parts masterfully. You can tell that Gary Cooper really enjoys playing this character and telling this Navy story. I also liked how the movie had continuity of time being that the story spanned many years. Perhaps most of all I enjoyed the footage of the aircraft carriers themselves. I thought to myself how the carriers that they were filming on only a few years before 1949 were the centerpiece of the most horrific combat of WWII. I am sure many of the actors and those who saw the film remembered vividly when the news from the Battle of Midway and Okinawa reached home. So many young Americans died. What brought a tear to my eye was the video at the end of the movie when the USS Enterprise is returning to NY City. The camera man at the time in 1945 films the damage with NYC icons like the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge in the background. It is amazing footage. I thought to myself how the young veterans in the audience in 1949 must have reflected on their war fought only a few years before. Therefore I love how this movie of history is indeed history itself.".

As others have stated Brennan and Cooper are a great pair and they were a very good pair in this movie. Except for the typical lack of bloody wounds in forties war movies it was impressive that the dramatic detail in this movie was more accurate than usual for this genre. The movie did a great job depicting the interaction in the CIC combat information center and elsewhere on the ships. However unusual it seemed transitioning from black and white to color to show plot transition The Wizard of Oz notwithstanding was effective for me. Deep down I think it might have been a way to sneak in color war footage. As I am also a Jane Wyatt Spock's mother fan she was great as Scott's Gary Cooper's character wife. Although it did seem to be a bit incongruous that she dressed as well as she did considering her situation. Sorry you'll have to see the movie.

This film starts in the early 20's when there were very few carriers and aircraft and pilots to fly them. Cooper's character fights Along with Brennan who is his immediate superior to get better Naval Air Power. He is rebuffed by his superiors but never lets up... And eventually after the incident in June 1942 where 3 Aircraft Carriers took out four Japanese carriers but were sunk or damaged themselves the Navy was granted a better carrier force.Lots of great war footage is used in this film They did not use special effects for Aerial battle scenes in moovies like these It is odd to think that when you see a plane being shot down a real person got killed in the crash.But the point of such films is not really entertainment At the start of WW II the US had just about nothing as far as armed forces were concerned. It took decades to get to the point were we had what it took to take on a country with a superior maritime tradition.The real war footage is a stark reminder of things that happened. In recent years this trend of using real war footage has again cropped up in a few pictures. For example in The Chronicles of Riddick the fireworks in a battle are real rockets from Iraq.This film ends with Cooper retiring and we see jets flying across the sky So in a way this film not only is showing us the history of Naval Air power but also of Hollywood filmmaking.And that makes Task Force a clever and important film.".

TCM is showing way too many films with Walter Brennan in them and I'm losing interest in him after so many films he was great in Sgt York though. Highpoint was seeing real life combat Navy Ace Wayne Morris but his acting is nothing like in Paths of Glory why'd they only make him a LT? at least make him a LCDR and give his role the meat the high billing has him at. Anyway pros some great shots of actual American fighters dive bombers and torpedo planes also it was cool to show my wife who dutifully watched with me what goes on in CIC with the plotting of enemy ship sightings etc thats what I have done on carriers. Cons very wooden acting also this script has dialog that explains out loud the actions going on so the naive audience understands to the point that its like a kids cartoon show. Big con was all the same stock footage we've memorized by now mostly of the kamikaze planes that happened long after the battle of Midway took place of the planes going down. Pretty much will hold hard hard core war buffs interests but most others will pass on this dated film after a few minutes. I wish someone would remake a movie on the battle of Midway based on the book Incredible Victory by Walter Lord. In it it really takes you into so much of the battle with narrative from both sides and includes the Midway land forces and the daring night attack by our PBY planes the night before the main battle which I found very thrilling and interesting to read about it's mentioned in the film Task Force but not the film Midway. Mr Lord wrote the book A Night To Remember which I think was used for the film of the same name so it wouldn't be a stretch to make a really choice film based on another of his books Am I the only one noticing the LACK of films made recently in which the Americans clearly win?. Task Force 6 of 10 to see real war hero actor Wayne Morris just in something like what he was really doing in the war and a different role than in Paths Of Glory and cool 40's carrier operations gotta love those springs that the planes crash into if they don't hook a line yecch.".

This rings true as there are always men of vision in every branch ofthe military who are ignored and even persecuted for their beliefsusually by members of Congress and career officers who either wish to feather their own beds or who equate bigger and more powerful as more effective especially in aircraft design.I do think there are many other actors who could have played the part of Scott with more animation andor passion. Cooper is most effective when playing characters with little social savvy e.g. Sergeant York or Friendly Persuasion. One could argue that Scott might be such a man but a more effective commander would be a man who had command presence and the ability to inspire.

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper plays a navy man that was one of the first pilots trained to fly from an aircraft carrier the USS Langley and continues his career through WWII until his retirement. The first section of the film focuses a lot on Cooper and his relationships with friends his future wife and the navy brass.Later when WWII arrives the film is much more of an action flick and gives a very competent overview of the war in the Pacific. While this did employ a lot of stock footage it was unusual in that most all of the footage was used correctly. Unlike the ridiculously historically inaccurate film MIDWAY 1976 TASK FORCE made sure to use clips that were accuratefeaturing the correct model planes for each segment of the war whereas in MIDWAY they often showed planes that weren't even in the naval arsenal until well after the battle as well as had dive bombers magically turn into fighter planes in midflight due to horrid editing blunders.This film really has widely different appeal depending on your perspective. If you are a history teacher and airplane nut like me then it earns a 9 because it does a really good job of conveying the history of the American aircraft carriers from its inception in the early 1920s through WWII. However if you are not then you might find the film a bit cold as it often focuses more on events than people towards the middle to the end of the film and it might seem a bit confusing if you aren't familiar with the history of these great ships.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gary Cooper plays a navy man that was one of the first pilots trained to fly from an aircraft carrier the USS Langley and continues his career through WWII until his retirement. The first section of the film focuses a lot on Cooper and his relationships with friends his future wife and the navy brass.Later when WWII arrives the film is much more of an action flick and gives a very competent overview of the war in the Pacific. While this did employ a lot of stock footage it was unusual in that most all of the footage was used correctly. Unlike the ridiculously historically inaccurate film MIDWAY 1976 TASK FORCE made sure to use clips that were accuratefeaturing the correct model planes for each segment of the war whereas in MIDWAY they often showed planes that weren't even in the naval arsenal until well after the battle as well as had dive bombers magically turn into fighter planes in midflight due to horrid editing blunders.This film really has widely different appeal depending on your perspective. If you are a history teacher and airplane nut like me then it earns a 9 because it does a really good job of conveying the history of the American aircraft carriers from its inception in the early 1920s through WWII. However if you are not then you might find the film a bit cold as it often focuses more on events than people towards the middle to the end of the film and it might seem a bit confusing if you aren't familiar with the history of these great ships.";

	schema:headline " Story behind the development of the aircraft carrier as a strategic weapon";
	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Delmer Daves this unremarkable war drama uses several real events concerning the development of aircraft carrier warfare from the original U.S.S. Langley and biplane aircraft of the 1920's through the U.S.S. Enterprise among others during World War II as its backdrop even jet fighters flying in formation are shown at the end of the picture.Initially thought to be too vulnerable to fund relative to battleships e.g. slugging it out since 1812 the carrier became the Navy's most strategic weapon around which much of the rest of fleet was built to support. Six years before Gary Cooper would play Billy Mitchell a visionary who predicted the advancement and strategic significance of the airplane in Naval battles he played a fictional Jonathan Scott a Navy pilot who finds himself in a similar position with regards to the aircraft carrier.The film actually begins and ends with officer Scott's retirement from the Navy four years after the end of the Pacific campaign and WW II. Therefore the story is told in flashback beginning in the early twenties when Scott was just a seaplane pilot being told he'd have to takeoff and land on a deck 65 feet wide that of the only early carrier a ship not decommissioned due to budget cuts the Langley.The plot progresses through years of struggle with e.g. Congress over the acceptance of this new technology up to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and 'our' subsequent hit and run strategy and tactics that led to the significant Battle of Midway victory etc..Most of the film is in BW but the last portion about 20 minutes of the movie is in color it appears to consist of stock footage of the actual battles ostensibly taking place as more than a dozen newly outfitted carriers advance towards Okinawa the carriers' defense weaponry against enemy aircraft and Kamikaze attacks as well as planes crash landings on their decks are shown.The background story that holds everything together is that of Scott's life and Navy career. His initial flight commander who during the course of the story becomes an Admiral who's also his superior officer is Pete Richard played by Walter Brennan of course their last of 8 films together. Jane Wyatt plays Mary Morgan the wife of another early carrier pilot Rory Mallinson uncredited who's killed that later becomes Scott's wife. Wayne Morris who actually served in the Navy during World War II himself and became a highly decorated flying ace plays McKinney a student of Scott's at the Annapolis Naval Academy that becomes a dive bomber Julie London plays his wife the former Miss Barbara McKinney. Bruce Bennett plays McCluskey someone who served with Scott while he was being punished for speaking out of turn and 'flying a desk' stationed at the Panama Canal until they were both called to serve on a new carrier the Saratoga Jack Holt plays wing commander Reeves who'd also served with Scott back in the 1920's. Stanley Ridges plays Senator Bentley and Art Baker plays Senator Vincent both of whom argue over the value of the carrier to the fleet and future warfare with Admiral Ames Moroni Olsen Laura Treadwell uncredited plays his wife. John Ridgely plays Scott's oldest friend Dixie Rankin a fellow pilot from the early days whose wife Ruth Mary Lawrence uncredited is killed during the Pearl Harbor raid. Apparently Edmond O'Brien is the uncredited voice heard on radio announcing the attack. Kenneth Tobey uncredited also appears very briefly as Captain Ken Willliamson a man who's escorting andor dating Mary at a Washington D.C. function before Scott arrives.".

The officers are at attention as he walks across the deck. He boards the gig and heads for shore. Then his narrative begins It doesn't seem like twentyseven years ago that I first flew an airplane off the Langley  And so it goes. The voices of Cooper and one or two other principals carry us through a kind of Classic Comics illustration of the development of naval aviation from the first fragile and clumsy biplanes wheeling around on the flight deck of the USS Langley in the 1920s to an overflight of jet fighters as Cooper and his wife Jane Wyatt stand on the pier staring proudly up at them as they zoom overhead.A familiar structure. It's like Jimmy Stewart growing up with the organization in The FBI Story a promo for J. Edgar Hoover PresidentforLife. And it was used by John Ford in The Wings of Eagles although there was more robust humor and a lot of distraction was provided by a drunken wife. The role of wife in Task Force is less challenging and of no importance whatever. She's there to tell him how proud she is of his successes to comfort him when he's sad and to talk common sense to him when he's so frustrated he's ready to quit the Navy. Usually it's the other way around with the wife jealous of her husband's being married to the Navy. There's a straw man  a viciously antimilitary editor who rails against expensive investments like aircraft carriers even after the battle of Midway when everyone down to the lowliest swabby recognized that the war in the Pacific depended on carriers. The guy should leave his brain to the Smithsonian. Julie London in a small role is yummy with startling eyes and a nose by Praxitiles.The movie gives us a sense of the passage of time. The footage of the Langley in the 20s morphs into the modern carriers of World War II and the shooting changes from black and white to color. There's a good deal of interspersed combat footage most of it familiar beginning with Greg Toland's reenactment of the precipitating event in Pearl Harbor. Flaming airplanes fall apart in the air. A wounded American aviator has his Hellcat torn in half during a crash landing. A stricken carrier sends up a ball of vermilion fire. The same airplane crashes two times maybe three with the negative flipped. If I see that same Japanese fighter trailing fire and smoke and skipping along a few dozen feet above the sea before doing a sudden nose dive I think I'll scream. Forty millimeter guns pound away. Officers sit and sweat out the battles while the score imitates a clock with a Thump thump Thump thump beat.The battles aren't really described in any detail and the detail that's provided always makes our side look good which is to be expected. References are made to Midway the Phillipine Sea and Okinawa. Kamikazes at Okinawa caused more casualties among Navy personnel than were suffered by the Army ashore. One genuinely brave and selfsacrificing aviator is named among all the fictional character McCluskey but he isn't given the right role. Wayne Morris an actor of little discernible talent plays another aviator. In real life he'd actually put his rear end on the line playing a Naval aviator during the war. The editing is only a little sloppy. An F4F landing suddenly morphs into a TBF then back again but that doesn't happen very often and the canopy of the hopelessly obsolete TBD Devastator is accurately pictured.The whole movie from beginning to end amounts to a promotional ad for Naval aviation. Gary Cooper is the central figure but he's only there to guide us along through the progression of things and events a kind of patient and explanatory Virgil taking us through a specular gray world that sometimes turns hellish.It isn't a bad movie. I always enjoy movies about aviation and the Navy. But as far as I could tell there was only a single original touch in the script. Cooper's ship has been torpedoed and his best friend killed on the bridge below and when Cooper touches the chesthigh steel shield to look down at the body the metal is so hot that he winces and quickly withdraws his hands. It would have been nice if there had been more such delicate and personal touches.".

The action sequences are gripping the actual archival footage is seamlessly integrated with the actor recreations and the film does quite a service to history by outlining the development of the US carrier force from the 1920's the lead characters are all alumni of the Langley through WW2  down to the fight the Navy had with Congress to get a new carrier fleet funded after Pearl Harbor. It manages to convey a huge quantity of information and do so factually without being a documentary  it's all actionpacked drama with several strong human interest plots  subplots including a pretty good depiction of what Navy fliers wives went through. Having watch this on TCM this morning I'm going to buy the video. This is a musthave! It's also really interesting how they switch suddenly at the end of the film from BW to Technicolor. Odd but it works and helps integrate the color archival footage into the film. Four stars in my book!".

	schema:headline " The true story of Albert Spaggiari";
	schema:reviewBody "That's the second film made about the 1976 Nice heist. A bunch of fifteen or twenty men drilled during two months a tunnel between the sewer net and the Societe Generale safe deposit room. The bank vault. They forced 317 armored boxes and did not forget the bank one too. They grabbed more than 50 millions of France  16 millions of dollars.The leader  the brain  of this bunch was arrested several months later and escaped one year after in 1977 jumping out of the judge's office and disappeared. He ran away from France to South America. He has never been caught again.Albert Spaggiari was not a real gangster but a hard boiled adventurer former paratrooper during the Indochina and Algeria wars. A real hard boiled guy. And most of his former brother in arms  the surviving ones  followed him were at his side in this outstanding expedition. The remaining hoods were however authentic gangsters specialists in safe cracking with oxyacetylene cutting torches.Another movie was made in 1979 directed by Jose Giovanni.

	onyx:emotionText "That's the second film made about the 1976 Nice heist. A bunch of fifteen or twenty men drilled during two months a tunnel between the sewer net and the Societe Generale safe deposit room. The bank vault. They forced 317 armored boxes and did not forget the bank one too. They grabbed more than 50 millions of France  16 millions of dollars.The leader  the brain  of this bunch was arrested several months later and escaped one year after in 1977 jumping out of the judge's office and disappeared. He ran away from France to South America. He has never been caught again.Albert Spaggiari was not a real gangster but a hard boiled adventurer former paratrooper during the Indochina and Algeria wars. A real hard boiled guy. And most of his former brother in arms  the surviving ones  followed him were at his side in this outstanding expedition. The remaining hoods were however authentic gangsters specialists in safe cracking with oxyacetylene cutting torches.Another movie was made in 1979 directed by Jose Giovanni. It focused more on the heist itself not the afterwads...The 2008 film points out the escape in a South America country where a journalist tries to meet the famous thief for making an interview.Spaggiari is shown as a weird character.

The story of five people in rural New Brunswick is a slice of life. Never once was I bored because the characters were so realistic  except for the GQ hairstyle on the character of Steph.  The film drew me in with its bleak portrayal of living in a small town with nothing but beer good friends cigarettes and sex to remind one that they are still alive.The cinematography of the film is exquisite crashing waves against jagged rocks broken down abandoned houses the metaphors are transparent. Edits in the film seem like jump cuts used instead of fadeouts to infer passing time. This technique reminded me of the brilliant 1996 FrenchDanish film Breaking the Waves.Full Blast takes place in a remote desolate town and revolves around Steph and his affair with an older woman his sexual relationship with friend Charles and Steph trying to stop his other friend the unemployed Piston from selfdestruction during his breakup with wife Marie Lou. Steph eventually gets involved with Marie Lou and Charles wants more than just sex from his once childhood buddy.  We are never quite sure whether Steph is bisexual or if he simply uses the women as a way of denying his homosexual nature. That plot remains unresolved as does the relationships in the film. But that is the point the town goes nowhere and the characters go nowhere. Still nowhere remains utterly transporting.Reviewer notes  French subtitled.

	schema:reviewBody "Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern is wonderfully shot and acted and needs not to shy from comparisons to other contemporary works just to mention Werner Herzogs or Herbert Achternbuschs films which often take place in a similar environment. But rather than discussing the film and its qualities I would like to discuss the social and cultural implications. Much has been said about Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern being a metaphor for the fascism under the Third Reich the butchering of the unwanted in the concentration camps etc. All this is true and intended by the director but if you take those metaphors and allegories away you'd still have a very precise portrayal of rural live in the Bavarian countryside.If you want to compare Bavaria to Germany you could think of Italy and the difference between Milano and a Sicilian hamlet. Or think about the States and the cultural differences between Boston and an Appalachian mountainvillage you should get the point.If you should ever visit Germany going south and crossing the Weiwurstquator or WhiteSausageequator an imaginary border that divides Bavaria from the rest of Germany you'll notice that you're indeed in another country. Cuisine language fashion indeed physically things are very different in the freestate. People in those areas are proud to be the most traditional if not tribal of all German states or down to earth as they frequently put it. Bavarians from the small villages and hamlets will often joke that the Autobahn is the only reason that saved those villages from degenerative inbreeding and refer to any outsiders  nonBavarians as Prussians. Bavarians will often declare that they are a monarchy despite the last king having been declared insane and committed suicide more than a hundred years ago. They'll likely point out that Bavaria is a freestate which is correct albeit purely symbolic and without political consequences. This is meant as a tongueincheek joke usually told with a wink of the eye. But once you've spent more time in those parts you'll notice that the joke only paperthin and that yes these people actually mean it.The film and the play upon which it is based also refers to the Bavarian tradition of Haberfeldtreiben which is a symbolic lynching during those occasions the mob generally the whole village will gather in front of the house of an undesired person usually people who have broken a taboo or against the moral standards of the village unmarried mothers liberals often intellectuals or the rich in more recent times homosexuals and people afflicted with AIDS. The villagers would recite the crimes of the target sometimes in the forms of rhymes and accompany the recitals by making as much noise as possible. Unlike in a real trial the delinquents are not given the chance to justify or defend themselves. Bavarians are quick to point out that other than to the dignity of the offender no physical damage is done during the Haberfeldtreiben  which is only partly true since there have been many such events recorded which ended in violence lynching and death. The last officially reported Haberfeldtreiben took place in 2009.In essence Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern is a look at an archaic culture deeply rooted in the 18th and 19th century which in many ways is backward stuck in outdated ways of thinking and very proud of it. Needless to say that there was much outrage in the south when this film was released. People were quick to point out that director Fleischmann depicted most of the villagers as stereotypical  which is perhaps true but not to much the fault of the director as the fault of the stereotypes themselves. In other words it wasn't the dignified outrage of people who felt that they were being lampooned unjustified but rather the outrage of people who were shown a mirror and weren't comfortable with the reflection.As for the film it is a piece of art and highly recommendable to anybody who wishes to look a little deeper into the Bavarian psyche beyond touristattractions like the castles of King Ludwig II and the bucketsized beermugs at the Oktoberfest.710".

The last officially reported Haberfeldtreiben took place in 2009.In essence Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern is a look at an archaic culture deeply rooted in the 18th and 19th century which in many ways is backward stuck in outdated ways of thinking and very proud of it. Needless to say that there was much outrage in the south when this film was released. People were quick to point out that director Fleischmann depicted most of the villagers as stereotypical  which is perhaps true but not to much the fault of the director as the fault of the stereotypes themselves. In other words it wasn't the dignified outrage of people who felt that they were being lampooned unjustified but rather the outrage of people who were shown a mirror and weren't comfortable with the reflection.As for the film it is a piece of art and highly recommendable to anybody who wishes to look a little deeper into the Bavarian psyche beyond touristattractions like the castles of King Ludwig II and the bucketsized beermugs at the Oktoberfest.710";

	schema:reviewBody "Jagdszenen aus Niederbayern or Hunting Scenes from Bavaria is a West German film from 1969 so this one will have its 50th anniversary soon. It is still in blackandwhite which was not too common anymore for the late 1960s and it runs for 1965. The writer and director is Peter Fleischmann and this is certainly among his most known works today even if it is far from famous. The man who wrote the play that Fleischmann adapted was Martin Sperr and Sperr also plays the main character in here. He received a German Film Award nomination like basically everybody else from this film that played a character with an impact on the story. Six acting nominations has to be a record with the German Film Academy. Lets take a look at the story now. This is the tale of a man who returns to his village and tries to get integrated again but doubts among the other villagers about the man's alleged? homosexuality make things truly complicated. For 1969 this was really a brave subject I must say and I applaud the makers for this approach. Sadly I cannot say I enjoyed the watch beyond this progressive idea. The acting was not half as good as I expected looking at the awards attention and same can be said about the film itself. The last 1520 minutes were pretty spectacular and I suppose the fact how they stayed in mind is the reason why many people rated this so highly on IMDb but these last minutes were not good enough to sit through everything before. The first hour of the film drags quite a bit. And lets be honest about the ending here. I personally did not think his act of violence made sense in terms of how he was depicted before. Yes he was insecure about himself and sometimes reactions don't make sense especially if they happen in the heat of the moment but it just did not fact the character at all in my opinion. This was not a good film at all. It is uninteresting for the most part and finally offers realism for shock elements. I give it a thumbsdown.".

The two young daughters 6 and 8 are delightful and seem much wiser than their mother who loves them dearly but is somewhat overwhelmed by the world around her.Perhaps it was the sound system but my American ears missed some of the British dialog and I wished I was watching it on videotape so that I could rewind and hear some of it again.  Also some of the editing seemed disjointed and episodic rather than a smooth flow.  However I loved the cinematography the setting the realistic portrayal of Morocco. Casting was more than excellent especially the two young actresses who played the daughters.  Much of the story is told from the children's point of view which added dimension and insight.There's a romance between Julia and a charismatic street acrobat played by a hunk of an actor named Said Taghaoui who also works at a quarry doing hard physical labor.  We get a serious glimpse into his character and his world.  One great thing about the film is that the story moves along with twists and turns and at the same time there are culture clashes and explorations of responsibility escapism and common sense.   Always there is a sense of tension and a constant concern for the children.The movie portrays a time and place and mindset that has a sense of authenticity.

The scenery was beautiful and the story was a poignant journey into the life of a young family uprooted from their London home to travel to the Moroccan countryside.  As the final scene ended and the credits began I remember sighing with enjoyment and satisfaction at an hour and a half of viewing pleasure.While the movie will not appeal to everyone I must say that it is nice to sit and watch a simple film that is not bursting with gore nudity and profanity for a change.A surprise treat!".

The scenery was beautiful and the story was a poignant journey into the life of a young family uprooted from their London home to travel to the Moroccan countryside.  As the final scene ended and the credits began I remember sighing with enjoyment and satisfaction at an hour and a half of viewing pleasure.While the movie will not appeal to everyone I must say that it is nice to sit and watch a simple film that is not bursting with gore nudity and profanity for a change.A surprise treat!";

The first is that it should take me some place that I have never been not just a strange location but a perspective with exotic causalities. It should be deeply selfreferential in that the form of the cinematic vision should convey as much or more than the story.' The images must captivate and flow and a significant part of that is the image presented by the actors.What stance they present is up to them whether they charm or amuse or tease. But it must show deliberation and be consonant with the whole. My absolutely perfect film will be intelligent and deal with some great ideas rather than fey emotions but it is nearly good enough to be competently transported.This is a nearly perfect film. It takes us to an era that some of us remember fondly but placed in a warm sensuous Morocco. What's so strange here is the film has a superstar newly from Titanic' but she is there primarily to walk us through the environment. This is an expertly architectural film. Not arty so much as giving a presence an enclosure that sometimes contrasts with an unsheltering sky.It is deeply selfreferentially wrapped it has no goal just an opportunistic drift. Nothing is resolved nothing illuminated no moral imparted. Just as it really was  a large part of the transportation is to remove us from the need for linear narrative. Thankfully this is not hammered home by the slight references to sufism.These three Kate and the two girls are absolutely endearing. So without guile. It is a dangerous type of acting to act so open  you need to be bigger than the part which means more open than this totally open Julia. Small wonder Kate fell in love on the set. She is surely one of the best film actresses alive. It is especially appealing she chose this path plus Holy Smoke' which can be seen as a companion film.I wonder about how small children can act so. Bigger mystery than any special effect I've encountered  the magic is greater. Makes the viewing somewhat dangerous if you yourself choose to be open.The only flaw is that this is not about any great idea. But the strange thing is that it is about something we believed in the seed of our souls to be important at the time. Richie Havens!A nearly perfect film.".

	schema:headline " A Refreshing And Responsible Film About An Unconventional Encounter Between European and Arab";
	schema:reviewBody "Hideous Kinky is based on the semiautobiographical novel by Esther Freud descended from a certain Swiss Psychiatrist. The film set in the 1960's follows Julia a young English mother with her small children Bea and Lucy recently divorced from her creative and philandering husband. She is in Morocco like many young Europeans inspired by the counterculture philosophy of the time to explore herself with respect to its eastern philosophy and culture.It would be so easy for a film with such a subject to fall into the trap of using the 'orient' as merely a backdrop to depict fun backpackers engaging in pseudospiritual experiments. Or on the other hand take a more malevolent track of exploiting the bad feeling between Europeans and Arabs by having the bright young Julia encounter the traditional savage womanhating Arab as depicted in most western films and pioneered by Valentino in Hollywood's silent classic The Sheik 1921.However Hideous Kinky is refreshing as it is fun and 'exotic' but does not compromise in its sense of responsibility. It attempts to show an intelligent though wayward young mother with the genuine desire to explore her self internally and captures the richness and humanity of the country and its people around her exhibiting their interesting religious life and culture.The feel of place in the film is astonishing. Marrakech with the narrow streets and courtyards of its old town dark and forbidding but also revealing wonder and the surrounding desert are filmed deliciously with ambition and assurance. Julia as well as being part of the 'drop out' European expat community finds herself accessing different strands of Moroccan society the common society of Morocco via her relationship with Bilal a shady character who turns out to be a convict played wonderfully by Said Taghmaoui and the higher rungs via her exhusband's friend Santoni.Central to the film and what also complicates it giving it an added new dimension is Julia's relationship with her two children played astoundingly well by Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan. They in turn have their own incredible experiences good and bad as shown by their delightful but confused sayings. Julia unusually in film is a complex female character with many shades. She is nave foolish and irresponsible. At one point she even manages to lose one of her daughters. But she is also smart soulful and canny and from her time in Morrocco Julia does gain an insight into her self but it is not the insight that she expected and perhaps it is a genuine insight for that reason. She is played by Kate Winslet with characteristic heart and intelligence and a brave choice as she had just come off the safety of the glitzy but vacuous blockbuster Titanic.Hideous Kinky is a rare thing despite being government financed usually the kiss of death for a British film it is a refreshing and responsible film about an unconventional encounter between European and Arab.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of two young girls and their mother who leave London to live in Morocco to allow their mother Julia to discover herself.  Once there they find many things ranging from love happiness to poverty and loss against the backdrop of Morocco.This is an interesting film that I must admit I did have high hopes for. All I heard about this was good with critics praising it pretty roundly. The story itself is pretty thin.  It is not exactly linear as it focuses on experiences rather than a straight series of happenings.  The effect of this to me was to make the film feel rambling and that it wasn't going anywhere  it certainly felt longer than it's 90 minute run time.  The adventures for want of a better word are very interesting and sometimes moving but they do give the impression that the film wants to give the audience a feeling or an experience rather than a story.Visually the film is beautiful and Morocco is well shot  both breathtaking landscapes and realistic scenes of poverty but this doesn't make up for the lack of story.  Some people may feel that the scenery is enough to watch the film for but not me.  The acting is also faultless  Riza and Mullan are excellent as Bea and Lucy while Winslet is also strong as Julia.  The main problem with the story is that it is quite focused on Julia and she is such a selfish unpleasant character at times that it makes it hard to stay with her all the time.  I didn't feel that I could learn anything from her travels and at times I was just amazed that such a spoilt Westerner would just act in such a way as to hurt her daughters either directly or indirectly.  The daughters were great characters and were worthy of all the interest and sympathy that the script gives them.  But Winslet's character is a major turnoff.Overall it looks great with great performances.  But the lack of a coherent story or message is a bit frustrating and can make it feel a bit aimless.".

	schema:headline " The best movie about the sixties counter culture so far";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie addresses the search for spiritual meaning that propelled thousands of western hippies to North Africa and India in the late sixties and early seventies. Although the braindead hippie stereotypes are there often with comedic effect the narration follows Julie a single mother played aptly by Kate Winslet and her two young daughters on a quest for transcendental knowledge around Marrakech Morocco and the nearby villages. Although this is not Winslet's strongest performance see Hamlet or Quillsher craftsmanship is superb in conveying the emotional turmoil that follows the trail of her character. Is Julie merely escaping from the drudgery of a cold water flat and a fourteen hour workday day in South London or is she on a serious path to spiritual awakening? Is she exposing her children to undue danger in a strange land or is she leading them on the adventure of a lifetime? Has she found the love of her life and a surrogate father for her daughers or has she thrust them into the hands of a polygamist bandit?The story does not take the easy way out and answer these questionswe do admire Julie's strength of character in coping with them but rather twists on a few epiphanies experienced by her children. Winslet  brings out the best in the children actors that play daughters Bea and Kate and Assiz a delightful steetwise Morrocan youth. As the movie opens the daughters beg Julie to return to London and to their father a well known writer and poet who is maintaining a second family and a son in Kensington. Julie meets and starts a love affair with Belal a Morrocan street performer and acrobat. The daughters beg for his acceptance but doubt his loyalty when out of desparation and out of money he takes them to the village of his family. The villagers welcome them warmly and throw flower petals over them but the scene is clouded by the presence of a woman who may be Belal's estranged wife.Julie returns to Marrakech to find long overdue money has arrived from the father in London. Julie can finally make the pilgramage to the Sufi Sheik her heart's desire all along but daughter Bea tired of turmoil and lack of security  asks to be left behind in Marrakech in the house of welltodo friends. When Julie meets her Sheik a marvelously acted scene takes place where the Sheik by asking simple earnest questions in a kindly manner draws out of Julie the realisation that her real purpose is to care for her daughters. Although she no longer fears death herself she must face the more awesome fear of loosing her children. Julie returns to Marrakech to find Bea abandoned to the streets. A mother's worst nightmare comes true when Bea becomes deathly ill. Only taking Bea home to London can save her but there is no money for the trip.Julie makes the sacrifice of giving up the spiritual life for the sake of her daughters but unexpectedly it is Belal who makes the sacrifice that opens Bea's heart to Morroco.The film is edited with a breakneck speed that conveys the exotic and strange experience of the young girls in Morroco. If the movie has a weakness it is that it did not slow down and linger as the the love between Julie and Belal blossomed. In the end we are left with hope. We hope that in the director's cut unseen footage can be ressurected to give dramatic depth where it is needed. We hope Belal is not caught by the authorities we hope somehow he and Julie can continue their love relation and we hope that Bea returns to Morroco and is once again welcomed by village women throwing flower petals over her. Imshalla.".

Many things about it are good and all the performances are quite strong again including Ms. Winslet's.But I didn't enjoy it.  I'm all for long slow understated movies but this one didn't make the grade.  I suspect the problem was either the direction or the editing  I'm not sure which.  Permit me to explainMovies that have a leisurely pace need to allow their events to breathe by surrounding more dynamic moments if you will with more tranquil ones. Any of the better MerchantIvory films will provide an excellent example of this.  This movie however suffers from being perpetually caught between calming down and taking wing.  There's not enough happening to make it exciting in a momenttomoment way but there's too much happening to give one the same sense of scale that one gets in a true leisurely masterpiece.  Sometimes it's the soundtrack which gets a bit much in places sometimes it's the direction sometimes it's something one can't quite put one's finger on.  To put it differently I don't think the film ever finds its rhythm and as a result the problems with the narrative and character motivation become far more of an issue than they would have been had the movie been better paced.In any event throughout the entire movie something is amiss and it's never put quite right.  As a result what could have been a great movie comes out muddled and jumbled and leaves one feeling oddly unsatisfied and apathetic.".

A great performance was also given by Said Taghmaoui who plays a local acrobat Julia's lover the daughter's father figure and somewhat mysterious and confused young man. Morocco with its marketplace scenes people and customs architecture and desert give the film an omnipresent exotic feeling.  A soundtrack that includes local traditional music and dissident rock music of the era America and Jefferson Airplane are two I can remember fit seamlessly.

	schema:headline " Powerful movie great individual performances a few flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "The trio of Jake Gyllenhaal Tobey Macguire and Natalie Portman got me very excited for this film and from an acting standpoint they did not disappoint. The script gives Macguire the most to work with as the family manMarine Sam Cahill whose latest trip to Afghanistan sees him imprisoned by the Taliban and ultimately returned to America with some serious psychological issues. While he is MIA his wife Grace Portman and excon brother Tommy Gyllenhaal are told he is dead and the two grow closer eventually verging on emotional and physical attachment.Ultimately the movie is an emotional ringer. Sam returns to a family that wants to love him but his walls are up he's been through a lot and its his brother the fun loving Uncle Tommy who Sam's children want to play with. A quick note Sheridan the director makes great use of the two daughters as comic breaks in otherwise terribly tense situations. Our theater was laughing at the kids and it felt to me as though we needed that laughter to balance out the gloom. There are a few climaxes some extremely tense family dinners and finally a final gripping scene where Sam is pushed to the brink he distrusts his wife assumes his brother is sleeping with her and no longer can see the humor in his elementary aged children can he hold on?Its a touching film and a sad film but it probably could have been a bit better. The script and title of the film suggest a big tension or interplay between the brothers. I found the brother relationship lacking in substance and I thought the ingredients for some serious tension and emotional pain were in place but were never put to use. Sam Shepard does well as the Vietnam Vet father but all he really does is establish his love for his son the Marine and his disdain for his son the excon. There was so much more that he could have done his role seems intentionally diminished. Portman is great as usual but arguably miscast as she doesn't belong cast into a film where she is not supposed to think. She's a thinking woman's actress and here she is left observing we know she knows but her character must play it clueless.I cried and wanted the story to continue as there seems to be a bit left to this story when the film fades away. Both signs that the movie was enjoyable and touching. The growth of Gyllenhaal as the excon who is on the rise adjusting to life on the outside and acting as a surrogate father in the absence of Macguire is nicely juxtaposed with Macguire's devolution into posttraumatic stress ridden torment. Watch the Oscar nods roll in but I think if anything the movie may win individual awards as the product as a whole falls quite a bit short of award winning status.".

The progression of the plot takes its time to develop but it feels organic. The characters feel real. While one could see the film as a criticism of war and the negative effects that war has on the family of veterans the film is more a characterdriven drama and doesn't touch much into politics.Admittedly the plot itself isn't anything drastically new and one may imagine a plot like this in a madeforTV drama if not for the emotional depth intensity and solid performances from Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman. One of the interesting plot points involve the brothers' father's in a fine performance from Sam Shepard favoritism for Sam while looking down on Tommy as the failure. The lovehate dynamics between the three are interesting and believable even as the two brothers go through drastic character changes.Tobey Maguire's performance is particularly noteworthy as Sam a marine and a loving husband who comes back transformed into a physically emaciated psychologicallyscarred ticking time bomb. My image of Tobey as SpiderMan now feels like a distant memory especially in comparison to what he portrays here. The two children who play the two daughters of Sam in this film give very natural performances in their varied reactions to difficult situations around them.

Ultimately her nuanced performance is the glue that holds the film together and make the other characters matter and one can't help but marvel at the maturity of her performance.Directed by Jim Sheridan The Boxer this film is a great showcase for all performances involved while portraying an engaging intense story about familial loyalty redemption and difficult relationships.

	schema:reviewBody "Brothers is something we may have seen before  if not in its original incarnation from Denmark in 2004 then The Deer Hunter  then it is something that surprises just on the vulnerability subtlety and ferocity of the actors in their roles. It's not about what the trailer pushes which is an affair between a guy Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister in law Natalie Portman while the one guy's brother Tobey Maguire is away at war. There is one scene of that but that's not really what the film is 'about' persay. It's about the personal affects of war on one man a horrific tragedy that befalls him and how he has to live with that the rest of his life specifically in front of his wife and children. Maguire's Sam says it simply towards the end Only the dead see the end of war. I have seen the end of War. How do I go on living? If I may have spoiled the message of the movie and in its own microcosm way it's as antiwar or perhaps just antitorture as it could get in modern movies it shouldn't detract from the pleasures of Brothers. This is seeing the actors Portman Gyllenhaal Sam Shephard especially Maguire fill in these characters with enough depth and passions and fears and desires and ghosts that make them more than real to us. That's not just their achievement but director Jim Sheridan's. He lets his players breathe life into characters who while not wooden or twodimensional by any stretch need that extra push as seen in David Benioff's characterizations and scenarios. Family life its fragility and it's equal amount of love and selftorment is what counts again Deer Hunter and it's this that works in the film.A word though about Tobey Maguire. I'm not the only critic pointing him out and it goes without saying he's not the only worthwhile actor in the cast there's even performances by the girls playing Sam's kids that are extraordinary. But it's the transformation that really counts. Perhaps it's noteworthy that both brothers do transform in the film as Tommy the excon goes from being a drunken nobody to stepping up to help his brother's barelyholdingittogether wife after the news that her husband is dead while Sam is in the downward spiral. It's crucial too that Sheridan shows those scenes in Afghanistan that cause Sam to change so radically as he does the way they're intercut in the athome narrative is a little uneasy one of the flaws of the film so that we see a good person shrunk down to his deepest darkest depths.When that last third comes around it's electrifying how intense Maguire can get even when he's just in his insinuating mode ala Jake LaMotta of accusing his brother of adultery. For anyone just looking at Maguire as SpiderMan's Peter Parker must give this a look to see his range indeed a double feature of Brothers and Seabiscuit will show how Maguire is one of the most underrated actors under forty in Hollywood. If the role calls for it as it does here he goes to town a youcan'tblamehim Oscar bait performance.".

Jake is really excellent as his sincere brother torn between passion and brotherly love guilt and devotion. The two young girls who play Tobey and Natalie's daughters were very impressive and are earning lots of praise.The supporting characters are less developed and the father seems to have just two states of emotion praise and admiration for his army son and disdain for the exconvict. This is the downside that I saw in Brothers that it tended to oversimplify many issues and too often contented itself with merely scratching the surface. For instance though I have never been in a war so I cannot say for sure the Taliban scenes seemed fake to me.Loyalty love faithfulness duty pain grief sorrow joy.

	schema:headline " A Teen Remake of Brdre";
	schema:reviewBody "The family man Marine Captain Sam Cahil Tobey Maguire is happily married with his beloved Grace Natalie Portman and adores his two daughters Isabelle Bailee Madison and Maggie Taylor Geare. His younger brother Tommy Jake Gyllenhaal has just left prison on probation for bank robbery and has issues with his father Hank Sam Shepard. Grace does not like him either but Sam invites Tommy to have dinner at home with their family. When Sam is sent back to Afghanistan his helicopter crashes and he is considered missing in action and presumed dead. However he is captured with friend Private Joe Willis Patrick Flueger and they are submitted to all sort of tortures culminating with Sam killing Joe with a bar. Meanwhile Tommy comforts Grace and the children and he becomes close to Sam's family. When Sam is rescued by the American soldiers he comes back home completely paranoid psychotic introspective and without feeling or affection for his family. Further he is convinced that Grace and Tommy have had sex during his absence. When Isabelle lies during a family dinner about the relationship of Grace and Tommy to upset her father the disturbed Sam triggers an intense paranoia jeopardizing his family Tommy and himself. Brothers is a powerful drama about family dynamics destroyed by war. I discover that this good movie is based on Susanne Bier's Brdre that I have not seen yet. Jim Sheridan shows again his ability to work with children the same way he did in In America and the girls Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare have awesome performances. Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman Jake Gyllenhaal and Sam Shepard have topnotch performances giving credibility to the story. Now I expect to see the original Danish movie to compare with the American version. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Entre Irmos Between BrothersRevised review after watching BrdreBrothers is actually a teen remake of Brdre. Tobey Maguire is completely miscast in the role of a marine captain despite his great performance. In the original movie Ulrich Thomsen is a mature man with face of man in the role of a major and not a babyface in the role of a captain. Jim Sheridan filmed practically frame by frame the film of Susanne Bier but replacing adult and realistic situations with shallow trivializations to adequate the story to the American society. In his version just as an example Grace and Tommy smoke marijuana when they kiss each other instead of the emotional situation of the original story. Or the motive why Sam is forced by his captors to kill Joe Willis in the Afghan camp. The open conclusion in the original movie is another plus. The impact of Brothers is totally different for those that have not seen Brdre My vote is six.".

Meanwhile Tommy comforts Grace and the children and he becomes close to Sam's family. When Sam is rescued by the American soldiers he comes back home completely paranoid psychotic introspective and without feeling or affection for his family. Further he is convinced that Grace and Tommy have had sex during his absence. When Isabelle lies during a family dinner about the relationship of Grace and Tommy to upset her father the disturbed Sam triggers an intense paranoia jeopardizing his family Tommy and himself. Brothers is a powerful drama about family dynamics destroyed by war. I discover that this good movie is based on Susanne Bier's Brdre that I have not seen yet. Jim Sheridan shows again his ability to work with children the same way he did in In America and the girls Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare have awesome performances. Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman Jake Gyllenhaal and Sam Shepard have topnotch performances giving credibility to the story. Now I expect to see the original Danish movie to compare with the American version. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Entre Irmos Between BrothersRevised review after watching BrdreBrothers is actually a teen remake of Brdre. Tobey Maguire is completely miscast in the role of a marine captain despite his great performance. In the original movie Ulrich Thomsen is a mature man with face of man in the role of a major and not a babyface in the role of a captain. Jim Sheridan filmed practically frame by frame the film of Susanne Bier but replacing adult and realistic situations with shallow trivializations to adequate the story to the American society. In his version just as an example Grace and Tommy smoke marijuana when they kiss each other instead of the emotional situation of the original story. Or the motive why Sam is forced by his captors to kill Joe Willis in the Afghan camp. The open conclusion in the original movie is another plus. The impact of Brothers is totally different for those that have not seen Brdre My vote is six.";

	schema:reviewBody "Brothers is a decent movie showing the trauma both a soldier and his family face due to Tobey Maguire's job as a marine. Although the script could have been improved and more drama could have been added throughout the movie the actors in Brothers deliver superbly.Tobey Maguire is rumored to be mentioned at the Oscars and his performance probably deserves it especially during his break down scene. Natalie Portman as the wife and Sam Shepard acting as the father also deliver plausible and emotional performances. Carey Mulligain who I almost did not recognise plays a cameo role and Clifton Collins Jnr also makes a brief appearance.If you haven't watched the trailer for this film do not watch it as it gives much away. Also do not read about this movie much before you watch it either. The less you know about Brothers the better its plot will unfold.I also must point out that although Tobey Maguire is the one with the Golden Globe nomination and rumoured Oscar nomination Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a much more subtle and on the whole a better performance than Tobey. He seemed to connect me more to his character with some comedic lines gentle eyes and genuine acts of redemption. I rate Brothers one star higher because of Jake and if it were up to me he'd get a supporting actor nomination.Don't expect a masterpiece like The Deer Hunter but if you're looking for some new depressive entertainment then Brothers is a good flick...It had potential and it delivered on most of it however some potential was also left unaccounted for.".

	schema:headline " a generally faithful remake of the Danish original";
	schema:reviewBody "Brothers is an American remake of an excellent Danish drama from 2004. As the title suggests the story centers on two male siblings who are essentially polar opposites of one another. Sam Tobey Maguire is an upright family man and lifelong Marine who has already served one tour in Afghanistan and is all set to embark on a second. Tommy Jake Gyllenhaal is a ne'erdowell excon who's released from prison on the very same week Sam is being redeployed to the battlefield leaving a wife Natalie Portman and two young daughters the delightful Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare behind at home. When news comes that Sam has been killed in a helicopter crash Tommy is there to help pick up the pieces leading to some potential romantic complications between him and his brother's grieving widow Grace. But that turns out to be only half the story as anyone familiar with the Danish version already knows.Written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan Brothers follows the original fairly closely in terms of outline and incident focusing on one man's attempts to turn his life around after making a mess of things and another's efforts to come to terms with an action he performed under duress that his conscience will clearly never allow him to live with. The complex relationships among the three principal players  along with Sam's PostTraumatic Stress Disorder  are dealt with in an adult and thoughtful fashion with a minimum of melodrama and nary a hint of sensationalism. The conflicts are further exacerbated by the men's father Sam Shepherd a hardnosed Vietnam vet whose personal preference for Sam over Tommy has been evident to both boys from very early on in their lives.Brothers reveals its European roots in its more deliberate pacing its emotional complexity its lack of judgment towards its characters and its willingness to leave some loose ends hanging at the end. Maguire and Gyllenhaal are both excellent as the two torn brothers trying to stay close despite their differences  as are Portman Shepherd and Mare Winningham as the boys' loving and conciliatory step mom whose calming influence over her husband goes a long way towards ameliorating some otherwise potentially volatile situations.".

	schema:reviewBody "CAUTION Possible spoilers The Irish director Jim Sheridan knows how to tell a story My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father and he makes good use of his talents in this remake of a Danish Dogme style film Brode originally directed by Suzanne Bier. The story here is of two brothers one an upright and uptight soldier in the Marine core Tobey Macguire the other a shiftless excon Jake Gyllenhaal whose relationship is altered for the better after the soldier suffers trauma in Afghanistan. At first Tobey is reported killed and Jake almost without thinking about it moves to take his place. Then when Tobey turns up having had his mind seriously messed with by the Taliban Jake helps him through some pretty bad moments. Jake gets close to both Tobey's perky children and his improbably beautiful wife Natalie Portman but he manages to stay out of her bed.Their crusty old ex Marine father played by Sam Shepherd with his constant putdowns of Jake and uncritical admiration of Tobey is clearly part of Jake's problem. Ultimately though the brothers have to work things out between themselves.The story is well put together though some of the Afghanistan scenes were rather awkwardly intercut with the action back home. Jim Sheridan doesn't examine the right and wrongs of the US being in Afghanistan except to have a Taliban translator tell Tobey you shouldn't be in our country. That might be a nobrainer as far as Iraq is concerned but Afghanistan is a different case  for that matter Mohammed Atta and his friends shouldn't have been in the US on 911. Anyway Sheridan is more interested in the personal story of the brothers and he tells this in absorbing fashion.Tobey and Jake are fine as the brothers and Natalie Portman puts in a good performance as Tobey's wife as do Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare as her two young daughters. I thought the story was set in Minnesota but it seems location filming was done in New Mexico where it also snows in winter but is not quite so cold. I haven't seen the Danish film but this version stands up well on its own is likely to have better production values and of course it is more accessible to an American audience.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Brothers";
	schema:reviewBody "A remake of the Danish film Brodre what this version boasts is the star presence of Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as the titular brothers Sam and Tommy Cahill with Natalie Portman starring as the former's wife Grace in what would be some powerful dramatic performances delivered by all three actors in a story that deals with the pain of loss the exhilaration of purpose love and family and the confusion that comes when jealousy starts to creep in a relationship no thanks to the presence of another man in one's home.Tobey Maguire plays Captain Sam Cahill who is bidding his family of wife Grace and kids Isabelle Bailee Madison and Maggie Taylor Geare farewell before he ships out for his tour of duty in Afghanistan. A well respected Marine he's actually looking forward to this return to the war zone talk about that addiction to war last seen in The Hurt Locker to fulfil his belief in the fight for freedom to keep America safe and is the pride of his parents Hank Sam Shepard and Elsie Mare Winningham as compared to his good for nothing brother Tommy who's just released from prison and bumming around to find what he could do when he's out in society.Then comes the tragic news that Sam's Blackhawk helicopter went crashing down into a river and the devastation that event had on the surviving family members. This of course provided director Jim Sheridan to cover some pseudoAfghanistan war scenes and making some statements about the war on terror but also allowed for Portman and Shepard to showcase their acting chops in particular Portman as you can feel that level of pain with the sudden cutting short of a young person's life and of course the reverse when excellent unbelievable news came her way.Brothers is an excellent character study piece which both Maguire and Gyllenhaal fleshed out their roles in stark contrast toward each other and the drawing of parallels in their characters as the film progressed. One's calm and collected but affected by recent experiences in guilt and blame to finally explode in Bale Out style while the other's laissezfaire approach to life suddenly found some purpose when he subconsciously took it upon himself to look after his brother's family so much so that it borders extremely close to that of being a surrogate husband and substitute father figure yet endearing himself to the family as he grows into a better likable person. It is this constant tense will he or won't he questioning that will keep you engaged in the film and then again with the pivotal turning point that will introduce elements of jealousy and needless suspicion into a relationship.There are plenty of memorable scenes in this film which I thought made it stand out amongst the crowd. One involves all the principal characters gathering over the dinner table in conversation and the dynamics of everything and I mean everything was magic from how the scene was shot edited and especially down to the roles that the kids play with kids Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare almost always stealing the thunder from the veteran actors with their antics. Granted that the assumption of death and how it screws up a relationship is nothing new heck even Michael Bay found time to squeeze it into his action packed Pearl Harbor it boiled down to the excellent performances all round to deliver an emotionally powerful film. You'll feel that intense fury and worry when the film hits its crescendo and for that alone it's worth the price of an admission ticket. Highly recommended!".

A well respected Marine he's actually looking forward to this return to the war zone talk about that addiction to war last seen in The Hurt Locker to fulfil his belief in the fight for freedom to keep America safe and is the pride of his parents Hank Sam Shepard and Elsie Mare Winningham as compared to his good for nothing brother Tommy who's just released from prison and bumming around to find what he could do when he's out in society.Then comes the tragic news that Sam's Blackhawk helicopter went crashing down into a river and the devastation that event had on the surviving family members. This of course provided director Jim Sheridan to cover some pseudoAfghanistan war scenes and making some statements about the war on terror but also allowed for Portman and Shepard to showcase their acting chops in particular Portman as you can feel that level of pain with the sudden cutting short of a young person's life and of course the reverse when excellent unbelievable news came her way.Brothers is an excellent character study piece which both Maguire and Gyllenhaal fleshed out their roles in stark contrast toward each other and the drawing of parallels in their characters as the film progressed. One's calm and collected but affected by recent experiences in guilt and blame to finally explode in Bale Out style while the other's laissezfaire approach to life suddenly found some purpose when he subconsciously took it upon himself to look after his brother's family so much so that it borders extremely close to that of being a surrogate husband and substitute father figure yet endearing himself to the family as he grows into a better likable person. It is this constant tense will he or won't he questioning that will keep you engaged in the film and then again with the pivotal turning point that will introduce elements of jealousy and needless suspicion into a relationship.There are plenty of memorable scenes in this film which I thought made it stand out amongst the crowd. One involves all the principal characters gathering over the dinner table in conversation and the dynamics of everything and I mean everything was magic from how the scene was shot edited and especially down to the roles that the kids play with kids Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare almost always stealing the thunder from the veteran actors with their antics. Granted that the assumption of death and how it screws up a relationship is nothing new heck even Michael Bay found time to squeeze it into his action packed Pearl Harbor it boiled down to the excellent performances all round to deliver an emotionally powerful film. You'll feel that intense fury and worry when the film hits its crescendo and for that alone it's worth the price of an admission ticket. Highly recommended!";

Connie Neilsen was stunning as the wife Nikolas Lie Kaaj was good as the brother and Ulrich Thomsen fitted the role of the Captain like a glove  mature grave and upon his return with a sense of foreboding. In this remake Natalie Portman is superb while Jake Gyllenhaal Sam Shepard and the 2 kids are all excellent. But Tobey Maguire is no Ulrich Thomsen. It's not that he's a bad actor it's just that casting him as Captain Cahill of the Marines was akin to picking Russell Crowe to play Rudolph Nureyev in the film version of Swan Lake.The other aspect in which seeing the Danish version first somewhat spoiled the remake was that a number of scenes were changed some in only minor ways but none for the better  the killing the rescue the postrescue debriefing and counselling omitted here the visit of the Captain to the private's wife and son. Most of all in the Danish film the whole movie was geared towards the revelations at the end and when they came they were emotional and powerful. In this film it seems as though the producers ran out of time or out of money or out of interest. I killed him. That's it. The End. Major disappointment.Pity because it was quite a good story and quite a good film. I'd have given it 7 but that ending dumped it down to 5.".

There's no need to exaggerate.This film does exactly the same thing but in a way which is so cackhanded that logic starts to intrude into the audience's mind. And although logic doesn't make great drama it stands in the way of hyperbole with a big stick and beats it to a pulp when it matters.And the issues and emotions raised in this film DO matter.Unfortunately there are so many emotional violins playing in the background that the sweeping orchestral piece that this film could have been is simply drowned out. Someone somewhere needs to ask why the title of this film was so named. The bonds between the two brothers need to be established in more than a 2 minute car journey. The history of the characters needs to compel us to empathise with them. The post traumatic stress disorder condition and the modern treatment for it Good or bad needs to be shown.Otherwise this becomes another one of those worthy but pointless tearjerking melodramas that some people love to love. See the other user comments.Personally I didn't feel any empathy for any of the cardboard cutout characters or the dialogue during the wince inducing Family round the dinner tale scenes.In short Soldier kills fellow soldier in order to survive but feels guilty and gets a bit messed up with his relationship with his wife and brother.What an amazing insight into the human soul.....Unless you are a directorscreenwriter who wants to get those heartstrings and just pull..pull..pull..........".

	schema:reviewBody "Again we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. The good and the bad son story courtesy East of Eden. The American marine hero story who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. And the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.The mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. Because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. No luck this time though as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.As the bad son never really gets to talk to his father so that conflict is never resolved properly. Apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. Now how satisfying is that.Next the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. Because he never really talks to the man under suspicion namely his own brother. So once more we're handed a loose end here.And finally the American military heroism hypocrisy theme where the marine is publicly considered a hero when due to the dirtiness of war he went through he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards that third theme falls flat just the same. Because the movie ends right when for the first time he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. Where the real story would actually begin at that very point namely his process of recovery how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. All that all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.So while story wise this film is a serious and I mean serious disappointment I'd still give it points for the impressive cast. Although no film should use Maguire for a voice over because that belongs to Spiderman. Especially a grown up Gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. So much that I'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.So while the cast really seems to do what they can I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. A shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. Message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of Vietnam films. You want to earn some credit show us a believable healing.".

So much that I'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.So while the cast really seems to do what they can I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. A shallow and ultimately pretentious utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. Message du jour to the writers we know the wounds already see the host of Vietnam films. You want to earn some credit show us a believable healing.";

	schema:headline " A touching movie about the true meaning of brotherly love.";
	schema:reviewBody "Brothers is the 2nd War themed movie of 2009 to emphasize the human psyche over guts and glory. Where Mel Gibson's We Were Soldiers faltered at bringing home the sense of loss and devastation that the wives and mothers endure during wartime Jim Sheridan nails it by keeping it personal in this film. There are no glorious shootouts or supermen taking out hundreds with a pistol through a hailstorm of shrapnel. What we get is the premise of loyalty bravery and sacrifice through soldier and civilian alike in a powerful drama appropriately named for the love between Tommy and Sam.It strategically starts with a contrast to play on our assumptions. The sharp dedicated and disciplined soldier in Sam Cahill swings by the jailhouse to pick up his tattooed wisecracking drunk of a brother in Tommy. The two don't say much as they drive home to reunite with family but the tiny exchanges and generally awesome acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Toby Maguire gives you the feeling that these two are very close. Ultimately it is all that is needed for the audience so when the hardened military father comes down on his failure of a son Tommy it isn't surprising that it's his good son the war hero Sam that bridges the rift between the two. The beautiful and talented Natalie Portman plays the part of Sam's wife Grace a mother to 2 cute daughters in Isabelle Bailie Madison and her younger sister Maggie Taylor Geare. The kids are smart and Isabelle especially is beyond her years they are saddened upon hearing that their dad is to be deployed but it all dissipates when he tucks them into bed lovingly. It is the setup for the meat and potatoes of Brothers when Sam becomes a prisoner of war assumed dead and his brother Tommy is there to pick up the broken pieces at home with his family.Jake Gyllenhaal and Toby Maguire really show their acting chops throughout this story. The awkward familiarity of the misunderstood badboy that is Tommy was as believable as the calm zenlike monk of a soldier that is Sam. The chemistry was cooking whenever they shared a scene and between the similarity of their looks and the dramatic situations that they played out I found myself fully immersed into their struggles to cope. The father played by Sam Shepard was equally impressive as the old battered war vet Portman as the strong wife and her children who were given much camera time played their respective roles convincingly.Brothers is real drama and though there are a few supporting characters it never veers away from the core family. With the movie taking place in 2007 and our recent push into Afghanistan the relevance will be there for a lot of people who have loved ones in action or soon to be. I cannot use the word Oscar bait for Brothers though the release date and heavy drama may lead one to feel this way. What I found Brothers to be was a beautiful drama with tones as heavy as any other well written movie that I can think of. Toby Maguire must have put his body through hell to look the way he does on this movie  rail thin crazed and sickly. For me Brothers was a salute to acting good story and the power to evoke emotion from an audience. Great dialogue a few twists and turns along with a decent score  the things that make me love the theater. If you haven't seen this yet I really encourage you to get out and see it you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "After an Afghanistan mission gone awry Captain Sam Cahill Tobey Maguire is captured by enemy Taliban forces while the US Army believes him dead. Back home Grace Natalie Portman tries to cope with the loss of her husband and ease the pain it brought about to her two girls Isabelle Bailee Madison and Maggie Taylor Geare. While Sam's brother exconvict Tommy Jake Gyllenhaal decides to comfort Grace slowly and unintentionally the two fall for each other. After Sam is recovered from capture the wouldbe widow and the prodigal son must now cope with the conflicting feelings as well as the remnants of a man that returned from Afghanistan.Brothers is extremely poorly scripted so having not seen the original version it is hard to place blame on either Bier or Benioff as to where the responsibility lies. However certain similarities between this movie and Haevnen seem to point to culpability on both persons. As in the Oscar winning Haevnen foreign countries are used instrumentally as a plot device nurturing all the worst stereotypes necessary in order to deliver some context for what happens in the 'civilized world'. This in itself is pretty appalling with Afghans unanimously portrayed as spineless despicable torturers and murderers just so that Sam can have appropriate trauma after returning to the States. This essentially cause the whole foreign content of the movie to be tiresome obtrusive and severely flawed while at the same time not visibly most scenes not serving much purpose the whole captured events are overdrawn and pointless and could have been sufficiently supplanted with onetwo nicely constructed scenes.What goes on in the States is an equally frustrating watch with trivial and shallow interactions predominant so despite best intentions by Gyllenhaal and Portman the predominant soap quality of dialogue disrupt buildup. For what seems a Benioff retcon the two never actually sleep together just exchange a single kiss but still seem unable to discuss this with Sam on his return while Isabelle explicitly uses lies about sexual relations between Grace and Tommy to vent frustration. There is however still one poignant culmination scene during Maggie's birthday rife with emotions context acting dynamics and tension that makes the movie worth a watch. The promise suggested by that scene alone does also inspire to check out the original Danish movie for comparison and maybe watching a piece which actually delivers on its promise.".

Maybe my hopes were set too high as I'm a fan of a good drama suspense thriller. I recall movies like A Perfect Murder The Gift and Seven being a few standouts from years past.

It is however interesting to compare De Sica's foremost works with Maddalena... a much earlier film which has absolutely nothing to do with neorealism.Maddalena... is typical of the white telephones films that is to say upperclass melodramas and comedies that were popular in Italy before and during WWII when Mussolini wanted cinema to distract and uphold the consensus. The telefoni bianchi or white telephones pictures gently mocked upperclass convention while celebrating the triumph of the commonplace  and were so named because the characters used elegant and pricey white phones rather than the standard black ones. A stage play filmed on sets in a studio Maddalena... is a sentimental romance with a very predictable plot. De Sica plays a young Austrian businessman remember that the play was originally written in Hungarian accidentally entangled in a romantic affair with a dreamy Italian school girl Carla del Poggio  guess what happens next. The only original turn of the plot is that the complications caused by an anonymous love letter eventually bring two ! couples together. Like all white telephones films Maddalena... says nothing about actual everyday life in the Italy of 1940. While the movie has a good pacing and was obviously directed with energy there is no more than the artificial fluff you will find in most of the nice little comedies of that era. One can see De Sica's subsequent neorealist films precisely as a strong reaction to that type of cinema. After years of such conventional filmmaking he was probably yearning to give a new direction to his films either as an actor or as a director. It was nevertheless Mussolini's downfall which led to the birth of neorealism when shortage of money and cinema equipments made shootings in real locations with nonprofessional actors an imperative choice. To be fair the fake characters and phony plots of the white telephones films could only lead to a brutal change which resulted in the production of leftwing films much more in line with what was actually happening in Italian society. Maddalena... can therefore be regarded as part of a preparatory phase prior to a more creative and interesting period in De Sica's directorial career.".

So the audience shouldn't be passive while seeing some real lives going on that is the only way to feel engaged.3. The most notable advantage of the movie comes to attention right here. It is touching without bending over backwards for that purpose. You can feel connected to it and at the same time wonder where all that connection comes from. The movie does not try hard to make you feel this way It shakes your deepest emotions simply because all it has to do with is the reality of a human society and also with the real nature for that matter.4.Another important point here is Visconti doesn't let the fact that he believes in Socialism affect the reality of what he is portraying. The hammer and sickle on the wall in no way seems anything other than part of a neutral report. He reminds us of those journalists who succeed in providing us with an unbiased report regarding a massively resented dictator when we are pretty sure the journalist hates the dictator as much as we do. 5. All in all this is a great picture  of course it requires active audience who know what they want to get from the almost sheer reality pictured.".

The young 'Ntoni Valastro rebels against the economical situation of his poor family and convinces the Valastro to mortgage their simple house in the Fidania Bank in Catania to buy a fish boat of their own and never work again for the wholesalers. In a stormy day he decides to fish due to the necessity of repaying the debt to the bank however the storm destroys his boat and the dream of his family.

La Terra Trema Episodio del Mare is a heartbreaking bitter and cruel story of a family of fishermen that decides to change their poor economical situation facing the powerful exploiters. The Marxist Red Count Luchino Visconti directs and narrates this little masterpiece of the Italian NeoRealism casting nonprofessional actors and actresses actually fishermen and inhabitants of Aci Trezza. The abusive treatment of the greedy and idle wholesalers gives an idea of how workers were exploited in this period of history and the reason for the ideological fight of classes between Communism and Capitalism.

The fishermen are confronted with a buyer's monopoly of a bunch of wholesalers who give them a minimum price for their catches 'the poor always pay'. One fisherman tries to break the monopoly by creating his own business.

It sets the wholesalers the capitalists against the fishermen. When the wholesalers pool their money and buy new boats the fishermen's only choice is to sell their labor force. Now they don't even own the fish they have caught. The movie has a main message only solidarity among the laborers can be a basis for a society of free associates.Luchino Visconti was the assistant director during the shooting of the movie 'Toni' in which Jean Renoir used amateur actors. 'Toni' paints also the fate of Spanish journeymen in France. But there is an essential difference between Jean Renoir's and Luchino Visconti's movie Toni doesn't transcend the personal level of his characters their love lives while in 'La Terra Trema' the lives of the protagonists are embedded in a real general socioeconomic environment.Luchino Visconti shot a most memorable social drama maintaining throughout the movie a most impressive emotional and typically local atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "Luchino Visconti's epic on a family living in the Sicilian fishing village of Trezza the Valastros is a compelling story told with sincerity and skill and for the outsider viewing into their world it's at the least interesting and at its most heartfelt is rather affecting. Narrators Visconti and Antonio Pietrangeli themselves are outsiders to the world of dirtpoor fishermen who work their entire lives to earn pittance for the wealthy wholesalers it's based on a novel I Malavoglia translated as Ill Will by Giovanni Verga. Their narration can hint the audience member on little details that wouldn't be known from the characters however sometimes their voiceover in such a documentary style before this Visconti was among a group of directors for a documentary during world war 2 that is not listed on this site but it mentioned in the documentary My Voyage to Italy can be a little deterring as they mention certain emotions the characters are feeling that we as the audience can determine right in the eyes. The story tells of the Valastros in particular 'Ntoni an idealist who returns from fighting in the war with a much different view of the environment around him than what his elders would want to believe. Unlike his grandfather who has worked for the wholesalers and not earned and saved a cent more or less than his children he wants change in the way things are done and soon gets enough money to build his own boat and to sell his own fish. Things look optimistic until nature intervenes in destroying the boat leaving 'Ntoni without a job the wholesalers laughing at him mercilessly and little by little loosing any respect he had in the village. His other family members also get time on the screen two sisters who want to meet a man to marry and how one is at the will of God and the other is at the will of the Don of the village Don Salvatore also a brother who after losing his job becomes a smuggler bringing in cigarettes. Their stories in a pacing that may have some wondering when it will end and some wondering if it can go on longer lead up to a heartbreaking climax for each of them. I learned shortly after viewing La Terra Trema that Luchino Visconti I suppose it shouldn't have been much of a surprise considering the state Italy was in before during and after the war was a lifelong member of the Communist party despite being raised in a wealthy environment in Northern Italy. While I had a feeling there was something about the way Visconti depicted the Volostros and the nature of the people and the village that seemed for the working man but I didn't really feel that the political intonations were a crutch to the overall execution of the film. Since one of the pinpoints of neorealism is to tell things as simply as they unfold in real life no matter how downtrodden it can get the focus of the fishermen versus the wholesalers is made more as a reflection of basic good versus evil and it can appeal to those who don't want a strict tale of classes. Its humanity is what shines through and that is what should appeal to connoisseurs of neorealism and Italian filmmaking while I can't quite recommend it as much as The Bicycle Thief or Open City I can recommend it as the first film people should see if they want to know and understand the work of Visconti his operatic intonations with his players a graceful counterpart to his documentary techniques.".

We see the exploitation of the fishermen vividly and how most accept it as God's will.It also brings to mind the old joke What is the difference between capitalism and communism?

All of Visconti's actors are from the Sicilian fishing village but they were not actingjust portraying their lives. You care about these real people!Family is everythingand it survives despite the buffeting by the storms the stranglehold of the oligarchical wholesalers and shortsightedness of the townspeople.  We see the exploitation of the fishermen vividly and how most accept it as God's will.It also brings to mind the old joke What is the difference between capitalism and communism?  Capitalism is the exploitation of man by man and communism is just the reverse.";

	schema:reviewBody "Luchino Visconti was a great Italian master director who along with Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica is regarded as one of the pioneers of Italian Neorealism. 'Ossessione' was Visconti's first film and in some quarters it is hailed as the first neorealist film ever made. Whether 'Ossessione' should be considered a neorealist film or not is debatable but if ever a film epitomised the Italian neo realist experience in my mind it is 'La Terra Trema'along with a few others. It tells the story of the exploitation of the workingclass fishermen in Aci Trezza by focusing on one particular family the Valastros. There are some films where the philosophies and sensibilities of the filmmaker can be skewed to the left or maybe the right. But in the case of 'La Terra Trema' saying that Visconti's stance on the issue of the condition and the treatment of the fishermen in Aci Trezza is skewed to the left is a huge understatement. Visconti addresses the issue by showcasing a ruthlessly damning indictment of the wholesalers and the capitalist social structure as a whole and its effect on the poor and the helpless. Visconti authentically depicts the hard and brutal life led by the workingclass families who live under pressure to earn a living. They have to get up each day they men and women have to embark on a cyclical routine of mundane activities with the hope of earning the meager amount which will earn them their food for the next day. We see the wholesalers exploit the fishermen by offering them low prices for the fish that they catch putting their lives on the line. The Valastros try to break open from this neverending cycle of oppression and inadequacy by deciding to deviate from the market structure and work independently. But Visconti shows that the cruel and expensive nature of their work coupled with the all encompassing market structure will inevitably render all ambitious attempts of independence futile in the long run. The film starts in a very documentarylike manner. We start at the stroke of dawn with bells ringing in the distance. Hordes of fishermen are seen flocking towards beaches. But we don't see faces. We see these figures in the darkness of dawn walking around. One of the primary characters in the film Mara then is seen opening the door of the Valastros' house and that in a thematic sense introduces us to the characters that enrich this world. This gets juxtaposed beautifully with the shot that ends the film where the Valastros again become a part of the faceless masses. Visconti before starting to make films on his own used to work as an assistant to the great French auteur Jean Renoir and I saw Renoir's influence all over 'La Terra Trema'. The slick camera movement to reveal characters who were off screen the humanism and the imagery is heavily inspired by Renoir. Visconti uses the trademark Renoir frame within a frame composition extensively throughout the film which almost gives a 3d like feel to the images. There are so many beautiful images in the film that will stay with me. But my favourite image is the shot of the three women standing on the rocks and looking out at the sea. It is haunting evocative and gorgeous. The grand and expansive photography involved in capturing the sea and beaches gets beautifully juxtaposed by the claustrophobic nature of the shots inside the Valastros' home.The fact that Visconti used the real people of Aci Trezza in the film instead of professional actors actually lends a bit of authenticity. Yes Visconti uses visual style and flair but he never does it by compromising the human element of the film. Yes with amateurs at the helm the acting is a bit stiff at times but considering what Visconti is going for the intentions are noble and the viewer can easily look past it.My only problem with the film which prevents me from giving the film a perfect 10 involves a scene that comes close to the end of the film where the wholesalers start mocking Antonio. This is a scene where the tone gets a little too overthetop and goofy which didn't fit with the realism of the rest of the film. I think a little subtlety and sarcasm would have worked better. The relentless laughter could have been replaced by snide sarcastic remarks.'La Terra Trema' is a beautiful depiction of humanity in its most raw helpless state. Visconti attacks the capitalist system by showcasing its harsh effects on the poor. The film isn't a very hopeful one but considering the time during the which it was made the pessimism is warranted. The plight of Valastros family and Antonio in particular reminded me of the story of Icarus. In their quest for freedom from oppression they ended up flying a little too close to the sun.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I had encountered the director Luchino Visconti was when I was more and more into the Italian Neorealism the movement that can probably be considered one of the most genuine waves in European cinema. Having seen Visconti's most popular movies including IL GATTOPARDO L'OSSESSIONE LA CADUTA DEGLI DEI or MORTE A VENEZIA as well as his earlier productions I started to understand his conception of art in movie and it gradually appealed to me more. However I realized that Visconti was the aristocrat who became a member of the Communist party representing the left wing of Italian artists. Even this film made way for the Italian socialists which for me is not a very privileged information. But that is not the gist of my analysis. The most important aspect for me is the artistic side of the whole work something in terms of which we evaluate LA TERRA TREMA nowadays.LA TERRA TREMA though not a top notch Neorealist work is a film that resembles almost all the principles of Neorealism retained by the great directors Rossellini DeSica Pasolini. At the same time all of these aspects are still much appreciated and searched by many today's authors.First the cast consist of all nonprofessionals simple fishermen of Sicily where naturally everyone has the role heshe knows how to perform in real life. And how they do in the movie perfectly the whole story is very authentic thanks to them. Sometimes the performances are so well managed that you as an experienced 21st century viewer do not feel it's all acting. Moreover they feel comfortable in the locations they know so magical places of the Sicilian coast.Second the movie refers to the very realistic situations that were obvious in the Italy of that time. It was 1948 and the country was suffering the horrific consequences of WWII and the regime of Il Duce Mussolini. The tragic story of the Valastro family is something many people could empathize with at the time and moreover can still empathize nowadays. Ntonio though formerly respected member of the community Sicilian village of Acci Trezza starts to lose everything. There comes a day when he has no job is taken advantage of any time being no more respected. His brother Cola is on the verge of despair leaving the family to find a better future. Two sisters experience hardship as young women. The grandpa gets ill. The whole family is on the verge of total tragedy when they are forced to leave the house their only property. The monotonous life gets even worse turns into the life of poverty helplessness and suffering. Is there a way to live a normal life in such circumstances? Third the whole movie is a profound development of characters within these very personal stories. Ntonio is an idealist who tells his brother that his love to his hometown has kept him there and will keep him till his death We were born here and we will die here. At the same time he is easily brought to despair starts to spend the nights drinking in taverns. Cola is a youngster who respects his family but desires a better life. I'll never forget the scene he says Farewell to the picture of his family when sorrow is combined with fear and helplessness with desire. Mara is a very religious young woman who accepts sorrows and hardship claiming this all is the Will of God. The other sister Lucia is a normal girl like every other yet the tragic situation leads her to the cold acceptance of male use. The little shining necklace seems to steal her heart.Similarly to the top Neorealist movies like GERMANIA ANNO ZERO or ROMA CITTA APERTA LA TERRA TREMA focuses on individuals in the society in the community at hard times. On the one hand there are so many praying women at Valastro's house when the grandfather is being taken to Catania to hospital on the other hand the Valastro family hear very bitter words God has punished you for your pride! from the same people. It is not the ostentation but solidarity of people that leads to better future better life it is the lack of solidarity that leads to hell on earth. That is beautifully executed in Ntonio's conversation with a simple girl on the shore at his past boat I'd gladly help you... Politically and historically speaking that was the point which gave way to socialist ideas.But so far I have not touched the most significant aspect why the film is so much worth seeing. Although it is pretty long it is black and white it has the narrator that may distract some of the modern viewers LA TERRA TREMA is like a loaf of bread to the poor a wonderful gift for today's viewers who may see what a film may be like how many messages it can convey not from the political perspective only but from a simple empathy with humanity which was most precious thing about Neorealism calling for change. Although these times are gone forever and some islands of poverty turned into isles of prosperity this change is still so desirable...See this! You'll not regret and don't be discouraged by its length and documentary like style. It's worth your search! By the way one of the assistant directors of the movie was Maestro Franco Zeffirelli".

Flaherty did a much better more eloquent job on a similar desperately poor fishermen folk theme without any words used in MAN OF ARAN. The only thing I really liked about this film is the Sicilian dialect which does not contain any decipherable Italian words. Like Central and Southern Spain the Arabic influence here was very powerful and the insular culture fought a hard battle to keep its own identity not Italian and not Arabic. Not a very great film from a director who is very highly regarded but for me is not in the league with the best of Italian filmmakers.".

The story is about some poorer than dirt fishermen and their families and their desire to get out from under crippling poverty.

This film unlike great Neorealistic films like Umberto D. or General Della Rovere just wasn't involving. At the time it was made the communists were making substantial inroads in Italy and so the movie was quite timely then with its anticapitalism message.

Instead of cutting the sequence into fragments of shots by montage Visconti made use of camera panning in shifting of focus between characters. This was exemplified in scenes of conversation and when another character enters or exits the dimensions of the shot.The long takes used in this film also added to the extraction of emotions from the actors realizing that almost all of the actors are neophytes some of them are reallife Sicilian fishermen guards and villagers. Long takes are very helpful to actors since in montage the acting should be filmed as many times as the technique requires. Also parts of an actors performance are sometimes cut in order to make way to the technique which will be used. In this manner the momentum of the performance as well as the realism it may suggest is being ruled out.The primary reason for this is that the film was supposed to be Visconti's documentary on the life and industry of poor Sicilian villagers who are usually discriminated by wealthy businessmen. And as the documentarystyle is maintained the existence of long shots will obviously come into place. No montage is needed because the objective is just to film what really takes place.

	schema:reviewBody "In her latest attempt to graduate from kids TV starlet to serious Hollywood actress Miley Cyrus takes on the unlikely role of an allaction private investigator. The film is a strictly formulaic Miss CongenialityKindergarten Cop clone in which the young sleuth is recruited by the FBI for an undercover job in a posh 'n' bitchy sorority house in New Orleans. One presumes that the target audience is teenaged girls who don't care much for high quality cinema they will probably find something to enjoy in the film. Meanwhile for the rest of us the film is a long slog which manages to make 94 minutes feel more like 194 minutes.Private eye Molly Morris Miley Cyrus specialises in photographing philandering husbands cheating on their wives in the Dallas area helped by her dad Sam Mike O'Malley an excop who now dabbles in surveillance work. FBI agent Armon Jeremy Piven approaches Molly with a new assignment he needs someone to track down some ledgers that are crucial to an upcoming court case. Apparently there's a strong possibility that the ledgers are being hidden by a college student named Alex Lauren McKnight who is resident in a sorority house in New Orleans. Worse still Armon is convinced that someone in the house is not who they claim to be and plans on harming Alex if the ledgers don't materialise soon. Initially unwilling to accept the job Molly is forced to change her mind when her father's gambling spirals out of control resulting in sizable debts. She switches her identity to 'Brook Stonebridge' and goes undercover as a college student on transfer from Hawaii. The rest of the film deals with MollyBrook's escapades in the sorority house where she tries to fit in with her weird wacky and often downright airheaded sorority sisters. On the one hand she must find the ledgers and uncover the 'mole' in the house.

	onyx:emotionText "In her latest attempt to graduate from kids TV starlet to serious Hollywood actress Miley Cyrus takes on the unlikely role of an allaction private investigator. The film is a strictly formulaic Miss CongenialityKindergarten Cop clone in which the young sleuth is recruited by the FBI for an undercover job in a posh 'n' bitchy sorority house in New Orleans. One presumes that the target audience is teenaged girls who don't care much for high quality cinema they will probably find something to enjoy in the film. Meanwhile for the rest of us the film is a long slog which manages to make 94 minutes feel more like 194 minutes.Private eye Molly Morris Miley Cyrus specialises in photographing philandering husbands cheating on their wives in the Dallas area helped by her dad Sam Mike O'Malley an excop who now dabbles in surveillance work. FBI agent Armon Jeremy Piven approaches Molly with a new assignment he needs someone to track down some ledgers that are crucial to an upcoming court case. Apparently there's a strong possibility that the ledgers are being hidden by a college student named Alex Lauren McKnight who is resident in a sorority house in New Orleans. Worse still Armon is convinced that someone in the house is not who they claim to be and plans on harming Alex if the ledgers don't materialise soon. Initially unwilling to accept the job Molly is forced to change her mind when her father's gambling spirals out of control resulting in sizable debts. She switches her identity to 'Brook Stonebridge' and goes undercover as a college student on transfer from Hawaii. The rest of the film deals with MollyBrook's escapades in the sorority house where she tries to fit in with her weird wacky and often downright airheaded sorority sisters. On the one hand she must find the ledgers and uncover the 'mole' in the house. On the other she has her own blossoming romance with college biker Nicholas Joshua Bowman to contend with as well as a newfound interest in her college studies.There's little to say about So Undercover  it knows its target audience and gives them what want and expect of a film of this kind.

	schema:reviewBody "OMFG This campus comedy directtovideo movie needs to be school on how to make a successful comedy. It's because this movie is pretty mediocre. Directed by Tom Vaughan So Undercover tells the story of Molly Morris Miley Cyrus a successful private investigator who specializes in adultery cases. Gaining the respect of the FBI Molly starts working with them under Agent Armon Ranford Jeremy Piven's control. Ranford recruits her to pose as a transferring sorority sister under the name Brooke Stonebridge at a New Orleans college in order to cozy up to Alex Patrone Lauren McKnight a potential witness in an important Russian mafia investigation. Can Brooke AKA Molly protect Alex from those who are seeking to hurt her or will the criminals get what they want for her? Watch the movie to find out if you really want to! Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say Miley Cyrus's acting skills are so limited and green here. Cyrus's only previous successful work before this was playing a young singer that has a double life in the 20062011's TV show 'Hanna Montana'. Seeing how much that role mirror her reallife it's not much of a stretch in the acting field. She looks so uncomfortable with her role here as if she didn't want to do it but had to. Miley Cyrus barely had any chemistry with anybody else on screen. Her character's relationship with Nicolas Dexter Josh Bowman felt a bit forced. I really didn't see them falling in love at all. The only redeeming aspect of the movie is the tender and close relationship between Molly and her father Sam Mike O'Malley but it's far too short. Worst of all She really look like a fish out of water big time when she's acting with the much much superior actor in Jeremy Piven. Who by the way gives a hell of a performance here! I really surprised how much work he really put in into his role and not phone it in. He really outshine his costar Cyrus. Miley Cyrus in the other hand is way too young for this role. Cyrus was 19 years old at the time playing somebody that should had been in their mid20s. Even if she's playing a character that supposed to a bit older it doesn't explain how her character is so successful. It's clear that her character never went to college or had any other policemilitary training so where did all her investigating skills came from? Another thing where did she get all that equipment in the beginning? Her father Sam? I doubt it with his gambling troubles. Another problem with her playing Molly is her look. Her body is such a small frame and her face childlike. It's a bit jarring for me to watch her act as if she was a badass. I never saw much Jiu Jitsu skills that she bragged about in the beginning. The whole motorcycle scenes really didn't fit with her character. It was a bit unbelievable. Don't get me wrong small frame actresses with a 'southern twang' had played pretty convincing FBI agents in the past like Jodi Foster in 1991's Silent of the Lambs. So it can be done but sadly Miley Cyrus can't pull it off. Have you ever heard the whiny noise a cat makes after you've accidentally stepped on it? That's exactly how Miley Cyrus sounds. The rest of the female supporting cast wasn't all better. Most of them were playing onedimensional dumb posh blonde stereotypes. They were all somewhat likable but a bit annoying at times. Megan Park as Cotton Roberts was funny but her performance was so overthetop I couldn't say it's good. Kelly Osbourne as Becky Slotsky was meh. It's a bit weird for her to try to do a Texan accent at first and then abandoning it throughout the film for her normal British voice. She really got annoying toward the end with her btchy tone. Last worth noticing is Eloise Mumford as Sasha Stolezinsky Suzy Walters who pretty much channeling her best queen bee Regina George from 2004's Mean Girls impression. She was a bit too meanspirited to be a real character. It's not only the acting that's the only weak link here. The whole movie has problems like the very predictable and clichs plot. I really didn't like how the movie like to flashbacks on things that happen a minute ago as if we were too dumb to notice the minor twists. Anybody with eyes can see it from a mile ago. Even the big twist can be deciphered halfway through the movie. Despite not making no sense afterwards. The action scenes in this film are limited and not fun to watch. The humor in this movie really falls flat and wasn't funny. The only reason why anybody would watch this now is to see what Miley Cyrus look like before she went overboard with not wanting to be known as Hannah Montana. So Undercover is one of the last film Miley Cyrus did before ditching her squeaking clean Disney image. She then went forward in trading her countrygrass singing roots for the over the top oversexuality pixel hair Madonna ripoff pop star delusion persona. It's nice to see her try to act like a normal person here before she gave up and commits to being a loud boisterous hypocrite that sleeps with anybody for attention. Overall This movie is epitome of the recycled garbage produced by the entertainment industry. It's has little to no different between other teen noirs film  television programs like 2007's Veronica Mars 2007's Nancy Drew and last 2010's Uncovered Princesses. It's so sad that many teen are still sucked into the hype that this is something new. It isn't. This movie isn't a party in the U.S.A. It was bad. Miley Cyrus's fans might love it regards what I say but for me I don't think I will rewatch this movie. It's not worth the climb.".

Is it the Hollywood clich now that the nerds in writing departments actually get back at their high school or college nightmares through film in this fashion by painting everyone in sorority and fraternity houses as such? One can only guess.In any case Miley Cyrus plays Molly a rather tomboyish gogetter of a private investigator in her dad's small firm in Dallas before getting hired by FBI agent Armon Jeremy Piven to assist in a case involving the mob a key witness the witness' daughter Alex Lauren McKnight and some ledgers. Needing the money to bail her dad out of trouble Molly accepts the role gets transformed into college student complete with wardrobe accessories vehicle and weapons to investigate into anything that's out of the ordinary. Nothing is out of bounds when required to use her skills to break into fellow sisters' rooms and rummage through their belongings for clues of anyone being a suspect waiting in the wings to get at Alex.Expect the usual episodes complete with the quintessential bimbo Megan Park written into the story just for weak laughs the easily envious head of the sorority house Eloise Mumford ever looking over her shoulder for threats to her power and well the rest of the forgettable actresses in thankless roles that you won't remember much of once you step out of the cinema hall. Romance comes in the form of Cameron Cameron Deane Stewart being probably the only guy in college who rides a Triumph motorcycle together with tons of red herrings that pop up now and then to keep one guessing in this tired tale of whocouldbe whom and for Molly to show off some deducting skills every now and then while frequently tripping up over the latest girly lingo which isn't too funny nor going to be included in the Oxford anytime soon.There's a neat plot development in the film for the final act that finally lifted the narrative from its lacklustre slumber but that was too little too late and unfortunately didn't hold up to scrutiny because it introduced a gaping plot loophole involving resource issues. I'm not quite sure who the intended demographic is for this film because Miley Cyrus fans would already get it that she's trying to move further away from her Hannah Montana days by taking on roles that are less saccharine sweet but skirting around characters like this one won't do her film career any good. She probably needs to tackle stronger dramatic roles if given a chance to really break out of her stereotype.".

Well again the writers never really bother to explain this or how Jeremy Piven has an unlimited budget to supply Cyrus with her undercover rich brat identity.Only Disney is able to film on location in a city 60 black and give us a 99.9 white cast. I actually counted the token minorities in this film. There's one Mulatto girl! They couldn't even be bothered to work in a few minorities even as extras in the background! At the sorority house Cyrus discovers that all sorority girls a dumb blondes. THAT'S THE SOLE PREMISES for every joke in this movie! Pretty girls are dumb!

Since this is Disney the sorority makes an Amish farm look like 'Animal House' as there is NO sex beer or rock and roll even at a pool party with a fraternity. No Disney music does not count as rock and roll.There are several other MAJOR plot holes such as Cyrus taking photos with a digital camera and then stating she left the negatives in a mailbox. And ad nauseam diatribes against the RICO act of 1970. Yes diatribes there's more than one.But the real nail against the chalkboard is Cyrus herself. She is so annoying it's unbelievable anyone actually paid to see this film.Worst film I've ever seen since 'The Starfighters' 1964.".

And I didn't realize that she was in this movie before I started to question whether or not it was actually her whilst she was doing the stunts on the hotel balconies.That being said then you shouldn't be intimidated or scared away from watching So Undercover just because Miley Cyrus is in it because the girl can actually act and she does have a certain charm to her as well.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was fun and it was well put together and the story was interesting enough despite it being a late teenage comedy. But Jeremy Piven and Mike O'Malley also helped the movie along quite nicely.Forget about Hannah Montana and try not to let the overshadowing stereotype that Miley Cyrus is stuck in overcast your opinion when you watch this movie because it is actually a great fun ride for people of all ages.".

I would love to see them. Yes the movie that is being portrayed here is a bit clich. It reminded me a lot of Get a Clue with Lindsay Lohan with some big twists towards the end and somewhat towards the middle as well. A lot of relationship drama in this film as well if you're into that. But yeah overall I think everyone should definitely watch it.

This was my first exposure to Miley as an actress I've never seen Hanna Montana for instance and she's effective for this kind of role a formidable nononsense detective with wit and feminine charisma. I'm not a fan of hers in any sense but she's easily the most allaround attractive female in the cast which is saying a lot since the events take place at a sorority. Or perhaps it's saying that the rest of the female cast is subpar as far as sex appeal goes. Other than that they're all just fine. Bottom Line This is a fun detective dramaadventure at a university highlighted by Cyrus as the protagonist nothing more but nothing less. The movie runs 94 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana.

They're willing to pay her big bucks which of course she has to take because old boozing daddy just lost a bucket at the racetrack. THEN we're asked to believe that after oh what ten minutes no I'll be generous a half day of FBI training toughtalking motorcycleriding Miley is ready to be a sorority girl. This is of course a transformation a la Eliza Doolittle because we all know sorority girls are all the same and they all talk like so unbelievably real. And they're all bitches...and dumb...and vain.

And this starts with a makeover...Miley Cyrus who plays Molly is not a phenomenon with which I am greatly familiar what with me being an old git on the other side of the pond. I gather she sings has a famous Dad and has appeared as a youngster on Disneytype stuff. Here she gets a chance to play young adult in a movie which is a mild variation on Miss Congeniality which was itself a mild variation on countless other similar offerings.Based on the small amount I had heard beforehand I was not expecting great things. And I was pleasantly surprised. The plot surprisingly strong holds together well there are some tolerable gags Miss Cyrus discharges her responsibilities which consist mainly of shallow sorority girl responses followed by lookaway What the hell am I doing? Expressions well enough she has the courage to look grimly plain in the early stages there are decent development arcs for her and the sorority girls and there are little bits of action and romance.The whole sororityfraternity thing continues to remain a complete blank to me.".

Miley Cyrus can act I think people are put off because she has a pretty deep voice compared to a lot of girls her age and it can sound a little strange. The story here is nothing original  she's undercover at a college working for the FBI etc etc.The story is maybe a C story but I think Miley carries herself well enough and if she was given something a little better to work with she could surprise all the naysayers on here.Unfortunately for Miley she's at that age that many former child actors struggle. It took Jason Bateman years to prove he was better than the show Valerie gave him credit for.This movie reminded me a lot of Ms Congeniality but was only a sub par version of it. It was like Clueless meets Ms C but it missed the mark a lot in both areas as it didn't seem to know what audience it was aiming for.I have definitely seen far worse and it is one of those movies that you can watch without expending too much brain power.".

	schema:headline " Honestly it was better than it should have been mindless silly fun";
	schema:reviewBody "This film immediately becomes fodder for every comedian and hate filled blogger in the world. Miley Cyrus is an obvious target for them though I never really understood why. The biggest issue with So Undercover is certainly not her but rather how extremely by the book predictable and cookie cutter this movie is. It copies a handful of films and mixes them together and spits them back out at you. Still if you can get past the cake made from Miss CongenialityHouse Bunny mix then you'll get a few laughs and chuckles and actually mostly enjoy yourself. It is very nearly vapid but sometimes I think...who cares. Sometimes a movie can be pure entertainment and mindless vapid fun is okay. The performances are decent and the story is good enough to keep you entertained. The script is surprisingly thorough and creates some fun and good characters.I don't hold the hatred that everyone else seems to towards Miley Cyrus. I think she is very talented and I think its unfortunate that the media has pushed her into revamping her image so much. She does a decent job in this film as Molly. It is a little bit of a stretch to call her tough and street smart but you know she actually does pull it off pretty well. Sandra Bullock she ain't but for the purpose of this movie she is good. Jeremy Piven is simply hilarious and excellent in his role as the FBI agent who sets Cyrus up with her undercover gig. He has some great lines and really steals the show with his performance. He makes the film that much better. Joshua Bowman is the typical romantic male lead. That being said he does a good job and him and Cyrus have solid chemistry together. His character is so predictable but he still does his best given what he has. The girls of the sorority are all decent but realistically they are really all the same. None of them truly stand out except maybe the small role played by Kelly Osbourne because her character was at least a little different. I felt like Lauren McKnight's character should have had more development and more scenes but she is really the same as the rest of the girls in terms of character. Mike O'Malley is perfect and really well done as Molly's doting father. More of him would have been good as well but he's great in what he is in.You have to know what you're dealing with going into So Undercover. I mean I had very low expectations and essentially I knew what I was in for. It does deliver exactly what you would expect looking and reading the cover. So you can't say your expectations won't be met unless they are unrealistic. Tom Vaughan is a bit of a strange choice for directing this film. This is definitely his first of this type of genre but he seems to have a good handle on what its all about. I'm not sure the demographic they were hoping for with the movie though. I think it would certainly appeal to Miley's younger fans 13 and under but there is a fair bit of bad language too which was unnecessary if they wanted it to find a popular demographic. Basically you can't say you will hate this movie because just by reading about it and looking at the cover you should know whether this is for you or not. It wasn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it was acceptable and fun and entertained me for an hour and a half. 6.510".

This movie is suppose to be an actionadventure but they forgot to add comedy as well. I like this movie and found it to be decently acted written and cast.

The girl who plays Grace on Secret Life is in it the guy who plays Daniel from Revenge the dad from Gossip Girl are also in the movie. I would say if you have a teenagepreteen girl who still likes Miley go ahead and check it out. I actually could see the potential for a sequel and probably would watch it. Miley plays a girl named Molly who goes undercover for the FBI and goes to college for the mission. Her dad in the movie is actually the guy who plays Jimmy in Yes Dear. I say give it a shot.".
