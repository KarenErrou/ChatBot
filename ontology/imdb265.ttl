It is based on a play by Brandon Thomas and there actually exist more films based on this material than I would have expected. This one here is among the most known probably because the title character is played by famous German actor Heinz Rhmann. And he made this film in the 1950s and in his 50s which was certainly his best period in terms of films he starred in. But it all or almost all went wrong here. Drag performances are always a challenger and I don't even think Rhmann did all that much wrong but everything in terms of comedy story and music and the rare moments of drama too did not become credible realistic or at least entertaining. Looking at the first hour of this 90 minute movie Rhmann did not even have that much screen time and it was all about the younger cast members and characters on many occasions. But they were either weak actors or just not good enough to make up for the bland ways in which their characters were written. Probably a mix of both. As colorful and loud as this QuestKampendonk collaboration may have been it turned out at least as annoying. This is especially disappointing as the duo worked with Rhmann on other occasions and there things did not go half as wrong as here. Or maybe the base material is just too weak also an option. After all Rhmann did not do himself any favors by starring in this one. I do not recommend the watch.".

There is a version of the same film starring Heinz Rhmann from the 1950s and here we get Peter Alexander's take on the story. The writer and director is Gza von Cziffra and one of his cowriters is Gustav Kampendonk who also worked on the film I mentioned earlier. Films with men dressing up as women are always a bit edgy I guess but at least Alexander seemed to be having a good time from what it looked like. I also think apart from his height he looks more feminine than Rhmann or the makeup was just better what helped the film at least a bit. Still it felt difficult at times to believe that people actually thought Alexander's character was really a woman. The music is soso but the comedy is fairly weak and sadly that's a common denominator in several Alexander films. I guess there is a reason why he stopped acting at some point and just focused on hosting and entertaining. He is not the greatest actor admittedly but makes up for his lack of range with his great charisma. Sadly this is something that cannot be said about his supporting cast here. I believe that this is a difficult original work by Brandon Thomas when it comes to turning this into a good film. Here they did not succeed. Thumbs down.".

Other differences In Kstner's story and the earlier film the girls meet in Bavaria whereas nowadays it's more likely to send children to Scotland for vacation. The differences aren't obtrusive and seem reasonable  as opposed to the 2001remake of another Kstner story Emil und die Detektive  Emil and the Detectives which tries to ingratiate itself with the nowadays audience in a very fashionable and superficial way. This one instead manages to keep faith to Kstner and the atmosphere he wanted to create then. Certainly it's a mainstream entertainment film and it's not a great one like some Astrid Lindgren films by Olle Hellbom but entertaining it is and it's sometimes even quite moving indeed the old story has some good turnarounds and ideas which don't spoil the original story and the actors are very good and take it seriously. All in all it's a nice film 6 out of 10".

The differences aren't obtrusive and seem reasonable  as opposed to the 2001remake of another Kstner story Emil und die Detektive  Emil and the Detectives which tries to ingratiate itself with the nowadays audience in a very fashionable and superficial way. This one instead manages to keep faith to Kstner and the atmosphere he wanted to create then. Certainly it's a mainstream entertainment film and it's not a great one like some Astrid Lindgren films by Olle Hellbom but entertaining it is and it's sometimes even quite moving indeed the old story has some good turnarounds and ideas which don't spoil the original story and the actors are very good and take it seriously. All in all it's a nice film 6 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "The 95minute Charlie  Louise  Das doppelte Lottchen is a German film from 1994 so it will have its 25th anniversary in two years already and if you see how this came out less than 5 years after the Fall of the Berlin Wall this shows you how old it is already. But despite the age you will find many names still active in film today like Lauterbach and Harfouch Zischler and Meyer. Director Vilsmaier almost 80 now still has a new project showing up here and there and even the Eichhorn Twins who play the title characters here seem to appear occasionally in television projects while other child actors from the early 1990s have long stopped acting. And you can feel the passion of everybody involved with this project. It is of course based on the famous Kstner story that even made it to Hollywood with the beautiful and talented Lindsay Lohan playing both characters. But here we have two actresses identical twins in real life too and now in their mid30s. On a trip to Scotland the two accidentally meet and find out about each others existence realizing they look exactly alike. So they come up with a plan that the girl who lived with her father poses as the other girl and now lives with her mother and the other way around which makes up for some pretty entertaining funny moments. Watch and learn folks this is how you do mixup comedies that are effective. The film's biggest strength is probably the heart as the authenticity and likable characters make it really easy to care for all the characters not just the girls. You will probably see some flaws here from a subjective position like why does the girl with the shades does not recognize the other as her twin right away or why did they have to include this pseudo danger drama at the very end because it went so strongly against the film's overall soothing tone but that's really just personal taste and it is also not bad enough to keep this from being a convincing work. It's a really good watch for everybody who likes kids films and it is a bit of a shame this underseen film is pretty difficult to find nowadays because it really tells a sweet story and also works very well not just from the family movie standpoint but also from the comedy standpoint. It's close to greatness at times. One of Germany's best from 1994 without a doubt. See it.".

The performances by Mantan Moreland and Willie Best in the much later Monogram Chans serve the same niche as Fechit's Snowshoes character but come off much better and are funny in the same way Lou Costello or Curly Howard are funny.

Though very politically incorrect by today's standards I have to admit laughing at some of his lines and actions as the fact is simply that he is often very funny even if we're not supposed to find him so today.

Fortunately his role is small although alas it's considerably larger than that enjoyed by the lovely Rita Hayworth who seems to have spent most of her Fox sojourn posing for charming stills. Her role in the actual movie is inconsequential although she does manage to exchange a few lines with Warner Oland. Otherwise all she does is to hover in the background of a few scenes.Oland of course is in top form but so are the other players and even more importantly the Robert EllisHelen Logan script comes across as a real winner. Although the identity of the killer will fail to stump many viewers the puzzle is admirably contrived and the plot worked out with commendable pace precision and power.This is no B picture. The sets are stunning. Daniel Clark's noirishly atmospheric photography also deserves special mention and even the normally humdrum director Louis King brother of Henry King has risen to the occasion.".

For some reason I'm more used to Sidney Toler in the role I love Mantan Moreland and it's always fun when one of Charlie's sons is on the scene.What this 1935 film does have is an interesting story footage of Egypt which even in black and white is pretty impressive and an appearance by a heavier brunette preelectrolysis Rita Hayworth using her original name Rita Cansino here. Pat Paterson Mrs. Charles Boyer is the lead woman.Chan is in Egypt on behalf of a French museum to investigate tomb treasures that were to go to the museum but instead are in other European museums. He meets Carol Arnold Patterson whose father on the dig hasn't been heard from in some time. There's a good reason for that. He's mummified in a sarcophagus that's supposed to hold an ancient priest.Well there's another murder and an attempted murder as Charlie attempts to figure out who killed Professor Arnold and why.Warner Oland is fine as Charlie though some other performances are a little over the topmelodramatic. Mainly James Eagles as Professor Arnold's physically challenged son sticks out with an absolutely maniacal performance.I won't bother to go into the controversial Stepin Fetchit's presence in this film. His life story is an interesting one however and worth a look. The character he developed which made him a millionaire is cringeworthy by today's standards.All in all an okay film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not like this one on the first viewing but I had a very bad tape which didn't help. With the DVD part of recent Chan Collection that came out in 2006 I enjoyed this more thanks in part to have the option of English subtitles.I still think this is a slightly subpar Warner Olandedition Charlie Chan but only because I think so highly of the other films. It did have some excellent suspense and strange characters and is known because of the appearance of young Rita Cansino who would go on to star status as Rita Hayworth.THE BAD  None of Charlie's kids are here to help him out and that's a loss. Instead for humor we have Stepin Fetchit with his mumbling drawl and unfunny character unlike Mantan Moreland in later Chans even though both are horrible black stereotypes of the day. Worse than the above we have a shrill hysterical female lead character  Carol Arnold Pat Paterson who got on my nerves bigtime! That's almost another stereotype of the period women who fall apart easily and act like overemotional cripples. After a few of these outbursts I just hit the mute button when she went into her act. She had a brother in here who was almost as bad except he had far fewer lines. Also in here was the typical thing you saw more of in the '30s than in modern films stories that dealt with the occult and a lot of superstitions. THE GOOD  The action was pretty good and this story gave us more of the weird suspects than what is normally provided. Not only weird people but strange scenes. Combine those with the usual Chan witticism's profound statements and uncommon courtesy he gives everyone and it's an entertaining film. I would never have recognized Hayworth if I hadn't been informed it was her. She played a darkhaired Egyptian woman. If you froze some frames and looked carefully enough you could be convinced it was her but it wasn't easy. She certainly wasn't the incredible beauty she would be in the next decade.".

Charlie has been sent to an archaeological dig by a French museum. It seems the museum is justifiably angry because items from the tomb belong to them but someone has been selling them to collectors and other museums. Naturally when Chan arrives people begin to die and it's up to Charlie to get to the bottom of it.Despite not having any of the Chan children particularly the ever enjoyable Keye Luke as Lee this is a dandy film with some interesting twists and a mystery that is a tad overcomplicated but fun to unravel. As far as my feelings about Fetchit in this film he didn't act that much different than the Birmingham Brown character from the later Chan film so perhaps I am just being a tad oversensitive. It's just that in so many prior films Fetchit was the living embodiment of all the negative Black stereotypesso bad that seeing him once again kind of made me cringe.".

	schema:reviewBody "The texture of this movie is as lumpy as the crunchiest peanut butter. The problem lies partly in the conventional 1930's Hollywood wisdom that audiences couldn't be trusted to sit through 6070 minutes of suspense and sleuthing unless you provided comic relief. Too often as here the comic element was totally extraneous to the story. Enough has been said by other commentators about Stepin Fetchit's unwelcome presence. Stupid lazy and cowardly his coon stereotype was the answer to a white supremacist's dream. More to the point he isn't even very funny here. His character fits in with Warner Oland's Charlie Chan like oil and water. One anticipated comic scene in which the bazaar merchant shows SF the longlost tomb of his ancestors fails to materialize. If it was ever shot it probably ended up on the cutting room floor. Paul Porcasi's fastidiously polite Inspector Fouad also seems superfluous. One longs for the presence of Keye Luke in this movie as the best humor in the Charlie Chan series always came out of Charlie's natural interaction with his sons.The other problem with Charlie Chan in Egypt is thin plotting. Why should Professor Thurston need to kill his nephew Barry and attempt to kill his niece Carol with the mysterious drug mapuchari when he has already hidden away the treasures of the 21st Dynasty in a secret room? It seems that Charlie is not given enough clues to go on when he reveals Thurston as the murderer. Actually the bulk of the evidence such as it is seems to point to the majordomo Edfu Ahmad played by the sinisterlooking Nigel de Brulier. As a direct descendant of the High Priest Amete he has a vested interested in saving his tomb from desecration by foreigners. And what is a teenaged Rita Hayworth doing here as the servant girl Nayda peeping through the shrubbery as Charlie investigates Barry's murder? Is she is league with Edfu Ahmad or merely getting some screen exposure while adding her decorative presence to the proceedings? Also the complicity of the chemist Daoud Atrash is not made clear. He claims ignorance of the drug mapuchari but is he on the level? If Atrash didn't provide Thurston with the drug who did? In the last analysis this is not among the the strongest films in the Chan series due to its unevenness. This in spite of the truly eerie tomb setting which recalls the chills we got in no less a picture than the original Boris Karloff classic The Mummy.".

	schema:headline " Influential But Problematic Film In The Chan Series";
	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in 1935 CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt is the eighth film in the 20th Century Fox series. It is also a pivotal film in the seriesand at the same time one of the most problematic.A French museum has funded an archaeological expedition with the clear understanding that all finds are to become property of the museum. The expedition is successful uncovering the tomb of a high priest named Ahmeti. But when items that should be delivered to the museum begin to show up on the international market the museum dispatches Charlie Chan... and murder is there to meet him.Earlier Chan films were grounded in reality no matter how odd in plot or detail they had a certain sense of possibility. Egypt however introduces a note of fantasy. The exotic nature of the setting is heightened in the sets and costumes Egyptian gods and goddesses and the findings from the tomb offer a touch of the occult as well. And the plot requires the use of two drugs that do not seem to have any reallife counterpart most notably the marijuanalike mapuchari. These ideas would prove extremely influential for later Chan films and mysticism the supernatural the occult and mystery drugs would become a common feature of many future films in the series.At the same time Egypt is problematic due to the presence of actor Lincoln Perrybetter known to audiences by the stage name Stepin Fetchit. An AfricanAmerican Perry developed the character in the 1920s it became an audience favorite in the 1930s and he would play the character throughout the decade and well into the 1940s making and due to gambling problems loosing a fortune in the process. Seen today however Stepin Fetchit tends to leave viewers utterly aghast. The character is incredibly stereotypical a lazy cowardly footdragging speechslurring and very stupid black man.In many respects Stepin Fetchit is an example of dialect comedy that was popular in America for some one hundred years or more and as a specific character he might be considered a holdover from the minstrel tradition which remained popular in the United States right up until World War II. Even so and in spite of the fact that the character was both created and performed by a black man it was essentially racist humor and no amount of context can ever make it wholly acceptable. There are occasional moments in the film in which Perry's artistry is very evidentbut this if anything makes the performance all the more disconcerting.Still and perhaps as much because of Perry's performance as anything else CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt is a fascinating little film. It offers an unexpected view of what most audiences considered acceptable in 1935 it has considerable style and it also has a very young Rita Hayworth appearing under her real name as Rita Cansino in the small role of an Egyptian servant. Even at this early date the director and cinematographers seemed to recognize her potential and she is allowed more closeups than a bit player ought to have!Given the issues surrounding this film I find it hard to recommend to any one other than Chan film fans. Unfortunately even they will have a hard time finding it it is not presently available on VHS or DVD and accusations of racism make it particularly difficult to find on television.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

It is also a pivotal film in the seriesand at the same time one of the most problematic.A French museum has funded an archaeological expedition with the clear understanding that all finds are to become property of the museum. The expedition is successful uncovering the tomb of a high priest named Ahmeti. But when items that should be delivered to the museum begin to show up on the international market the museum dispatches Charlie Chan... and murder is there to meet him.Earlier Chan films were grounded in reality no matter how odd in plot or detail they had a certain sense of possibility. Egypt however introduces a note of fantasy. The exotic nature of the setting is heightened in the sets and costumes Egyptian gods and goddesses and the findings from the tomb offer a touch of the occult as well. And the plot requires the use of two drugs that do not seem to have any reallife counterpart most notably the marijuanalike mapuchari. These ideas would prove extremely influential for later Chan films and mysticism the supernatural the occult and mystery drugs would become a common feature of many future films in the series.At the same time Egypt is problematic due to the presence of actor Lincoln Perrybetter known to audiences by the stage name Stepin Fetchit. An AfricanAmerican Perry developed the character in the 1920s it became an audience favorite in the 1930s and he would play the character throughout the decade and well into the 1940s making and due to gambling problems loosing a fortune in the process. Seen today however Stepin Fetchit tends to leave viewers utterly aghast. The character is incredibly stereotypical a lazy cowardly footdragging speechslurring and very stupid black man.In many respects Stepin Fetchit is an example of dialect comedy that was popular in America for some one hundred years or more and as a specific character he might be considered a holdover from the minstrel tradition which remained popular in the United States right up until World War II. Even so and in spite of the fact that the character was both created and performed by a black man it was essentially racist humor and no amount of context can ever make it wholly acceptable. There are occasional moments in the film in which Perry's artistry is very evidentbut this if anything makes the performance all the more disconcerting.Still and perhaps as much because of Perry's performance as anything else CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt is a fascinating little film. It offers an unexpected view of what most audiences considered acceptable in 1935 it has considerable style and it also has a very young Rita Hayworth appearing under her real name as Rita Cansino in the small role of an Egyptian servant. Even at this early date the director and cinematographers seemed to recognize her potential and she is allowed more closeups than a bit player ought to have!Given the issues surrounding this film I find it hard to recommend to any one other than Chan film fans. Unfortunately even they will have a hard time finding it it is not presently available on VHS or DVD and accusations of racism make it particularly difficult to find on television.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

Part of the problem is that the film feels terribly set bound. I never felt that I wasn't anywhere other than in Hollywood with a cast that was just trying to be glitzy. Give Fox points for making a film that is very much A list but take many points for what is really a dull by the book mystery. I know some people really like this film a great deal but for me this is not one I rarely ever choose to see with any screenings always done as the result of watching a video tape where its between two other entries in the series I like. Worth seeing once for Chan fans other wise I'd skip it.".

In summary this was a clumsy jumbled slapstick mess that only rated a few chuckles from me due to some witty lines near the end. And Peter Ustinov is wasted as Chan as he sounds more like an Englishman impersonating a Chinese man than more convincing portrayals from the likes of Warner Oland and Sidney Toler I have yet to rewatch a Roland Winters one that I haven't seen in 30 years. And how convenient to have his grandson Lee Jr.'s Richard Hatch parents one of whom is Jewish be killed in a car crash so as not to have Keye Luke make an appearance. No. 1 Son as a young man here is played by David Hirokane The fact that he's not there nor is Earl Derr Biggers credited as creator here is just as well since this movie does nothing to honor their contributions. And the supporting cast of Hatch Lee Grant Rachel Roberts Roddy McDowall Brian Keith and in one of her earliest roles Michelle Pfeiffer are just wasted as well never mind Angie Dickinson as the Dragon Queen. Director Clive Donner seems to want to do a Mel Brookslike parody down to the Blazing Saddleslike climax but there's nothing the least bit creatively funny here. So on that note I'd only recommend Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen for anyone curious about the treatment of this onceiconic hero. P.S.

And as far as the acting goes I expected nothing form Hatch and got it and Michelle Pfeiffer is young so she can't be blamed. But Lee Grant Roddy McDowell and Peter Ustinov an Oscarwinner!! are just awful and should have known better. What possessed them?!

I just don't know what to say about this...all I know is I wouldn't even show this film to my worst enemy!! If karma and reincarnation are true those who made this movie should all come back in their next lives as dung beetles.By the way although it didn't change my opinion about the movie overall it couldn't be any worse I was irritated to no end about the character played by Brian Keith. All he seemed to do was curseand in ways that are bound to offend anyone who is the least bit religious. Is this supposed to be funny?! I am sure this would offend many out there and shows a complete lack of sensitivity towards the audience and their values.

The explicit irony was the Chineseness of the man was deliberately bogus.Second there's the appearance of Peter Ustinov. For this bit you have to know the absolute importance of the fictional Hercule Poirot in how film discovery evolved. Ustinov had just played Poirot in the tothen most high budget detective story filmed. So when we see him or did when this was new as a similarly portly pretentious internally cogitating detective it matters.Third someone involved was intelligent enough to set the thing properly. It begins with a faded black and white oldstyle Chan movie with our modern characters but a couple decades previously. The mystery shown bears on the one in our movie. Later at the end of our movie the action takes us to an old moviehouse in Chinatown where a Charlie Chan movie festival is being held. No mention in our film that Chan has a film persona. The trademarked end copied from Poirot where Chan gathers all the suspects and tells each one why they are the murderer until revealing the real murderer after a separately scripted false alarm  this happens in the scenery loft of the theater where a Chan film is playing below.Naturally the chase to catch the murderer takes each character in front of the giant screen where the audience applauds them.But its the truest of parodies. Usually parodies put new life into old form by adding a new layer of reference. Its a mistake to think that the new life would be funny or more entertaining in any way. This is true parody it took something that was dead and added enzymes to the decomposition.There's one joke I appreciated. The Chan films are generally pretty vile in how they handle race. One trick is to set the bottom racially so that Chan can drift at the top in some cerebral racial advantage. That meant that the black driver was nearly subhuman. Stupid ignoble. The driver here is a black man also. Poised attractive articulate. We learn some noble things about him at the end.Oh another small matter of interest. It has a very young Michelle Pfeiffer very pretty  before she had all that work done on her face.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

It's just awful  truly truly awful. You'll sigh you'll look at your watch you'll feel as if you're stuck with some adolescent in an elevator trying out his impressions for 17 hours until they free you.Don't rent it  it's just TERRIBLE  and with this cast that's such a shame.";

Chan having been hysterically spoofed as one of the detectives in Murder By Death with a name change tries to take Peter Ustinov into another mystery series after the success of Death on the Nile. Ustinov's all right but the story is ridiculously silly poorly written and only has a few moments that can be called knee snapping funny. What is there is one of the oldest plot lines in mystery who killed the patriarch of a wealthy family leaving behind widow Lee Grant who still talks to his ashes as if he could hear her an evil mistress Angie Dickinson in the ugliest wig and makeup imaginable some weird servants Roddy McDowall as a hovearound riding butler who deliberately defies orders and Rachel Roberts as the neurotic maid. Then there's Richard Hatch as honorable grandson 1 a product of the marriage of Ustinov's son and Grant's daughter seemingly deceased or traveling the world but lucky not to be included in the script.The film concentrates mainly on farce showing a scene where Hatch unknowingly destroys all of San Francisco's Chinatown and a wild ride through Golden Gate park with idiotic cop Brian Keith chasing Dickinson. A young Michelle Pfeiffer plays Hatch's floozie girlfriend whom grandma Grant despises. This one is so bad it has to be seen to be believed but I must admit that for all its incredible awfulness I found it surprisingly watchable. But then I also enjoyed the huge bomb Haunted Honeymoon with Dom De Luise in drag so what do I know?".

The film is more successful when it sticks closer to the spirit of the original Chan films I am referring to the bw flashback sequence and the clue of the fork in the tea cup as well as the climactic gathering of the suspects for the unmasking of the Bizarre Killer who is indeed rather wellcamouflaged.

The reallife Tootie Smith played by Margaret O'Brien wrote stories of her life for the NewYorker.  These stories were bought and compiled into this classic musical.  Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated here and has become a classic yuletide song.  It has been sung a thousand times by a thousand artists but no one could ever capture the heartfelt emotion expressed by Judy Garland.  If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye as you listen to her sing the song to little Tootie I would have to wonder if you have a heart at all.The most fun song is The Trolley Song  you can even see that Judy herself had a ball singing it.  That scene was done in one take.Judy Garland never looked better in any of her films as she did in this one. Perhaps it was one of the happiest times in her life?  It is wellknown that she married director Vincent Minelli after this picture.Beautifully directed depicting with accuracy the passing of the seasons of one year in the life of the Smiths of St. Louis.  What a fun charming movie.  I could never tire of it.".

	schema:headline " Minnelli Directs Garland In MGM Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The day was bright The air was sweet The smell of honeysuckle almost knocked you off your feet ...  This is unashamed nostalgia for an idealised America dating back to an age of innocence before the two World Wars.It is 1903 and the city of St. Louis is ablaze with excitement as it prepares to host the World's Fair.  Here in the geographic heart of the USA the very pleasant Smith family lives in a very pleasant suburb of the very pleasant St. Louis. We watch the Smiths through the seasons and into Spring 1904 as they fall in love dress up for Hallowe'en bottle their homemade ketchup and .... well ride the trolley.This is a world of tranquillity where nothing can threaten the homely complacency of Middle America.  The evening meal is always a wholesome family gathering the month of July is always sunny big brothers are always handsome Princeton freshmen and the iceman's mare knows the neighbourhood so well that she stops at each home on her round without needing to be told. The only shadow which falls across the Smiths' domestic bliss comes when Alonzo the paterfamilias proposes to move the household to New York. However Alonzo soon realises what a terrible mistake it would be to tear his wife and daughters away from their beloved MidWest he relents and family harmony is restored.This heartwarming exuberant musical is one of the very best ever made and MGM knew exactly what it was doing in terms of box office success.  The film was calculated to cash in on the zeitgeist of 1944 the year in which vast American armies were sent across to Europe and the war in the Pacific turned decisively in America's favour.  Millions of young American men found themselves far from home in what was certain to be the last Christmas of the War and millions of families back home missed them terribly  Some day soon we all will be together If the fates allow.  Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow ...In this idealised America everyone is prosperous everyone conducts himself like a good citizen should old folks are cheerful healthy and alert domestic servants feign grumpiness but actually adore their masters and teenage girls are flirtatious but impeccably proper.  There are strong American folkresonances in the homespun wisdom of the family elders the strong straight young adults and the 'down home' hearthside gatherings and dances.  It could be argued that the film invokes an America that has never in fact existed.  This maybe so but the Perfect America which we experience here exerts an emotional pull far stronger than any real place could command.Vincente Minnelli directed the movie with panache.  There are many subtle but sure touches  for example two short scenes  which establish the proposition that the family's happiness is inextricably linked to St. Louis. Alonzo announces the move to New York and with clever choreography Minnelli turns him into a pariah in his own livingroom.  Esther and Tootie gaze at the snowmen which they will have to abandon in the yard and we know without any dialogue to help us that the eastward migration isn't going to happen.  With similar cinematic economy Minnelli shows us the happy commotion around the Christmas tree without allowing it to distract our attention from Alonzo and Anna whose wordless reconciliation sets the seal on the plot.  This is directing of rare skill.In films of the 1960's and 70's a stock device was used a sepiatinted photograph would 'come to life' with colour and motion to show that the scene was laid in the past.  Minnelli employs the trick elegantly in this film and I am not aware of any example which predates this one.This is a 'formula' movie but its ingredients are so fine and they are combined with such marvellous skill that the whole eclipses the parts. Among the elements which contribute to the project's success are the songs  and the film contains three classics The Trolley Song Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and of course Meet Me In St. Louis.Judy Garland was 22 years old when she made this film though she easily passes for a 17yearold and it was this movie which cemented her relationship with Minnelli.  They married one year later and Liza was born in March 1946.Predictably enough the film has a happy ending.  The teenage girls Esther and Rose are paired off and the Smiths get to visit the World's Fair as one big happy family.  As they look for the restaurant once again a meal signifies domestic harmony they are distracted by the lightingup of the city a filmic metaphor for the approaching end of World War Two.  The sisters are filled with awe at America's technological ascendancy and that such miracles can be achieved by such folksy simple people  Right here where we live right here in St. Louis!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest movie musicals and thus one of the greatest American movies Meet Me in St. Louis tells a story that may appear insultingly inconsequential a happy family living in turnofthecentury St. Louis considers moving to New York but decides against it. Yet Vincente Minelli working with a wonderful cast and unusually intelligent songs takes this story and makes it the one really convincing screen refutation of Tolstoy's claim that all happy families are alike and indeed perhaps the only fully rounded and persuasive representation of a happy family in the history of movies. From the small family conflict over the quality of homemade ketchup that begins the movie to the agony over moving at the end the Smiths are a collection of distinctive vibrant and at times almost incompatible characters bound together not only by love but by a contagious and very particular sense of fun. Minelli's genius for musical numbers in interior spacesmost notably the great party in the Smith home near the beginning of the movieis complemented here by two unforgettable outdoor sequences Judy Garland's matchless Trolley Song and Tootie's Halloween adventure in the neighborhood where she shows such vulnerability such courageand in the end such diabolical lack of conscience that no one can fail to love her. These outdoor scenes protect Meet in St. Louis from the claustrophobia that so frequently limits the power of family dramas.Tootie at five is the youngest of the five Smith children and as played by the great child actor Margaret O'Brien she is also the center of most of the fun. Her relationship with her older sister Esther Judy Garland is captivating in its joy complexity and ultimately in its sadness. For even though the catastrophe ! of moving to New York is narrowly avoided Esther will still leave home for life with the boy next door and the powerful unity of these lucky people will ultimately give way to other claims of new love new suffering and new duty. The happiness the Smiths knew while living together will only increase the pain of each parting. We're blessed though to have glimpsed their particular brand of happiness at its glorious peak.".

	schema:headline " How have I missed seeing this film?";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd never seen this movie until a few weeks ago. After I rented it from Netflix last month I still have it but I plan to buy my own copy soon I saw it on AMC. Has it been on TV before? I mean I've known of its existence because I've seen the title in the sheet music for Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I heard James Taylor talk about the movie in an interview after he recorded that song in response to 911 and I've been wanting to see it ever since. Now I've become a MMISL junkie. I can't stop watching it! I've read everything I can find on the Internet about it and about the St. Louis World's Fair which is absolutely fascinatingdid you know that one of the pavilions featured actual premature babies in incubators? and I just started reading Sally Benson's original book. For those who complain that this film is some kind of idealized or fantasized representation of life in America I say read the book. It's based on Sally Benson's actual recollections of growing up in St. Louis and the movie dialogue and situations are lifted almost word for word from the book. It jibes pretty well with other things I've read about the era and with stories I've heard my parents and grandparents tell so I have no trouble believing it at all. Actually the situations and relationships are not that different from what families face today at least the normal twoparentsoftheoppositesex kind that I'm familiar with. Just listen to Mrs. Smith tell her husband to count to three before responding to his daughter. He counts to three and shouts at her anyway! As for Mr. Smith giving up a lucrative career move for the sake of his family's happiness and wellbeing how many parents have not faced similar decisions?I think there are five main reasons I like this movie 1. Judy Garland. She's just one of the greatest performers of the 20th century that's all there is to it. 2. Margaret O'Brien. What a joy to watch on the screen. Now I know why she was one of the most beloved child stars in America. 3. The wonderful songs.

	onyx:emotionText "I'd never seen this movie until a few weeks ago. After I rented it from Netflix last month I still have it but I plan to buy my own copy soon I saw it on AMC. Has it been on TV before? I mean I've known of its existence because I've seen the title in the sheet music for Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I heard James Taylor talk about the movie in an interview after he recorded that song in response to 911 and I've been wanting to see it ever since. Now I've become a MMISL junkie. I can't stop watching it! I've read everything I can find on the Internet about it and about the St. Louis World's Fair which is absolutely fascinatingdid you know that one of the pavilions featured actual premature babies in incubators? and I just started reading Sally Benson's original book. For those who complain that this film is some kind of idealized or fantasized representation of life in America I say read the book. It's based on Sally Benson's actual recollections of growing up in St. Louis and the movie dialogue and situations are lifted almost word for word from the book. It jibes pretty well with other things I've read about the era and with stories I've heard my parents and grandparents tell so I have no trouble believing it at all. Actually the situations and relationships are not that different from what families face today at least the normal twoparentsoftheoppositesex kind that I'm familiar with. Just listen to Mrs. Smith tell her husband to count to three before responding to his daughter. He counts to three and shouts at her anyway! As for Mr. Smith giving up a lucrative career move for the sake of his family's happiness and wellbeing how many parents have not faced similar decisions?I think there are five main reasons I like this movie 1. Judy Garland. She's just one of the greatest performers of the 20th century that's all there is to it. 2. Margaret O'Brien. What a joy to watch on the screen. Now I know why she was one of the most beloved child stars in America. 3. The wonderful songs. It doesn't get much better than The Trolley Song The Boy Next Door and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. 4. The beautiful Technicolor cinematography. In the DVD version the colors are so brilliant that it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday. And Rose and Esther's clothes are simply stunning.

Now nearly 20 years past I look more at the nuances and subtleties of the performances and direction in a movie that seems easy to characterize as sentimental. Indeed the vibrant color the relatively simple plot contrivances and the resolution of the big question of the movie all make for what seems superficially like a film for fans of Corny Musicals.Let me argue against sap for the main reason that a deep undercurrent of real and heartfelt emotion underlies the entire enterprise. And the credit can be spread wide for that 1. The rich and subtle performance of Judy Garland who does not miss a step a note a glance or an inflection throughout the entire movie. For many la Judy can be an acquired taste but she shows her stuff here. Watch her primping at the mirror with Rose watching Tootie as she sings Dear Mother or in the scene where The Boy tells her he can't get his tuxedo out of the cleaners. She was a marvelous actor and it shows in the small scenes as well as the grand singing ones. Her transition from worry and disappointment to exuberance in The Trolley Song is a wonder to behold.2. Margaret O'Brien as Tootie and also the writer's characterization of Tootie here is a child who is not nice or cute the way TVMovie kids are today. But she is compelling and wonderful in own right  a real flesh and blood kid. In particular the Halloween scene really shows the dark side of childhood where scary fantasies can become real and the depths of her despair at leaving St. Louis capture the essence of leaving everything that is familiar and right.3. The acting company is so wonderful from the smallest supporting actor to the largest role there is a give and take note the passing of the title song from person to person at the beginning of the film and the easy banter the dinner table interactions the scene where everyone finds out about the Big Move and you get a sense that this is a real family.4. The integration and the transition from the emotion of the scene directly into the emotion of the song and then back to the scene is repeated again and again. This is not an easy thing to do and for all I can recall Minnelli was the first to master it. Most musicals would stop dead in the their tracks to do a song but the music here is so organic and truthful you hardly notice the strings moving in the background.5. And don't get me started on the score which is really wonderful echoing the various themes at just the perfect moment. The Halloween bonfire music is especially good. I think credit goes to George Stoll for that.6. And for putting the package together a tip of the hat to Vincente Minnelli and Arthur Freed who went on to do many wonderful musicals but none perhaps as wonderful as this one. Minnelli works magic with staging the Skip to My Lou and Trolley Song are wonderful group numbers and it must have been true love that helped Judy Garland's wonderful performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of the Hollywood studios during the War years made these nostalgic films about a simpler time when no foreign foe threatened our way of life. MGM's contribution to these films was not bettered served than by Meet Me In St. Louis. It's a simple story about the Smith family in 1904 St. Louis eagerly awaiting the World's Fair that would take place in their town. And to my knowledge no other World's Fair had as enduring a theme song as the one written for this fair serving as the title song for the film.The Smith family consists of parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor and their five children son Henry Daniels Jr. and daughters in descending order Lucille Bremer Judy Garland Joan Carroll and Margaret O'Brien. Grandfather Harry Davenport lives with the clan and so does livein maid Marjorie Main who functions like Alice in the Brady household. A good meal and an occasional wisecrack to keep everyone in line.Everyone's excited about the upcoming fair St. Louis's rival city Chicago had one a decade earlier and Buffalo did three years earlier but this one promises to be the most extravagant of all. Ames gets an opportunity in business and wants to move the family to New York but one by one the family has or develops obligations and ties to St. Louis that makes them reluctant to leave. Not to mention they don't want to miss the fair.Vincente Minnelli directed Meet Me In St. Louis and it was his first opportunity to work with Judy Garland whom he would marry after the film was finished. Judy got to do three of her most identified songs from the Hugh MartinRalph Blane score that was blended with some traditional music of the times. The Boy Next Door Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and The Trolley Song all come out of Meet Me In St. Louis and were staple items at Garland concerts for years. One of the Oscar nominations that Meet Me In St. Louis received was for The Trolley Song for Best Original Song. It lost to Bing Crosby's Swinging On A Star that year. The other nominations were for musical scoring color cinematography and screenplay.Margaret O'Brien did a remarkable job in this film this was probably her best role while a child star at MGM. Not that she was the youngest and most appealing of the kids she was that. But Minnelli did a great job in directing her. She had all the fears and trepidations of a child growing up and not wanting to leave all she's known and loved in St. Louis. Her acting reached its zenith in the scene where she destroys the carefully made snowmen in her yard and in the Halloween scene where she is induced to play a practical joke on a neighbor the rest of the kids regard as scary. Her number with Judy Garland Under The Bamboo Tree is a gem.Meet Me In St. Louis was one of the earliest and best films coming out of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. It was films like these that gave the Freed unit and MGM its reputation for turning out the best in musical film entertainment. It can never be duplicated because you don't have studios with all that talent under contract.In its way the film itself is as nostalgic as the time it celebrates. I guarantee your heart strings will go Zing Zing Zing as you hear Judy Garland sing the score from Meet Me In St. Louis.".

	schema:headline " An early modern musical still worth watching barely";
	schema:reviewBody "None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line but few people notice because there is no story line no plot. Nothing beyond Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 19034 made in 1944 Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago even in 1944 and in the depths of World War II surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a fullblown modern movie musical and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties but much of the music was staged performed by performers. Gradually beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz studios shifted over to free form musicals where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945 the first Rodgers  Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair passed around among the characters but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier nonmusical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters  the Rodgers  Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing but much of it is tied to musical performances so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand The Trolley Song is great fun but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line and a more elaborate expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light escapist story like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing while St. Louis produces no such emotion perhaps because it is so long ago but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland the charming Margaret O'Brien demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue and Marjorie Main performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals the color dancing music even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life circa 190304 some cute some quaint but mostly clich and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music and what have you? A movie without a plot a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely it is not Garland in 1903 it is Garland talking about WWIINext year all our troubles will be miles awaySomeday soon we all will be togetherIf the Fates allowWhat does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943.Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10 with it a 5. It is highly overrated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten yet has a lot of polish and fine detail and a story line of eternal appeal in short a classic so it is highly underrated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun in a brainless sort of way. By all means see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story you should watch the 1949 Little Women which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father 1947. Or I Remember Mama 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semiautobiographical stories of family life far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy.And for a musical on a similar family theme see the 1945 State Fair not to be confused with the 1963 remake. The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis which will warm your heart.Spoiler alertIn the last two minutes the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie musicals don't get any better than this! In The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland's character Dorothy opines there's no place like home. In Meet Me in St. Louis we are treated to a depiction of exactly what an ideal home a home to cherish and nostalgically remember is. The Smith family lives in a sprawling and lovely house in the nicer part of St. Louis. Three generations of the family live together Grandpa Smith Lon a prosperous attorney  Anna Smith and their five children Lon Jr. off to Princeton Rose smitten with Warren Sheffield Esther getting to know the boy next door and the two youngest girls Agnes and irrepressible Tootie always up to mischief. Family drama unfolds! The brilliantly talented Vincente Minneli has created in this film an irresistible homage to home and family circa 190304 with the added piece de resistance of Judy Garland singing some of her most wellknown and beloved songs The Boy Next Door The Trolley Song and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Beautiful!Garland is the supreme entertainer of her generation and possibly for all time. She can relate a song to her audience and make them feel what is in her heart. Nowhere in St. Louis is this more clear than in her rendition of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas  a carol with obvious tearjerking sadness and poignancy. However the film's most exuberant display of joyous passion remains 'The Trolley Song'. At any rate enjoy! This is one film that never gets old and Judy Garland was never more beautiful than she was right here.".

Most of the characters though were interesting even to me someone who doesn't like chick flicks.Child actor Margaret O'Brien in her first starring role is okay but a little annoying with her emoting. She sure was a ham in her child acting career in the 1940s. Judy Garland meanwhile well.....I certainly can't knock her voice but she was too strangelooking. Perhaps it was her hairdo which made the shape of her head look too triangular. She just looked odd.Leon Ames as head Mr. Alonzo Smith of the household played the most likable character followed by Harry Davenport as the grandpa.As for the music The Trolley Song was my favorite although I admit I found myself humming the title tune for several days after watching this. Although billed as a musical the stories in here were played up much more than the songs of which there were only a half dozen.The costuming of the ladies and of the period turn of the 20th century were beautiful as was the Technicolor. If you enjoy color this is pretty film to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's sentimental favorite time here on Hot Toasty Rag. I'm sure everyone has their own favorite Judy Garland impersonator but at my house there's no comparison to my mom. And while she has been known to wave her hands in the air during The Man That Got Away or I Could Go On Singing it's The Trolley Song from Meet Me in St. Louis that is her signature Judy Garland performance. Years before watching the movie for the first time I knew the Clang Clang Clang song by heart because of my mom. Therefore my review for Meet Me in St. Louis is going to be unapologetically biased. Ironically she doesn't even really like the movie! I'm the one who insists on keeping our VHS copy.Judy Garland Lucille Bremer and Margaret O'Brien are sisters in an allAmerican family in the early 1900s. Judy and Lucille have romantic problems to worry about and Margaret doesn't always play nice with the other neighborhood kids. Add in Marjorie Main the family's grumpy maid two other children a fatherinlaw and a new invention called the telephone and both parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor have their hands full! The film is chockfull of songs with oldfashioned standards like the title song and Under the Bamboo Tree as well as new songs for the film including Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. While the movie is upbeat and fun it's also a little sad Judy sings the Christmas song to a sobbing Margaret who has just destroyed her own snowman. I always feel sorry for Leon Ames's character in the film. Not only is he overrun by females in the house but he's constantly put down stifled criticized and left out of important family discussions. At that time the turn of the 20th century men were believed to rule their own roosts but maybe they didn't. Meet Me in St. Louis is such a heartwarming piece of Americana maybe it was realistic for the father figure to have less of a say in his house than the overwhelming majority. In any case my heart still goes out to Leon a character actor who was normally overlooked.I love this one despite the sadness because there were so many famous moments I was taught as a kid and looked forward to seeing for the first time onscreen after years of buildup. This might not wind up be your favorite Judy Garland movie but you can rent it and see if you like it.".

Tunes such as The Boy Next Door Clang Clang Clang Goes the Trolley and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas have since gone on to become classics. Garland pretty much has center stage all to herself. There is no A list leading man for example to detract from her performance. She sings all of the songs and sings them well.Garland and Minnelli would soon become an item and would eventually marry resulting in daughter Liza Minnelli. None of the supporting players would achieve major stardom except for a bit player who played the Iceman Chill Wills.".

Perhaps too well.  The characters are oversentimentalized to the point of caricature and the situations they find themselves in are usually dull or predictable. Though it is commendable for Hollywood to try to escape the thenpredominant goalandobstacle formula this film sorely needs a strong narrative to carry its paperthin characters through its two hour length.  The musical numbers are static and uninteresting to watch and do not make the film any better even though some of the songs are quite good.The only things that make this film watchable are Margaret O'Brien's as well as Judy Garland's performance and Vincente Minnelli's direction. Like the bright pastel and candy colors the film employs Meet Me in St. Louis oozes sickysweetness watching it is like eating several pounds of skittles within two hours.".

She can steal a scene from almost everybody. One person where her presence was equaled if not surpassed was Margaret O'Brien. Miss O'Brien won a Juvenile Academy Award for her part as 'Tootie'. I found the love story between Esther and John quite believable and the songs Meet Me In St.Louis The Cake Walk and The Trolley Song very enjoyable. It was wonderfully acted and is one of those movies that just makes you feel good and you can forget about your problems because of watching it. I liked the representation of the year and I liked the Halloween scenes with Margarget O'Brien and how she was so proud of herself throwing the flour in Mr.Broakoff's that may be spelled incorrectly face. I also liked the sister relationships between Agnes and Tootie and Rose and Esther. Katie the maid played by Marjorie Main was a riot however I didn't like how she disappeared after the Snowman Scene. Overall a wonderful '10 out of 10' movie!".

This film is beautiful and Judy Garland is gorgeous. Are a few people blind? And Judy's singing is absolutely wonderful. I must say though that most reviews I've read I've almost never seen anyone badmouth Judy just on a couple reviews for this film. Other bad reviews I've read people are usually picking at other things about Judy's films but are still saying they love Judy and her singing and they still think she's pretty. Anyway enough about other reviewers. I think Judy is beyond pretty she's beautiful and heavenly. And her singing is also beautiful and heavenly. I love old fashioned classics such as this film and Judy's other films. The wonderful songs in this film are the trolley song  the boy next door have yourself a merry little Christmas and the title song. Judy and the other characters here are great including a very young Margerate O'Brien. This film and Judy are pure sweet wonderful old fashioned classic good cheer from Hollywood's golden age.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review won't be long because I do not have too much to say about this movie. So here it is. Meet Me in St. Louis is about the Smith family that are living in St. Louis at the time of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's Fair in 1904. I don't find anything groundbreaking about this movie because of the amount of praise it gets. Don't get me wrong I like the movie but I don't think its a masterpiece or anything like that. For what it is I think its fine and it is indeed watchable. The cast in this movie are good especially for Judy Garland although I like her more when she was in The Wizard of Oz. I do love the film's cinematography and its setting. I really do enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis as you go on out and have a wonderful time. The movie is also well directed and well written. The movie itself is not really a Christmas movie but at the end it does somehow leave you that Christmas feeling as Garland sings wonderfully with the song Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas the songs in the film are fine too. Again there is nothing groundbreaking about it but I do think it is a fine relaxation of a movie as you just want to enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis. So that is what I thought of Meet Me in St. Louis and I give it an 8 out of 10.".

Feeling good  no place like home come into play too.Vincent Minelli directs this Garland starring vehicle  then marries her after the film. Arther Freed the MGM musical genius produces it. The supporting cast is strong from character actors Marjorie Main  Chill Wills to Mary Astor  even a 19 year old June Lockhart.The story is basically about St. Louis  a family living there in 1903. During the first half hour Judy sings several songs. Then there is a musical break for a while before the songs come back as we go from summer to fall. Then in the winter in the last 15 minutes Judy finally gets to that tune Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. Besides Over The Rainbow this is her next most famous song. This Technicolor musical is a good film. Some of the tunes are now dated but Judys Christmas song is as timeless as any she ever sang  she is in excellent voice. The film features the mandatory happy ending which most films of the period have. It runs a little short of 2 hours so it doesn't get bogged down which makes it quite watchable  even though it has Christmas in it it is not broadcast as often as other Christmas films but is as good as many of the films which are broadcast every year.".

	schema:headline " The Louisiana Puchase Exposition of 1904";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a nearly flawless musical film by Vincent Minelli based on a series of writings by Sally Benson about her real life family from St. Louis Missouri at the turn of the 20th Century. Although the most famous sequence and a real heartbreaker at one point deals with the current Christmas season the film really looks at the events in the Smith family from Spring 1903 to Spring 1904 culminating in their attending the above mentioned Louisiana Puchase Exposition that was under construction at the time. It was one of many Worlds Fairs that were frequently occurring in the 19th Century the most notable previous ones in the U.S. being the 1876 Philadelphia Worlds Fair the movie CENTENNIAL SUMMER is about that one the 1893 Chicago World's Fair subject of a few movies and the 1901 Pan American Exposition at Buffalo New York which is involved in the plot of the film THIS IS MY AFFAIR because President William McKinley was assassinated there.The Louisiana Purchase Exposition was best remembered for the invention by accident of the hot dog and the ice cream cone the latter when a vendor ran out of paper mittens for holding the frankfurters and sausages and bought some roles the latter when a vendor ran out of paper plates for ice cream and used some soft waffles as cones. But in it's day it was an exciting place and it was a very successful world's fair.The Smith family is made up of the father Leon Ames the mother Mary Astor the grandfather Harry Davenport the son Henry Daniel Jr. and the four daughters Lucille Bremer Judy Garland Joan Caroll and Margaret O'Brien and their cook Marjorie Main. Bremer has a boyfriend studying at Princeton Robert Sully and Garland is fascinated by the next door neighbor Tom Drake. In the course of the year we watch the family enjoying their close friendships with other St. Louis residence even little Tootie  Margaret O'Brien  likes to ride and help the iceman Mr. Neeley Chill Wills. We see them having social parties with singing Minelli includes many songs in the film but he does maintain period music  one hears Ethelbert Nevin's Narcissa White and the popular tune Under the Bamboo Tree that is sung and danced by Garland and O'Brien. Even some of the songs for the film are set in that period most notably The Trolley Song.The trouble in the story is the decision by Ames to move to New York and begin a New York City office of his large St. Louis law firm. This shakes up the family who are used to living in St.Louis and think of New York in the warning words of Marjorie Main as a place where people live in tenements! While this film has great sweet comic moments O'Brien in Halloween disguise playing pranks on neighbors with flour and fake bodies it also has one truly gut wrenching moment. If any film belongs to two players despite ensemble excellence it is MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. Garland's songs THE TROLLEY SONG THE BOY NEXT DOOR HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas all are wonderful and became part of her legendary repertoire. But O'Brien stole the heart of the audience as Tootie not just by her funny antics she looks so cute and little in this film but in her dramatic scene  when she breaks down at the thought of leaving St. Louis and destroys her snowmen family so nobody else can have them when they move. The sequence always brings tears to my eyes as it is perfectly done.This comment does not ignore the other players. Ames turns in a gilt edge performance as a father who learns a valuable lesson in what is important to his family above larger salaries. Astor is properly loyal to her mate even if she disagrees with his initial decision. Davenport spices the film particularly at the Christmas dance scene where he rescues Garland and Main has her normal salty comments about the activities around her. It is one of the greatest of MGM musicals and a wonderful look at the lost world of Teddy Roosevelt's America.".

Not as serious as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but perhaps more entertaining it takes a sceptical look at the socalled glamour of cold war entrapment lying kidnapping and other things that are actually being done to you by your own side.David Hemmings is as comfortable as an old shoe in the title role and Ralph Richardson has a couple of minutes of invaluable screentime as his old boss whose methods were shall we say a little more orthodox than the somewhat obtuse fellow who is giving Charlie his orders at the moment. I once owned this on exrental video but was delighted to find out that the version posted on You Tube is at least thirty minutes longer. More laughs more thrills and more sublime takedowns of the British spying establishment before they had the sense to elect Margaret Thatcher lol.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made for television by Euston Films in 1979 this is a wonderful look at the world of secret agents that is very far from the world of James Bond. More like John Le Carre with much more humour. Its main character is Charlie Muffin an aging and cynical agent who isn't liked by his own service. The plot winds around sinuously until the satisfying ending involving British American and Russian spies. It needs watching twice to enjoy the subtleties of the script by Keith Waterhouse and the direction by Jack Gold.Charlie Muffin is played excellently by David Hemmings whose down at heel and tired appearance belies a beguiling charm and an incisive mind. The role and the actor are a perfect fit. He is supported by some great talent including Ian Richardson as his boss Pinkas Braun as the Russian general Sam Wanamaker as the American boss and Clive Revill as the captured spy. The scene between Richardson and Wanamaker in the restaurant is priceless. The only negative thing about this engrossing film is that Sir Ralph Richardson is only in it for one scene as Charlie's old boss.The author Brian Freemantle wrote several novels about Charlie Muffin but this was unfortunately the only one filmed. It would have been good to see more made with David Hemmings.".

While this looks like a comedy about someone's personal difference its more of a telling commentary on high school and how cruel it can be. One is only accepted through athletic achievement or by who they are. Fox's character only becomes more popular because he can dunk and take over a game. Of course the team eventually wins in the end but only after digging deep inside. But all of the dark critiquing aside this film is quite good because of the unusual twist on an old story. Funny and outlandish this film has more staying power than the typical teen movie from the 1980s.".

While this looks like a comedy about someone's personal difference its more of a telling commentary on high school and how cruel it can be. One is only accepted through athletic achievement or by who they are. Fox's character only becomes more popular because he can dunk and take over a game. Of course the team eventually wins in the end but only after digging deep inside. But all of the dark critiquing aside this film is quite good because of the unusual twist on an old story. Funny and outlandish this film has more staying power than the typical teen movie from the 1980s.";

	schema:headline " A Fairly Typical 80's Teen Movie That Loses Some Appeal As You Get Older";
	schema:reviewBody "I certainly have good memories of this movie. I watched it when it first came out and quite enjoyed it as I remember. Of course I was much younger at the time. Looking at it now reminds me that I'm getting old I guess. This is a teen comedy  directed at teens starring teens or at least actors playing characters who are teens and dealing with the normal teen issues such as acceptance and friendships and romance and the changes that accompany those years. Scott played by Michael J. Fox has a big change happening. He's suddenly discovered that he can change into a werewolf  a surprisingly friendly one for the most part but still a werewolf. The change makes him a superstar basketball player who now leads his team to victory after victory and it makes him really popular  especially with the hottest girl in school. Scott was a bit of a strange character to me though. The movie is supposed to be about the unpopular kid becoming accepted but having to become something other than who he was to do it but I didn't get the impression that he was particularly unpopular. He seemed to have lots of friends he got invited to all the parties more and bigger ones than I ever got invited to in high school!  lots of kids have a lot more problems than Scott. The only issue he had was that as Scott he had the hots for the hottie but he couldn't get her to talk to him. I don't think I ever got the hottest girl in high school to pay much attention to me either. So Scott didn't strike me as having that many challenges or problems to be honest.In the end I suppose the message is still worthwhile. He learns that he can't use the wolf to buy friendships and he convinces the basketball team who eventually take a dislike to him because as the wolf he dominates every play of every game and the others hardly ever get to touch the ball that they have to play as a team without him being the wolf if they really want to be successful. So the lesson is  don't put on masks. Be yourself. Point taken. Fox was pretty decent here and I liked Susan Ursitti as his friend Boof  who has the hots for him but who he doesn't notice because of his fixation with the hottie. Frankly thinking back to my high school years  from which I wasn't far removed when this came out  I'd have gone for Boof! She was cute!".

	schema:headline " Not great but has a certain charm thanks mainly to a solid script and typical charm from Fox";
	schema:reviewBody "Scott Howard is on a basketball team of nohopers himself included is outside of the cool pack at highschool and can't seem to even get close to the girls he is interested in. He also is going through some changes in his life  with his body doing odd things. The nature of these become clear to him when he transforms into a werewolf. Horrified to find that this runs in his family Scott tries to control it but when he loses his temper in a basketball game he changes  to the stunned silence of the crowd and players. When he then wins the game he wins everyone over well most of them and finds that the attention acceptance and coolness that he craved are now his to have. However can he have this without it going to his head or becoming a novelty more than a person?My girlfriend insisted that we watch Teen Wolf Too recently because neither of us had seen it. Having suffered through that I then rewatched the original film as it had been about twenty years since I last saw it. This should be kept in mind because my enjoyment of the first film was unquestionably influenced by how poor the sequel was  indeed I need to keep this in mind while writing because I should not be praising Teen Wolf simply for not being as bad as the film that followed it. So Teen Wolf is not a great film. It is a basic story that mixes teen comingofage films with the sports clich and throws in the werewolf legend to make it a bit different. It does what you expect it to ending with the moral lesson and sporting climax that you know is coming from about 10 minutes into it. Unlike the sequel though the film does have scenes that link the various stages of the film so it feels like a story rather than squares on a board game where you are either in one or the other never between. This gives it a better flow and makes it feel like we have something to go along with rather than making jumps.The film is never really hilarious but it does have a certain charm to it that makes it quite fun to watch. It badly needs laughs but the setpieces and the moments of plot do help keep it engaging. A big part of this is Fox himself  he is a personable actor and he brings that easy charm to this film. He works well and is well supported by the cute Ursitti while Levine's Styles works a bit better than his counterpart in the sequel  ie he is less annoying even if he is not really funnier. Holton is just a comedy fat guy with no comedy to deliver while Hampton is just solid as the father. Nobody si brilliant but they are OK with Fox leading the way well.Not a great film by any means Teen Wolf does have a certain charm to it. It needs more laughs to it but there is fun to be had and the plot at least flows rather than stutters and in Fox and Ursitti the cast make it a bit more engaging than the material should be.".

	schema:headline " Poor Kid. He had to turn into a werewolf to raise his selfesteem.";
	schema:reviewBody "Teen Wolf is really one of the cheesiest horror comedies of it's day and sometimes that cheesiness factor depreciates the enjoyability factor. I think it's winds up being a love it or hate it movie. I'm still mixed about it loving some of the characters smart ass styles a few of the sequences werewolf transformation at unexpected moments and a bit of the music. But Michael J. Fox turns his character Scott Howard into the epitome of hopeless nerd though not looking like one even though he's more of just a quiet kid who's not popular or anything like that and that for me makes the movie often difficult to appreciate despite the little goodies scattered throughout.Scott Howard has an identity crisis. Uh...he's a werewolf. Howl at the moon scratch behind his ears. The whole bit thanks to werewolves being a long part of his family lineage. For a kid like Scott Howard high schooler who's a fairly poor basketball player and super shy around the girls this is bad news. His selfesteem is shot altoghether especially when his inner wolf makes an appearance in a big way...during a game on the basketball court.But maybe being a teen wolf isn't so bad afterall because with the fur and fangs Scott has also developed something of an alter ego allowing him to do things he couldn't as just plain Scott Howard. Now he's an individual. And with that he's popular he can play basketball he can breakdance he gets good grades and he can even surf on top of a moving vehicle without falling off. Scott Howard seems to have it all.But Boof Susan Ursitti Scott's closest friend and the girl who really likes Scott more than his superficial infatuation with the popular girl Pamela Wells Lori Griffin encourages Scott to get rid of the wolf image. It was fun for a while but what she admired was the real Scott. This being in part a romantic comedy Scott will soon realize that Booth is really the girl for him and being the wolf is turning him into something he's not or at least not something he's proven that he could do on his own. As many of these films always teach the viewers Scott's got to learn to gain some selfconfidence in himself is he's ever going to expect to do things the teen wolf Scott can do only without being a wolf. In other words he'd probably be able to do just what teen wolf could do if he could only muster up the guts to try hard enough. And Boof is just the proper guidance he needs to realize that.Teen Wolf...too bad it was so damned sentimental. If Scott wasn't so horribly nerdy and uptight then the characters could've had a little fun with the story maybe even using some stupid humor. Heck for a theme repeated so many times you've got to be creative. One of the few treats in the movie however is Jerry Livine as Scott's friend Stiles who finds Scott's wolf dilemma to be an excellent money making opportunity. Stiles is always a guy who's looking for a good time anyways. And hell this is also one of Matt Adler's earliest appearances as Louis Scott's timid friend. The music is kind of good too for 80s dance and rock.Unfortunately they even made a sequel to this dumb movie.".

No other actor could have pulled off that ending in a movie like this. Everything about the ending is perfect. There is no doubt that the ending was the typical happy ending to fun and goofy 80's movie but I always thought the ending of the movie had a little extra special feeling to it. From the moment that the second foul shot goes in and Amy Holland's Shooting for the Moon begins until the screen goes from freeze frame w MJF being held in his dad's arms while he kisses the head of Boof to black as the credits roll is a stretch of great emotion for the viewer in my opinion. The Amy Holland song is excellent and I have it on MP3 and burned the song to my best movie soundtracks mix. The whole ending to that movie always is great no matter how many times you've seen it. There are so many awesome things about that ending but I'll spare everyone my babbling about all of the great things that transpire at the end of this movie. Criticize its so called cheesiness as some people eluded to in other comments all you like but each person who is critical of and concentrated on that aspect is just being sheltered about the child that is inside of everyone. Come on people just let loose and enjoy a true feel good movie with the classic storybook ending that all humans want to see. Why does everything always have to be realistic?! This movie is an enduring classic film from the 80's and deserves more credit that it has received over the years.When your shooting for the moon and finally make it. I guess a lucky star is shining on you. The candle on the cake is yours so take it make another wish it's sure to come true. Isn't that the way you do it?

If you bring up a good Teenwolf conversation and someone knows what you're talking about you might want to take heed though it really isn't too cool.

	schema:headline " Fox makes this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Teen Wolf when it came out in 1985  86 and thoroughly enjoyed it. If I can remember correctly it flowed on from the phenomenal success of Back to the Future and Fox's star was shining bright at that time. Nonetheless  for a cheap budget flick of questionable storyline  this film actually comes across well.I recently bought the DVD with Teen Wolf Too on it also to see if my rose coloured memories stood the test of time. They did. The first hour of Teen Wolf if you ignore some basic editing mistakes and clumsy cutting is superb. The story deteriorates a tad from the school dance to it's inevitable ending  but it is still good enough for its time.Fox is brilliant in this  funny natural and a star in the making.

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw Teen Wolf when it came out in 1985  86 and thoroughly enjoyed it. If I can remember correctly it flowed on from the phenomenal success of Back to the Future and Fox's star was shining bright at that time. Nonetheless  for a cheap budget flick of questionable storyline  this film actually comes across well.I recently bought the DVD with Teen Wolf Too on it also to see if my rose coloured memories stood the test of time. They did. The first hour of Teen Wolf if you ignore some basic editing mistakes and clumsy cutting is superb. The story deteriorates a tad from the school dance to it's inevitable ending  but it is still good enough for its time.Fox is brilliant in this  funny natural and a star in the making.

Of course werewolves don't really exist. In Germany after the second world war the German resistance called themselves the werewolves.

Doug Savant of Melrose Place fame is in TEENWOLF as Brad. Michael J Fox as Scott Howard gets up to mischief when he goes to a beer store and says that he wants beer with a growl low enough to get the beer from the startled employee. Fox seems believable when he is hanging out at the diner as a wolf and everybody is walking around accepting the fact. These days if you say you are a werewolf people react with a phobia. Foxs character is a good example of nonviolent werewolf. They call President George W Bushs advisors the VULCANS and nobody thinks this is a fantasy but the moment you say you are the Omega Wolf of the American Intelligence Community you have multiple police cars pulling up to your doorway. The lesson is if your CIA Handlers call themselves SPOOKS and WEREWOLVES you shouldn't tell people or they will just get scared. The term Vulcan for the Presidents Advisors doesn't seem to scare Americas enemies and maybe it should because they hang out with spooks and werewolves. I gave TEENWOLF a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the same year that Fox became a superstar going back to the future he also had this little werewolf gem creep out. The title says its all really in its brilliant cheesy way a typical 80's film title. Young teen Fox slowly discovers that he is in fact a werewolf and its been in the family for generations. In all honesty this is your very standard cheeky 80's high school romp which was the staple diet of many classic comedians throughout the 70's and 80's. The twist in this of course is the supernatural element which is simply a play on the effects of puberty swapping spots for claws. Its all here as you would expect the sexy blonde everybody lusts after the plain brunette our hero never notices the party obsessed crazy ass best friend the quiet sensible best friend the bully the fat kid the token black guy lemonade...awesome character name and various amusing stereotypical teachers. The best easily being the carefree gum chewing basketball coach.So if you put the predictable teen antics to one side what are the wolf antics like? Well its pretty darn sweet as a matter of fact and what's more amazing is the makeup effects on show are really quite good. The little sequence of Fox turning into the wolf has clearly been influenced by 'An American Werewolf in London' and its a really well done moment. Its not scary or gruesome in any of course but it still does look quite realistic utilising simple effects and quick editing. His father in wolf mode doesn't look quite as good admittedly more like a greying woodland animal with puffed up hair.There isn't all that much wolf action so to speak its mostly more silly high school antics but in wolf mode. Wolf mode gives our hero greater strength better vision brains etc...the guy becomes a super werewolf and aces everything in school whilst becoming a ladykiller not literately. The main events of the film are based around the high school basketball games in which Fox's character usually sucks but naturally as a werewolf he's turned the game on its head. This film actually got me into basketball for a time it introduced me to the game because of this I bought NBA Jam hehe. The game segments are really good fun and as the film climaxes it does get a little emotional I can't deny. The game montage accompanied by Mark Safan's 'Win in the End' is glorious mainly down to that corking track. Funny how the underneath of Fox's arms didn't have any werewolf hair applied always obvious when he raises his arms. I think people can relate to this film in many ways certain characters despite them being clich the problems of popularity loneliness bullying sexuality etc...usual teen stuff. In all fairness this film doesn't really differ much from the vast array of fast food American high school flicks out there the werewolf angle is only a different representation of teen angst. It shouldn't really be a good film but somehow it is what you see isn't original and there aren't any dazzling special effects its more a characterschool based fantasy which is simply a good fun little ride. Attractive performances all round especially from Levine as Stiles and a wicked soundtrack make this a solid cult gem.8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of those movies that I remember watching a few times back when I was a kid and back when Michael J Fox was still acting and I must say it is one of those eighties movies that I still have a fondness for even though now I would probably not watch it again because despite all of the fondness that I have for the film there is nothing really all that much about it that makes it stand out all that much. It's not as if it is The Terminator with a classic Arnold Schwartzenegger one liner or any number of other classic eighties movies that I remember with fondness because well there isn't all that much about it that would make it a classic.Basically it is about a boy in highschool who suddenly discovers that he is a werewolf and that it is something that runs in the family. After the initial shock he suddenly becomes really popular and is able to take on an opposing basketball team all by himself. In fact at the beginning of the film it is very clear that the schools basketball team basically blows and it is not until one game when he finds himself at the bottom of a stacks on that he becomes the wolf and then goes on to win the game  single handedly.Some have suggested that this is a subtle exploration of the nature of High School in your average American town or suburb or what not  it is not really made all that clear but you could suggest that this could occur in any high school in any part of America  except for the fact that werewolves are creatures of myths and legend. Some have also suggested that it is about how unless we are sporting heroes or there is something important about us that we are damned to spend our lives in obscurity. Yeah I can see that in this film and I can also see it as some form of subtle criticism of the American way of life not that there is much that you can criticise and that one is defined based not only upon how many people know who you are but also how many people like and look up to you.It could also be considered some form of morality tale in that we don't need magical powers to be able to win all we need to do is to work as a team and believe in ourselves. Well that is all well and good but it suggests that by doing that then we can go from being a basketball team that blows to a basketball team that can win a championship  the problem is that it never actually works out that way. Still this is a Hollywood movie and in the end the hero gets the girl  the right girl not the snivelling bitch that leads you on because you are a famous person and she can only define herself based upon what that famous person thinks of her and that they win the basketball game and the evil viceprinciple it is always the viceprinciple that is evil isn't it is put into his place and then the movie ends. I guess that suggests that everything is sorted and everybody lives happily ever after  until the make a sequel that is.".

Basically seventeen year old Scott Howard Michael J. Fox seems just an ordinary teenage high school student wishing he was something more but hopeless at playing basketball for the Beavers and failing to get the attention of Pamela Wells Lorie Griffin the prettiest girl in school who already boyfriend Mick McAllister Mark Arnold. He is hitting puberty but the changes he experiences are more than he expected as he grows more hair than he expected his teeth become sharp and his nails become longer and eventually he locks himself in the bathroom to be a full werewolf. Scott's father Harold James Hampton demands for him to open the bathroom door and he when he does to freak him out he is surprised to see that he is a werewolf as well his father explains that the werewolf gene is in the family only sometimes it skips a generation he was hoping it wouldn't happen to Scott. He tries whatever to keep his newfound werewolf side inside but during a basketball game he cannot but let it out and reveal it the people on the court and watching are freaked for a little bit but he continues to play and proves a hit with newfound skills and wins the game so after this he continues to play superbly. Becoming the star play for the Beavers team and learning to control of his other side Scott uses his persona as The Wolf to gain to popularity he had always longed for and he finally gets the attention of Pamela but he is neglecting best friend Lisa 'Boof' Marconi Susan Ursitti who has had feelings for him since they children. Party animal and Scott's other best friend Stiles Jerry Levine takes advantage of the popularity for The Wolf by becoming entrepreneurial he starts selling goods and merchandise for Teen Wolf in wolfmania he even trades in his old car for a van he calls the Wolfmobile. The Spring Dance approaches and everyone expects The Wolf to be there Scott obviously doesn't want to disappoint them but Boof is against the idea and it is after a near violent encounter with Mick that he starts wishing he was just simply himself he even contemplates this before the final basketball game with the Beavers against the Dragons. Scott refuses to become The Wolf Coach Finstock Jay Tarses is sure that the team will fail without the star player but he proves him wrong and with penalties by Mick he gets the dramatic ending where he scores the allimportant final two baskets to win the game by one point Pamela expects his attention but Scott puts arms around Boof and they passionately kiss. Also starring Matt Adler as Lewis and Jim MacKrell as Mr. Thorne. Fox is pretty good as loser turned hero from his alter ego I slightly agree he is similar to the character of Marty McFly but obviously the werewolf aspect sways you away from that thought the makeup effects are very good and even though it does feel slightly cheesy at times it has some light hearted funny moments a fun comedy. Worth watching!".

I would've guessed that they would have thought their little Johnny was on dope but their mistake is actually much funnier. Plus you have a pretty good soundtrack to boot with the dominating song being Timbuk 3's The Future's So Bright.If this is your forte of films the 80s horrorcomedies you should likely enjoy this one.

I would've guessed that they would have thought their little Johnny was on dope but their mistake is actually much funnier. Plus you have a pretty good soundtrack to boot with the dominating song being Timbuk 3's The Future's So Bright.If this is your forte of films the 80s horrorcomedies you should likely enjoy this one. It doesn't bite!";

	schema:reviewBody "Ah our precious 80's a time of great music interesting taste in fashion action movies and goofy teen horror films. During this time we had films like Teen Wolf Once Bitten Teen Witch movies that involved our classic horror stories with the world of a teenager. What would happen if a teenager was a werewolf zombie or even a vampire. So I was watching TV and came across My Best Friend is a Vampire don't know why just figured I would check it out actually I seemed to like it. So I went out and bought it and watched the unedited version of course and still actually found myself having fun watching this movie. While it's not exactly the most original idea and there are some really silly moments I think My Best Friend is a Vampire is a small little gem.Jeremy Capello is a typical American teenager fighting with the usual problem of getting himself a girlfriend. Although he has someone interested in him he has his eyes on his classmate Darla Blake but she in turn is unnerved by his constant staring at her. Recently Jeremy has been having some weird nightmares about a strange woman trying to seduce him and later he actually encounters that woman named Nora who makes an obvious invitation to him while delivering groceries. His skirtchasing friend Ralph convinces him to take up the opportunity for a first erotic experience. But the encounter goes badly first the woman bites him in the neck then two strangers burst into the house forcing Jeremy to run for his life. Next morning Jeremy looks pale and does not feel well. Also over the day he notices a strange man observing him. This man pops into his bedroom the very next night introduces himself as Modoc and carefully attempts to relate to Jeremy that he is now a vampire. Jeremy of course is at first skeptical to say the least but a sudden aversion to garlic an increasing sensitivity to sunlight and a craving for blood slowly convince him otherwise. His new vampire lifestyle hampers his attempts to start a relationship with Darla who has finally become interested in him otherwise Jeremy begins to adapt to the minor impacts the change has brought to his life.I think the reason I loved this film was because of it's camp value and the actors that seemed to enjoy making this movie. I nearly died laughing when the vampire slayers that are supposed to be after Jeremy think that his best friend who's mortal is the vampire they want to slay. They finally capture him and are just so over the top with it all the times they think he's a vampire he just thinks that they're perverts. I also loved how Jeremy's parents are trying to figure out what's wrong with their son they come to the conclusion that he is gay. Plus you gotta love how it's awkward enough being a teenager imagine going through your teen years as a vampire. I'd recommend My Best Friend is a Vampire it's nothing too special but it's a funny little movie that was over looked at a time of teen witches and werewolves.810".

So his best friend Ralph suggests that he should seek out someone unknown for a onenight stand to get this get his mind thinking straight. While doing his job he encounters the mysterious Nora who invites him over for the night. So Jeremy with little help from Ralph meets her only to be bitten by her and a crazed loon possibly the husband break in. The day after Jeremy goes through some minor changes and finds out that Nora's place has been burnt down. Through the course he learns that these are vampire hunters after them but they seem to think that Ralph is the vampire.The midtolate 80s was a time for vampire films and even teenage monster themes too. This pleasant little romp is the standard mould of these monster comedies maybe one of the lesser ones but surprisingly it makes for a decently breezy timewaster if you're looking for a little 1980s nostalgia in your viewing. It has some generally amusing moments especially from Rene Auberjonois' sneaky vampire mentor role as Modoc and you can see David Warner is having a ball in his ripe crackball role of Prof. Leopold McCarthy vampire hunter.Most of the performances are reasonably charming. Robert Sean Leonard Dead Poet's Society and who would probably be best known for the recent TV series House is delightfully good as Jeremy and Evan Mirand turns in a joyful performance as the loutish Ralph. A fetching Cheryl Pollack is fair as the geeky Darla. Fannie Flagg and Kenneth Kimmins trump in with marvellously tuneful performances as Jeremy's overly worried parents. Paul Wilson makes solid of Prof. Leonard's bumbling assistant Grimsdyke. Let me not forget the minor role of the seductively alluring Cecilia Peck Gregory Pecks' daughter as Nora. Oh and look out for a slender Kathy Bates. The variable cast had a witty script to play along with and most of it was quite satisfying when it came to the punch.Director Jimmy Huston does a competent job without doing anything overtly special but he gets a lot spirit and odd developments running through some humorous situations. It can get corny in parts and extremely sappy when it comes to its closing moral. A trailblazing 80s pop soundtrack notably Blondie and Oingo Boingo features strongly in the film's makeup with the utterly hip and catchy title tune The future's so bright I've got to wear shades by the TIMBUK 3. The stereotypically lucid premise which shares similarities with the Jim Carrey vampire flick Once Bitten is routine and derivative but still it has some nice touches and diverting trivia on the vampire mythology. None of this should sideswipe your entertainment of it unless you're looking for something with more aggression amongst its bite. I guess you'll know if you're going to like it after the first 15 minutes.It might be far from revolutionary just look at the title and you should know what to expect but there's just something endearing about this campy lightweight piece.".

Despite its campiness it is entertaining throughout and never lags. The only downside is the bad acting of RSL's girlfriend and best friend in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Jeremy Capello Robert Sean Leonard has more problems than the Typical Teenager. After being seduced by mystery lady Nora Cecilia Peck he finds out that she's a vampire and now he's one too. A wise old blood sucker named Modoc Rene Auberjonois appears to help him make the adjustment to his new life while a stubborn vampire hunter McCarthy David Warner and his bumbling assistant Paul Willson repeatedly pop up determined to kill Jeremy's friend Ralph Evan Mirand whom they've assumed to be the newly minted night crawler. My Best Friend is a Vampire is absolutely no great shakes with no real comedy fireworks but it's still quite likable and fairly entertaining with some funny moments. Among them is seeing Jeremy getting used to his new attributes  the craving for raw meat keeping his fridge well stocked with pig's blood realizing he no longer casts a reflection in mirrors and all while attempting to get a relationship with Darla Blake Cheryl Pollak going. It's also a gas to watch the amusing Warner eight years after playing a hunter  killer of vampire bats in Nightwing and Willson whom you may recognize as one of the barflies on 'Cheers' fumble their way through their mission. The supporting cast is quite strong in general with the always solid Auberjonois a joy to watch Fannie Flagg and Kenneth Kimmins are the perplexed parents Kathy Bates has a small role as Darla's mother and Amelia Kinkade a.k.a. Angela from Night of the Demons makes a brief appearance as a brunette dancer in the punk bar. A lively pop  rock soundtrack adds to the enjoyment as do some decent vehicle chases. It's also nice to see a vampire comedy where the hunter is actually the antagonist and the creatures of the night are the good guys this leads to a nicely ironic resolution. While there's nothing here that's that memorable it's all pleasant enough and easy to take. Leonard and Pollak are appealing in the leads. Directed by Jimmy Huston who'd also done the 1981 slasher film Final Exam. Six out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jeremy Capello Robert Sean Leonard has more problems than the Typical Teenager. After being seduced by mystery lady Nora Cecilia Peck he finds out that she's a vampire and now he's one too. A wise old blood sucker named Modoc Rene Auberjonois appears to help him make the adjustment to his new life while a stubborn vampire hunter McCarthy David Warner and his bumbling assistant Paul Willson repeatedly pop up determined to kill Jeremy's friend Ralph Evan Mirand whom they've assumed to be the newly minted night crawler. My Best Friend is a Vampire is absolutely no great shakes with no real comedy fireworks but it's still quite likable and fairly entertaining with some funny moments. Among them is seeing Jeremy getting used to his new attributes  the craving for raw meat keeping his fridge well stocked with pig's blood realizing he no longer casts a reflection in mirrors and all while attempting to get a relationship with Darla Blake Cheryl Pollak going.

However a sordid little encounter with a hot mysterious lady named Nora turns our average teenager Jeremy into a vampire. Enter ModocRene Auberjonis to show Jeremy the ropes of adjusting to his new life as a vampire and to warn him about obsessed Professor McCarthyDavid Warner a Van Helsing type of character of which with his inept and goofy sidekick is determined to eradicate all vampires from the face of the Earth. Like all teenagers in 80's comedies Jeremy is having girl troubles as well. His pursuit of Darla BlakeCheryl Pollak is off to a rough start as Darla while she likes Jeremy she thinks he is a weirdo. While My Best Friend Is A Vampire is a much lower budgeted production than Once Bitten it has a lot of original ideas and is really funny. This film is VERY very 80's and a whole lot of campy fun. This leading role may not have made Robert Sean Leonard a breakout star but he was likable enough and he and the rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job. I would not regard this as the best horrorcomedy or the best 80'S movie but if you are are fan of vampire movies andor the cinema of the 1980's My Best Friend Is A Vampire is a cool little film for you to check out.".

To hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of 1 Teenager In 10 the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter  gayhating evangelist who is of course a selfloathing closet case. The list of sight gags and injokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some goodnatured fun and hoping no doubt to lightenup as well as to enlighten.But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays. In some places where there is education and culture the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are plenty of dark nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was.".

To hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of 1 Teenager In 10 the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter  gayhating evangelist who is of course a selfloathing closet case. The list of sight gags and injokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some goodnatured fun and hoping no doubt to lightenup as well as to enlighten.But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays. In some places where there is education and culture the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are plenty of dark nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was.";

	schema:reviewBody "Upon coming out of Grizzly Man with my friend I couldn't help noticing my own face in the reflection of the lobby mirrors... my face was completely blank. I looked over at my friend and noticed she was merely staring down at her shoes and scratching her nose. Exiting out onto the street joining the rest of the crowd as we all search for our cars I couldn't help but believe I was still staring into the lobby mirrors... nearly every head was shaking and every expression blank. I now believe I will never know how I feel about Timothy Treadwell. A boy who accidentally grew into a man. Grizzly Man immediately opens with the facts surrounding Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard's death. These facts will stay inside you as you grow acquainted with Timothy and the animals surrounding his demise. Sadly Amie Huguenard remains a faceless mystery.Werner Herzog's soul remains intact as he gently disassembles the matter of Timothy Treadwell's. Failed actor? Inveterate liar? Misguided Mercenary? Was Timothy Treadwell merely playing out the part of some great Discovery Channel episode in his head? We watch and listen as a lonely Timothy walks and talks into his only companion a MiniDV camera about his female problems drug problems memories and most importantly his love of animals.Bears and Foxes in particular. There is one thing you could never doubt about this man and that is of his love for Bears. I love you I love you... We constantly hear him saying to the Bear's and Foxes that had become his friends over the years. And through Herzog's direction it is impossible to miss the beauty in this.Timothy Treadwell's photography in this film is absolutely extraordinary. And Mr. Herzog did an extraordinary job putting it all together. In my opinion this is his best film since Little Dieter Needs To Fly. Un fortunately I cannot stop thinking about it. I cannot stop wondering who this man was... He wrapped himself in bandana's claimed to be a Peaceful Warrior there to protect the Bears. But from what? The arguments were made that acquainting himself with them he was doing much more harm then good. Why should they get to know a human? How could this help them in the future? And we know how it ended for him...How can you just sit there and watch one mans whole life be wrapped up in a two hour film? And then declare his work meaningless? You can't. Was he just a suicidal man playing one big act? Was he truly some feral warrior bringing awareness and the importance of Bear protection and safety to light? Was he a directionless maniac who ultimately got an innocent girl killed?The duality of Timothy Treadwell is merely one more example of the duality of mankind. And the mirror in which I had been looking into had in fact been the movie screen itself. Unfortunately it appears as though he believed the Bears surrounding him shared this depth. And who am I to tell you they don't?".

	schema:reviewBody "For thirteen years grizzly man Timothy Treadwell went to an Alaskan wildlife refuge on Kodiak Island and pitched his tent alone  and the last couple of times with a girlfriend Amy Huguenard  spending the summers among huge grizzly bears. The rest of the year he went to schools and free of charge showed his films of the bears and his exploits. When the last of his summers drew to a close he and his girlfriend died among the grizzlies as he'd always known  and even David Letterman had pointed out  that he might. Filmmaker Werner Herzog longtime student of crazy eccentric loners on heroic doomed quests has taken on Treadwell's life and personality as the subject of a rare and powerful documentary. At the heart of Grizzly Man are Herzog's selective cullings from film Treadwell left behind chronicling both the bears and his own demons. Herzog has added interviews with women in Treadwell's life with his parents with the pilot who took him to and from his campgrounds and later found his and his girlfriend's remains and with Franc Fallico the unusually sympathetic and sensitive  and perhaps a bit looney  coroner who examined these. The director has bound it all together with his own frank and idiosyncratic narration. The result is a rare sober look at the more delusional aspects of man's relations to wild animals. At times Herzog by implication sympathetically links Treadwell with his former principle star and sparring partner the late mad eccentric actor Klaus Kinski. Like Kinski Treadwell had tantrums on a film set. But his set was the outdoors and there was no director to spar with his sparring partners were nature and his own troubled psyche. Nature contained of course living witnesses chief among them the grizzly bears he knows can kill him. He repeatedly tells the camera how much he loves them. He loves the gentler smaller foxes near whose dens he pitches his tents during the second halves of his summer sojourns. He tells the camera you must be firm with the bears and he says he knows how to handle them even though he also repeatedly says he knows he may die there. He is a gambler. Is he a complex man or merely a confused one? Is he brave or just foolhardy? What is his purpose in spending all this time among the grizzlies? Is he gathering information or taking refuge among creatures he need not please only keep a safe distance from though he continually comes closer to bears than the park rules and good sense require? He has a soft sissified manner and voice and even says he wishes he were gay. But he also rants and rages embarrassingly and tiresomely against unseen enemies poachers sightseers rangers hunters park officials the whole urban settled world he runs from to this world he idealizes and blindly sees as perfect. As Herzog notes Treadwell sought to disregard nature's cruelty and any time it was in his face  as when the bears were starving in a dry spell and began eating their own young  he sought to manipulate nature to eliminate the ugliness. He faults not the bears but the rain gods. Young Timothy according to his parents was an ordinary boy who loved animals from childhood and got a diving scholarship to college. But he injured his back and quit college and he drank and when he went to LA to act and didn't get a part on Cheers he spiraled down. He never had a lasting relationship with a woman and the drinking became serious and constant. In vain he tried programs meetings selfdiscipline  but the drinking went on and was killing him. Finally he got sober for the grizzlies and the foxes. He decided to devote his life to them and he pledged to them that he would be clean and healthy. It was a miracle. Yet he remained not only manicdepressive but passiveaggressive as his alternations between gentle declarations of love of the animals and his spewing of vitriol against the civilized world attest.Treadwell's softvoiced declarations of love and sweetness among the grizzlies would be beautiful  if such behavior in a world of extreme physical risk surrounded by limber lumbering beasts with great teeth and long claws while preening for the camera with caps and bandanas and golden locks in a dozen alternate takes  were not criminally silly and irresponsible. Herzog hides none of this in his portrait which is both sympathetic and ruthless.As the years passed the Grizzly Man found transitions back to civilization harder and harder to make. On the last occasion an airport official infuriated him by questioning the validity of his ticket and he turned around with his girlfriend  who was afraid of bears!  and returned to the maze the most dangerous of his summer campgrounds because it wasn't in the open where the bears could see him and steer clear but among their burrows and the brush. It was later than he ever stayed and the bears he knew and had names for were hibernating now replaced by new unknown and more hostile and nasty animals. He must also have been more desperate perhaps more careless? We see the bear that probably devoured him and the woman.Herzog has access to everything even an audioonly tape of Timothy and Amy's truly grizzly death. He spares us though.As Herzog begins his film by stating Timothy Treadwell crossed a line between wild animal and human that should never be crossed. This is a line so many other touchyfeely nature and wildlife films cross. See The March of the Penguins and you'll have a prime example. Grizzly Man isn't meant to be about grizzlies. It's about men who cross that line  who willfully misunderstand nature for their own misguided reasons to serve their own dysfunctional needs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog has created an outstanding documentary feature adeptly letting Timothy Treadwell's work speak for itself. Herzog interjects his own opinions only on occasion and makes no attempt to demonize or rehabilitate Treadwell's complicated legacy. The footage of the grizzlies is amazing something far more intimate for better and for worse than anything I have ever seen in other documentary footage. It is almost beyond belief that Treadwell lasted 13 years in Alaska among these bears before he finally met his end. He had deluded himself into thinking that he had earned or been given by God? some kind of special immunity from harm among these animals. What complicates this delusion is the fact that he knew he had to behave as a gentle warrior among the grizzlies in order to fend off their occasional aggressive maneuvers. This description although somewhat romanticized at least acknowledges a rational need for some form of protection among the bears. Treadwell decides to camp in the heart of the Grizzly Maze almost as a means of proving his special ability to survive the dangers that would no doubt capture and claim ordinary men. He dares the wilderness to take his lifeand it does. I agree with Herzog's decision not to play the audio recording of the attack. Seeing the expression on the exgirlfriend's face as Herzog listens to the tape himself is very poignant. Herzog however seems to grandstand a bit when he counsels the woman to destroy the tape and never listen to it. The woman should be allowed to make up her own mind what to do with the tape and does not need Herzog's or anyone else's advice in that regard. However this is a minor quibble against so many skillful moments brought to life in Herzog's film. On a final note I think that Treadwell missed his callinghe was definitely a Fox Man rather than a Grizzly Man! Those foxes adored him!".

However this is a minor quibble against so many skillful moments brought to life in Herzog's film. On a final note I think that Treadwell missed his callinghe was definitely a Fox Man rather than a Grizzly Man! Those foxes adored him!";

	schema:reviewBody "It became apparent from the first scene of Grizzly Man that I was watching raw film footage of a mentally ill man. Given that the bulk of the film consists of Timothy Treadwell talking into a camera for the bulk of the film you the audience member seek entertainment or enlightenment from a raw encounter with a madman. Tourists used to visit asylums like Bedlam. As I watched this disturbing film I asked myself am I no better than those creepy tourists at Bedlam? Grizzly Man also rapidly became amazingly boring. I say amazingly because you wouldn't think that a film depicting such a naked encounter  man against nature or properly nature against man  would bore. But mentally ill people often are quite boring and Treadwell so lost inside his own sad limited deadend mind bored me.I had to do a forced march through the boredom. And I came to appreciate this movie as something it isn't marketed as at all but definitely is. More on that below.Timothy Treadwell was a boyish blond actor who spent thirteen summers doing primitive camping among what is sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore Kodiak Island grizzly bears. Polar bears are also sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore let's let the bears duke it out for the title among themselves. Treadwell and his willowy blonde companion Amie Huguenard you couldn't make these names up were killed and devoured by a grizzly bear the sounds of that attack were recorded by Treadwell's camera the lens cap was left on . . . one can't help but think of the sad sick jokes this might inspire. I knew all that going in from a lengthy Vanity Fair expose I thought what can I get from this movie? Werner Herzog adds minimal commentary. For the most part you are watching film footage shot by Treadwell himself of Treadwell himself. There are a few short scenes of the bush pilot who flew Treadwell in and out of his last campsite the coroner who examined four garbage bags full of human remains pulled from the intestines of the killer grizzly a Native American grizzly museum curator Treadwell's suburban and normal parents his flakey girlfriend Jewel Palovak a male friend from California. No one advances any grand overarching theory. Treadwell pere does indicate that losing the role of the bartender on Cheers that went to Woody Harrelson drove his son into a downward spiral.Given the minimal commentary viewers will inevitably interpret Treadwell according to their own agendas. RushLimbaugh exploittheearth types will denounce Treadwell as an environmentalist wacko. This is wrong of course Treadwell has as much to do with true environmentalism as Mohammed Atta has to do with safe aircraft piloting.Treadwell was not an environmentalist. He was not a symbol of the frontier. He was not a man obsessed by love. What Treadwell was was a narcissist. Did Herzog miss this? I don't know if Herzog uses the word narcissist once. But what made this movie ultimately worth watching for me was its  perhaps inadvertent  presentation of a classic case study of narcissism.The word narcissism gets tossed around a lot often in ways that obscure its true meaning. Narcissists are not people who love themselves too much in fact true narcissists don't love themselves at all.Narcissists detest themselves and avoid at all costs any encounter with their true selves. Narcissists seek artificial choreographed encounters which they script and control in which they can be seen as the superior beings that they want to be understood to be.Unlike Treadwell most narcissists don't create their dramas by interacting with wild animals most narcissists create their dramas by interacting with people whom they can fool manipulate and control. For this reason narcissists often associate with people they perceive as being less intelligent than they are or weaker in some sense. Narcissists often seek out children the ill or the poor whom they cast as characters in their productions.In any encounter though the narcissist is not running toward intimacy either with the self or the other the narcissist is running away from contact with the self and the other at top speed.I can't think of any more perfect encapsulation for narcissism than the image most common in Grizzly Man. Treadwell sets up his camera on a tripod and then stands in front of the camera filming himself with grizzlies in the background.Treadwell goes on and on repetitively about what a great man he is saying so explicitly. I am a great man. I am doing great work. No one loves these grizzlies but I. No one is protecting these grizzlies but I. God is very happy with me  he really says things like this. And the truly telling part of this triangle charade is this  there is nobody there. There is no audience. Treadwell filmed himself without any other people around. There is no grizzly. Treadwell did not understand these animals at all. He attributed feelings to them that they do not feel. And there is no Treadwell. This is a man who spent his last breath resisting any real encounter with himself.There is a scene in which the real Tim Treadwell appears. He releases a torrent of violent verbal abuse against the real protectors of the grizzlies the parks department. If you want to see the true scabrous soul of a narcissist catch that scene.".

Treadwell must have seemed to Herzog like a Laguna Beach version of his Fitzcarraldo and his Aguirre and even of Herzog himself in his more unhinged moments. This film appears at first to be a fair minded documentary about Tim Treadwell the 'protector' of all things natural and wild in the remote regions of Alaska. What Herzog shows us however is that what Treadwell really needed protection from was reality itself and that his escape into the wilds was just a deadly game of denial. The film is also a meditation on the brute force of nature on art and on human hubris. My wife found the 'character' of Tim Treadwell so ludicrous and offensive that she had to leave the theater. For my part I was in awe of both Treadwell's incredible physical courage coupled with his absolute lack of judgment and his insane narcissism. He struck me as a cross between PeeWee Herman and Marlon Perkins the guy who narrated the Mutual of Omaha nature documentaries that showed up on Sunday afternoons in the 60's and 70's.The word is that Hollywood in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio was a financial supporter of Treadwell's 'mission'in Alaska and that a Hollywood version of the story is due out sometime soon with Di Caprio playing the lead. I know I won't be going to see that version because it will just continue the lie and the myth that Treadwell tried so hard to create and sustain. Even at his most intense moments of profoundity Treadwell had nothing to 'say' to anyone about either bears or himself. It was all selfserving and selfcongratulatory and it is only in his grotesque death at the hands of a rogue grizzly that any meaningful message finally comes across. Herzog thankfully spares us from the actual experience which was caught on audio but not on video because the lens cap had been left on.Its hard not to feel sorry for Tim Treadwell and the young woman who died with him but the 'native' scientist in the film put it quite nicely My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.Tim Treadwell wanted desperately to cross the boundary into the 'way' of the bear because the 'way of the human' was too much for him. Despite his goofy childish demeanor he revealed himself to be a man of deep anger and resentment. However if the bears had let him live he would probably be considered something of a folkhero in 'reality' obsessed America.Herzog shows us that there was nothing real about Treadwell at all and that the bears knew a lot more about him than he ever would of them.".

	schema:headline " a kind of master's class in a schizo documentary sometimes quite amusing and entertaining other times very somber and depressing";
	schema:reviewBody "This documentary written directed and narrated by German madman maestro Werner Herzog has very little in it that isn't worth seeing and at its best brings some of the most captivating candid and entertaining documentary footage of the year. The subject matter is an environmentalistbear nut named Timothy Treadwell a nobody who became a kind of weird celebrity for living each summer on an Alaskan wildlife preservation with Grizzly bears. He also documented a lot of his time on the island which Herzog chooses wisely for his film on him. Treadwell may or may not have totally believed a fate like death among his cohabitants would come there is one scene where he says he'd die for them another when he says he's safe. But his fate did come along with his girlfriends rather grisly as we hear from the details which wisely we never see.One is tempted to comment on Treadwell as he is much as with Herzog's protagonists in his fiction films possessive ambitious naive dazed emotional but somehow in tune with his own sense of nature and the ways of the world. Herzog himself comments a good deal on Treadwell when he agrees with him when he doesn't Herzog as Roger Ebert pointed out does have a bleak worldview as opposed to Treadwell's overly optimistic one.

Herzog also gives us majestic spacious images of Alaskan wilderness and gives some ample time for footage of the bears and foxes.If not for Treadwell's rather high  low nature as a friend comments this might be a very standard documentary on a bear expert. But because of the documentary or near television hosting footage I sometimes felt like I was seeing a nicer if stranger version of the Croc Hunter of Treadwell on camera by himself the film gets another dimension.

The absurdity of it usually brings the laughs but even behind them there is always a constant curiosity about him. We learn that he wanted to be an actor which lead to a bad near fatal spell before his 'bear' retreat acting as more of a spiritual catalyst more than anything else.

	onyx:emotionText "This documentary written directed and narrated by German madman maestro Werner Herzog has very little in it that isn't worth seeing and at its best brings some of the most captivating candid and entertaining documentary footage of the year. The subject matter is an environmentalistbear nut named Timothy Treadwell a nobody who became a kind of weird celebrity for living each summer on an Alaskan wildlife preservation with Grizzly bears. He also documented a lot of his time on the island which Herzog chooses wisely for his film on him. Treadwell may or may not have totally believed a fate like death among his cohabitants would come there is one scene where he says he'd die for them another when he says he's safe. But his fate did come along with his girlfriends rather grisly as we hear from the details which wisely we never see.One is tempted to comment on Treadwell as he is much as with Herzog's protagonists in his fiction films possessive ambitious naive dazed emotional but somehow in tune with his own sense of nature and the ways of the world. Herzog himself comments a good deal on Treadwell when he agrees with him when he doesn't Herzog as Roger Ebert pointed out does have a bleak worldview as opposed to Treadwell's overly optimistic one. What one can comment on is the execution of the material. We get interviews with Treadwell's close friends one platonic one not the people who found his and his girlfriend's bodies in the forest and a couple of nearby experts one Native American comments on how Treadwell did what they had never done in 7000 years to cross a boundary that was respected.

	schema:headline " Loved Herzog but could not sympathize with Treadwell";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers Grizzly Man is a documentary of Tim Treadwell who spends 13 summers in Alaska living amongst grizzly bears and eventually loses his life to the creatures to which he devoted all his heart.I saw Grizzly Man without knowing anything about it. I first thought it would be a documentary about the beauty and behavior of grizzly bears. However through Tim Treadwell's interaction with grizzly bears Werner Herzog shows that this film is actually about the inadequacies and insecurities of human nature.Tim Treadwell seems to be the culmination of many of the deficiencies that man possesses. I felt absolutely no sympathy for this individual despite the fact that he suffered a tragic and horrible death. If it weren't bears that killed him it probably would've been something else. He was definitely headed toward a downward spiral. I felt like he was a man who ran away from his demons because he could not face or overcome it. He developed high ideals and when he could not adjust his values and beliefs to that of society he abandoned it and sought out for acceptance from creatures that are incapable of judging or criticizing Treadwell. Unfortunately Treadwell mistakes the grizzly bears' indifference or incompetence as a sign of acceptance and falls in love with them.Treadwell displayed behavior suggestive of manic depressive disorder or cyclothymic disorder or histrionic personality disorder. His emotional reactions to incidents were over dramatic to the point that one questions whether it's genuine. I also thought that he was a closet homosexual who could not accept his sexual orientation. In the film Treadwell talks about wishing he were gay because it would be easier but he denies being gay. He also talks about how he has trouble with keeping relationships with girls. I know this is a big assumption but I couldn't help but question whether he was running away from civilization hoping he didn't have to face the reality of his sexual orientation. Treadwell is a person who does not know himself and is afraid to find out.I also did not like the fact that Treadwell was on this unsubstantiated high horse. This selfproclaimed protector of animals and nature displays his hypocrisy in at least 2 scenes. When Treadwell stumbles upon poachers who throw rocks at a baby cub all he does is hide behind a bush and criticizes the hunters for hurting the bear. Not quite what a protector would do. Also when Treadwell discovers the dead fox he gets angry for the destruction and death that exists in this world. However he doesn't blink twice to try to swap a fly that is buzzing around the fox. Obviously he shows no respect for the fly which is also a living organism.Also throughout the film most of Treadwell's friends glorify all that he represented. It seems that his death has elevated him to a martyr and I found that inappropriate. I don't believe one's achievements in life should be overblown and exaggerated because he or she suffered a tragic and violent death. Based on Treadwell's selfrecordings I find that he has done nothing to deserve any praise. The way he died is sad but that should not have any bearing on what he did in life. If anything Treadwell encroached upon the grizzly bears' territory and abused their independence and way of life in order to hide behind the mask of his own demons. I find nothing altruistic about his actions because of that.In the film Herzog says that death and destruction is a unavoidable reality of nature and he has done a brilliant job in portraying that. My take home message was that everything bad in this world exists because man is too weak and feebleminded to transcend beyond our natural tendencies to destroy his surroundings and to selfdestruct. And Treadwell is the perfect example. Great job Mr. Herzog.".

	schema:reviewBody "Herzog's Grizzly Man is a miraculous documentary. He started by collecting hundreds of hours of video tape shot by the movie's subject Timothy Treadwell. The director then culls through the footage and assembles a fascinating portrait of this uniquely bold and clearly troubled human being Treadwell spent 13 summers living amongst grizzly bears in the wilds of Alaska before being killed by one in the summer of 2003. Treadwell's footage is gorgeous and at times heartstopping a grizzly battle caught on tape is the stuff Animal Planet would kill for. But the footage goes beyond simply revealing the harsh yet beautiful reality of the Alaskan wilderness. The camera soon becomes a silent confidant to Treadwell's selfobsessed confessions. For one he sees himself as the singular savior of the wildlife preserve he camps at and the creatures that reside there. But he also sees himself becoming increasingly less connected to the real world he lives in 9 months out of the year. The footage here is most poignant revealing Treadwell's inner struggles. It paints a picture of a lonely man searching perhaps desperately for purpose in a world he feels has rejected him. Most eerily prescient are Treadwell's repeated remarks about how he would die for the bears though his eventual death does not appear to be the martyrdom he so clearly sought.This is where the film is most riveting  in Treadwell's footage focused on the man the bears and the force of nature around them. Less compelling are Herzog's talking head interviews with Treadwell's friends and family  although they do help to solve as much as possible the puzzle of where Timothy came from what lead him to the bears and why he was killed.It would not be a Herzog film with the director's own philosophical palette framing the story. Herzog's commentary reveals his longstanding view that nature is cruel and that chaos is the constant in our life experience not harmony. That Treadwell saw beauty and soul in the bears seems to be beside the point since ultimately their need for sustenance made them turn on their selfappointed protector.".

What Treadwell sees as his reason for existence and his greatest source of happiness ultimately destroys him. Herzog portrays him as he really was a multifaceted complicated man whose dreams sadly did not conform to our world.It is fair to say that Treadwell was eccentric and delusional. Treadwell imagined himself as a champion and protector of the grizzlies when in reality they were in little danger. He saw in his beloved grizzlies an idealised world of love and harmony. All the love and beauty that Treadwell thought was missing from civilisation he projected onto the bears. He was naive and delusional in that he failed to acknowledge the brutality and misery that are constants in our world. It is heartbreaking to see him encounter the halfchewed paw of a dead bear cub. Herzog's narration outlines his more pessimistic view of life and nature where sorrow and ugliness are constants not aberrations. Treadwell's violent death would prove Herzog right adding to the tragedy and sadness created by this film. Treadwell was not a violent or evil man  he just didn't fit into our world. His belief that the world can be made a better place leads to his destruction. Herzog's film brilliantly captures the poignant sadness of Treadwell's death.".

But my favorite thing about the movie I think was how Herzog usually left the camera rolling for a few seconds after the interviewees finished what they had to say just to capture those moments of silence and sometimes awkwardness which felt really authentic.

Tim's passion for the grizzlies took him to appoint himself as the savior of the animals. This was a man that didn't pay attention to the dangers around him because as all consumed individuals in search of greatness for achieving something he lost track of what was real and what wasn't. Tim even gets his girlfriend Amie Huguenard involved in his quest for protecting the bears. At the same time Mr. Treadwell is seen also with the foxes of the area who didn't pose the same danger as the great brown bears.What Mr. Herzog has achieved is to show us the man in the mission he set out for himself expanding in the material Mr. Treadwell had amassed on his own. The director shows us breathtaking views of Alaska as probably never has been shown before. The cinematography takes our breath away. The Katmai National Park has never been seen in its glorious splendor before.Grizzly Bear like The March of the Penguins currently playing in local cinemas is a welcome diversion from the typical summer Hollywood fare of films that are big on special effects that don't add anything to our enjoyment because the adhere to the same tired old formula.".

This was a man that didn't pay attention to the dangers around him because as all consumed individuals in search of greatness for achieving something he lost track of what was real and what wasn't. Tim even gets his girlfriend Amie Huguenard involved in his quest for protecting the bears. At the same time Mr. Treadwell is seen also with the foxes of the area who didn't pose the same danger as the great brown bears.What Mr. Herzog has achieved is to show us the man in the mission he set out for himself expanding in the material Mr. Treadwell had amassed on his own. The director shows us breathtaking views of Alaska as probably never has been shown before. The cinematography takes our breath away. The Katmai National Park has never been seen in its glorious splendor before.Grizzly Bear like The March of the Penguins currently playing in local cinemas is a welcome diversion from the typical summer Hollywood fare of films that are big on special effects that don't add anything to our enjoyment because the adhere to the same tired old formula.";

	schema:reviewBody "Grizzly Man Werner Herzog has once again given us one more reason to claim him as a genius. 'Grizzly Man' is a fantastic documentary one of the best I've ever seen and it certainly stands aside from the rest. It's a film you'll see may or may not get may or may not like but you will never forget what you've just seen. Timothy Treadwell is in a way a distant or maybe close extension of Herzog himself or perhaps his long time friendfiend Klaus Kinski. Herzog even gives us a connection when commenting on Treadwell's rage filled rants to the heavens over rain comparing it to his experiences on film sets with angered actors  clearly Kinski. Herzog never really takes a side with Treadwell. He sometimes agrees with him and sometimes disagrees. We're presented mostly with Treadwell's films with voice overs or just Timothy talking. In a way perhaps you can say Herzog is siding with Treadwell by being the medium through which Timothy's films and thoughts are now being presented to the world. And in a way this documentary is about films. Herzog has spent months living in isolated jungles to make his films and claims that he would rather die than not finish filming. You can see the connection between the two here and its no wonder Herzog was so interested in Treadwell. We all know that Treadwell is gone and before seeing this documentary you knew this and felt little over the death. But after watching this I felt very sad yet was happy at the same time. Treadwell was by his own admission very troubled. Was he crazy? It is not mine your's or Herzog's place to make this assumption and thus he doesn't. We are all in some ways eccentric and its possible that Treadwell was simply brave enough or desperate enough to act on these inner thoughts. And though he comes across as a simple fellow as the documentary goes on you see that he wasn't so. He makes strange decisions that leave you wondering 'why?'. I'm sure anyone who sees this with an open mind not having already condemned or praised Treadwell will come out asking yourself many questions. The score of the film which you can watch a documentary on the making of on the DVD is wonderful as is every soundtrack to a Herzog film. It's never background music it always plays a part and it works wonderfully. The final scene lead off by Don Edwards 'Coyotes' will leaving you smiling as you watch Treadwell walk upstream with two grizzly bears by his side. No matter what you feel for Treadwell this is a beautiful touching fascinating and crushing experience. Anyone and everyone should feel some connection here. This is very much a reflection on society and its pariahs and in a way we all have a little bit of Treadwell in us. In short this is far and away the best documentary of the year and thats saying something as there are quite a few good ones out there. If this does not win the Oscar then something is clearly wrong with the Acadamy. Herzog is one of the most talented and interesting filmmakers on the planet and its about time he got his due. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "It would be rather easy and quite comforting to simply label Timothy Treadwell as a delusional crackpot who ultimately received his just deserts. Treadwell's woefully naive idealism coupled with his willful rejection of the most basic realities of his natural surroundings make him a rather wieldy target for even those with terrible aim. Treadwell's inability to anticipate the inevitable consequences of his actions has been interpreted by many to signify the man's complete separation from any resemblance of realism and sensibility thus marking his extensive efforts as purely frivolous and futile. But by merely dismissing the man's Utopian vision of a harmonious existence between humankind and nature we're ultimately doing a great disservice to ourselves as well. Werner Herzog one of the cinematic world's preeminent cynical jackasses was able to both understand and empathize with Treadwell's contorted optimism refusing to conveniently sticker Tim as some sort of brain damaged newage spiritualist. Herzog discovered inside of Treadwell's madness an alluringly gullible romanticism that carefully shielded a secluded demonic realism. Treadwell's refusal to succumb to the demands of our world's primitive natural order clearly fascinated Herzog just as much as Tim's secretively smoldering fixation with the indigenous inhumanity of the unforgiving material world.Herzog ingeniously incorporates Treadwell's tangential metaphysical ruminations into the movie in order to communicate his own conflicting philosophical perspectives while also conveying a semblance of sympathy and familiarity if not outright accordance as well. Herzog immediately empathizes with Treadwell's desire to search for some higher meaning beyond the discernible limits of both sanity and security but does not fail to readily concede the enigmatic stupidity of Timothy's misguided enthusiasm as well. In many respects the movie explores many similarities between Treadwell's adventurous pursuits and Herzog's welldocumented desire to impose his own will on the natural world. For all of Herzog's pontificating on nature's unmistakable indifference such confessed naturalism has never stopped the man from attempting to conquer these impartial forces through sheer fierce determination. Similarly for Treadwell even the unequivocal evidence suggesting the inapplicability of his philosophical disposition the murder of a baby fox the infanticide of a baby cub instances of cannibalism during an extended drought is not enough to dissuade him from the attractiveness of his hallucinatory insistence on the beauty and simplicity of the natural wilderness. While Herzog mocks and scolds Treadwell for his blatant ignorance with regards to the childlike Quixotism of his pilgrimage he also seems to secretly admire him for his refusal to conform to others' expectations even when all the impulses of the universe seem to be conspiring against him. Like Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo Herzog is able to extract carefully hidden noble qualities buried within a man of very questionable character.In many respects Timothy Treadwell's quest for natural harmony was an unattainable search for spiritual absolution as well as social vindication. Herzog shows great respect for Treadwell's intense desire to discover a sense of place and purpose within a higher immaterial order while similarly displaying affection for Timothy's corporeal drive to convincingly demonstrate both his superiority and masculinity to all of those who had expressed doubts and engaged in interference. Herzog has always reserved his greatest admiration for those great historical figures who have unleashed their greatest ambitions upon the natural world around them and Treadwell is clearly no exception. But this is not because of some juvenile fascination with conquest and subjugation Herzog's veneration has always been directed towards the instinctual human passion to satisfy one's greatest aspirations forces of the uncaring universe be damned. Treadwell's absurd eagerness to prove the feasibility of his ideological utopia is sufficient enough to earn Herzog's qualified approbation but it is not practical enough to stave off Herzog's equally powerful adherence to rational skepticism. Just as Herzog ultimately recognized the folly of Aguirre's ways Timothy Treadwell is similarly depicted as a man who has become so lost within his untamed search for grandeur that he has forgotten the very purpose of his once innocent expedition.Many people have taken issue with this back and forth dialogue between Herzog and Treadwell bemoaning the use of voiceover narration as manipulative theatrical and unnecessary. Many people have accused the movie of being quite staged and overtly fictional while needlessly abandoning the most basic purpose of Treadwell's adventure in order to posit some hackneyed sophomoric philosophical dichotomy that was completely beyond Timothy's intentions and perhaps comprehension as well. But without Herzog's added abstract speculations Treadwell's undertakings lose a great deal of larger significance and withstanding permanence. Without Herzog interjecting his own balanced suppositions we're unable to see just how Treadwell's acts of defiance are not only acts of pure lunacy but acts of poignant proclivity as well. It would indeed be easy to categorize Treadwell's activities as little more than the product of years of alcohol and drug abuse coupled with prolonged bouts of frustration and isolation but it is infinitely more difficult to recognize his actions as a manifestation of a much deeper exclusively human predilection to create meaning in one's life by imposing order upon one's natural surroundings. Werner Herzog's and it is Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man is not only a fervent rebuke of the unfeasible insanity of Timothy Treadwell's hopeless optimism but also a tempered celebration of humanity's imperishable stubbornness arrogance and inspiring audacity.".

	schema:headline " Grizzly but also funny";
	schema:reviewBody "There's no doubt that Timothy Treadwell was insane. Just look at the facts here was a guy who lived unarmed with bears who referred to himself in the third person always a sure sign of insanity and who had a loon for a best friend. But entirely because of that his story is a fascinating one.At first what's so amazing about Treadwell is how camp he is. He has a squeaky little voice a peculiar obsession with his wispy hair and he's always cooing I love you to his animal 'friends'. It seems remarkable that such a person would survive so long in the wilderness. But fortunately for Treadwell he's both tough and completely insane. Therefore he has the blind confidence of the deluded  he never really thinks about what he's doing.Treadwell's lack of real insight is summed up in his life's purpose  he wants to protect the bears. But the forces that he's protecting the bears from are amorphous poachers and the Park Service. They're never really there. And it's telling that when some strangers finally do turn up Treadwell can only hide in the bushes and film from afar as the men throw rocks at the bears  he doesn't do much protecting.But as Treadwell admits it's more about the bears protecting him. Which I guess is ridiculous and it is but it's also true. As the film shows us Treadwell was in all kinds of trouble before he went bear crazy. He lost his scholarship became a drunk and got involved with criminal elements. Had he kept steering that course he probably would have wound up getting killed. And although it's darkly comic that his new obsession finally did bring about his death it did at least provide him with a momentary release.The film that Treadwell shot is both amusing and sad. It's amusing because Treadwell is such a strange figure declaring himself a 'kind warrior' and touching bear faeces with an almost orgasmic excitement. But it's sad because Treadwell is so out of touch with reality. For example he gives all the bears cute little names like 'Mr Chocolate' and 'Rowdy'  he even calls a particularly nasty bear 'The Grinch'. All the time he's trying to humanise them. He desperately wants to be their friend. And although at times Treadwell seems to understand that they're killers it never truly sinks in that they could kill him. I will not die at their claws and paws he says.Another illuminating moment is when one of his fox friends steals his cap. He seems deeply upset he seems personally affronted. He just doesn't quite grasp the fact that these are wild animals that they aren't really his pals. But despite this Treadwell does capture some wonderful moments on film. There's a fantastic bit where he's in his tent playing with the paws of a fox that come poking through from outside. It's here that you can understand why Treadwell has isolated himself from people. It's innocent moments like this that keep him hanging on to the few marbles he has left rattling about in his brain.But although Treadwell doesn't really understand nature Herzog does. In his unmistakable German accent he says he sees no kinship in the bear's eyes I only see the overwhelming indifference of nature. Everything between Treadwell and the bears is one sided. The love is only his. To them he's just meat. Or as a helicopter pilot says maybe the bears just thought he was mentally retarded.And although the film is a wonderful insight into a crazy mind and although it's poignant and sad it's also very funny. And it's some of the peripheral characters who provide the biggest laughs. One moment that sticks in my mind is when Herzog is talking to Treadwell's crazy exgirlfriend. It could and should have been a moving moment as Herzog is listening to the tape recording of Treadwell's death but Treadwell's ex is just so bonkers that I couldn't help but guffaw when she broke into some of the weirdest tears I've ever seen  at first it seems like she's laughing. And then you have Herzog in his gravest tones telling her that she must never listen to the tape. And she replies I know Werner. No wonder the scene has been parodied.And then you have the coroner. He really seems to love the fact that he's in front of the camera and decides to ham it up for everyone. And this actually leads me to my one criticism of the film. There are a few sections that are just too staged  the scene with the watch and the bit in the morgue stand out the most. Herzog is obviously trying to give the film more drama to break away from the restrictions of a documentary but the people in the film are over the top enough as it is without them acting it up for the camera. The story really doesn't need any spicing up.But despite that one criticism Grizzly Man is a wonderful film.

	onyx:emotionText "There's no doubt that Timothy Treadwell was insane. Just look at the facts here was a guy who lived unarmed with bears who referred to himself in the third person always a sure sign of insanity and who had a loon for a best friend. But entirely because of that his story is a fascinating one.At first what's so amazing about Treadwell is how camp he is. He has a squeaky little voice a peculiar obsession with his wispy hair and he's always cooing I love you to his animal 'friends'. It seems remarkable that such a person would survive so long in the wilderness. But fortunately for Treadwell he's both tough and completely insane. Therefore he has the blind confidence of the deluded  he never really thinks about what he's doing.Treadwell's lack of real insight is summed up in his life's purpose  he wants to protect the bears. But the forces that he's protecting the bears from are amorphous poachers and the Park Service. They're never really there. And it's telling that when some strangers finally do turn up Treadwell can only hide in the bushes and film from afar as the men throw rocks at the bears  he doesn't do much protecting.But as Treadwell admits it's more about the bears protecting him. Which I guess is ridiculous and it is but it's also true. As the film shows us Treadwell was in all kinds of trouble before he went bear crazy. He lost his scholarship became a drunk and got involved with criminal elements. Had he kept steering that course he probably would have wound up getting killed. And although it's darkly comic that his new obsession finally did bring about his death it did at least provide him with a momentary release.The film that Treadwell shot is both amusing and sad. It's amusing because Treadwell is such a strange figure declaring himself a 'kind warrior' and touching bear faeces with an almost orgasmic excitement. But it's sad because Treadwell is so out of touch with reality. For example he gives all the bears cute little names like 'Mr Chocolate' and 'Rowdy'  he even calls a particularly nasty bear 'The Grinch'. All the time he's trying to humanise them. He desperately wants to be their friend. And although at times Treadwell seems to understand that they're killers it never truly sinks in that they could kill him. I will not die at their claws and paws he says.Another illuminating moment is when one of his fox friends steals his cap. He seems deeply upset he seems personally affronted. He just doesn't quite grasp the fact that these are wild animals that they aren't really his pals. But despite this Treadwell does capture some wonderful moments on film. There's a fantastic bit where he's in his tent playing with the paws of a fox that come poking through from outside. It's here that you can understand why Treadwell has isolated himself from people. It's innocent moments like this that keep him hanging on to the few marbles he has left rattling about in his brain.But although Treadwell doesn't really understand nature Herzog does. In his unmistakable German accent he says he sees no kinship in the bear's eyes I only see the overwhelming indifference of nature. Everything between Treadwell and the bears is one sided. The love is only his. To them he's just meat. Or as a helicopter pilot says maybe the bears just thought he was mentally retarded.And although the film is a wonderful insight into a crazy mind and although it's poignant and sad it's also very funny. And it's some of the peripheral characters who provide the biggest laughs. One moment that sticks in my mind is when Herzog is talking to Treadwell's crazy exgirlfriend. It could and should have been a moving moment as Herzog is listening to the tape recording of Treadwell's death but Treadwell's ex is just so bonkers that I couldn't help but guffaw when she broke into some of the weirdest tears I've ever seen  at first it seems like she's laughing. And then you have Herzog in his gravest tones telling her that she must never listen to the tape. And she replies I know Werner. No wonder the scene has been parodied.And then you have the coroner. He really seems to love the fact that he's in front of the camera and decides to ham it up for everyone. And this actually leads me to my one criticism of the film. There are a few sections that are just too staged  the scene with the watch and the bit in the morgue stand out the most. Herzog is obviously trying to give the film more drama to break away from the restrictions of a documentary but the people in the film are over the top enough as it is without them acting it up for the camera. The story really doesn't need any spicing up.But despite that one criticism Grizzly Man is a wonderful film. It tells the story of a ridiculous man who probably did more harm that good but at the same time the story is strangely positive. It offers hope to damaged people. It shows that by finding a purpose in life you can overcome your problems and find some degree of happiness. I guess the trick is to focus your energies on something less dangerous than maneating bears.";

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed 04012005  Whitefish MT. This is the story of Tim Treadwell a man whose work with bears was more about selfgratification that it was of protecting the bears from poachers and the government as he claims he was doing. Tim photographed and videotaped for 13 seasons in the wilds of Alaska and then took his films on the road and showed schoolchildren across the country a world that most will never see. Tim was born in Fla. to a stable family was a B student in school excelled on the swim team went to college on a swimming scholarship and eventually dropped out due to the drinking problem he developed in college. Tim ended up going to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tried to land roles Coming in 2nd to Woody Harrelson for the bartenders' role in Cheers which further increased his chemical dependency. Tim then decides to go to Katmai National Park in Alaska to be with the Alaskan Brown Bears which he continually calls Grizzly bears need his protection albeit they are on a federally protected bear refuge and that in order to do it properly he must not be screwed up and we assume stopped drinking. Undoubtedly Treadwell in his 13 seasons in Alaska took some of the most breathtaking media of the Alaskan wild ever witnessed. His interaction with the wild foxes is something that must be witnessed and the extreme closeup's of the Brown Bears are unlike anything you have ever seen. But having no sort of wildlife background he ignores signs that the bears are not always happy with is presence. He openly disregarded laws about not moving his camp one mile once a week and getting within 100 yards of the bears. As the movie goes on it shows a more and more antisocietal antigovernment Treadwell go on a bluestreaked tirade about the Natl. Park Service and that it is actually HIM that is responsible for saving these bears. He brags himself up that he is camping in the most dangerous place in the world and it is only him who is capable of doing such feats as others would be eaten dead! His girlfriend Amie Huguenard is shown on film a total of three times for a total of less than one minute of the over 100 hours of footage that Treadwell filmed. One point shows Treadwell getting of his charter plane and saying to someone to get out of the shot because people are supposed to think that he is the only one up there.It is revealed later on that Tim Treadwell started to tell people he was from Australia and tried to even pass of the accent. Think about it A big strong sandyhaired well built man trying to be with one with ferocious carnivores Didn't Steve Irwin already apply for and get that job back in 1992 when his 1st documentary was seen? The difference is Steve was born into a family that had the background and education needed to be taken seriously.On a side note the man they had who was the medical examiner seemed far too staged and cheesy acting to be a real medical examiner. If he is the real thing I think it is time for him to find another line of work. Maybe it is because I have personal experience in this field but not one of the morticians or M.E.'s that I know behave like that. I felt it cheapened what was fairly consistent set of interviews with families and friends.We never do get to hear any of the last audio moments of Tim and Amie as they were attacked. Maybe it would make the next Tim Treadwell in attendance at a Grizzly Man viewing stop and think twice before dragging his girlfriend off into the woods to both be killed and eaten. There is nothing wrong with following your dreams just make sure you are awake when you do it and firm grip of the reality that can befall you when you forget that these are called WILD animals for a reason. 6 out of 10 Stars for oneofakind content that cost two people their lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog is famous for portraying surreal characters. In this movie he tells the story of Timothy Treadwell who spent every summer with bears in Alaska for 13 years until he was killed by one of them. Treadwell recorded 100 hours of his journeys with the bears on MiniDV. Herzog narrates the pictures in his usual gloomy way and his German accent and he also criticises Treadwell occasionally for his apparent views that nature is in harmony. For example when Treadwell discovers the remains of a BabyBear that was eaten by an  AdultBear he cries and Herzog then mentions that nature can be harsh and brutal. Personally I don't think that Treadwell lost his mind towards the end of the footage since the video sequences give almost no clue to their chronology. Treadwell talked at length about his past his troubled childhood drug and alcohol problems and lack of sexual relationships. He then argued that spending half of the year in a remote location made him happy. That he is disenchanted from civilisation also becomes apparent at one of the later sequences where he violently rages about the Park Authority and other members of society.There is strong sense in this documentary that Treadwell felt let down by society and tried to escape to or from reality. In my opinion he achieved that by spending 13 years in close contact with the bears only to be killed by a newcomer bear. There also is some truth in that society is in itself brutal and harsh and continuously lets people down. This movie isn't funny and the fact that many members of the watching audience were laughing at various sequences suggests that we have a lot to learn to respect the natural world.I think this documentary proves that human society has nothing to do with nature and that ultimately we are totally disengaged from the real world by being absorbed with our own little lives. At least Treadwell has shown to me that I am not the only one in this world who believes that Humans are not the most important things on earth.".

It also proves that we know even less about human nature than we do about bears as Tim Treadwell is a mystery even to his own species. It's obvious that he has some kind of disorder or drugrelated brain damage what with his extreme lability of mood delusions of identity neurotic and repetitive speech patterns and general paranoia about the activities of his fellow humans. He knows a lot of interesting people from his geeky friends who state the mundane as though it is profound I don't think he had a death wish at all. I don't think anyone really deserves to be eaten alive by a bear. to the FriendActor who is not even believable when portraying himself to his very ordinary parents who are just as confused by him as we are. In this film we learn that Treadwell switches addictions from alcohol to bears and descends into functional madness while attempting to integrate himself into their secret inner world. He is paradoxical throughout both disliking humans and yearning for a love relationship being fully aware of the dangers that the bears pose but doing nothing to protect himself from them. Well he is fatalistic in his devotion to them but seems to think that they will not harm him as long as he behaves properly around them. That an older aggressive bear could become hungercrazed enough to attack him indiscriminately seems beyond his scope. At times he shows a thorough understanding of animal behavior and the natural world at other times a grand ignorance of the reality of life in the wilderness. He seems forever stymied trying to enforce human concepts like justice and righteousness upon the jungle. His sentimentality with the bears and perceived relationships there show in stark relief when the animals display constant indifference or even aggression and when it is clear that some nearaltercation with them has occurred offcamera. In the end he is really no more successful with bears than he is with people understanding the basic rules but never seeing the whole picture in clarity enough to know how to avoid crashing and burning. Perhaps most indicative of his dysfunction is how he responds to the fond relationship he develops with the foxes who actively play with him and seek his company and interaction. While he loves them they are but a footnote on his path to destruction he prefers the ambiguous and imagined affection from the dangerous bears to the foxes' genuine displays of it.Grizzly Man is not about a man at all it is a sad true story about a wayward being without a species. On this journey the audience meets a lot of bears that look alike but who we know were distinct to Treadwell a creepy coroner who is probably not acting and a slew of observers who all have their own biased and often badly distorted views of what really happened. In the creamy middle is the quirky pilot who knew Treadwell best and the director himself the voice of reason in this wellcrafted work. The moral Van Halen was right. It's business as usual in the woods. Animals make sense it's people that don't.".

His reckless attitude eventually led to the demise of two Alaskan brown bears and another human being.His close relationship with wild foxes led the very young girl in the row in front of me to believe this was a cool and neat thing to do and I have to wondering with this film and the next projects which show Mr. Treadwell doing these illegal activities how many young children will think it is okay which will lead to the unneeded destruction of wildlife as well as the associated injuries that will occur to other humans.In not once instance in this film did I ever observe his actions as being protective of the bears as they are not endangered they are not hunted and there has been no documented case of illegal hunting of these bears in the last 28 years in fact the bears in this film are quite conditioned to the human beings that visit them every year to observe and take pictures of them. The bear that eventually caused the demise of Tim was not part of the community that he says he lived with but an interior bear which has a different makeup then the coastal bears who are quite familiar and tolerant of humans.Mr. Herzog's narration and showcase of Mr. Treadwell works in the fact that is shows an individual who for some macabre reason had a wish to destroy himself and his companion as well as the bears he professed to love so much his love was to elevate his standing as a self made star his arrogance to the wild creatures of Alaska was quite transparent and as stated will have to be undone by the educational community.I don't feel his interviews with the associated parties of this story show anything more than individuals who knew of Timothy's destructive nature and how they are more than happy to make a buck off of this tragic story I saw very little emotion from any of his friends or family which I am sure is not the whole truth but all individuals interviewed in the making of this film seemed to be quite aware that Tim was on a self centered destructive course which had a predetermined outcome that was set in place many years ago The M.E. at best was star struck and the Native American curator was disgusted with the actions of Tim.In closing if we use this film to actually educate the public by showing all the wrongs Tim practiced then perhaps the loss of life and wildlife will have some meaning this is not an action thrill adventure but a very important story on how not to act in the wilds of America and the world!".

The bear that eventually caused the demise of Tim was not part of the community that he says he lived with but an interior bear which has a different makeup then the coastal bears who are quite familiar and tolerant of humans.Mr. Herzog's narration and showcase of Mr. Treadwell works in the fact that is shows an individual who for some macabre reason had a wish to destroy himself and his companion as well as the bears he professed to love so much his love was to elevate his standing as a self made star his arrogance to the wild creatures of Alaska was quite transparent and as stated will have to be undone by the educational community.I don't feel his interviews with the associated parties of this story show anything more than individuals who knew of Timothy's destructive nature and how they are more than happy to make a buck off of this tragic story I saw very little emotion from any of his friends or family which I am sure is not the whole truth but all individuals interviewed in the making of this film seemed to be quite aware that Tim was on a self centered destructive course which had a predetermined outcome that was set in place many years ago The M.E. at best was star struck and the Native American curator was disgusted with the actions of Tim.In closing if we use this film to actually educate the public by showing all the wrongs Tim practiced then perhaps the loss of life and wildlife will have some meaning this is not an action thrill adventure but a very important story on how not to act in the wilds of America and the world!";

You might expect he is doing so as part of a government or universitysponsored longitudinal study in the habits of these majestic and fearsome animals.But that's not what Timothy Treadwell was doing.In 'Grizzly Man' a Werner Herzog documentary of Treadwell's exploits we encounter not so much a learned man of science and his discoveries as we do a complete fruitcake with a death wish.Comprised entirely of Treadwell's extensive footage along with separate afterthefact interviews sewn together with Herzog's ponderous voiceover narration this film achieves a near 'This is Spinal Tap' level of unintended absurdity. But instead of inviting us to ponder the merits of an amplifier with an extrahigh setting  this amp goes to eleven the comically effeminate Treadwell increasingly attributes human motivations to wild animals that would just as soon eat his face.After a sequence in which he has taped two gorgeously majestic grizzly bears dueling like mother nature's own furbearing titans Treadwell seems just a little giddy afterwards about the fact that in the course of battle one of the animals had as Treadwell put it made a B.M. Evidence of his dementia mounts as we see him affectionately handling grizzly excrement scolding foxes like children sleeping with stuffed animals and routinely putting himself in the path of hungry bears.Hey Tim I don't know if you've heard this or not but BEARS EAT PEOPLE!Aside from occasionally beautiful video of wild bears up close and what might be considered useful information on standing one's ground when confronted with a grizzly in the wild Treadwell's contribution seems to have given way to naked selfaggrandizement. This lessthannoble goal comes into stark relief when his parents speak of the downward spiral his spirits took after having allegedly lost a chance to play a role on the TV show 'Cheers.' A lifelong animallover Treadwell then appears to have restyled himself as America's Steve Irwin  the famously daring Australian crocodile enthusiast. Treadwell is even alleged in the film to have tried changing his name and adopting an Australian accent for a time.Without really covering his business dealings one might expect Treadwell was attempting variously over the course of his undertakings in Alaska to sell his persona and adventures as documented on videotape but wasn't having much luck. His wouldbe customers probably came to the same conclusion we do. That a TV show about wild bears and the hockey puck who thinks he should live in their midst would be a lot better if it starred a genuine naturalist with ANY kind of credentials who didn't behave like a flaming homosexual.In one rather revealing sequence Treadwell waxes wistfully on the benefits of a gay lifestyle but jars it up afterwards like a bad liar protesting too much. Indeed if one wanted to play amateur psychologist one would probably quickly come to the conclusion  especially after we meet his nononsense Eisenhowerera parents  that Treadwell was in fullblown denial about his sexual identity and that he had probably decided to come out after he was rich and famous a la Ellen Degeneres.But after 13 years the film shows us Treadwell's work was going largely unnoticed. The inference one is invited to make is that he was starting to realize that the only way he'd ever gain any notoriety would be if he were killed by these bears.And of course ultimately this is exactly what happens. He and his girlfriend are mauled to death and devoured by a bear I'm convinced Treadwell knew was a danger to them both. An audio record of the attack exists but is not played in the film.What would cause someone to walk out into the woods and basically beg to be gobbled up by wild bears? Inasmuch as this film poses and then answers that question it is intriguing and definitely worth watching. But it fails to fully explore what could have truly motivated Treadwell and lets him get compared to Thoreau and other great naturalists who didn't view nature as some sort of foil for their own personal problems. Treadwell was a nature enthusiast certainly beloved by a number of kindred misfit souls but what comes across in Herzog's outtakes is someone who is clearly disturbed and in need of some therapy. To the degree it buys into Treadwell's cover story  he's just fighting for those misunderstood bears  the film fails utterly.Treadwell was finally a tragically pathetic figure so starved for recognition he was willing to endanger his own life the lives of others in his community  habituating bears to the company of humans not to mention giving them a taste for people  and the life of his faithful partner. To the degree the film helps us reserve our pity for those he hurt the film is a stunning success.The worst thing you can say about 'Grizzly Man' is that it does for Timothy Treadwell just what his death by digestion intended makes him famous.This movie review by Erik Gloor".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains SpoilersCharly a movie directed by Ralph Nelson in 1968 and adapted from the novel Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes is a moving case study of what could happen to a mentally retarded person who suddenly becomes a genius.  Cliff Robertson won an Academy Award for Best Actor as he portrays Charly Gordon a 30 year retarded man who has an IQ of 56.  Charly's life is a simple one yet he continually strives to improve it both socially and intellectually. As the movie begins Charly is working as a janitor in a bakery and going to night classes.  In the evening where Charly attends school he is selected to participate in an experimental scientific research project that will improve his intellect.  His teacher Alice Kinnian played by Claire Bloom is very protective of Charly and he as her pupil does everything she asks of him.  Prior to the surgery Charly competes against a mouse Algernon to see who can get to the center of a maze first.  Charly is dismayed when the Algernon wins and when he finds out that Algernon beat him because he has already undergone the experimental surgery Charly decides that he wants to have the surgery too.During the day Charly does his best to fit in with the other employees at work.  Unfortunately they see Charly as a goodnatured moron and they constantly find ways to tease and humiliate Charly.  It seems that they do not think that they are harming him as he appears oblivious to the fact that they are using him for their own amusement.  One scene that stands out is when they allow him to work one of the machines and the dough in it overflows.  As Charly tries to push it back into the machine he gets completely covered by the dough.  After his surgery this scene is dramatically juxtaposed against a similar one as he unwittingly humiliates them when one of their schemes backfire because he learns how to operate a similar machine in a few minutes. Together these two scenes create the most poignant moments in the film in my opinion.  While they laugh heartily at Charly's failures they are dumbfounded and disheartened at his success.  I believe that they felt better about themselves when they felt superior to Charly.  However when they could no longer make him the butt of their jokes they become almost fearful of him and he loses their friendship.  This is a very dramatic way of saying that it is very lonely at the top and gives insight to how those who are intellectually gifted are treated and how they feel.  To further illustrate this Charly is dismissed from his job after he shows the plant manager how the bakery could save a lot of money by improving its production.  Just as the other employees became wary after Charly's intellect blossoms the manager seems equally threatened by Charly and fires him.Charly's intellect grows he becomes an insatiable learner and reads books by the dozens.  He also becomes enamored with his teacher but he is emotionally unprepared when she refuses his advances.  In dealing with this rejection Charly leaves town and travels all over the country on a motorcycle encountering many different types of experiences so that he can mature emotionally.  Eventually he wins over his teacher and they begin a romantic relationship.Upon his return to town he is informed that Algernon has lost his intellectual capacity and ultimately died.  Knowing that this will happen to him as well Charly embarks on a quest to prevent this from happening. He learns everything that the doctors know and begins his own research. Unfortunately he discovers that it is not possible to inhibit the reversal of the downward process his intellect will experience.  As he acknowledges that his own demise is inevitable we are left to reflect upon whether each of us would want to be a shining star for a fleeting moment or a dusty moon that only reflects others' light.".

Seinfeld's Barney Martin and Dick Van Patten play his coworkers. The divine Claire Bloom who should be made a Dame is the sympathetic attractive teacher. Ruth White plays the landlady in one of the last film roles before her death in 1969 from cancer. The setting is filmed on location in Boston Massachusetts.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cliff Robertson earned an Academy Award for playing the title role based on the novel by Daniel Keyes entitled Flowers for Algernon. His portrayal is heartbreaking and you can't help but feel for the character who is the butt of so many jokes by his socalled colleagues and friends at his workplace a bakery. Seinfeld's Barney Martin and Dick Van Patten play his coworkers. The divine Claire Bloom who should be made a Dame is the sympathetic attractive teacher. Ruth White plays the landlady in one of the last film roles before her death in 1969 from cancer. The setting is filmed on location in Boston Massachusetts.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before watching Charly I had been told to avoid watching this film having just read the book. Of course I didn't do myself justice and decided to watch the film anyway. The film simply rushes through the whole storyline trying to fit too many themes in a minimum amount of opportunities in a mere hour and forty minutes.As stated before the length of the film was much too short in order to get across the message in an efficient way let alone in a strong manner. This had a large indirect or maybe direct effect on the performance of that of Cliff Robertson who plays Charly. The transformation of his happens at lightning quick speed which undermines the book in not displaying the long and grueling process Charly had to face in which he was constantly being treated like a lab experiment. Also the way he deals with his feeling on loneliness and lack or respect is in no way the same as he did in the book which was much more understandable and seemingly much more realistic in the way Charly would have reacted. Instead in the movie he drives off and becomes wild and crazy without a second thought. A rushed script here leads easily to a rushed movie with glaring problems even more so then the leading character.Ralph Nelson the director of this film took the wrong approach here trying to have Charly change so drastically at such a fast pace. The transformation in itself is shocking enough. There is no need to further try and make the lead character undergo this rapid change because it takes away from the substance of the film and ultimately the rest of the film with it. The entire film rests on this one leading character and the director certainly displayed that challenge here unfortunately it was not displayed in the way that it should have been. I would not recommend this film especially if you read the book because it is filled with just to many contradictions throughout and faces its own themes in a overly simplistic way and method. The film fails miserably in trying to describe such a complex problem effectively and certainly doesn't give any answers in a precise or convincing manner. Sadly this film becomes a parody of itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having done The Days Of Wine And Roses On the small screen and seeing Jack Lemmon get the part for the big screen Cliff Robertson pulled a Katharine Hepburn. Like Kate the great who bought the screen rights to The Philadelphia Story and dictated the making of it to MGM Robertson did the same for Charly which he had done on the US Steel Hour almost a decade earlier on television. He did better than Lemmon who only was nominated for Best Actor for Days Of Wine And Roses. Charly is the story of an amiable mildly retarded man who works and supports himself in a job at a bakery but also has agreed to become an experimental subject to scientists Claire Bloom Leon Janney and Lilia Skala. Janney has a theory in which he feels that the proper enzyme given and an operation and Robertson could start to function like a normal person.The operation has some foreseen and unforeseen consequences. One of them is that Robertson is one fully functioning male but still lacks a whole lot of social skills. He forms an attachment to Bloom which is something she saw coming but not necessarily her.More important he becomes far more aware of the world around him and how badly treated he was by a lot of people. One role I very much liked was that of his landlady Ruth White who was a woman with a big heart who does value Robertson as a person and gives him the respect any of us is due.Still the film belongs to Cliff Robertson who won an Oscar for Best Actor in 1968. Robertson had some stiff competition that year but probably was helped by the fact that three of his competitors were British Alan Bates for The Fixer Ron Moody for Oliver and Peter O'Toole for The Lion In Winter who if memory serves was the betting favorite. The other nominee was Alan Arkin for The Heart Is The Lonely Hunter. How he manages to go from a mildly retarded man to a person of no mean erudition is a wonderful process unfolding on the screen. Personally I think it ought to be required viewing in every acting class on the globe the subtleties are something to behold.I don't claim to be any kind of scientific expert on this or any other scientific matter but I would love to hear from those who know more as to whether the whole theory is feasible or not. In any event though Charly is a fine picture with both a message and a heart.".

Some are gifted some are slow and some are just plain retarded and will never comprehend what is being taught. But what if there was a way? What if science could remedy what nature restricted in the human brain? That is the premise for the movie  Charly.  It tells the story of an adult retarded man named Charley Gordon Cliff Robertson 1968 Academy Award winner who is mentally incapable of surmounting even simple challenges like spelling the word 'School.' Inside him is a deep desire to learn but is mentally unable. That all changes when two brilliant scientists conceive of a medical procedure which can transform first a mouse then a human being into not only a educated individual but a mental genius. Based on the novel Flowers for Algernon Cliff Robertson gives a brilliant and visually haunting performance of the retarded man who is suddenly transformed into a genius. Not only does he 'see' better than most he's able to visualize what escapes even the most sophisticated in society. What he also sadly realizes is that 'increased intelligence equals loss of friends.' Beginning with the ability to learn and learn quickly his advanced knowledge also unfortunately reveals his own future a future he confronts the two doctors with. This is a must picture for anyone who'd like to see the man beat the mouse and yet have sympathy for both. A superb cast featuring Claire Bloom Lilia Skala Leon Janney and Dick Van Patten as Bert makes for a believable Classic movie. ".

	schema:reviewBody "CHARLY is an interesting movie to watch because its premise is the antithesis of the premise in ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. Where in Michael Gondry's movie Carrey undergoes a traumatic experiment where he erases his mind to get rid of the memory of his great love Cliff Robertson playing Charly Gordon a mentally disabled man who works in menial labor gets a major life change an experiment to elevate his mental activity. While you may not see the parallels in both movies I could.Both processes are essentially brain damage. One of them causes terminal amnesia and even then it's not guaranteed because the two lovers  Carrey and Winslet  gravitate towards each other as if they were meeting for the first time. Charly's is a breakthrough it opens the doors of not only his perception of the world and his placement in it but to his heart because he is able to express his love for Alice Kinian the woman who has been the link between him and the world of intelligence. The problem being that his newfound intelligence is temporary.CHARLY as a movie feels of its time and much of the visual exposition  split scenes bright colors and inserts  are purely late Sixties. There is even a psychedelic romp that Charly indulges in that seems to be a precursor to EASY RIDER at some point and his walk in the woods with Alice all but evokes the folksy music of soft rock bands like Bread. However the science fiction aspect of the story is able to transplant it to any other time frame despite the fashions and the overall look it could happen today with the advance of sciencefact. The one point where the movie falls short of being excellent is at the moment when Charly is told that he'll revert back to his former self. True we're given glimpses here and there but there is a much too abrupt ending that shows him back at a child's state still dressed as a man playing with children on a seesaw. I guess the people involved in the production thought it would have been too much for the moviegoing public of 1968 to see Charly suffer the effects of his regression leaving the movie with that one scene in which he tells Alice to leave him alone followed by the closing playground scene.Even so CHARLY is full of beautiful understated acting. Cliff Robertson is detailed in his characters idiocy not making Charly a onenote object of pity but a human being who is loved by his coworkers. He evolves into a man full of this frightening intelligence who becomes the thermometer of the way the world is heading going so far as to denounce the state of the cold war and America's complacent society which echoes FAHRENHEIT 451 when he addresses that education comes from television. Claire Bloom has a role that could be thankless but isn't  as Alice she has a lovely sensitive presence that complements Robertson's completely.".

It was written by Daniel Keyes who won many awards for his short story. In 1968 that story was made into a movie called Charly. The movie pretty much follows the storyline and is very good until one scene when it dosen't go down a hill but goes down a cliff. From the scene were he stalks his teacher and then attacks her thats when it goes a long long long way down. And can't get back out. From then on it leaves Daniel Keyes story and turns into something totally different. So different it scares me. It tearns into a hip movie about free love and easy rider.

	schema:headline " Flawed Manipulative Maudlin Moving Unforgettable. See It.";
	schema:reviewBody "Charly is a flawed maudlin poignant unintentionally laughable heavy handed sometimes grotesque inescapably dated unforgettable movie.Charly is the story of a mentally retarded adult man Cliff Robertson who is experimented on by two scientists Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur Lilia Skala and Leon Janney Each is terrifying. Skala forces smiles through clenched teeth and a German accent Janney is a humorless deepvoiced skull. These scientists have been able to dramatically increase the intelligence of Algernon a mouse. Without so much as a signed informedconsent release form Charly is experimented on as well. He too becomes dramatically more intelligent.Newly smart Charly falls in love with his teacher Alice Kinian Claire Bloom. She rejects him at first but they connect. Shortly thereafter Algernon dies. The same fate awaits Charly but he will lose his intelligence first. He dismisses Alice and unlike Bette Davis in Dark Victory dies off camera.Like many other reviewers here I read Flowers for Algernon and saw this movie as a child. I never forgot either. I remember even as a kid feeling embarrassed for being so moved by the story because it is so blatantly manipulative. And yet it is undeniably powerful.I resent the film's masochistic wallow in Charly's victimization by his coworkers. One scene of Gimpy Edward McNally instigating trouble at the bakery where Charly works would have done the job of communicating the torment of being a retarded man. But the movie includes several such scenes Gimpy and the gang humiliating Charly with bread dough packed into his locker at work with a juke box trick by telling him to go stand on a deserted street corner at night and wait for snow and with a dough machine. Finally when Charly becomes more intelligent they gang up on him and fire him. These vignettes have the ring of truth but their repetition only serves to encourage the viewer to wallow in pity for Charly and to become enraged at his tormentors.The movie is very much of its time. The bakery villains are working class white men Straus and Nemur and their colleagues in a conference audience who shoot questions at Charly are soulless scientists and authority figures classic 1960s villains reflecting the obsessions paranoias resentments and scapegoating of sixties hippies. The psychedelic sequence where a wounded Charly deals with Alice's rejection of him by taking drugs having orgies and growing his hair long is a goofy time capsule of 1968's values obsessions and grandiosity. The Ravi Shankar soundtrack that makes use of flutes harpsichords and sitar is obtrusive in its shouting 1968! The split screen effect also calls attention to itself. The only stars who could carry split screen off were Rock Hudson and Doris Day.Cliff Robertson won an Academy Award for his performance as Charly and it is that kind of performance  an actor playing a retarded man  that was so harshly mocked in Tropic Thunder. The fact is that Robertson creates two believable very different characters retarded Charly and intelligent Charly. When his nonretarded voice first breaks through when he asks Alice if her fianc loves her it's like a teenage boy's voice breaking.Claire Bloom exhibits her usual restrained sexuality and hints at an inner disciplinarian  dominatrix. When smart Charly first lunges at her she calls him a stupid moron which is completely unbelievable but serves the movie's need to be as maudlin as possible. The romance between Charly and Alice is disturbing to anyone with a sense of the ethics of teacherstudent relationships but the film isn't interested in exploring this relationship with any seriousness. Rather it just wants to extract as many tears as possible. Once Charly and Alice connect the camera moves as far away from them as possible. As dewy landscape shots  parks ponds toy trains  parade across the screen Robertson and Bloom perform voiceover readings of what sounds like Rod McKuen poetry. It's all so 1960s so dated so much of a cheat of the viewer. The film is very willing to spend lots of time in close observations of Charly's workmates tormenting him but has no time to develop a real relationship between Charly and Alice.The movie undercuts its own message in its final scenes. When Charly realizes that he will become retarded again he is haunted by terrifying disturbing ghosts of his past retarded self. These retardedCharlyghosts have no dignity no value. If the movie wants to tell us that retarded people are primarily people just like anyone else it undercuts that message by making smart Charly's past and future retarded self so disturbing.For all of its flaws this is a movie very worth seeing. There are genuinely touching scenes such as when Charly helps a retarded man clean up after dropping glasses in a bar.Too the film raises profound questions questions that anyone who has lost a loved one to Alzheimer's has asked where is the essence of the soul? In the intellect? Or somewhere impossible to locate? Finally Charly exerts a real tug on the heart. Whether that is because schlock is more powerful than art or because there is art here under all the schlock is topic for a dissertation not a relatively short review.".

Cliff Robertson delivered the performance of his career in this film.There are elements of science fiction and psychological action in the film. You have been warned.  These segments are well done and add to the film as opposed to creating a negative sidetrack.I suggest that anyone watching Charly first read at least part of Daniel Keyes's Flowers for Algernon for basic background.  The film makes more sense after reading the novel.All in all Charly is a worthwhile experience.  Some may not like the film but I find it to be one of the best of the 1960s.".

Cliff Robertson delivered the performance of his career in this film.There are elements of science fiction and psychological action in the film. You have been warned.  These segments are well done and add to the film as opposed to creating a negative sidetrack.I suggest that anyone watching Charly first read at least part of Daniel Keyes's Flowers for Algernon for basic background.  The film makes more sense after reading the novel.All in all Charly is a worthwhile experience.  Some may not like the film but I find it to be one of the best of the 1960s.";

A mentally challenged man Oscarwinner Cliff Robertson tries to improve his intelligence with the help of a beautiful doctor Claire Bloom and experimental scientists who have successfully increased the thought capabilities of a lab mouse. Soon Robertson is to be their guinea pig but could it be possible that the treatment might make the titled character too smart? And is the experiment as perfect as it seems on first glance? Robertson's dynamic role is the true key to this tonedeaf curiosity as he literally plays his part as multiple personalities. Everything else including the direction and the script is just windowdressing. The movie wants to question the relationship between God and science but its style makes that potential point go flying out the window. The possible romantic connection between Robertson and Bloom feels forced and detrimental to the overall effectiveness of the picture. 4 stars out of 5.".

He really did seem like a different person before and after the operation.I watched the movie because of Flowers for Algernon but it only shares names and the basic premise with the book. The movie doesn't really show any understanding of the book. The movie is almost 2 hours long and yet everything seems so rushed. Ideas are thrown at you but we don't really experience them. In the book changes are gradual at first and the process speeds up. In the movie everything just happens he gets an operation and becomes a genius. Then just as quickly he loses it like literally in the middle of a sentence. The movie also really missed out on showing the intellectual and emotional implications shown in the novel. In the novel Charly has an intellectual awakening. He becomes so smart that he passes everyone up. This leads him to see that people all have a limit to what they know. Because of this he feels people are like frauds pretending to be something they are not. It angers him scientists only know about certain things. On the emotional side his intelligence quickly and vastly surpasses his emotional understanding. He can not relate to people or understand them. As he becomes a genius he is not even at the level of an adolescent emotionally speaking. The idea of love is not one that he can truly understand until almost the very end. In the movie ugh they just throw a love story at us without reason. I mean what in the movie can explain why his teacher would fall in love with him. She just does. It shows Charly become sexually awakened then he is forceful on her leaves and seems to develop relationships with many women and comes back and they are in love. It really makes no sense even ignoring the novel.".

It was probably the best book I've ever been forced to read. Also at our school they made us watch this movie after finishing it. I found this film at best a poor adaption of a great novel and at worst a disastrous attempt at surrealist filmmaking.First the positives The actors especially male and female leads are excellent and have a definite chemistry together on screen however they seem a bit confined by the material they are given to perform.Now the far more lengthly section of my review the negatives. 1. Cinematography. The whole movie seems to have been shot in a style to suggest being on a bad acidtrip not that I would know the feeling.. Many scenes are an endless ridiculously over metaphorical montage where it would have been much simpler and more effective to use a more straight forward approach. For some odd reason the director also decided to use a split screen effect at certain arbitrary points in the film for no apparent reason other than possibly the notion that it looked cool.2. Writing. This is probably my biggest problem with the film. The writing in the movie is simply incredulous seeing as it not only departs from the book in unnecessary ways which I will detail later but it also changes the plot in ways that make no logical sense such as changing it so that the doctors don't tell Charlie that the effects of the operation may not be permanent not something a 20th century medical professional is likely to do given that a patient must give informed consent before undergoing an operation. The beginning portion drags on filled with scenes of Charlie doing childish activities such as playing on a slide or driving bumper cars to the point where one feels like jumping up on one's chair and screaming We get it! He's retarded!. The most nonsensical plot twist is the series of scenes in which Charlie not being emotionally developed tries to force himself on Ms. Kinnian and is as a result slapped and called A stupid moron then departs on a motorcycle trip for no readily apparent reason and comes back and is suddenly sleeping with Ms. Kinnian whose fiance just magically disappears which leaves the audience scratching its head and saying Didn't she just slap and insult him two scenes ago? I wish my life worked like that.3. The Ending. I have given this it's own section because I feel it deserves special attention. At the end of the novel the reader basically has two ways of interpreting it Relocation or Suicide the latter being my preferred interpretation. However this version removes all of the guesswork by simply giving you no clues as to what happens after he regresses back to his former state. Instead you get a long stretched out scene in which he is chased by his former self through long white hallways for about five minutes and one is left with a similar reaction I mentioned having during the beginning portion. This is one of the few movies in which I have been shocked to see the end credits as it just ends with a freezeframe of Charlie on the teetertotter and leaves the story completely unresolved.I'm sorry if the above review seems a bit rantish however these are simply my criticisms of the film. If you enjoyed it then that's all well and good. To each his own.".

	schema:reviewBody "The unemployed Peter encounters the shadily unusual June when clubbing one night and straight away the two fall for each other. However since June has entered Peter's life things has turned out rather strange and she reveals to him in a erratic manner that she can see spirits with left eye. Through her he learns that a headless loan shark ghost that was killed in a traffic accident is possessing citizens of Hong Kong seeking revenge on those people and their families that he thinks is linked to his death.More so a touching drama with supernatural elements blossoming romance and oddball hilarity is how to describe this handsomely haunting but evocative treat for the senses. Even with its familiar premise idea think of The Eye and The Sixth Sense this Hong Kong feature turns in one curiously textured screenplay which is intelligently crafted to get you intrigued where everything finally falls into place after pulling you into many different directions and possibilities. The central point of Kwang Abe's story is one of those character finding themselves devices which is learning to first respect who they are and throw in some meaningful character relationship building. There's a twist or two in there. While the twists might be predictable but elaborately effective nonetheless. However at times it does feel episodic and leisurely ticks along before letting the mystery really fold out. Also it might feel a little too long when coming to its longwinded if underwhelming resolution. The morbidly quirky humour and visual gags worked in feel right at home to the material characters and situations. What it has going for it is its moody direction and atmospheric locations with sublime shadings lighting and detail. Director Ann Hui paints many surreal images which float between slightly grisly to beautifully melancholy. The eloquently inventive framing from Arthur Wong's crisply dusky cinematography sets the dreamy tone and a creepy ambiance settles into Tommy Wai KaiLeung's stirringly unhinged music score.

The two leads are equally splendid with the extremely wonderful Shu Qi's vividly plucky turn as June and Eason Chan's perfectly sombre performance as Peter. The support cast are reasonably lowkey and more there for the story's progression but what is offered up is colourful bunch with the likes of Sam Lee Anthony Wong ChauSang James Wong YiuCheung Lai Jo Kuk and a memorable Tony Liu. Everyone's performances gel together to make believable and emotional ties.A charming offbeat little winner. Maybe too long in its story but the novelty and atmospheric tone works from the getgo.".

	onyx:emotionText "The unemployed Peter encounters the shadily unusual June when clubbing one night and straight away the two fall for each other. However since June has entered Peter's life things has turned out rather strange and she reveals to him in a erratic manner that she can see spirits with left eye. Through her he learns that a headless loan shark ghost that was killed in a traffic accident is possessing citizens of Hong Kong seeking revenge on those people and their families that he thinks is linked to his death.More so a touching drama with supernatural elements blossoming romance and oddball hilarity is how to describe this handsomely haunting but evocative treat for the senses. Even with its familiar premise idea think of The Eye and The Sixth Sense this Hong Kong feature turns in one curiously textured screenplay which is intelligently crafted to get you intrigued where everything finally falls into place after pulling you into many different directions and possibilities. The central point of Kwang Abe's story is one of those character finding themselves devices which is learning to first respect who they are and throw in some meaningful character relationship building. There's a twist or two in there. While the twists might be predictable but elaborately effective nonetheless. However at times it does feel episodic and leisurely ticks along before letting the mystery really fold out. Also it might feel a little too long when coming to its longwinded if underwhelming resolution. The morbidly quirky humour and visual gags worked in feel right at home to the material characters and situations. What it has going for it is its moody direction and atmospheric locations with sublime shadings lighting and detail. Director Ann Hui paints many surreal images which float between slightly grisly to beautifully melancholy. The eloquently inventive framing from Arthur Wong's crisply dusky cinematography sets the dreamy tone and a creepy ambiance settles into Tommy Wai KaiLeung's stirringly unhinged music score.

Ann's won numerous awards  best director best film etc.  and if you aren't acquainted with her well go see Visible Secret and you'll know why she's so good.The leads are pretty good. Say what you like Shu Qi  the sexpot  is a good actress. I particularly liked her in the early karaoke scene.But look out for the supporting actress Hui Ying Hong the mother of a little boy called Hsiao Hsung in the movie. She's a famous Hong Kong actress with real kung fu skills. Here she's not called on to display her fighting prowess but boy can she act. In one scene you can literally see the veins on her temple popping out so intense yet natural is her facial expression it reminds me of Lawrence Fishburne's very fine facial expressions as Morpheus in The Matrix when he was interrogated by Agent Smith.Visible Secret is an intelligent movie  you've got to concentrate on the plot or you won't understand the ending. Everything ties together at the end and if you understand it THEN  I couldn't and a friend had to explain to me certain aspects of the movie even after a second viewing  you'll agree the story's superb.Though principally a horror movie Visible Secret has some of the finest comedic moments I've ever seen on the silver screen. I caught it at preview and the audience appreciated one funny moment so much a few persons actually applauded.Visible Secret's a real scary movie. And the best thing is it doesn't rely on sudden loud sounds to frighten you which the lousy horror flicks resort to.Incidentally the poster for the movie which shows a row of seated people in an underground train was banned by the MTR in Hong Kong as being too scary. I don't think the poster's too scary but I do think it's very clever. The tagline What's that sitting next to you? is eyecatching.Watch out for the movie's play with sounds. It's nearly as good as The Ring in its use of sound to create an eerie mood. Incidentally I don't know of any director who uses sound as well as Ann. PAY ATTENTION TO HER USE OF SOUND.One of the hallmarks of good movie direction is proper pacing. Director Ann excels at it.The original score is excellent.Many of the scenes are hauntingly beautiful.I believe Visible Secret will go down in movie history like Gattaca  good but underrated. Don't be put off by anyone who's seen the movie and says it's lousy  they just don't get it.Go see Visible Secret. You won't be disappointed. 1010".

Apparently this being kidnapped is ordinary. A man is moving rather forcibly through the waiting crowd. Then he's beheaded. The girl looks at the head beneath the bus. Apparently that massive mutilation of a living human being is ordinary too. She stares at it for seconds with no affect.In the present we start in a rave. Minus points for that. Conversation in a rave. Sure nothing but bellowing or screaming. June meets Peter and uses Peter to get away from some other young man. They go here and there and end up at his place. Peter looks like he needs a shower a shampoo and directions on using a comb. June could use a flamethrower to get all the layers of badly applied cosmetics crap off her face.The lead characters seem repellent and useless. Peter asks her why she was in such a hurry to leave every place they went to.Ah the movie starts. Well no it doesn't. It seemed she was about to speak some truth but she did not.June is a useless selfcentered pest. She and Peter have at each other then she leaves in the morning after emptying his wallet.Peter's Dad shows up the next morning claiming to be possessed by a ghost. They take him to the hospital. The children assemble and bond over bad times they trade veiled insults. Nice. Peter's about to leave but his father needs more talking. Peter thinks he sees June as he leaves but perhaps not.Peter gets fired from his job. He goes to a beach marshmallow roast with ghost stories. He meets June again on this trip. The reputed ghost shows up in the body of a friend of June's. Peter sees some ghost lore in June and starts to wonder. The next day she confides that she can see ghosts with her left eye and there is always one following Peter.After that they spend a lot of time together Peter eventually gives her a ring he had hoped to give a previous girl friend who left him. Peter has trouble finding a new job.Peter has a dream of his father visiting him at midnight the next morning the hospital calls to tell him that his father hung himself. His relative tells him that June was with his dad sharing a long stare the night before he died. Sigh.Peter tries to find out more about June and encounters some strange experiences. Also he digs up the newspaper story about the beheaded man and sees a little girl there with the same distinctive birthmark as June. The description of the beheaded man ties up some threads for Peter.Peter tries to get a job with good prospects. June tries to involve him in some ghostly business. He tells her to go. He wakes to find his apartment painted in red and he tries to get clear of all this for his job interview. At his friend Simon's place the red paint shows up again. After he talks with Simon he tries to connect with June but she's hard to find.After resolving the problem that the headless man was obsessed with he is released.Peter and June visit his dad's grave. Then Peter is drawn to a woman at another grave site which turns out to be June's. As opposed to the Sixth Sense the ending was a huge let down.ScoresCinematography 810 OK even with challenging lighting situations.Sound 510 Both relentless and boring. I was ready to quit before the opening credits were over. One needs to be near the volume controls at all times to save your ears too loud by far or catch any words of the conversation.Acting 710 OK for the story. I liked the supporting cast but the two leads were obnoxious.Screenplay 510 After 75 minutes I wished I had never started this mess. When I was done I had the same feeling. If June is a ghost why did everyone see her? If Peter is the psychic why can he only see June?".

OK it's not that hilarious but mildly amusing hilarity ensues once in a while.Eleniak is lovely her acting is OK. Her character is sympathetic up to a point even though she does pull some very vexing antics! However her stunning figure and muchdiscussed breasts in the nude scene are not enough to elevate this film beyond soso.McNamara is babyfaced and his character is somewhat irritating as a twobit scam artist and love interest for Ms. Eleniak. I didn't particularly care for his character. His romance with Eleniak wasn't developed well and he was only a somewhat sympathetic character.Berenger does well in his role  as a grumpy gravelvoiced superior officer. While I am inclined to be a fan of Berenger I don't always like everything he does. And alas sometimes his looks get a little on the seedy side   but not in this film. He looks pretty good and his character is kind of fun in a crabby kind of way.Some nudity and profanity earn this film a R rating. It's a fairly enjoyable film just don't expect much.

However it turns out she really isn't a mean girl just misunderstoodReilly becomes lovableDevane falls in love with her and vice versaand it all leads to a ridiculously improbable ending.As you can see the plot is just ridiculous and predictable and this is NOT a good moviebut I sort of liked it. Berenger and McNamara are very good and play off each other very well. Eleniak is beautiful and sexy and surprisingly not a bad actress. The situations they end up in are totally unbelievable and almost always unfunny but I laughed a few times. If you're watching this for taforget it. It's about 50 minutes until Eleniak is in her underwear and another 20 minutes or so before she has a quick nude scene. As a gay guy I had no interest. Anyways McNamara shows more skin than herhe has a few scenes wearing nothing but underpants and once is totally nude. He's handsome and has a smooth nicely toned body. As it is him and Eleniak became a couple after meeting in this movie. Also there are some familiar faces in small rolesDean Stockwell Crispin Glover Seymour Cassel Gary Busey Frederic Forrest and Marilu Henner. Even director Dennis Hopper pops up in multiple roles! So not a good movie but the acting is on target there are funny moments and it has female AND male nudity. A pleasant time waster.".

However it turns out she really isn't a mean girl just misunderstoodReilly becomes lovableDevane falls in love with her and vice versaand it all leads to a ridiculously improbable ending.As you can see the plot is just ridiculous and predictable and this is NOT a good moviebut I sort of liked it. Berenger and McNamara are very good and play off each other very well. Eleniak is beautiful and sexy and surprisingly not a bad actress. The situations they end up in are totally unbelievable and almost always unfunny but I laughed a few times. If you're watching this for taforget it. It's about 50 minutes until Eleniak is in her underwear and another 20 minutes or so before she has a quick nude scene. As a gay guy I had no interest. Anyways McNamara shows more skin than herhe has a few scenes wearing nothing but underpants and once is totally nude. He's handsome and has a smooth nicely toned body. As it is him and Eleniak became a couple after meeting in this movie. Also there are some familiar faces in small rolesDean Stockwell Crispin Glover Seymour Cassel Gary Busey Frederic Forrest and Marilu Henner. Even director Dennis Hopper pops up in multiple roles! So not a good movie but the acting is on target there are funny moments and it has female AND male nudity. A pleasant time waster.";

The video showed that there was real talent there not just a centerfold's body.  For a former child star to take that direction in her career and have it catapult her into stardom is unusual because most centerfolds don't have her talent.  Her performance in Under Seige really made her a star and the remake of The Beverly Hillbillies showed she was really funny as did Pyromanic's Love Story.

It all starts out fairly innocent but slowly we get drawn into his real intentions. The people who come in his chatroom all have their own issues. They are lonely in real life traumatized or misunderstood and in the chatroom they find people who they can tell their stories to. At first this seems to have a healing effect but slowly we see that all is not what it seems to be.What this movie shows IMO is the loneliness many people face and also the dangers of using internet for our main communication. Like Will's mum tells him at one point 'You can not help yourself if you are only talking to strangers. You need to communicate with us.' The plot is not too difficult to figure out and quite predictable but it's worked out reasonably well and for me the movie just got under my skin. There is no winner in this movie. I would not name this to be a thriller but more a psychological drama. The feeling I am most left with is sadness.Though this movie doesn't come close to the strength Hideo Nakata's 'Ringu' or 'Dark Water' have and has a whole different feel to it I do consider it worth watching.".

If I could make some decisions here I would have kept the entire film surrealistic keeping every scene in the virtual world instead of flashing back and forth from the online fantasy into the real world where the kids are typing into their laptops or phones. That would have taken quite a bit of more talent to write however as we'd have to stay engaged with a conversation in a My Dinner With Andre sort of way. Also two of the characters are extremely neglected and their subplots are never carried through to fruition. I also have a hard time believing even in the virtual world of the internet that the villain here could actually manipulate everyone so easily without anyone really objecting. It would have been in that objection in the passion of that debate that this movie could have found its true energy. But unfortunately it relies too heavily on every parent's paranoid nightmare of the internet leading to suicide or a sexual predator.

Yes the actors look like they've escaped off sets of U.K teen dramas such as Skins but they are playing characters that that market already caters for.It's quite neat how the protagonist Aaron Johnson Will is accessing the chatroom in question via his PC or smartphone but is also then seen within it.

Is the chatroom itself purely in his mind and is the labyrinth of other rooms that we see at the start also only in his imagination? If so that's quite a neat way of adding extra texture and substance that's already there.The challenging soundscapes and things like the animations add extra meat to the body of expression that director Hideo Nakata uses  and I personally liked them and thought they added to the film.

It did take me quite a while to adjust to the visual interpretations of online cyberworld chatting but having said that it was very cleverly done if a bit stagy. This is not a horror film. Despite the surrealistic online interpretation this was first and foremost a dark teenage drama that quite effectively highlights the dangerous mental traps that socially withdrawn youngsters can face online in real life. Maybe parents of teenagers who spends all their time on the internet may well find this to be a horror film and start taking away their kids computers then push a football into their hands.Of course this being cinema liberties need to be taken with plausibility to turn this intriguing drama into a dark thriller. But it works. Its just that it took a heck of a long time to really get going with the main plot. The dialogue also felt very sluggish. The young actors however were very good and did well to emote their feelings convincingly.I was very bewildered at the inclusion of a couple of stop motion animated cartoons which I get the impression were supposed to be darkly funny but I did not find it in the least bit amusing. Maybe that was the idea but it served no purpose in the flow of the movie for me. Also this being a British Film Four production it feels so and you wont find any money spent on special effects apart from a change of wallpaper in the chat rooms.Overall though this is a very good thought provoking film with decent performances from the young cast. It is an effective thriller but very sluggish until it really picks up momentum in the 3rd act.".

The obvious lack of conviction and personality coming from any of the cast is almost forgivable given the atrocious script and pointless motivations.One of Chatroom's strangest failures is that it doesn't seem able to integrate and weave together mainplots with subplots and character development instead assigning blocks of time and space to deal with each separately. It makes unsatisfying storytelling not all that much interaction takes place between the main characters their lives mostly just play out independently without much consequence except to show how inexplicably malicious the main character is. As subplots we are treated to a cringeworthily overacted memory of the main character's past and at least two COMPLETELY unresolved subplots of other characters one's disagreement with her parents and another's obscure and pointless love for his friend's much younger sister. How can they open that can of worms and forget about it?! It's just bad story telling. Also maybe a minor point compared to the rest but it's a bugbear of mine. The presentation of the chatroom and the use of the internet is unsophisticated in its depiction both simplistic and unrealistic. If it was meant to be a closetothebone comment of the dangers of the internet why of all things use the outmoded chatroom? It doesn't work.".

Nothing much can be said about the cinematography as it's only there for the locations and the decorationset. Soundtrack is also nice...So with everything being mediocre at best why would I rate Chartroom so relatively high? Again on account of the original and almost genius concept.

Ringu was remade as The Ring with Naomi Watts quickly followed by Juon remade as The Grudge starring Buffy. In both cases the Hollywood remake is not a patch on the original. And this is what Chatroom feels like a cheap and rushed Hollywood remake. However this time there is no precursor.Let's start with the good stuff though. At the heart of Chatroom there is an interesting and potentially compelling premise. The internet is the one place which offers true anonymity and Nakata portrays this via an innovative physical visualisation of the online world focusing on the chatroom arena. You watch the characters make their way down long corridors filled with stereotypical internet users deep in conversation with each other. You see couples getting busy who clearly don't match the physical description they are giving each other alongside the more sinister picture of grown adults talking with young children. Along the corridors there are a number of different doors each the gateway into a different chatroom. Once inside Nakata films the interactions as physical encounters with each character sat on a chair facing the others in something akin to a group counseling session. The occasional flashbacks to the users sat at their computers keeps us grounded in the real world and works well in demonstrating how some characters but not all portray themselves in a very different light online.However this interesting premise is let down by a poorly constructed script and distinct lack of character development. The dialogue between the group at their first encounter feels incredibly forced and the ease with which William Aaron Johnson  post Kick Ass leads the group into sharing their most intimate secrets is far too rushed. The secrets which each member chooses to share are clichd at best and ill thought through and borderline offensive at worst. In a film with effectively only 5 characters there should be enough scope within the script to bring each character to a satisfying conclusion. Unfortunately this is not the case here with the film quickly focusing on the relationship between William and Jim Matthew Beard so leaving the other three characters floating in the wind. There is simply no effort made to resolve their sub plots and all three feel significantly short changed. I was left sorely disappointed by Chatroom. Through its clichd characters and lack plot development you are left with what feels like a hollow shell of a film. You have to give it credit for attempting to deal with the dangers associated with the internet such as sexual predators and teen suicide but it does so in such a clumsy and misjudged manner that whatever message it is trying to portray is simply lost. With a director with the pedigree of Nakata and a premise of real potential this should have been better. In fact it needs remake.".

I thought the content and delivery of the dialogue of the online conversations as acted out in the hotel were actually quite reminiscent of the kind of language used in chatrooms at least from my own experience The film struck a chord with me because i spent a few years on chatrooms myself as a teenager I was lucky in that I avoided any real contact with weird people or indeed malevolent entities such as William and eventually met quite a few of the people i got to know well in real life and struck up some great friendships many of which continue to this day. however i only met and talked to people in chatrooms because i had low selfesteem and was depressed and unsure of myself the anonymity and control provided by a chatroom appealing to me more then less removed and more traditional forms of socialising i'm sure a lot of people who use chatrooms have such issues and plenty more besides which were represented by the film's characters William and Jim were extreme examples and the fraught hysterical plot of William's to drive Jim to suicide culminating in that chase through Camden market seemed a little over the top to me. i did appreciate the way that each character's own personal plot and life was almost entirely mutually exclusive to the central plot of their friendship and interaction in the Chelsea teens room Eva's room etc. a person's online persona particularly in a chatroom is a contrived and carefully constructed thing and it's a very distanced protective form of interaction however personal you may get as the characters did in the film to devastating effect. I thought the film's disjointed pace and seemingly inconsequential progression in the first half at least was a good portrayal of that compartmentalisation of online chat and personal life.in addition to the bedrock of the main plot that emerges the tragic lonely depressive characters who selfharm andor seek solace online meeting with people who display a variety of different responses from supportive to manipulative and cruel we're also presented with a crosssection of sexual deviance from the tolerable and acceptable  a hallway Eva walks through to meet William which is filled with people indulging in fetish and mo talking to that older lady while other people talk dirty in neighbouring rooms  to the disgusting and unacceptable  mo's paedophilic interest in his mate's 11 year old sister and the pervert whose entry to Chelsea teens prompts William to set up a password.along with the girl who Jim meets early on and from whom he runs away using the above the film seeks to establish the consensus that the world of chatrooms is a forum for the disaffected deviant and personalitydisordered to convene and of course provides a warning about the dangers of such conference by presenting a group of characters so misguided andor malevolent that their initially beneficial wellintended supportive online friendship leads to a lifeordeath situation which yields one casualty fortunately not the painfully depressive Jim.all in all i was impressed by this film which i consider a worthy wellmade convincingly acted portrait of the world of chatrooms the freedoms connections pitfalls and traps that can result from such interactions and friendships and ultimately the value of real social structure especially for those who aren't entirely comfortable with it and are driven to seek less direct ways of establishing it. i give the film 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a big fan of movies about teen angst but I'd heard some good things about Chatroom. I'm glad I gave it a try! It wasn't a brilliant movie by any means but it characterized the Internet quite well. I think if anyone has been on the 'net long enough they've run into manipulative people like William so his character was believable. Even his ability to manipulate people was quickly as he did was quite believable as lonely people on the 'net are apt to follow anyone with a good story.I would have scored it higher except I did not care for the stopaction films within a film and I did not care for the Jim's father storyline being kept openended. In all it was as good as I had expected if not a bit better based on what I had read. It was a bit better than I expected based on my lack of fondness for teen angst stories. Definitely a solid 7 with a toehold in the 8 range if I'm feeling generous.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS I did find it a bit convenient that Mo's friend was willing to help him even after he confessed to being interested in the friend's underage sister. I think it wouldn't have taken the other long to realize that the story about the penguins was important to Jim and if he wanted to make a statement with his death that he would choose that place to die. It might have added a couple of lines of dialogue and a bit more tension to the scene.I also found William's death to be shocking if not a bit expected. He was obviously disturbed from the beginning and at odds with himself. He was probably struggling with his own desire to kill himself hence Jim being a hero to William if Jim shot himself and he probably would have taken his own life with the gun if he could not convince Jim to use it. His falling in front of the train was a nice change rather than committing suicide by cop as I expected him to do. It was also nice seeing a hint of William's internal struggle as he tries to work up the courage to kill himself earlier in the film and his thought to stop Jim's suicide however briefly it lasted.".

Basically bored teenagers Jim Matthew Beard Eva Imogen Poots Emily Game of Thrones' Hannah Murray and Mo Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya meet William KickAss's Aaron TaylorJohnson online. William's charisma seduces them but he is not what he seems he is calculating manipulative and does not have time for people in the real world. Jim is vulnerable and has no idea how dangerous his new friend William really is Jim confesses he is on antidepressants William now knows he has found a victim he vows to help Jim come of his drugs and the rest of the group fall in line in their meetings and in the chatroom William creates online. Eva and Mo realise that William is not offering friendly advice he is playing a deadly game but it has already begun and Jim is set on the path of self destruction and going to do the unthinkable. Eva Emily and Mo do their best to save Jim but William chases them across the internet in a game of cat and mouse shutting down their systems and cutting them off from his victim. William and Jim come face to face in blur between fantasy and reality on the underground without online security everything has become real it is a race against time for Jim to be saved and to stop William someone will meet their fate. Also starring Megan Dodds as Grace Game of Thrones' Michelle Fairley as Rosie The Mimic's Jacob Anderson as Si Ophelia Lovibond as Charlotte and Richard Madden as Ripley. TaylorJohnson is alright as the sulky teenage rebel who hates his parents and everyone the supporting cast of upandcoming mostly unknowns do okay but overact often the plot could have been clever an intimate chatroom created to lure in the most vulnerable people to punish or kill them but it is done in a predictably dull way it only has small moments of really dramatic stuff a disappointing British thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Hughes as director had his limitations but he was at his best in making possible the great combat and special effects scenes. The Zeppelin scenes are so realistic it is difficult to believe it was all model and special set work. In 19271930 there just wasn't available a junk Zeppelin for Hughes to buy and shoot down. It would not surprise me to learn that he offered the U.S.Navy or the Zeppelin Co. a good round sum to buy Los Angeles LZ126 or Graf Zeppelin LZ127 for that purpose! Hughes' inexperience as a director shows up at its worst in his handling of the cast. Even allowing for the difficulties of Dawn of Sound filming and that HELL'S ANGELS started as a silent Hughes tolerated some of the worst acting ever seen in a major film. There is some good work though. Jean Harlow is very smooth and natural and the actors playing the German officers are satisfactorily sly and evil.The story? Oh two brothers are in love with the same girl who doesn't really give a hoot for either of them. They volunteer for a suicide mission in a captured German bomber and .... But see the ending for yourself. Meanwhile the Germans are trying to bomb London with their Zeppelin but the Royal Flying Corps in on the job. That's about it.For true airship buffs I'll add a word about the designation L32 visible in one scene when the Zeppelin is over London. In the minds of folks not too knowledgeable about Zeppelin history there is apt to be confusion about the L and LZ designations of German airships used in The Great War WW1 and after. The German Naval Air Service gave their ships an L number. The Zeppelin Co. gave its products an LZ number and the two did not correspond. There was a real L32 LZ74 and a real L7 LZ32. Both were destroyed during raids over London in 1916. Perhaps Hughes may have had either of these airships in mind for his fictional one. Incidentally there is no record of the observation gondola which figures in the film story ever having been used over England. It was used to some extent in raids over European cities.".

She appears in colour for the only time in the 8 minute Lady Randolph's Party sequence about halfway into the film.The story starts with three friends at Oxford  two brothers the goodnatured Roy James Hall and the flybynight Monte Ben Lyon and a German student Karl John Darrow. An early sequence features one of the brothers taking the other's place in a duel  important to remember for later in the saga while the turning point of the first part is of course the start of the Great War forcing Karl to join the enemy and Roy and Monte to enlist as pilots. Roy has a wellto girlfriend Helen Harlow who isn't quite the angel he takes her to be.The aerial battles are by far the highlight of the film although Harlow is good in her role vamping all who come into her path. Evelyn Hall is agreeably twittery as Lady Randolph while Lucien Prival overacts as Baron von Kranz. Roy Wilson provides some comic relief as 'Baldy' Maloney.Originally planned and started as a silent movie 'Hell's Angels' still has some problems with pacing and comes across as rather stilted in places.

This is a Great film and for those who would criticize the acting editing etc compare it to other films made during the first years of the talkie era. It stands up very well. Pay special attention to the wounded pilots as they are dying in their planes. Very gritty. The realism of the aerial battles has never been equaled. This film is a true classic. How many other classic films circa 1930 come to mind? Not many.".

Like many people I had been attracted to it by the clips shown during Martin Scorsese's The Aviator and was intrigued enough to buy the DVD. I read several reviews before watching it which were inconclusive but I must confess I was dubious about the fact that the majority of the film had been reshot after the dawn of motion picture sound suggesting a rushed or insensitive job.Having now seen the film I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised. Considering it was made in 1930 Hell's Angels is unfailingly watchable. The relationship study between the brothers Roy and Monty along with Jean Harlow's Helen is unexpectedly interesting and some of the avenues the film explores are at times gripping. The sexuality of the film must have been rather shocking for its time not unlike director Howard Hughes' compelling use of colour in certain scenes.But of course the great talking points of Hell's Angels are the aerial battles that were filmed so daringly by Hughes in midair. The closeness of the aircraft and the clear danger that many of the planes were in is alarming stuff and  whatever one says about the wisdom of the techniques involved  makes positively stunning film. Three pilots died during the filming and Hughes himself was badly injured but he was always fascinated by how far boundaries could be pushed and that is clear right throughout the movie.The film's plot has been somewhat maligned which is rather cruel considering when it was made and the fact that it is not predictable in the way that many of today's movies are. The performances are competent the characters believable and the ending is what would be deemed 'satisfying'. The scale of this film is frankly monumental and it is hard to think of a film being made on a scale which would equate to it today without the use of CGI. I am surprised this is not considered a classic as it offers as much if not more than many movies placed in that bracket from a similar era.".

	schema:headline " Hell's Angel Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hughes is known for his multimillion dollar movies and love for action and that really shows in the scenes of this 1930s spectacular film Hell's Angels. The only negative I have about the whole movie is that the first half is full of wide angle conversation shots and a few mixed in close ups and the real run doesn't get started until Roy and Monte go off to their war barracks. It is very obvious that Hughes is very passionate about this film and really wants to make it the film of the decade and take movie production of the thirties to a next level. Every thing from the characters to the mise en scene Hughes landed it right on. My favorite part of this movie is when all the planes are all fighting and crashing into each other and all the shooting is done from sky level either from a birds eye view directly underneath the planes or looking right at a pilots face as he shoots gets shot or is shooting. This really shows a great job done by Briggs Lawrence and Hollingsworth as editors. These three men eventhough Hollingsworth is not credited were able to edit all these plane fight scenes and after watching the movie to its entirety then the sky scenes once more I could not notice any continuity editing errors. I am just really amazed that this complex of a film was produced in 1930 and as far as the editing goes I don't think it could be done any better to this day.Another piece of this film that really took my by surprise is the color effects during all the airplane and bomb explosions. We all know going into this movie that it is all shot in black and white but when that first explosion of the Englishman's plane flying into the German 'ship' and that explosion really caught my eye and I was amazed by the detail and bright colors all the sudden shown on the screen. I expected for this even to occur but what I did not expect was this great light show to occur and light up my whole living room especially in an all black and white film. The blues and the yellows are really vibrant and took my by surprise when I first saw something blow up. The cast selected for this movie was another dead on strike by Mr. Hughes. The second I saw Helen I could tell that she was not as into Roy as he was her but she played the part fairly well and when caught kissing the Captain at the bar her reaction was a perfect summary of how she felt for Roy the whole time. I like Roy's character because he just tries to be the nice guy that takes directions and does as he is told. He stays loyal to his relationship with Helen and his love for his country however he does not stay loyal to his brother Monte. I was taken by real surprise when Roy really did shoot his brother at the end of the movie but he still does not give up on his country and ends up getting shot for it. Monte is the only one I'm not really sure about. This is because at first he seems pretty laid back just seems to go with the flow of things then at the end he is ends up being very passionate for his brother and country. I didn't get a real feeling for Monte until they were at dinner and his name was called out as to report for night shift duty after dinner. This scene to me is the best monologue in the whole film. I say that because when Monte starts to explain to his boss why he doesn't want to go on duty that night his words really get me feeling sorry for the guy. He is so passionate and full of emotion that he really does not want to be a part of the war and he does not even understand why they are at war. This short shot is the reason Monte is my favorite character in this movie. The shots in this movie start very plain and rather boring and by then end I was amazed at the way the cameras were used to produce some great shots. The first hour all the shots are of two or three people just having a basic conversation and the scene starts with a wide shot then mixes up close up and medium close ups. By the end of this movie when the main fight scene is going on their is a mixture of close up shots medium close ups wide angle and on a couple occasions Hughes uses a very wide angle shot to show you how many planes are involved in this major air battle. Hughes also uses flyby shots during this battle where one plane will fly by and right behind will be another plain firing bullets trying to gun the first plane down this mixture of shots really adds to the intensity of this movie.All in all this is a great production by Hughes and his crew but I guess you cant settle for any less when you spend four million dollars on this project. Hughes was a great director and would not accept anything but perfect.".

The only negative I have about the whole movie is that the first half is full of wide angle conversation shots and a few mixed in close ups and the real run doesn't get started until Roy and Monte go off to their war barracks. It is very obvious that Hughes is very passionate about this film and really wants to make it the film of the decade and take movie production of the thirties to a next level. Every thing from the characters to the mise en scene Hughes landed it right on. My favorite part of this movie is when all the planes are all fighting and crashing into each other and all the shooting is done from sky level either from a birds eye view directly underneath the planes or looking right at a pilots face as he shoots gets shot or is shooting. This really shows a great job done by Briggs Lawrence and Hollingsworth as editors. These three men eventhough Hollingsworth is not credited were able to edit all these plane fight scenes and after watching the movie to its entirety then the sky scenes once more I could not notice any continuity editing errors. I am just really amazed that this complex of a film was produced in 1930 and as far as the editing goes I don't think it could be done any better to this day.Another piece of this film that really took my by surprise is the color effects during all the airplane and bomb explosions. We all know going into this movie that it is all shot in black and white but when that first explosion of the Englishman's plane flying into the German 'ship' and that explosion really caught my eye and I was amazed by the detail and bright colors all the sudden shown on the screen. I expected for this even to occur but what I did not expect was this great light show to occur and light up my whole living room especially in an all black and white film. The blues and the yellows are really vibrant and took my by surprise when I first saw something blow up. The cast selected for this movie was another dead on strike by Mr. Hughes. The second I saw Helen I could tell that she was not as into Roy as he was her but she played the part fairly well and when caught kissing the Captain at the bar her reaction was a perfect summary of how she felt for Roy the whole time. I like Roy's character because he just tries to be the nice guy that takes directions and does as he is told. He stays loyal to his relationship with Helen and his love for his country however he does not stay loyal to his brother Monte. I was taken by real surprise when Roy really did shoot his brother at the end of the movie but he still does not give up on his country and ends up getting shot for it. Monte is the only one I'm not really sure about. This is because at first he seems pretty laid back just seems to go with the flow of things then at the end he is ends up being very passionate for his brother and country. I didn't get a real feeling for Monte until they were at dinner and his name was called out as to report for night shift duty after dinner. This scene to me is the best monologue in the whole film. I say that because when Monte starts to explain to his boss why he doesn't want to go on duty that night his words really get me feeling sorry for the guy. He is so passionate and full of emotion that he really does not want to be a part of the war and he does not even understand why they are at war. This short shot is the reason Monte is my favorite character in this movie. The shots in this movie start very plain and rather boring and by then end I was amazed at the way the cameras were used to produce some great shots. The first hour all the shots are of two or three people just having a basic conversation and the scene starts with a wide shot then mixes up close up and medium close ups. By the end of this movie when the main fight scene is going on their is a mixture of close up shots medium close ups wide angle and on a couple occasions Hughes uses a very wide angle shot to show you how many planes are involved in this major air battle. Hughes also uses flyby shots during this battle where one plane will fly by and right behind will be another plain firing bullets trying to gun the first plane down this mixture of shots really adds to the intensity of this movie.All in all this is a great production by Hughes and his crew but I guess you cant settle for any less when you spend four million dollars on this project. Hughes was a great director and would not accept anything but perfect.";

	schema:reviewBody "With everything that went on during the making of this film you can make a good point that it's more interesting than the film itself but don't let that keep you from viewing this because some of the footage that was shot is still amazing to look at. Story surrounds two brothers who end up in World War I together as pilots but also the relationship they share with the same woman. Roy Rutledge James Hall is brave and polite but also dull and he keeps telling everyone around him about his girlfriend Helen Jean Harlow but what he doesn't know is that she's a promiscuous tramp. Roy introduces her to his brother Monte Ben Lyon who's a selfish cad and a playboy and Helen doesn't waste any time getting him to go home with her where she seduces him.SPOILER ALERT Both brothers are pilots for the British Royal Flying Corps and Helen volunteers to work in a Canteen which Roy visits often but one night he catches her with another man and it ends with her telling him that she never loved him in the first place. Later a dangerous mission comes up and both brothers volunteer to fly a German plane into enemy territory and bomb a munitions dump which they succeed in doing but they are also caught and told that if they don't cooperate they will both be shot.This was the first film that Howard Hughes directed and it cost almost 4 million dollars for him to produce which resulted in him never earning a profit in it's initial release. So many things to mention about this film and I guess I'll start with the fact that it was supposed to be a silent film but sound took off during filming and Hughes refilmed several scenes with the actors and one of the interesting things to watch is the newer footage edited in with sound effects. Three pilots working on the film would crash and die during filming and Hughes himself flew some of the planes and crashed twice nearly killing him. There are two scenes that are tinted and hand colored and this film possesses the only color footage in existence of Jean Harlow. I'm one of those who never thought that Harlow was this jaw dropping beauty but I do think she's incredibly sexy in this film. The dresses look like they are ready to fall off of her and considering that this was her first big role it's easy to see why it made her a big star. Some have said that the story is dated but I still see a uniqueness in it especially with the characters and some of the dialog that was written by Hughes. In one scene Monte screams about how senseless the war is and how it was started by politicians and the film doesn't attempt to hide the fact that he would give up information to the enemy to save his own hide. Thank God the Hays Office Production Code that was formed in 1934 wasn't in effect otherwise audiences wouldn't have been titillated by Harlow's deliciously trampy performance. But the highlight of the film is still the aerial dogfight footage and the scene of the German Zeppelin going down while on fire. These scenes still hold up and add to the mystique of Hughes legacy as a maverick in everything that he wanted to do.".

Written out of the love of air planes and the beauty of flying Hell's Angels provides some of the best flying battles assortment of planes amazing aerial shots and stunts. Hell's Angels delves deep into the aero library and features several kinds of airplanes from zeppelins to biplanes and single engine planes. Since the release in 1930 several ways of depicting aerial or space battles have been seen there has been flying models Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope or CGI King Kong. The battles in Hell's Angels are a sure showstopper as the audience is drawn into the real world look of planes flying and crashing. The film doesn't just have one or two planes fighting but multiple planes flying around. The epic battle scenes were shown with such passion and earthshattering explosions literally is something rarely seen preformed today.Of course the beautiful flying sequences and stunts weren't the only astonishment to be seen in Hell's Angels. The movie also went through an early coloring process it may have been primitive by today's standard but during the early 1930's it was ground breaking. The use of the blue or purple dyed film showed an early form of day for night and helped distinguish the difference between day and night in the movie. The movie also tries to go for full color but comes out a little short but it would be at least seven years before color would be enter the movie scene. But color wasn't the only barrier that Hell's Angels broke down it also made the leap from silent to talkie movie during production. It is said that there's 250 feet for every foot of footage in the film release.Hell's Angels takes a look at the reaction of two brothers as World War I hits and how they were once in love with Germany. There's a metaphor for World War I when Baron Von Kranz finds Monte in bed with his wife and kills the romance of his life in return the Baron battles Monte's older brother Roy. World War I started as a small assassination and ended up being a huge battle in Hell's Angels Monte falls for a girl who is already taken and then runs away when he's challenged to a duel and Roy takes the bullet and begins to create a rift between the two brothers. Until the point where Roy was shot it felt like the two brothers were inseparateable and do everything together but as the film progresses the rift between the two grows larger and larger until the end of the film when both brothers realize that they are still brothers and love each other despite the things they had done.The film shows a sexy strong and backstabbing Helene portrayed by the no underwear wearing dyed bombshell Jean Harlow. A women who would go on to inspire a young girl just four years old when the film was released called Marilyn Monroe. Jean Harlow's performances as a seductress and two faced may have been an inspiration for the femme fetales of the film noir genre. Closer look at the other characters and one feels like they are very stereotyped The stiff German officers the older more mature brother the boozing and womanizing younger brother who doesn't have much responsibility. However both the brothers have moments where they shine for Roy it's his decision to fool his brother and kill him before he spills the secrets. For Monte it's his speech on how hard war is and how it can ruin people and how he feels like a pawn. Howard Hughes had a real eye for getting the beautiful feel of flight captured on film and has captured some of the most breath taking footage that stands the test of the time while bringing a real epic feel to the movie and breaking rules and making the movie he wants.".

	schema:headline " The Year For World War I";
	schema:reviewBody "World War I was the source of two great war films All Quiet On The Western Front and Hell's Angels in 1930. The first was the Best Picture for that year according to the Motion Picture Academy the second is known for its special effects and had the Special Effects Oscar been a category that year Hell's Angels would have won no doubt.The other thing that Hell's Angels is noted for is the screen debut of Jean Harlow in a major part. She had done several bit roles prior to Hell's Angels when Howard Hughes who produced and directed this gave her the big break. Harlow is perfect as the flighty upper class woman who flirts between brothers Ben Lyon and James Hall. Hughes photographed her to best advantage the way he would do for Jane Russell later on in The Outlaw. Harlow was not the accomplished comedienne she later became but all she has to do in Hell's Angels is be alluring and sexy and that she did without practice.When it came to the special aerial effects and filming of same no film could touch Hell's Angels. The film received it's one Academy Award nomination for cinematography. It lost to the documentary film With Byrd At The South Pole. If there had been a documentary category that year the Admiral Byrd film would have been in that category and probably an easy winner. As it was the real life heroics of Richard E. Byrd trumped any make believe that Howard Hughes put on the screen.But Howard Hughes was not a man of thespian profession and was no director of actors. He was also no judge of scripts. The plot is an overwrought melodramatic one involving two brothers one a heroic if somewhat dull figure the other one both a ladies man and a weakling as well. Maybe with a real director the acting would have been of a better caliber.The most famous sequence is the aerial battle between the German Zeppelin and the Royal Flying Corps squadron sent up to bring the big dirigible down. Even there with the well done battle sequences there's a bit of ridiculousness where the German crew after everything else has been tossed overboard to lighten the load and gain altitude is asked to sacrifice themselves. And you see them jumping out the plane for the Kaiser and the Reich as they put it WITHOUT PARACHUTES. I mean PLEASE give me a break. The German commander who had a run in with the brothers before the war when they were touring Germany as Oxford students is played by Lucien Prival. He must have been the guy that the producers called for when they couldn't get Erich Von Stroheim. He had all of Von Stroheim's bullnecked Teutonic personality down to the last sneer. He did fine with the part but it must have been something with this guy to be cast in these parts and only when the producers couldn't get Von Stroheim.Aviation fans will love this film but for all its technical wizardry it's not close to being as good as All Quiet On The Western Front.".

The film details the situation in Britain at the end of the 1970s where widespread dissatisfaction and alienation combined with a very dull music scene helped fuel the anger and craziness of Punk which according to John Lydon aka Johnny Rotten gave a  voice to people who previously didn't have a voice.  The film is a collection of present day interviews with the surviving members of the band given in silhouette for some reason archive footage from concerts and TV appearances vintage movie clips notably Laurence Olivier as Richard the Third and surreal animation.The film mostly sidelines the Pistols' notoriously selfaggrandising manager Malcolm McLaran to concentrate on the band members themselves.  The movie gives a good insight into an often quite disturbing world and a scene that was truly anarchic and exciting whether you were a fan or not.  There are also moments of genuine sadness for example when Lydon talks about his friend the late Sid Vicious.

	schema:reviewBody "Forget everything you may have heard or read about the Sex Pistols. Forget Sid and Nancy. This is THE documentary. A warts and all look inside the lives of a band that changed the face of music forever. Never mind Julien Temple's earlier effort The Great Rock and Roll Swindle the sensationalist Malcom McLaren Manager of the Pistols centred documentary. Filth tells the story using the the band and a lot of Temple's own 1970's 'never before seen' home video tapes.In existence for only 26 months and releasing only one album the Sex Pistols evolved within a time of massive economic social and cultural oppression in England. This was an era unlike any other. Staggering youth unemployment squalid streets where the piles of rubbish became small hills and the stench overpowering and with the IRA bombing campaign reaching its peak. One of the most amazing things about this documentary is that it actually takes us back in time to the mid70's landscape of London. Through the use of newsreel footage television adverts of the day weather reports and gameshow clips Filth immerses the viewer in everything absurdly English from the time.The documentary not only lets you feel like you're actually there with the band it tells you so much that you actually believe you were there. Without going into essay length about the story of the Sex Pistols there are just so many interestingbizarre facts revealed about the band that you really begin to realise why they are such a huge influence on music today. I may be ignorant but I now know that Johnny Rotten started spitting on stage only because of his sinus problems Sid Vicious inadvertently started the pogo dance and the band were the first ever to say the F word on British television. David Bowie Siouxie Sioux and Elvis Costello could often be spotted at a Pistols show and opening bands on the bill ranged from The Clash The Damned and The Buzzcocks.Onetoone interviews with each surviving band member as well as extensive interview footage with Sid Vicious Hyde Park1978 are revealing and extremely honest. The many sides and angles of the Pistols story have been told by those that lived it. Almost all of the interviews have been shot in silhouette so the only faces you see are those of the members being The Sex Pistols. The idea being not to spoil the feel or continuity of the film and from saving us all having to look at a bunch of old blokes talking about those crazy days.Julien Temple proves himself to be the only man for the job of Director. There is a lot to be said about someone who abandons there student film career and goes about documenting a band but Julien Temple did just that. His ability to display the true personalities of each band member is remarkable and this has translated over to the audience. In a recent interview he states People have watched the film and been almost in tears at the end which is the last thing you would expect from a Sex Pistols movie. But it is because there was never anything about the Pistols that you expected that was part of their power.No I didnt cry but the story of the Pistols is a tragic one ending with the split of the group Sid Vicious being the prime suspect over the death of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen and then his drug induced death months later.Whether you're a fan of the Sex Pistols or not is really irrelevant. Whether you play in a punk band is also irrelevant although it'll make you think twice about the term punk. The point is if your interested in music popular culture or human behaviour this is a movie that will reward you.

	onyx:emotionText "Forget everything you may have heard or read about the Sex Pistols. Forget Sid and Nancy. This is THE documentary. A warts and all look inside the lives of a band that changed the face of music forever. Never mind Julien Temple's earlier effort The Great Rock and Roll Swindle the sensationalist Malcom McLaren Manager of the Pistols centred documentary. Filth tells the story using the the band and a lot of Temple's own 1970's 'never before seen' home video tapes.In existence for only 26 months and releasing only one album the Sex Pistols evolved within a time of massive economic social and cultural oppression in England. This was an era unlike any other. Staggering youth unemployment squalid streets where the piles of rubbish became small hills and the stench overpowering and with the IRA bombing campaign reaching its peak. One of the most amazing things about this documentary is that it actually takes us back in time to the mid70's landscape of London. Through the use of newsreel footage television adverts of the day weather reports and gameshow clips Filth immerses the viewer in everything absurdly English from the time.The documentary not only lets you feel like you're actually there with the band it tells you so much that you actually believe you were there. Without going into essay length about the story of the Sex Pistols there are just so many interestingbizarre facts revealed about the band that you really begin to realise why they are such a huge influence on music today. I may be ignorant but I now know that Johnny Rotten started spitting on stage only because of his sinus problems Sid Vicious inadvertently started the pogo dance and the band were the first ever to say the F word on British television. David Bowie Siouxie Sioux and Elvis Costello could often be spotted at a Pistols show and opening bands on the bill ranged from The Clash The Damned and The Buzzcocks.Onetoone interviews with each surviving band member as well as extensive interview footage with Sid Vicious Hyde Park1978 are revealing and extremely honest. The many sides and angles of the Pistols story have been told by those that lived it. Almost all of the interviews have been shot in silhouette so the only faces you see are those of the members being The Sex Pistols. The idea being not to spoil the feel or continuity of the film and from saving us all having to look at a bunch of old blokes talking about those crazy days.Julien Temple proves himself to be the only man for the job of Director. There is a lot to be said about someone who abandons there student film career and goes about documenting a band but Julien Temple did just that. His ability to display the true personalities of each band member is remarkable and this has translated over to the audience. In a recent interview he states People have watched the film and been almost in tears at the end which is the last thing you would expect from a Sex Pistols movie. But it is because there was never anything about the Pistols that you expected that was part of their power.No I didnt cry but the story of the Pistols is a tragic one ending with the split of the group Sid Vicious being the prime suspect over the death of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen and then his drug induced death months later.Whether you're a fan of the Sex Pistols or not is really irrelevant. Whether you play in a punk band is also irrelevant although it'll make you think twice about the term punk. The point is if your interested in music popular culture or human behaviour this is a movie that will reward you. Both entertaining and informative The Filth and The Fury actually delivers as being the definitive story of The Sex Pistols.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Filth and the Fury is directed by Julien Temple and is a rockumentary charting the rise and fall of Punk Rock flag bearers The Sex Pistols. 20 years earlier Temple had made The Great Rock and Roll Swindle a bonkers and quirky movie that skewed the Sex Pistols legend as some elaborate hoax formulated by band manager Malcolm McLaren. The Filth and the Fury tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves and goes some way to dispelling the myths that surround them and their self publicising manager. The title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror after an interview with the band on ITV's Today show presented by Bill Grundy. The story follows the band members from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their implosion at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco and then to coup de grace as Sid Vicious  Nancy Spungen left the mortal coil.Love them or hate them The Sex Pistols in the mid to late 70s created a wave in the music industry that can still be felt today. Most of it now seems tame of course swearing on TV and alleged distasteful songs are common practice these days but it were not the case back when flared trousers and guys wearing make up gave way to Punk Rock Britannia. But is there anything here for those who just don't get that the Pistols were influential and one of Britain's most important bands? Yes definitely. This is no rose tinted glasses documentary serving only to keep the Pistols name on the high heat. Nor is it over an hour and half of their videos and live footage. Of course the music features prominently but it's in context to the story a story that sees the remaining band members give frank and honest assessments of the time the place and the now.Interviewing the band singularly in darkened silhouette to give off the impression we are witnessing criminal informers at work Temple also puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s. This is crucial to the origins of the band. It was a time of strikes and suspect politicians so with archival footage from the period Temple fuses the Pistols ire with that of a country that was limping along in apathy. Haters of the band don't want to agree of course but the Pistols showed that not all of Britain would surrender meekly and that music could actually make a difference and shake up the system. Get Off Your Arse snarled John and thousands did as Punk bands formed over night and showed that the youth of the day had a voice. How many bands can say that eh?But as we know it was to be a short lived journey for the band one that would end in tragedy as first the press went bazooka over the top with their every move and then as one out of his depth bass player lost sight of the bands vision. This part of the film is subtly handled by Temple the sense of impending doom hangs heavy none more so with the old interviews held with Vicious that are woven into the last third as self destruction grows ever near. These sequences show what many people either forget or don't realise that Vicious was just a kid of 21 years of age. This part of the tale also lets us into an untapped part of Lydon's neRotten emotional side a telling moment that brings the sorry chapter to a close.From a time when music could be as dangerous as the politicians running the country The Filth  The Fury is an essential music based movie. Not just for fans of the band nor just for curious music fans in general but also for historians wishing to see just how bad late 1970s Britain was. 1010".

It's a thoroughly enjoyable docu film with some great footage and really encompasses the whole scene. It's amazing how times have moved on really and this is also a look at how society was so stuck up it's own arris here in the UK at that period.John Lydon has always been much more than just a yob of a front man as every interview I have ever heard with him he has always spoken with true meaning and passion. This has not changed my mind and you cannot help but be moved by his interview especially on the death of Sid. The best moments for me are the interviews and clips of journalist Nick Kent an absolute 'kent' if ever there was one. As a big Adam Ant fan it was nice to see some footage of the man behind the song Press Darlings and boy did he come up trumps. What a complete.... It also reveals McLaren to be the compete tt he was too. A great film for everyone with even a passing interest in music and not just punk. It's about a change in ideals and the times.

The band their formation joining up with McLaren firing Glen Matlock replacing him with Vicious their problems in the United Kingdom and the United States and the eventual end of the band due to Vicious's heroin addiction.The documentary really got inside of the Sex Pistols and showed a more human side of the band.  While the band is often made out to be a bunch of rowdy angry punk rock kids the documentary showed a different side to them.  Footage is shown of the band during a children's benefit show and the band members are seen playing with and talking to the kids with huge smiles on their faces their joy at being at the event evident.  Johnny Rotten also spends a large amount of time at the end of the film discussing Vicious' heroin addiction and his guilt at being unable to help his friend before it was too late.I really liked the live footage of the Sex Pistols shows as it showed the band in their element and also did a lot to show what the scene was like when the Pistols were around and I could see how little it has changed since then.  The footage shown of the Sex Pistols on a British television show and clips of newspaper articles at the time also did a lot to show the band's image in the eyes of the media as well.One problem with the movie was that live footage of the band would be playing and then the film would cut to scenes from a Shakespeare movie or other random scene which completely detracted from the film.  Every time one of those clips would cut in it would jar my attention from the story and it definitely broke up the cohesiveness of the film.I think the film did a good job capturing the image that the Sex Pistols gave off while also contrasting it with more human images of them like during the children's show.  Overall I think the film was very well done though I would have liked to have seen more background on each of the band members rather than the Shakespearean ode.  I would give this film a 710 and would recommend it to anyone looking for information about the Sex Pistols.".

	schema:reviewBody "if your not a pistols fan before you watch this you definalty will be after. at least thats the experience I've had from myself and people i know viewing this film. i was already a bit of a fan. you know i had a thing for sid pre nancy days and i thought johnny rotten was a unique man. but after watching this documentary with my dad  who is a musician but never liked anything the pistols did i realized that this band was so much more than the punks they were made out to be they were rebeling against being a product of their surroundings but at the same time find that it near impossible to achieve. my dad on the other hand watched the movie and immediately asked for one of my pistols cd. so i game him never mind the bollocks and set off to listen. the very next day i find him singing 'anarchy' while doing the dishes. his views were exactly hte same as mine. except this documentary turned him from a non believe to a fan.I'm not really one for documentaries... i thought id cracked it when i watched spinal tap and then realsied that they were only mocking hte whole genre... so then i felt like a fool but immediately went to see if my dads marshall went up to 11 rather than just 10. but the filth and the fury held my attention from the very first shot to the rolling of the credits. so naturally when i saw it in the store i bought it and I've watched it A lot of times since. sometimes in the row... and every time it makes me laugh and cry and makes me want to have lived back in the days of the punk.the filth and the fury is an emotional ride of a doco that combines everything you want in a movie with an awesome soundtrack and some real meaning. this documentary is a MUST for all music fans whether you think you like the pistols or not. by the end of it you will be converted. or just appreciative. its an excellent piece of film making that tells the story of one of the most influential bands of the 70's and indeed of rock history.".

Immigrants  legal and illegal  were taking work cheap and crowding out the council estates thus leaving youth disaffected with no hope. The Sex Pistols voice that deep discontent so the Callahan Labour government ginned up a campaign of 2 Minutes Hate as a temporary distraction from his evil party's stupid policies. I was caught up in it too.However in 1985 I bought a copy of Never Mind TheBollocks. After listening to it enough times to decipher the lyrics I was blown away! No wonder the government had to shut them up the Pistols pulled no punches  calling the government a fascist regime was simply going too far. Well God bless these lads.This film paints the despair of four down and out yet very real people. I'd buy the fellows a round any time. They are genuine no phoniness whatsoever. The best scenes are when the band hurled green on the hooknosed heroin addict from the New Musical Express who was responsible for starting the media's hate campaign. And also the scene during the TV interview with the totally forgettable Bernard Whathisname. The lecherous host came on to one of their fans so Glen called him a dirty old man. You could see this lilylivered coward blanch with fear and cringe as he called for a commercial break.The Sex Pistols proved to the world that if you have something to say then set it to 3 chord rock and proclaim it loudly!".

	schema:headline " So much better than Julien Temple's first fulllength Sex Pistols film";
	schema:reviewBody "Twenty years after the release of The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle Julien Temple's weird incoherent mockumentary about the Sex Pistols another film about the shortlived but groundbreaking 70's punk rock band from the same filmmaker first saw the light of day. Unlike its predecessor The Filth and the Fury can actually be classified as a documentary. I had never heard of this one by the time I first saw Swindle but saw both of them I think twice each in 2006. This month I've revisited both films. The first of the two went way downhill for me with my last viewing whereas this one which I always thought was the stronger of the two certainly didn't. It seems my opinion of this 2000 documentary hasn't changed.Temple's two Sex Pistols films tell a different side of the story. The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle tells the band's manager Malcolm McLaren's side of the story. This followup focuses on the point of view of the band members. Frontman John Lydon a.k.a. Johnny Rotten guitarist Steve Jones drummer Paul Cook and original bass player Glen Matlock featured in silhouette form give viewers an insight on their beginnings how the band formed their experiences and the impact they had during their time together which obviously included a lot of controversy and their breakup. They also contradict McLaren's claims about the band. Lots of archive footage is also featured including clips from Swindle and interviews with the band's late second bass player Sid Vicious.This film isn't exactly perfect. A lot of the archive footage is shown as we hear the band members talking and it can be hard to pay attention to both at the same time. Clips like the Shakespeare ones are also unnecessary. Maybe the documentary could have used a more downtoearth director. However other than that I don't have too many complaints. It's still a very interesting piece if you're a Sex Pistols fan and much more believable than what McLaren says in this film's predecessor. Some good footage is featured here and the band members have some fascinating things to say. Of course several Pistols songs are featured as well at least partially. Like Swindle The Filth and the Fury has problems with the way it's put together but it's definitely more coherent and I've always found it easier to pick up what is said in this film than I have with what is said in the 1980 mockumentary.Comparing Julien Temple's two Sex Pistols films and the two different sides of the story they show I would say the band members have a much stronger case than their manager. It seems to me that the first film of the two is pretty much nonsense with nothing gripping or too memorable. This second film on the other hand is an insightful documentary about the controversial band with some poignant moments. In Swindle you don't see McLaren crying over anything do you? However in this film that's just what John Lydon does while talking about Sid Vicious at one point! So overall The Filth and the Fury is a well done insightful film about a groundbreaking band and I recommend it for any Pistols fan. Unlike its predecessor one can watch this film for more than just entertainment though it can be good for that as well. No wonder it's more popular than the disjointed mess that came before it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the first ten minutes of F  T F I can honestly say that I experienced the only true religious experience I've ever felt in the matrix of a movie theatre. I had an outofbody experience so completely was a swept into the world of Julian Temple's interpretation of what The Sex Pistols were how they came to be when they came to be and the madness of Great Britain that allowed them to come to be. It was probably the only time cheek irony ever really worked that is playing majestically classical music during the opening credits. And then that marvelous segue from the lowerincome housing courtyard to Johnny's blistering presence. As ferociously brilliant a film as the band itself. But the film is more than just about the band it's also about the fear of the establishment when its status quo is threatened the media and British society. The hypocrisy of the British government is ever evident when we see a public official denouncing the band as a disgusting bunch subhuman runts that are the antithesis to humankind and then later see this and play a benefit concert and host an xmas party for the children of striking firefighters. THAT WAS THE POINT OF THE PISTOLS in some respects. Their anger was grounded in the mistreatment of working people. Maybe it was a publicity booster but I've seldom seen any American bands get their ands dirty and link up with Labor issues. The film is also about Language. It seems that using racial epithets are accepted in some British circles but airing some traditional four letter words on public television is still taboo. Antidrug? Certainly. Johhny Rotten comes right out and extols the evils of Heroin and we see what it can do to a human being in Sid and his ultimate demise. SEE THIS MOVIE!".

Here's one example of whyIf you listen to the song I'll Never Fall in Love Again you'll notice that the lyrics are very bitter to say the least.  But there's nothing bitter about the accompanying music.  It doesn't punctuate nor put to sound the extreme emotion that the singersongwriter was feeling at the time of the song's conception it's just cutesy and nauseatingly nice a sugarcoating until you realize Wait a minute this isn't a nice song it's totally angry and bitter.That's why it came into being in Britain anyway the Sex Pistols were not just making the loudest noise at the time but the noise also seemed to be the only one that fit what they as well as many others were feeling at the time.This documentary is not a P.R. film that is clipped to portray the Sex Pistols as great and wonderful geniuses of music who changed the world as most movies and documentaries do it explains what it all meant to the members of the band in THEIR time and place and why they HAD to come into being then and there.

That's probably where the explanation If you don't know what it meansmeant then up yours came from.By the way in case you're wondering about how biased my opinion is I should let you know that I'm fully aware that such groups as Black Sabbath who knew more about instrumentation more or less started that GodAwful Noise approximately 10 years prior to Punk's conception much less given its title.  So as much as I enjoy Punk and Metal as well as Mozart Bjork 2Live Crew and many others depending on my mood I know very well that there is nothing new under the sun and that they were no more original than Grunge groups like Nirvana if you stick a pearlywhite tooth and leave it in a glass of cola for a month is the brown tooth you see later a different tooth?  Of course not.Anyway for the fans as well as those who didn't understand this is one very welltold explanation.  Love the subculture andor the music hate it feel what you will about it.  At least you'll have a clue to understanding maybe not supporting but at least understanding why it WAS.

	schema:reviewBody "In interviews done at the time of the film's release Julien Temple talked about the genesis of this film and the reasoning behind some of the peculiar and novel gimmicks he used. Basically he had some outtakes that he had filmed for The Great Rock  Roll Swindle as well as some random British TV recordings from the 1970's that he had recorded on one of the first commercial VCR's. Temple wanted to use this material to tell the story of the Sex Pistols from their point of view rather than Malcolm Maclaren's point of view presented in The Great Rock  Roll Swindle. He said he included the ancillary material such as the video recordings to give a flavor of the times. The reason he gave for recording the living Pistols in witnessprotection style silhouette and Maclaren in a mask was to hide their age and make it seem like the interviews were contemporaneous with the other footage especially with regard to the interview of a nonsilhouetted Sid Vicious in London's Hyde Park in 1978. In practice the silhouettes are annoying and repetitive and make it hard to identify who is speaking on first viewing.This film has exactly the same flaws as Temple's original effort The Great Rock  Roll Swindle  its account of the Pistols' story is a biased inaccurate incomplete poorlystructured mess frequently interrupted by unnecessary gimmicky distracting pretentious irrelevant inserts that have nothing to do with the main story. Only this time instead of portraying the Sex Pistols as mindless puppets in a cynical commercial ploy by a clever manager they are portrayed implicitly via news footage from the 1970's as idealists making political statements about their society financially exploited by a useless Maclaren. Both slants are fantasy. The Pistols have repeatedly pointed out they were not political although Rotten has in recent years started parroting some of the fantasies written about him and the punk scene by intellectuals any quasipolitical imagery foisted on the band was largely the doing of the supposedly useless Maclaren and his cronies. We see all the usual tricks of agendapushing documentaries with isolated possibly irrelevant snippets of visual interest e.g. a fat racist squirming through a window to rant to a TV camera edited together to imply relatedness. What's more many of these clips appear to date from long after the Pistols formed. Likewise we see the bad guys Maclaren and cronies in unflattering shots and the good guys the Pistols in flattering or neutral shots. That's just childish as are the sudden dramatic increases in volume every time a Pistols song starts playing.Instead of Rock  Roll Swindle's cutaways to shots of Maclaren singing mugging and pontificating we get Olivier playing Richard III or TV ads or weather reports or forgotten comedians. These nonsequiturs are supposedly justified on the grounds of Rotten citing his influences or as a reflection of life in the 1970's but it goes on and on and on long after the original point if any was made until the original point is lost. When Temple was asked if there was any Pistols footage left unused after The Filth and The Fury he said there wasn't really apart from additional concert footage which he considered redundant. This I suspect is the real reason for the excessive irrelevant footage i.e. filler to get a commercial length for a feature film. I would dearly love to have seen the redundant concert footage instead. It would have been infinitely more interesting entertaining and relevant. Temple's TV archives could have interest in their own right but they belong in a separate documentary.Ignoring the inept pretentious directing this film does have many priceless moments and does reveal a number of obscure or unknown facts about the Pistols although I was surprised at how little unused footage there really was and how much was reused from the final cut of Swindle. The Pistols are shown to be funny intelligent and personable far removed from the punk caricatures. The 3 Johns and John's closeness to Sid and John's crying over his dead friend are a revelation. So too the Pistols' last concert before their American tour a firemen's benefit with lots of young dancing children joining the band in a cream pie fight  not very punk but oddly touching. We see footage from the Pistols' very earliest days together with some of the bizarre early fans like Sue Catwoman highlighting the bohemian roots of the punk scene. We get to see footage of the disgusting Nancy Spungeon. In a remarkable stroke of luck Temple captured skinny teenage punk fan Shane MacGowan long before he was famous doing an acapella rendition of Anarchy in the UK on the grounds of a council flat and schoolteacher Sting playing a gay rapist in a scene from the abortive Who Killed Bambi movie. But by far the funniest scene in the film was the intro to a 1978 American TV music show in which the Pistols were the most normal most successful and least ridiculouslooking band to appear on the program.In summary this film was a wasted opportunity on account of the talentless director. But it's still essential for the odd gem of obscure Pistols footage which even Temple couldn't mess up. If you want to see the definitive Pistols documentary check out the Never Mind The Bolloks episode of the Classic Albums TV documentary series.".

I suppose that's because most of the surviving participants have too much ego invested or because as the years fade and the original social context disappears the meaning of Punk  at its inception  becomes harder to decipher and easier to forget.I was in NYC in '76 when it was first breaking for the national press and I hung around CBGBs under a number of pseudonyms trying to write reviews and articles on bands that nobody ever heard of many of them breaking up before I could dot the last i in the last paragraph. And I tried out a couple bands of my own weird blends of Iggy and the Velvet Underground. But I was really an outsider coming from upstate and when the London scene started shipping singles over I knew that for whatever reason my heart was really more into Anarchy and White Riot than the metalsurfmusic of the Ramones or early Blondie. But this disjunction of 'right time wrong place' or whatever allowed me to see the development of Punk in a way others seem content to ignore.The fundamental problem that Punk never resolved and current neopunks are still struggling with it is whether Punk was to be a continuance of the counter culture of the '60s in different guise or just another popmusic for sexually frustrated young people. This sounds like an empty theoretical issue but it has one allimportant concrete aspect to it no one can ignore  money. Did do punks make music to make music  or to make money? That question was never answered or perhaps every punk answered answers it in his her own way. Yet once we begin adding up all the individual answers most of them sure come out sounding like money. Yet the memory of Punk survives largely because it seemed to be about anything other than money so the dilemma continues.That dilemma surfaces again in this film especially in the discovery of the wretched ripoff Pistols manager Malcom McLaren pulled not only on the audience but on the Pistols themselves. The brief moments from the thankfully unfinished Who Shot Bambi? make it very clear that McLaren had not the slightest clue as to who the Pistols were or what they represented. Yet he not only continued to guide their career after their breakup but is warmly mentioned in Griel Marcus' scholarly history of Punk Lipstick Traces which will probably bear influence on punk histories long after the last photoalbum paperback turns to dust. Yet it is clear that from the getgo McLaren's only interest was the profit.The Pistols were right and are right to ignore questions concerning their materialism or selling out since they were never part of the hippies' 'antimaterialism' ideal to begin with and because they never denied a desire for some paycheck which they almost never got from McLaren. But also plain is their desire to make the music of the UK workingclass slums from whence they came.All of this comes to a head in the brief yet unforgettable tragedy of Sid Vicious  for whom music meant freedom and money meant  heroin. But junky 'rockstars' don't play at commercial venues to make music. He ended up in NYC which by then had a punk scene swarming with recordco.exec vermin dealing dope and poseur sycophants trying to score. Eventually all that was left was the heroin and it killed him.This film won't resolve any of these issues but it may help raise them and place them in a proper light. I can't agree that it is a wellmade film  the editing which is very flashy is also somewhat vapid and goes out of control too often. But there's adequate reminder of the era of the Pistols here and why it was many of us thought at the time and still believe that the Pistols were the most important rock band in history.The segment from the final performance at Winterland is worth the price of the film sameold sameold music concerts are no fun and Jones and Rotten knowing they've been betrayed by McLaren into performing for the corporate music world they hated rub our noses in it until they've had enough and stalk off. If you can see this  and know what it's about  and still pay 200 to see Mick Jagger pull his wrinkled pud at you at the age of 65 you don't need a movie review you need a psychiatrist.".

Come to think of it the last 20 years when I first started listening to them in junior high also zipped by pretty fast...they put all the best songs the best performances in there along with some rare footage. Sex Pistols fans may have already seen the interview with a noddedout Sid Vicious and sleazy girlfriend Nancy Spungen who makes Courtney Love at her worst look like Grace Kelly trying to wake him up for the camera as he snores. But what no fans may not have seen is a short heartbreaking clip of an interview with Vicious after he is out on bail after being arrested for her murder. When the interviewer thoughtlessly asks him if he's 'having fun right now' Vicious just chuckles bitterly and asks him Are you kidding? No I'm not having any fun at all. when the interviewer asks him where he wishes he was right now Vicious' quiet calm answer to the question is so chilling and heartfelt that it made every hair on my body stand on end. In a scene shortly after John Lydon talks about Sid getting his wish and for a minute you think in the voice over he is laughing because as a rule you don't see him displaying any other emotion other than general crankiness then you suddenly realize he's actually in tears over his dead boyhood friend. But you can also see the fun the Sex Pistols had while it lastedespecially memorable during a reminisence of how they played a children's party with footage of them covered in cake later to one of the Pistol's best songs Bodies. The soundtrack timing and editing are all perfect. As I said my one complaint that was it zipped by too fast but talking with my husband after the movie so did the Sex Pistols.

	schema:reviewBody "The Sex Pistols were one of the most underrated bands ever just listen to the driving guitar of Steve Jones the wailing dynamic voice of Johnny Rotten and the drums of Paul Cooke driving the rhythm with Glen Matlock on the bass yes Glen Matlock on the bass and not Sid Vicious Sid came later and couldn't play the bass by all accounts thus giving the band its reputation of incompetence which they didn't deserve so they only used three chords so what so did some of the rock'n'roll greats of the fifties and so did The Ramones.I am not of the same age as The Sex Pistols I identify more with the likes of Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly but I sure envied the fans in the 100 club shown in this movie when they witnessed The Sex Pistols there on Oxford Street with Sid in the audience inventing his pogo dance.In this film we get an early glimpse of their Svengali Malcolm McLaren at the store SEX that he owned with his then wife Vivienne Westwood we see him as he swans around the shop like Sean O'Casey's strutting peacock wearing a teddyboy suit and sporting a duck's arse hair cut here was the opportunist who was to take The Sex Pistols to the top and leave them there high and almost dry in America with no money no access to credit and no communication as he refused to take or return any of their calls McLaren was booked into a luxury hotel whilst the band had to make do with some motel.The Pistols response to this was to tell the audience that they were getting 'one song and one song only as this isn't fun' Johnny Rotten called on his alter ego John Lydon to relay that pathetic statement to the American crowd this didn't seem to be the type of crowd that cut Sid's face that night with a missile earlier in an American performance this was a crowd that took notice when they heard that it wasn't fun any more it was then that we heard the voice over of Steve Jones saying that he had looked at Sid trying to play a bass that he wasn't sure was plugged in and wondered if he wanted to go ahead being a Pistol he said he left soon after that but had regretted it ever since he loved performing and loved the sex it had brought him throughout the touring life of The Sex Pistols.Interviews with the members of the band were carried out in silhouette throughout and it became clear that the band trusted the man doing the interviews one Julien Temple the director of this film who knew the band from his previous movie 'The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle' which he had made twenty years prior to this one.Even though it had been twenty one years since the death of the twenty two year old Sid Vicious the telling of the story brought a tear to Johnny Rotten's eye as it is quite clear that John Ritchie or John Beverly or whatever Sid's real name was was the biggest victim in the whole Sex Pistols story he was one of the Johns who had always been a friend of the other John the John they changed to Johnny Rotten.There is a lot of archive footage in the film and a lot of it is entertaining we do see the situation as it was in Britain during the seventies which led up to the famous 'winter of discontent' and we even see the man himself Laurence Olivier uttering those famous Shakespearian lines from his own movie 'Richard III' from whence the newspaper subeditors stole the quote we see political Britain and racist xenophobic Britain but we also see very funny Britain there is footage from some of the funniest men of the day where else can we see archive footage of Nat Jackley Tommy Cooper Max Wall Billy Dainty and even Arthur Askey who was as funny as toothache? There is the infamous television interview with Bill Grundy who we are told by Steve in voice over was drunk too  we weren't there but it was a terrible interview and the poor fellow deserved to be fired which came soon after that day in 1976.I didn't have anything to do with these people as there was another CS on the scene in London who owned a club and knew Julien Temple but I remember them from afar as their music was as exciting as the first time people of my age had heard Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard it was a terrible shock when they went away and Elvis started to sing ballads but bands like the Pistols hit the dust too when it stopped being fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Sex Pistols were one of the most underrated bands ever just listen to the driving guitar of Steve Jones the wailing dynamic voice of Johnny Rotten and the drums of Paul Cooke driving the rhythm with Glen Matlock on the bass yes Glen Matlock on the bass and not Sid Vicious Sid came later and couldn't play the bass by all accounts thus giving the band its reputation of incompetence which they didn't deserve so they only used three chords so what so did some of the rock'n'roll greats of the fifties and so did The Ramones.I am not of the same age as The Sex Pistols I identify more with the likes of Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly but I sure envied the fans in the 100 club shown in this movie when they witnessed The Sex Pistols there on Oxford Street with Sid in the audience inventing his pogo dance.In this film we get an early glimpse of their Svengali Malcolm McLaren at the store SEX that he owned with his then wife Vivienne Westwood we see him as he swans around the shop like Sean O'Casey's strutting peacock wearing a teddyboy suit and sporting a duck's arse hair cut here was the opportunist who was to take The Sex Pistols to the top and leave them there high and almost dry in America with no money no access to credit and no communication as he refused to take or return any of their calls McLaren was booked into a luxury hotel whilst the band had to make do with some motel.The Pistols response to this was to tell the audience that they were getting 'one song and one song only as this isn't fun' Johnny Rotten called on his alter ego John Lydon to relay that pathetic statement to the American crowd this didn't seem to be the type of crowd that cut Sid's face that night with a missile earlier in an American performance this was a crowd that took notice when they heard that it wasn't fun any more it was then that we heard the voice over of Steve Jones saying that he had looked at Sid trying to play a bass that he wasn't sure was plugged in and wondered if he wanted to go ahead being a Pistol he said he left soon after that but had regretted it ever since he loved performing and loved the sex it had brought him throughout the touring life of The Sex Pistols.Interviews with the members of the band were carried out in silhouette throughout and it became clear that the band trusted the man doing the interviews one Julien Temple the director of this film who knew the band from his previous movie 'The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle' which he had made twenty years prior to this one.Even though it had been twenty one years since the death of the twenty two year old Sid Vicious the telling of the story brought a tear to Johnny Rotten's eye as it is quite clear that John Ritchie or John Beverly or whatever Sid's real name was was the biggest victim in the whole Sex Pistols story he was one of the Johns who had always been a friend of the other John the John they changed to Johnny Rotten.There is a lot of archive footage in the film and a lot of it is entertaining we do see the situation as it was in Britain during the seventies which led up to the famous 'winter of discontent' and we even see the man himself Laurence Olivier uttering those famous Shakespearian lines from his own movie 'Richard III' from whence the newspaper subeditors stole the quote we see political Britain and racist xenophobic Britain but we also see very funny Britain there is footage from some of the funniest men of the day where else can we see archive footage of Nat Jackley Tommy Cooper Max Wall Billy Dainty and even Arthur Askey who was as funny as toothache? There is the infamous television interview with Bill Grundy who we are told by Steve in voice over was drunk too  we weren't there but it was a terrible interview and the poor fellow deserved to be fired which came soon after that day in 1976.I didn't have anything to do with these people as there was another CS on the scene in London who owned a club and knew Julien Temple but I remember them from afar as their music was as exciting as the first time people of my age had heard Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard it was a terrible shock when they went away and Elvis started to sing ballads but bands like the Pistols hit the dust too when it stopped being fun.";

Could we get some fing TRUTH in here?! Julien Temple apparently felt the weight of guilt upon his shoulders after aiding and abetting Malcolm McLaren in his insipid attempt to take credit not only for every single thing the Sex Pistols ever did but for the creation of punk rock which goes all the way back to the end of the '60s if you wanna get technical...so get stuffed Malcolm.Here Temple interviews the band in silhouette and throws at us a barrage of great clips from the hundreds of hours that he shot during the making of Swindle...included are several bits that were featured in the aforementioned film but they're given a different spin which actually has a ring of truth about it...as well as a great deal that we've never seen before no doubt because that footage undermines the whole concept of the first film...namely I am Malcolm McLaren...the Sex Pistols were nothing...it was all me...worship me now.It's quite refreshing to hear Steve Jones the only member of the band who ever really liked McLaren to begin with musing as to how everyone in the world knows Malcolm's full of s. That's right...we do. And especially enjoyable were the band's recollections of how McLaren was panicking after the infamous Bill Grundy incident. Funny when you watch Swindle it seems like it was all his idea...just like everything else. Oh Malcolm...can your own life be so meaningless that you feel the need to take credit for everyone else's actions? Nevermind...that's rhetorical.What this film gives us that its predecessor lacked aside from the absence of staged McLaren egotrip material is a historically accurate account of the band's existence from its inception to its inevitable selfdestruction.Not to mention that it actually contains genuine human emotion...something which Swindle lacked altogether. Especially touching are John's recollections of Sid Vicious's death...and how it was turned into more money in McLaren's pockets. You can't get more evil than that can you? This was someone that John cared for like a brother and his absence still hurts even 20 years later.Overall this film delivers the goods in every conceivable way. It is not only the ONLY worthwhile documentary about the Sex Pistols...it's also the best rock  roll documentary I have ever seen. Anyone with an interest in the musical evolution of the 20th century should miss this film at their own expense.".

He looked and sounded so different from anybody else particular the musicians who were on TV a lot like Abba and David Cassidy. He was scary unique funny and behind his penetrating stare there was an almost ruthless questioning intelligence. I never bought for a second what the authorities said about how The Sex Pistols would create a corrupt society. I thought a corrupt society had created The Sex Pistols and I thought their music  and the music of the many bands they influenced  was brilliant. This thoughtprovoking documentary is a companion piece to Temple's 1980 cult classic The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. But whereas that was the brainchild of their egocentric impresario manager Malcolm McLaren this is their story in the band's own words. It deals with the social upheavals of seventies Britain which gave rise to them and then does an excellent job of charting their progress from alternative music club heroes to national pariahs to chart topping music icons to disillusioned and rippedoff losers without pulling any punches. Typical Sex Pistols day internal band punch up in limo sign prestigious contract in front of Buckingham Palace get wasted and trash record company offices record a number one hit single God Save The Queen which was subsequently banned and get fired by your new label. If anyone has the right to call themselves anarchists it's them. Some of the footage in this film comes from Swindle and other familiar sources but there is also lots of new stuff particularly some intimate pieces with Vicious which make his pathetic tragic fate all the more sobering. It's also packed full of tubthumpingly great music and performances from a terrific band who compressed so much energy into their shortlived career. A must for all punk fans and for anybody interested in one of the most influential musical movements of all time. The title comes from a tabloid newspaper headline the day after their infamous Bill Grundy TV interview. For more detailed insights into Lydon and the heady years of the late seventies read his excellent book No Irish No Blacks No Dogs.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was almost hooted into oblivion by the critics at the time of its release so when I saw it on one of the Cinemax channels last night I was surprised that it wasn't much worse. A few months ago I saw the highly acclaimed docudrama on Fidel on Showtime and this film while not as good as the Showtime drama is not all that much worse either.First the bad stuff. Jack Palance's portrayal of Fidel Castro must rank as one of the worst performances ever to appear on screen. During the first half of the film he spends most of the time rolling a lit cigar around in his mouth and making weird facial grimaces most of which he seems to have forgotten by the second half. Moreover he makes Castro come across as a dimwitted doofus who is always helped to see the right course by the brilliant Che rather than portraying Castro as the brilliant strategist and tactician he was. Secondly although the film is in English much of the spoken dialogue sounds like a dubbed movie. Maybe that's because one of the principal supporting actors is Italian.That having been said the film's history is quite surprisingly fairly accurate. It accurately depicts how Castro's forces were almost completely wiped out after the arrival from Mexico and Castro was left with a force numbering less than twenty. Nevertheless he survives and gradually wins the support of the peasants so that eventually he has a guerrilla force numbering in the thousands. The fact that Guevara was unable to pull off the same feat in Bolivia due largely to his own megalomania that prevented his listening to the Bolivian peasants is accurately portrayed as well. This isn't available on video and isn't likely to come to a theater so you can probably see it only on cable. If it comes along it's worth a watch.".

Jack Palance's portrayal of Fidel Castro must rank as one of the worst performances ever to appear on screen. During the first half of the film he spends most of the time rolling a lit cigar around in his mouth and making weird facial grimaces most of which he seems to have forgotten by the second half. Moreover he makes Castro come across as a dimwitted doofus who is always helped to see the right course by the brilliant Che rather than portraying Castro as the brilliant strategist and tactician he was. Secondly although the film is in English much of the spoken dialogue sounds like a dubbed movie. Maybe that's because one of the principal supporting actors is Italian.That having been said the film's history is quite surprisingly fairly accurate. It accurately depicts how Castro's forces were almost completely wiped out after the arrival from Mexico and Castro was left with a force numbering less than twenty. Nevertheless he survives and gradually wins the support of the peasants so that eventually he has a guerrilla force numbering in the thousands. The fact that Guevara was unable to pull off the same feat in Bolivia due largely to his own megalomania that prevented his listening to the Bolivian peasants is accurately portrayed as well. This isn't available on video and isn't likely to come to a theater so you can probably see it only on cable. If it comes along it's worth a watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you are determined to see CHE! no matter what I highly suggest you first pick up and read a good book about the man Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution itself. Otherwise you'll be utterly confused. The movie starts with the rebel invasion of Cuba without giving us any idea about what Che had been doing up to that point of time. Like Why was he convinced to follow Castro? We also don't really see what the political situation was exactly like in Cuba at the time. How can we understand the rebels if we don't know what they are fighting against? The movie continues to be confusing by subsequently not making it clear just how the rebels were able to build in force after being almost completely wiped out... or just how exactly they were able to weaken the government forces... or how Che transformed from a weakling into a strong leader it seems to happen overnight!... or why exactly Che got tired of being in Cuba.The subsequent unfolding events do get somewhat clearer once Che gets to Bolivia and starts his doomed campaign there but you still don't understand the man. And with Richard Fleischer at the helm  a director who was usually only as good as his script  the movie sinks deeper into badness. The fact that Fleischer shows a complete inablility to film action scenes is just the least of his problems.And talk about miscasting! Omar Sharif as Che?!? He looks understandably confused and cowed in the role  deadly for someone who was reportedly a charismatic and cunning leader. But his performance is brilliant next to that of Jack Palance. Palance is unbelievably goofy as Castro who was a strong leader in his own right. Reports at the time of filming state that Palance asked that Castro's buffoonery in the script be changed. Apparently that didn't happen. I can imagine that Palance subsequently decided to take revenge by hamming things up especially since he also stated to the press after filming that he regretted ever being involved in this production.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was brave of the makers of this film to release it in 1969 when the U.S. war against Communist North Vietnam still raged. It does depict a failed attempt to foment revolution in the Third World and on balance it is a negative portrayal of a professional revolutionary. Given the times any depiction of Guevara and Fidel Castro showing them as human was a bold move. In the U.S. most publicity has been garnered by Castro's bitterest enemies those wonderful folks who brought you the Elian affair. Fidel has his supporters here and around the world also. Many of them seem to have posted comments at this site. The title of this movie is Che! not Fidel!. Naturally Castro's role will be a secondary one a decision Castro's supporters seem unable to forgive.Everyone knows how the story ends and that is where the movie starts with Che Guevara's body being transported by helicopter down from the oneroom schoolhouse where he was apparently executed after being wounded and captured by an elite unit of the Bolivian Army. It's a strikingly beautiful almost elegiac shot with the slopes of the Andes stretching to the horizon in the background. The movie proceeds in a semidocumentary style the story told in flashbacks by Guevara's old Comrades and some old enemies. Some of the Comrades visibly aged give their interviews from prison cells.While Guevara's early life in Argentina isn't depicted there is a soundless striking scene early in the film of Cuban women protesting the dictatorial Battista regime only to be massacred by Cuban soldiers We heard you calling Cuba and we came... that well explains what motivated young Ernesto and other youths from Latin America's upper classes to join the Cuban revolutionaries. From there we trace Che's transformation from idealistic medical graduate to hardened guerrilla fightersummed up in a moment when in the heat of battle he picks up a rifle and leaves his doctor's kit on the ground.I also disagree with the many criticisms of the portrayal of Fidel Castro by Jack Palance. Palance's movie career was distinctly on the down slope when he accepted the part but he always had macho. Here he captured the 6'4 Castro's dominating physical presence in a land of mostly short statured people. It is a real pity that this motion picture has completely disappeared. There is not a commercial version of it available anywhere. In the future perhaps after Omar Sharif has died this portrait of one of the twentieth century's most charismatic figures will be recognized as the rare achievement it is.".

It could have been so much better. The political oppression that led to the overthrow of the Batista regime is totally glossed over  the rebels life in the Sierra Madre is portrayed as almost luxurious with Batista's troops wandering around waiting to be shot. Constant monologues as a means to link scenes prove to be more irritating than useful and you find yourself wishing for the what little action there is to resume.The film truly dies when Guevara leaves Cuba for Bolivia with Shariff becoming more asthmatic and psychotic by the minute until his ultimate capture in the mountains and his eventual murder in the backroom of La Higuera's village schoolhouse.Any half decent film director would probably relish the chance to make a biopic of the legend that is Che Guevara. Che is an icon who deserves to have a film biography worthy of his legend in the same manner of the biopics of Chaplin Gandhi Biko Morrison etc.".

The movie gives you the impression that if it wasn't for Che Fidel Castro Jack Palance would never have taken over Cuba in what's called the Great Peasant Revolution of 1959. Che an Argentinian doctor and oneworld revolutionary did in fact land with Castro and his contingent of 82 men off the west coast of Cuba on December 2 1956.After being ambushed by Batista's the Cuban dictator men only a dozen including Che  Castro survived. During the next two years in the Sierra Maestras mountains the dozen revolutionaries grew into the thousands. It was undoubtedly because of the leadership and knowledge of guerrilla tactics and warfare by Che that forced the besieged and defeated Batista to abandon his palace in Havana on New Years Eve 1959 and check out of the country. This left a victorious Castro  Co. to enter the capital city without as much as a shot being fired on New Years Day.The movie shows how Che became a ruthless and bloodthirsty disciplinarian to the troops. Che as a commandante is shown without as much as flinching ordering the execution of traitors many times in the movie doing it himself that even his leader Fidel didn't have the heart to do. After the Castro takeover of Cuba Che held around the clock military trials and executions of former Batista political and military personal. This even shocked and outraged some of the most battlehardened Cuban revolutionaries. Che's excuse for his coldblooded policies was that if he didn't show the people that he was ridding the country of Bitista's war criminals they would do the job for him themselves. This would result in many innocent far more then those proved guilty by his military tribunals people ending up being slaughtered by rampaging mindless and vengeful mobs.The movie Che goes on to show that it was Che who gave Fidel Castro the idea of not only declaring himself a Marxist which outraged the United States Government and turned it against him but in establishing diplomatic and military relations with the Soviet Union. This lead to the 1961 fiasco for the US and Free Cubans known as the Bay of Pigs. Were also show that it was Che who planted the idea in Fidel's head to invite the Soviet Union to use Cuba as a base for it's nuclear missiles. This irresponsible action on Castro and the USSR's part almost brought the world to the brink of nuclear war in the autumn of 1962.Feeling betrayed by his friend Fidel and his Soviet allies for backing down to the US during the Cuban Missile Crisis Che calling Castro a Soviet dupe decided to leave the safety of Cuba and go out in the dangerous hills and valleys of Bolivia to start a revolution of his own. Since in reality Che left for Bolivia in late 1966 or early 1967 the event in the movie of Che's break with Castroin 1962 seems a bit premature.In Bolivia Che lost his revolutionary persona as well as his ability to rally peasants like he did in Cuba ten years earlier to his aid. Going against his own writings and principles about how a guerrillarevolutionary war should be fought had Che's men mostly Bolivian rebels desert him because of his mindless and brutal tactics to whip up both support and recruits among the peasant population.The hard life as a guerrilla fighter coupled with his deteriorating asthmatic condition smoking Cuban cigars didn't help Che's asthma either took a heavy toll on Che's health. Fate eventually caught up with Che as well as the Bolivian army and on October 9 1967 in an ambush at the Quebrada del Yuro ravine the lifelong revolutionary was shot and captured. Later on orders from the Bolivian high command Che was executed as if he were just a common criminal not the man who's name became synonymous with world as well as local revolution over the last thirty five years.More of a curiosity piece then anything else Che has it's share of unintentional laughs. Omar Sharif in many of the battle and strenuous jungle mountain climbing scenes in the movie is heard breathing and wheezing because of his asthma condition like someone making an obscene phonecall. The final scene when Che's confronted by an elderly Bolivian peasant berating him about how his guerrilla actions in and around his village have caused his goats to cease from giving milk. The scene looks like something straight out of a Mystery Science 3000 parody of an unintentionally and hilariously funny movie. Jack Palance as Fidel Castro with his fake plastic nose and acting as if he'd be lost without Che makes the guy Castro look like a totally helpless dolt as well as alcoholic buffoon. Castro who seems to drink as many bottles of booze as the cigars that he smokes that it's a wonder that he's still around now some forty after Che left him to run Cuba on his own! At the time of the movies release in the spring of 1969 there were plans by many CubanAmericans to demonstrate in front of the moviehouses that were to be playing Che. It wasn't until after word of mouth as well as critics reviews about how awful the film really was that it was decided that Che instead of ingratiating Castro's Cuba was in fact the United States revenge for it's defeat by Castro's army and militia at the Bay of Pigs!".

I remember when it was issued  there was very much hushhush about it and Richard Fleischer would not publicly reveal the sources of many arguable details of the script. The account is convincing enough and there has been no protests against any untruthfulness. Omar Sharif as Che makes a convincing character of great controversy and selfcontradictoriness while it is possible at the same time to understand him  why he abandoned the Castro regime as a hopeless case of either becoming a puppet of Russia or of America to try to make an interSouthAmerican revolution of his own. Of course it was utterly unrealistic which he failed to realize having no detachment but rather an obsession with any revolution at any cost.Jack Palance has been criticized for his almost caricature of Castro but he has made the best of it Castro was actually like that and Palance has studied him carefully.There is nothing wrong with the film as film either. The quality has its flaws but the direction and cinematic realization is practically flawless.The greatest credit of the film though is the unmasking of Che as the tragic megalomaniac he was a sick man gone wrong from the beginning and getting stuck in a vicious circle of violence going irrevocably from bad to worse his pride outgrowing him into arrogance and inhumanity leading only one way into selfdestruction a man obsessed with constantly worsening his own tragedy made clear enough by Omar Sharif.In brief an underrated film of great documentary objectivity charting the psychology of man at his most destructive.".

	schema:reviewBody "CHE! is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film. It takes a serious subject and presents it like the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics because there isn't much emotion or a proper narrativejust episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid true stories relayed by a variety of yutzes.This is a deservedly derided film as it is poorly written and acted. However what I have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working towards a Communist Cuba they seem to be more of a gay couplewith Che behaving coy and aloof and Fidel as the ardent suitor! Again and again the film abounds with great lines such as when Fidel implores Che Cuba needs you....I NEED YOU!!. I am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that the other reviewers didn't point this out. However if you remember this when you watch the film it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier.A final note. In recent years Che has been very chiceven a fashion statement with hoards of braindead teens who have no idea who he was wearing shirts emblazoned with his face. Considering he was a coldblooded killer and nihilist an odd combination for a doctor this new reverence for the man is gross. What will they do next put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on Tshirts and posters?!!? Even Communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for and I find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance! Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was it does nothing to further the message that Guevara was no hero. I would love to see a realistic film done of his lifewith the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren't apparently created by chimps!".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone mentioned this flick the other day and boy did it bring back memories! Che! clearly deserves a place all its own in any discussion of entertainingly bad movies. It's totally unconscious though because this is a genuine and heartfelt liberal tribute to good old Ernesto with lots of Hollywood contrivance mixed in. I'm biased because I never bought a Che Tshirt or admired Fidel Castro. I'm pretty sure that without the USSR's timely checkmating of the USA these two clowns would've been consigned to history's garbage heap in a couple years at the most. Years ago I read an excellent book about the guy Max Gomez who tracked Che down so that the Bolivian Army could shoot him. He was a Cuban expatriate who ended up in the US Army and the CIA. He had quite a different take on Che and Fidel than all those drugaddled AmericanEuropean teens and intellectuals did. Apparently Communist revolutionaries have an extremely ruthless viewpoint and a very unsentimental way of doing business. Che looked great on a poster but his spoiled admirers would not have enjoyed him in person. Or he them. When production of Che! was announced rightwingers and Cheworshipers were both infuriated albeit for opposite reasons. The hard right was upset that Communists would be glamorized and Che fans were positively livid that the legend of their sainted icon would be desecrated. But the story goes that when the flick came out it was so bad and so boring that both sides immediately lost interest in their indignation.Anyway back to the movie. Jack Palance is the greatest but his portrayal of Fidel must be seen to be believed. Mr. Palance never had a reputation for being funloving but I swear he's always on the verge of cracking up and is struggling to keep it together the entire time. He probably didn't have a choice because the script is so absurd that it was impossible to take seriously. Omar Sharif just wheezes and gasps during all his screen time in order to emphasize Che's reallife asthma. Seriously that's it. He just pants like an obscene phone caller the whole movie and displays zero charisma which I assume the real Che must've had at least some of. I guess the filmmakers thought that scenes of Che struggling to overcome his asthma and still being so dynamic added tremendous drama to Omar's role. Che! also features the inimitable Woody Strode and the immortal Sid Haig as henchmen and they both do their usual fine work. The funny thing is nobody even attempts a Hispanic accent or else they give it a halfad try and waver back and forth. There are some odd interviews interspersed throughout which are meant to imply a documentary feel but they're as disconcertingly comical as the rest of the flick. One character gives a long speech and then actually looks directly into the lens and implores Please don't tell anyone I said any of this! Good stuff.It's available on Amazon instant video but DVD's are almost certainly nonexistent. It's still pretty hilarious same as I remembered. But I bet it's even better in a group setting with inebriated viewers. I gave it 1 star purely on face value but as unintentional comedy it deserves 10 stars.".

While watching this movie you'll have no idea what Che and his buddies are all fighting for and what they want to achieve if you know nothing to little about Che Guevara and the Cuban revolution. Perhaps this can be blamed on the fact that this is an 1969 movie. Only 2 years after Che's death so his story was still fresh back in the minds of the audiences at time. Therefore the movie perhaps felt no need to ever explain anything or to go into detail. But this movie was already much hated back in its day so of course there is plenty more wrong with this movie.Not only the story won't learn you anything but you also won't learn a thing about the person Che. Nothing in this movie justifies why he is globally regarded still such an icon since the movie doesn't show anything great or heroic that he ever achieved and his personality in his movie is just very bland as well.I can't really blame Omar Sharif for it though while many other still seem to do so. In my opinion the blame should be put with its writing and directing. The story is already bad to begin with by the entire way it gets told makes it all the more worse.What I also really didn't like about the storytelling was the random insertion of random people narration the events straight into the cam as if this was a documentary. It comes across as incredibly cheap and lame also since often the actors just aren't the greatest ones.Even Jack Palance is real bad in his role. He is supposed to play Fidel Castro but instead he seems more like a caricature of him. And to be frank he made Castro come across like an idiot. Perhaps this all was intentional though for propaganda reasons.The way this movie got shot and all of its action really reminded me of a The ATeam episode. I of course love The ATeam but this doesn't really seem like a compliment for a movie that tries to tell a serious historically relevant story.Perhaps the movie is not as bad to watch as its reputation might suggest but still it's truly really far from a good movie.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Most of the stories you hear about this freedom fighter are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murdering scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1 Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men Women AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2 Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar. Now it's basically worthless.3 Continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy economy and the military. He never made it past his first year in Medical School and he was only in one real battle in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun.4 He took over the largest estate in Cuba to set up for himself. He had a Yacht a 60 custom made TV from America a swimming pool and a view of the Ocean. So much for shunning the materialist life style.Cuba today is an absolutely destitute country and you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank for it. If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas. If you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see you would find slums beggars and prostitutes.If you think any of what I'm saying is untrue then go do some studying. Compare Cuban exports from 195060 to those of today talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called Cuban revolution of the 1960's read all of the reports of murdered innocents read the reports from people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of what an evil disgusting human being he was.And please please always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything at face value and THINK ABOUT IT.".

He never made it past his first year in Medical School and he was only in one real battle in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun.4 He took over the largest estate in Cuba to set up for himself. He had a Yacht a 60 custom made TV from America a swimming pool and a view of the Ocean. So much for shunning the materialist life style.Cuba today is an absolutely destitute country and you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank for it. If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas. If you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see you would find slums beggars and prostitutes.If you think any of what I'm saying is untrue then go do some studying. Compare Cuban exports from 195060 to those of today talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called Cuban revolution of the 1960's read all of the reports of murdered innocents read the reports from people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of what an evil disgusting human being he was.And please please always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything at face value and THINK ABOUT IT.";

It gets a few plus points for its beautiful scenic landscapes stirringly rich music and Sid Haig giving a performance of fiery dignity. Unfortunately everything else is a failure.Well actually the photography was not so bad it actually looked decent and professional but it could have been more expansive to give the scenery more character and it doesn't really shake off the 60s TV series look. In the acting stakes only Haig impressed the rest of the supporting cast have hardly anything to work with and some like Robert Loggia spend their screen time looking annoyed. Omar Sharif's lead performance often is very stiff and a lot of the time he is either emotionless or perplexed. To give credit where he's due he actually looks the part. Which is more than can be said for Jack Palance who basically looks like Jack Palance with a fake nose and beard and glasses. His performance is a possible careerworsteven worse than that in Outlaw of Gor being little more than a buffoonish caricature chewing the scenery to shreds and I am sure that Fidel Castro in real life didn't behave like this much of an idiot.The way the characters are written is never compelling and they never come over as real people either coming over instead as caricatures with the cast attempting and failing to give them life or realism. Che! also has one of the worstwritten scripts I've heard in a while for a film with the dialogue flow and delivery being so stilted that you can't be blamed if you thought dubbing was involved the actual dialogue being very flowery and with no substance or subtlety at all. The dialogue and blatant and sometimes disturbing gay subtextor what can be seen as such in the scenes between Guevara and Castro is just embarrassing on the ear. The story is never involving it feels very episodic and onesided with a lot of padding so much so that although the film is 96 minutes long it feels longer. The 4th wall talking into the camera interviews were randomly put in and completely misplaced they seemed to only be there for filler and just confused the storytelling rather than added. The Bolivia segment has a little tension and truth in an overall story that has very little of either but only in spades and it's too late. At the end of the day it felt like there was no point in the film being made it tries to cover a lot but says very little and we learn next to nothing about what made Che Guevara famous and also learn just as little about him as a person as well. Not helped by that the film while mostly onesided didn't seem to make its mind as to whether we should feel sympathy for Guevara or not.All in all not that dire but a miscalculated failure all the same that sees two wholly dependable actors giving very bad performances. 310 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. In direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isn't just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that Part Two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of Che's life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner.While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. This somewhat distant cold approach to telling Che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything the entirety of Che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast Che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably conducted the whole thing.Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points. Here the basic structure of Part One is echoed backthere's the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement.

This difference in combination with the similarities to Part One make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.Indeed everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. In fact upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One and title the review as a whole yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.With that said I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. With a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che Part Two as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the Congo no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity. Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships. He is reasonably unreasonable. Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind. But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men. It is the concept.In Part 1 in Cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. Here in Bolivia not much understanding is apparent. Villagers expose him. They protect government troops not his own. When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested. You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply. Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians but doesn't fault the United States for Che's collapse. Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it.In showcasing both wars Soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results. Che's men attack and are attacked. They exchange fire with faraway assailants. There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for. This is not a war movie. It is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure. There is no elaborate cinematography. Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication. There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as Che's POV shot during his final beats. There is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the allconsuming effect is of languor Guevara himself having malaria part of the time.Benicio Del Toro one of the film's producers gives a champion's performance not least because it's modest. He isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes. In Cuba he arises in conquest in Bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair. Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude. You may think the film is too long. I think there's a genuine cause for its breadth. Guevara's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane. In the end Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means.".

But I felt into a trap perpetrated by...who? I don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and no matter how smart I think I am I fell into it. But thankfully I bumped into an Argeninean film director Martin Donovan a man I love and admire. When I told him I wasn't going to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I went to see both parts straight away and Che part 1 and 2 is the best film I've seen in 2008. It is of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. The regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore. I don't know if we ever were. Riveting moving without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul we can actually perceive it. The humanity of the man is overwhelming. So thank you Martin Donovan once again for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film. Don't commit the mistake I was about to commit. Go see it now on the big screen".

But the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of Guevara's excomrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the Bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement. It might not be topflight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history.There is also another very important point in the Che 'hero' figure here. It's about failure. That if you try your utmost even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage. One could cynically call it a 'martyr' complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well. But Che does not 'sacrifice' himself. He does what he does best to the best of his not inconsiderate ability and so provides an example. Success or failure in any particular instance become mere details.With the U.S.'s longstanding and illegal blockade of Cuba all in the name of 'freedom' I am tempted to write that Che Parts 1  2 are too good to be wasted on the U.S. But that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid. One must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view Che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders. Whatever its faults it rehabilitates Soderbergh from the populist nonsense of Oceans 11.But if you haven't heard of Che Guevara or seen Part One or if you can't get past the phrase 'murderous Marxist' without frothing at the mouth I might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Ironically the most talkedabout American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98 in Spanish. The extralong film's controversy began at the Cannes Festival. There were lovehate notices and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. As consolation the star Benicio Del Toro got the Best Actor award there. I'm talking about Steven Soderbergh's 'Che' of course. That's the name it's going by in this version shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2hourplus segments without opening title or end credits. 'Che' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto Che Guevara is in almost every scene. Del Toro is impressive hanging in reliably through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia. It's a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting.If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an intermission between the two sections there are rewards. There's an authentic feel throughoutfortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the English segments especially are wooden. You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare Che style was like the teaching the recruitment of campesinos the morality the discipline the hardship and the fightingas well as Che's gradual morphing from company doctor to fullfledged military leader. Use of a new 9pound 35 mmquality RED digital high performance cine camera that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth.The film is in two partsSoderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them commercially as such. First is 'The Argentine' depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's and the second is 'Guerrilla' and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967. The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and I think shot first. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. Yes but both parts have a lot in commontoo muchsince both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos who suspected foreigners and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists. There is a third part a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is intercut in the first segment. The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality Europeanstyle miniseries which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement. There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. This is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his lifelong interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on. And what about his harsh cruel side? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn't Che but revolution and guerrilla warfare. The lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick's 'The Tin Red Line' and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but 'The Thin Red Line' has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che and it's a really good film. This is an impressive but unfinished and illfated effort.This 8yearsgestating heavily researched labor of love how many more Ocean's must come to pay for it? is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. Radical editingor major expansionwould have made it into something more successful and as it is it's a long slog especially in the second half.It's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have takenbut with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ironically the most talkedabout American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98 in Spanish. The extralong film's controversy began at the Cannes Festival. There were lovehate notices and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. As consolation the star Benicio Del Toro got the Best Actor award there. I'm talking about Steven Soderbergh's 'Che' of course. That's the name it's going by in this version shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2hourplus segments without opening title or end credits. 'Che' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto Che Guevara is in almost every scene. Del Toro is impressive hanging in reliably through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia. It's a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting.If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an intermission between the two sections there are rewards.

Part One played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing Che Guevara's personality through different types of film stock different locations and cutting back and forth between an interview and the Cuban revolution. For the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. In Part Two Che enters Bolivia and along with changing geographical location the rules and the structure changes. Gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks the documentary realism and the treatises. Instead now we are literally trapped with Che in a desaturated depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option. I posit that it's the dark turn of Che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer Part One to Part Two.The change in geographic location also signifies for me at least that Che Part One and Che Part Two are in fact the second two acts of a three act structure begun by Motorcycle Diaries. Motorcycle Diaries is Che's comingofage or more appropriately comingofideals in Argentina Che Part One is his military leadership in Cuba and Che Part Two is his downfall in Bolivia. These movies do not completely illustrate his life we're missing his experiences in Guatamala and more importantly in my opinion his postCuban revolution executions but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol. He both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression and revolutionary failings in the postWorld War II third world countries and their hindering by such activities as um the CIAs meddling.But yet again all of that is projected onscreen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches but through a much more intimate suffering portrayal of Che at the end of his thread and his life. Again the rules have changed and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. The number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape an existential hell where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death. It's just not that easy of a movie to watch but it's very effective.PolarisDiB".

They may each be overlong and not chart as much territory as they perhaps should. Some may wish they would delve further into the obscure intimacies of his life especially for the benefit of those already familiar with his activism.

	schema:reviewBody "Everything that worked in the first film was thrown out for this one. As a result the movie is actually pretty boring. We are given a detailed look into the frontlines as the insurgents wade through Bolivia trying to take out the government. Battle after battle everything stays very much the same as they go city to city doing their best to find victory hidden beneath the death. A crucial piece to the puzzle comes from Lou Diamond Phillips' small cameo as Mario Monje the leader of the revolutionary group who was more for political talks and compromise rather than violence and fear. Guevara played brilliantly once again by Benicio Del Toro has already started the fight and due to his win or die mentality will not back down. He is a stubborn man believing unquestionably in himself knowing that what he is doing is the only way. Che is most definitely setup to be the hero and martyr many feel he is throughout this film. Glorified as a leader of men and a man of superior knowledge on mankind Guerrilla is not much more than a vanity piece showing what happened to him in his final year never backing down and never giving up.Again though is this man worthy of such praise? People around the world hail him to be a murderer and evil but you would never think it to see Soderbergh's epic tale. The man is afflicted with constant asthma attacks having left his medication behind stays at the front of the charge helps those in need with his medical expertise and leads a ragtag bunch of revolutionaries towards victory. Che is a God amongst men here even when captured he holds such a charismatic mystique brainwashing the guards with his celebrity to the point they want to talk to him even if they are employed to keep him captive. No one is beyond his hold something so innocently powerful he can turn even the youngest boy into a fearless warrior one that will follow him to his own destruction.While it all is a straightforward war epic fight after fight slowly advancing and retreating depending on the outcome we are thrust into the jungle for almost the entire film. There is no breathing room jumping back to civilization as in The Argentine instead we stay entrenched in the battle. Because of this exotic locale we get some stunning shots. A scene containing a group of soldiers attempting to find their way back to Che crossing a river is breathtaking. Due to events we see the audience knows an ambush is likely and the suspense is high while they cross guns over heads music at a minimum. The overhead view is stunning and just one example of visual flair thrown in the mix. Another is with Che peering through trees at an advancing Bolivian army. Framed in blurry leaves the army is shown with crisp silhouettes in the distance walking through and setting up position the composition and movement is very well done.Along with the artistry also comes moments of contrivance. I don't know if Soderbergh didn't want too many characters running aroundthere are a lotbut one family on a farm father mother and six children come into play often. It's as though they are the only family in all of Bolivia. Che treats them well offering extra money to buy livestock the Bolivian army take over the land for shelter the separated group containing a Spanish speaking Franka Potente how many languages does she speak? look for advice on where to cross the river and the Bolivians force them to give any information they can on the insurgents' whereabouts. This family is as much a crucial part to the war as Che's inclusion if the script is to be believed.The final twenty or so minutes dealing with Guevara captured redeem a bit of the monotony that came before it. It is his final stand against the Bolivians saving face and never showing fear being the model example of a martyr knowing his death might be just the thing to band the Bolivian people together. Del Toro knocks the part out of the park transforming from the balding gray disguise needed to clear customs to eventually become the Che we know from the tshirts and posters long hair sticking out from underneath his hat. A gorgeous point of view shot at the end just adds one more instance of artistic touch trying to make up for the more or less static camerawork shown the rest of the time.If there was more explanation I might have become invested in the proceedings. Instead we are quite literally dropped into Bolivia and made to follow these soldiers as they do what they do without rhyme or reason. Such a different style than The Argentine makes you feel like you could watch them separately but with almost no character development you'd be absolutely lost with Guerrilla coming in cold. Soderbergh definitely has created something intriguing and original unfortunately it just doesn't quite work. Pretty to watch but slowly paced this installment could have been a ten minute epilogue to the first part describing what happened to Guevara postCuba. Instead we are subjected to an entire war with no purpose other than to show his capture. The war was a Vietnam scale debacle and an interesting fall of Icarus from the first's victorious fight. I just feel Soderbergh thought it was more than what it actually is. A bit bloated and unnecessary I'd be interested to see what might happen if both films were cut together an hour excised. Then maybe we'd have a tightly constructed full biography otherwise the whole experience is just too much to stay engrossed with.".

	schema:reviewBody "Part Two picks up... not where the last film left off. As part of the quasiconventionality of Steven Soderbergh's epic 4 hour event Che's two stories are told as classic Rise and Fall scenarios. In Part Two Che Guevara leaving his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo only in passing mentioned in the film goes down to Bolivia to try and start up another throughthejungle style revolution. Things don't go quite as well planned at all probably because of Che's then notorious stature as a Communist and revolutionary and in part because of America's involvement on the side of the Bolivian Government and of course that Castro wasn't really around as a backup for Che.As it goes the second part of Che is sadder but in some ways wiser than the first part. Which makes sense as Guevara has to endure low morale from his men betrayals from those around him constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants and by ultimately the enclosing larger military force. But what's sadder still is that Guevara no matter what won't give in. One may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw maybe both but it's also clear how one starts to see Che if not totally more fully rounded then as something of a more sympathetic character. True he did kill and executed and felt justified all the way. And yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity the sequence where Guevara's health worsens without medicine leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year.Again Soderbergh's command of narrative is strong if on occasion slightly sluggish understandable due to the big running time and one or two scenes just feel totally odd Matt Damon? but these are minor liabilities. Going this time for the straight color camera approach this is almost like a pure militiastyle war picture told with a great deal of care for the men in the group as well as Guevara as the Lordover this group and how things dwindle down the final scene. And as always DelToro is at the top of his game in every scene every beat knowing this guy so well for better and for worse that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible. Overall the two parts of Che make up an impressive package history as drama in compelling style good for an audience even if they don't know Che or better if they don't think highly of him. It's that special. 8.510".

Going this time for the straight color camera approach this is almost like a pure militiastyle war picture told with a great deal of care for the men in the group as well as Guevara as the Lordover this group and how things dwindle down the final scene. And as always DelToro is at the top of his game in every scene every beat knowing this guy so well for better and for worse that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible. Overall the two parts of Che make up an impressive package history as drama in compelling style good for an audience even if they don't know Che or better if they don't think highly of him. It's that special. 8.510";

	schema:reviewBody "I sat through both parts of Che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and I can't recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly. I'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because I have a real 'thing' about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and I feel that on the whole 2 to 2.5 hours is about right for a movie. So 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and I was very dubious about the whole enterprise. But I will say upfront that this is a beautifully  I might say lovingly  made movie and I'm really glad I saw it. Director Steven Soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision. The battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself.If there is a person on the planet who doesn't know Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was the Argentinian doctor who helped Fidel Castro overthrow Fulgencio Batista via the 1959 Cuban revolution. When I was a kid in the 1960s Che's image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on T shirts on magazine covers. Che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever. If the famous images are to be relied on then Che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism. Had he been butt ugly I have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination? Of course dying young helps.Movies have been made about Che before notably the excellent Motorcycle Diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal as young Che touring South America and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his Marxist politics but I don't think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this twoparter is an ambitious project. I hope it pays off for Soderbergh but I can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind.The first movie The Agentine shows Che meeting Castro in Mexico and follows their journey to Cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to New York in 1964 to address the UN. Cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't. The second film Guerilla picks up again in 1966 when Che arrives in Bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement. The second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest. As far as I can see it was shot mostly in Spain but I can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as Che a part he seems born to play.Personally I felt that The Argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more 'entertaining' in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat. They are winning the Revolution will succeed. Che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause. The second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat. In much the same way that the recent Valkyrie  while being a good movie  was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so I felt the same about part two of Che Guerilla. We know at the outset that he dies we know he fails. It is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in Bolivia is doomed Che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the Cubans. He doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because I felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises. The movie does not romanticise him too much. He kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children.But overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making. One note as I watched the US trained Bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off Che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to Butch Cassidy. I almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place. As we left the theatre he turned to me and said Didn't you think the end was like Butch Cassidy!".

	schema:headline " Part two is a great standalone film beautifully filmed inspiring and tragic";
	schema:reviewBody "I came to watch Guerrilla part two of Steven Soderbergh's biopic of Che Guevara without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of Che's life. At the same time I was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavygoing history lesson and an unrepentant loveletter to the iconic revolutionary. As it turns out this film far exceeded my expectations.Guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film. The story of Che's failed attempt to lead a revolution in Bolivia then under military rule is a compelling tragedy. The initial impetus brought by Che's arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune. The odds stack up against the revolutionaries. US backing for the Bolivian army hostile conditions in the rainforest suspicious locals and Che's failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellion.Soderbergh's portrayal of Che is largely uncritical but this film is no hagiography. The style is refreshingly undramatic with a subtle and effective soundtrack by Alberto Iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes. Che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few closeups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too. Where Soderbergh wishes to demonstrate Che's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question Che's leadership and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind Cuba to fight again for revolution.The direction throughout is superb. Part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience. At the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in postrevolutionary Cuba immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why Che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country. Later on the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionaries.If there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and Che which though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person. True Benicio Del Toro is utterly convincing in the lead role  so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself. However watching Guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping Che's thoughts words and actions. It is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of Soderbergh's biopic I cannot comment on that yet and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "It helps to know that this was originally brought to life as a Terrence Malick screenplay about Che's disastrous forray in Bolivia. Financing fell through and Soderbergh stepped in to direct. He conceived a first part and shot both back to back as one film trailing Che's rise and fall.He retained however what I believe would be Malick's approach no politics and a just visual poem about the man behind the image exhaustive as the horrible slog through Cuban jungles and windswept Andean plateaus must have been. Malick applied this to his New World that he abandoned Che for lyrical many times over.But Soderbergh being an ambitious filmmaker he puzzled over this a little more. Here was a man of action at the center of many narratives about him some fashioned by himself conflictingly reported as iconic revolutionary or terrorist charismatic leader or ruthless thug erudite Marxist thinker or brutal soldier.So how to visually exemplify this contradicting ethos as our film about him? And how to arrange a world around this person in such a way as to absorb him whole unfettered from narrative  but writing it as he goes along  off camera  but ironically on  and as part of that world where narratives are devised to explain him. As flesh and bones opposed to a cutout from a history book.One way to do this would be via Brecht and artifice. The Korda photograph would reveal lots how we know people from images how we build narratives from them. Eisenstein sought the same in a deeper way coming up with what he termed the 'dialectical montage' a world assembled by the eye and in such ways as the eye aspires to create it.So what Soderbergh does is everything by halves a dialectic between two films trailing opposite sides of struggle glory and failure optimism and despair. Two visual palettes two points of view in the first film one in the presence of cameras hoping to capture the real person the other were that image was being forged in action.The problem is of course that Brecht and Eisenstein made art in the hope to change the world to awaken consciousness Marxist art with its trappings. By now we have grown disillusioned with the idea and Soderbergh makes no case and addresses no present struggles.But we still have the cinematic essay about all this.The first part a narrative broadcast from real life meant to reveal purpose ends revolution. The second part we get to note in passing a life that is infinitely more expansive than any story would explain more complex beautiful frustrating and devoid of any apparent purpose other than what we choose as our struggle truly a guerilla life.I imagine a tremendous film from these notions. Just notice the remarkable way Part 2 opens. Che arrives at Bolivia in disguise having shed self and popular image. No longer minister spokesman diplomat guerilla he is an ordinary man lying on a hotel bed one among many tourists. Life could be anything once more holds endless possibility. Cessation.What does he do? He begins to fashion the same narrative as before revolution again. Chimera this time. Transient life foils him in Bolivia. Instead of changing the world once more he leaves behind a story of dying for it. We have a story about it as our film adding to the rest.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. Of course the two parts are worlds apart so I am a little shaken by all that I just saw. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death for me it clouded the entire movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. Part Two was so downbeat compared to again an inevitability but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. For me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the Bolivian official where that official questions Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict Argentine versus Bolivian. I thought Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried. I guess it is all in the timing is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement in Bolivia there wasn't. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film If not now when 50 years from now. A very thought provoking and well done film make every effort to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who have seen The motorcycle diaries 2004 may expect a similarly dramatized continuation of the story of Che Guevara from the 4hoursplus Che packaged in two distinct parts like two separate movies from Steven Soderbergh that fetched Benicio Del Toro a Best Acting award in Cannes. They will soon realise that this is a horse of a different colour.Made meticulously from Guevara's diaries this film from a micro aspect as in economic theories tells about his adventure Cuba and misadventure Bolivia on a daytoday basis. Part 1 with scenes liberally labelled by dates traces his successful guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba helping Castro overthrow the Batista regime. Interwoven into the military progression are scenes in black and white of his speeches in the UN as well as interviews. Part two starts with a short interlude of his brief sojourning back home in Argentina with his family and the travel to Bolivia. What follow then is very much along the vent of what we see in Cuba with one huge difference  this campaign is a failure. Rather than marking off the progression of time by dates this part uses number of days in Bolivia the ominous tone of which we eventually understand as a reverse countdown to Guevara death captured and executed  procedure 600 as intimated by his Bolivian captors.Del Toro's awardwinning portrayal of Guevara probably differs from the perception an average audience might have formed from this biggerthanlife hero's Tshirt icon. I'm not sure if underplaying is the right word to describe it because for all I know Guevara may well be just as Del Toro portrays  uncharismatic. Indeed he makes excellent speeches in the UN but they are excellent in their cool reasoning controlled sarcasm and calm composure. You don't see flamboyant performances as you would from say Hitler apologies for that example. In the battlefield he is no less sensible and pragmatic. Yes he is a born leader but again he inspire by being firm reasonable and persuasive unlike and I'll use a better example here Michael Sheen's rousing pitch in Underworld 3 2009 We can be slaves or we can be LYCANS!! At well over 4 hours Che is perhaps a tad long but nonetheless a mesmerising characterstudy of this iconic figure. Soderbergh's direction is always solid and interesting. You also have the refreshing Cuban tropical terrains which is surpassed only by the breathtaking Bolivian landscape that follows.".

	schema:reviewBody "48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting...People are such suckers for image and looks  as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind Communism. Che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda such as this movie about him.I don't know what's worse being captured by one of Che's murdersquads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question isn't why this petproject was made but what took them so long. By them I'm referring of course to Leftwing Hollywood and its secret love of Marxist tyrants Lenin Castro... take your pick. I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically onesided projects yet somehow Che Guevara who is arguably the most popular and wellknown Communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet.Guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an American truthbending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood bigbudget political fairytale bios such as Malcolm X or Gandhi i.e. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary. Nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family  which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment.The movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3hour mark so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of Che's life has been shown here  then think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of Guevara's alleged idealism. Psychopaths don't have ideals. I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this overpraised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4hour movie.Soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side  which is more than 90  of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist  a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold  but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs. Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term they're supposedly siding with.Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting. In reality wearing a Che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in selfeducation. Wouldn't YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising hisher face to the world? Wearing Che's bynow clich image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those Chewearers probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about Fidel Castro's dead ally.After everything that'd been done in the name of Marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest. It seems mankind will never learn. Stalin Mao Kim Il Pol Pot Castro Milosevic Ceausescu the Iron Curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically andor mentally through this system... so none of that matters huh? The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work  and vote.

So rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution. It didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba.

	schema:reviewBody "Che Part II follows Che Guevara as he sneaks himself into Bolivia and gets together a gorilla force to fight for all that is Marxist in South America.It suffers from the same drab boring writing scene selection and overall boringness of part I. Let's face it folks Benicio Del Toro only won an award from this 2 movie snoozefest because Europeans now worship at the alter of anything leftist. The biggest problem with this 2 part movie is that it leaves out the story between the Cuban Revolution and his reappearance in Bolivia. The time period that is well known to Cuban refugees and always left out by marxist supporters. That is the part of history where Che gets a reputation as being quite the Inhumane humanitarian. Its the time when he rules over a prison where people are stripped of all human rights and killed. The also neglected to write in the part of history where Fidel agrees to release political prisoners but because he and Che had already did what communist nations do they call it a purge but most people call it murder he just send all his criminals to Miami.They do again get one thing right in part 2 as they did in part 1. They portrayed Che as he was a poor military leader. I also think though that they may have really ignored a real reason for leaving Cuba. That is called EGO. Che had a big ego. This may explain why Che just disappears and later Castro reads his letter. After his speech at the U.N. Fidel Castro might have felt that Che may get more famous and popular than him that would explain why there wasn't a ton of Cuban help for his endeavor. Che was a devout marxist and believed in the cause. I can't argue that but he may have been looking to become a bigger figure than Castro and wanted to lead a Domino effect army of communist revolutions with himself as leader and dictator. It may just be possible.Again both movies together make for a most boring 4 hours of bad dialog in Spanish dull scenes little to no action and a real sense of Why did I waste my time watching this crap? and  Why would anyone waste this much film and never really entertain the viewer at all? Che part II is just the last 2 hours of 4 that you will never get back.".

William Wallace was everything Che wasn't a genuine patriot fighting against a foreign tyrant who oppressed and abused the people against their will. Che was a faux revolutionary who after helping turn one country Cuba into a totalitarian dictatorship then went abroad and tried to use force to impose his evil ideology on the people of other countries who to their credit wanted none of it.In sum Wallace was the Real Deal and is still an inspiration to true freedom lovers to this day. Che was just another Marxist turd a megalomaniac with a Messiah complex a guy whose image appears on the Tshirts of assorted selfproclaimed Hipsters and pseudointellectuals who think Cuba is great because they have government run health care but rather than move there and enjoy the fruits of the great People's Workers' Paradise sit here at home and write angry screeds about the very country America that quite unlike Castro's Cuba gives them the freedom of speech to do so.".

It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded remember that Che was a physician. It ends as Castro wins the revolution Che never gets to Havana. The second part Che in Bolivia is about guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.When I realized this was supposed to be an epic I never knew anything but the title before it started I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.Not to be a racist but aside from what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable  unknown Hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear Che beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che Benicio del Toro even Fidel has a very minor role. While del Toro's terrific think of Lawrence with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character no Alec Guinness no Omar Sharif no Anthony Quinn etc. You get the idea.Because the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed I don't think that's a spoiler there's no empathy from the audience  he's just killed.He's too onedimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about Che is that he's married with five children he tells another character that near the end. What was his motivation? A complete enigma.Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend Sharif and associates Guinness Quinn. He was as courageous as he was insecure  i.e. had human qualities. Che is like a machine about as warm as The Terminator.Earlier this year there was another war epic Mongol. Che makes Mongol look like It's a Wonderful Life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Part II or formerly known as GUERILLA is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as PART I because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of Che Guevara. Once again I'm impressed by the causeandeffect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories. We're reminded again and again that the lead character Che Guevara is an Argentine. Some of the men in Fidel's army chose not to take orders from a Foreigner and now that Che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in Bolivia he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because he's a foreigner.As far as technical goes I think Part II would've been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in Cuba but they don't work in Bolivia. It is clear now in this segment that Che is not as charismatic as Fidel Castro. In Bolivia he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it. It's said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love.. well they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell. It's excruciatingly painful and difficult for Che to get the others to buy into his vision.I like one particular scene that illustrates Che's deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly Che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets he's a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse. His army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led. But at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of Part II if so.. then it definitely works. Standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of Che's last breath. This movie may not answer the questions of why Che Guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants South America to have the same fate as Cuba but the movie CHE is a story worth telling.".

	schema:reviewBody "A King in New York is one of those few films that gets better and better every time you see it.Yes it's flawedthe sets look shabby and some of the dialogue is stilted and melodramatic.  Yet despite these shortcomings AKINY still stands out as a wonderful playful satire of 1950's America.For those of you who may not know Chaplin himself was targetted by the U.S. government at the time for his alleged communist leanings. In fact AKINY had to be shot in Britain Chaplin's birthplace only because Chaplin and his family had been forbidden to reenter the U.S after a short vacation overseas.AKINY was Chaplin's response to the nonsense and paranoia that pervaded American society at that time.  Chaplin also pokes fun at America's obsession with technology and the mediaa point which is even more relevant today.Chaplin plays King Shahdov a deposed monarch who flees to America in the hopes of selling his plans for a peaceful nuclearbased society which never happens. Chaplin plays Shahdov as an honest but hapless European monarch thrust into the dizzying whirl of modern America. Chaplin is at his absolute best here as a befuddled and somewhat puzzled outsider.Shahdov soon meets up with two people.  The first is Ann Kay Dawn Addams a beautiful young woman who seduces the King and lures him into appearing in her television commercials and Rupert Macabee played by Chaplin's son Michael a brilliant young boy whose parents have been imprisoned by HUAC. Also worth noting is Ambassador Jaume Oliver Johnston Shahdov's loyal friend and confidante. Johnston and Chaplin play off each other beautifully and together they share some of the film's funniest moments.AKINY is full of priceless bits of business as Chaplin used to saythere's a hilarious restaurant scene in which Chaplin mimes his order to the waiter in order to overcome the dreadful racket from the house band.Then there's the scene in which Shahdov's newly lifted face become unhinged as he bursts into laughter at a comedy show. Chaplin slyly slips in and out of these bits which are essentially silent comedy pantomimes dating back to his earliest days in English Music Halls with great ease.Such scenes provide the most satisfying moments in the film.  Here behind Chaplin's aged face and body you can still see the little tramp come to life and it's wonderful.AKINY is vastly underrated by most critics who for some reason obsess over the sets and virtually ignore what is truly one of Chaplin's masterpieces. AKINY is rarely screened in North America for some reason so if you get the chance to see it don't pass it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "A King In New York was a pure delight to watch. Seeing perhaps the greatest actor of the first half of the century is always a treat and he doesn't disappoint in this film. Chaplin made this satire as a shot at the United States who only five years earlier had denied him reentry into the country. This was based on the fact he wouldn't come before the McCarthy hearing and make a statement on his supposed ties to the Communist party. Regardless of the basis for this film's comedy pieces one can find a few moments where Chaplin is taking a direct shot at those who had doubted him.The plot involves Chaplin as King Shadov a ruler of a ficticious country whose people have ousted him based on his unwillingness to manufacture Atomic Bombs. He would rather spend the taxpayers money on finding ways to create atomic energy. Obviously this is a deliberate analogy of Chaplin being thought of as a communist although the complete opposite was the truth. So the exiled leader goes to America in search of a fun vacation in which he can experience the excitement that he had heard about so many times before. The viewer follows Shadof and his trust aide throughout New York City and their many hilarious experiences. The best of which that come to mind are the scenes in which Chaplin pantomimes his order to a waiter who cannot hear him the scene in which Chaplin recites the famous to be or not to be soliloque from Hamlet to guests at a dinner party and the scene in which Chaplin gets his finger stuck in a fire hose and cannot get it out.One can see some elements of the tramp in Chaplin in this film including the facial expressions his smile and the way he moves about gracefully. I had never seen Chaplin in a talking film before this one and was somewhat surprised to see how much of a great talking actor he truly is. For an actor who had done so much in silent films and only silent films this film shows that Chaplin is one of the top actors of this century.The only element of this film that somewhat disappointed me was the manner in which the hearings were brushed off. I believe that there was plenty of room for some gags to be thrown in here. Perhaps Chaplin felt as if he had already taken enough shots and didn't need to exploit this area.This film is yet another example of the Chaplin greatness and I would recommend it to anyone who loves films or are interested in seeing film making magic.810 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Chaplin had a lovehate relationship with the United States of America. On the one hand it was in Hollywood that the Britishborn comedian and filmmaker built a successful life and career immortalising himself as one of the most beloved directors and stars in the history of cinema. On the other hand Chaplin's political attitudes during the 1940s  that America should form an alliance with the Soviet Union in order to fight Adolf Hitler's fascist regime  led to his being labelled a Communist or Communist sympathiser. In 1952 Chaplin returned to his hometown of London for the premiere of the brilliant 'Limelight 1952' where he was greeted with great enthusiasm though with his arrival came the news that the American government had rescinded his reentry visa into the United States. Over the next few years the aging filmmaker toyed with numerous ideas for his next film  including a possible resurrection of the Little Tramp  before settling upon 'A King in New York' whose screenplay took about two years to complete.'A King in New York 1957' tells the story of King Shahdov Chaplin a dethroned monarch who seeks refuge in the United States his entire wealth cunningly stolen from him. The film starts off as an amiable slapstick comedy which is basically what I had been expecting before branching off into darker territory become a scathing satiric assault on almost everything that America stands for. When he first arrives in the country King Shahdov revels in the peace and liberty of this grand nation exclaiming to his dedicated ambassador Jaume Oliver Johnston if you knew what it means to breathe this free air. This wonderful wonderful America. Its youth its genius its vitality! However through his relationship with a brilliant young boy Rupert Macabee Chaplin's own son Michael whose parents happen to be members of the Communist party Shahdov becomes embroiled in the period's rampant McCarthyist witchhunts revealing the devastating truth that perhaps America's notions of freedom have become a mere illusion.Despite Chaplin's insistence that my picture isn't political it most undoubtedly is with the director  just as he did in the final scenes of 'Monsieur Verdoux 1947'  evidently expressing his distaste for what society has become. It's easy to dismiss 'A King in New York' as prosocialist propaganda but to do so would be completely missing the very idea behind the film. Personally I'm unsure of Chaplin's official stance on Communism itself but the filmmaker certainly reviled the manner in which the United States government approached the issue citing it as an immoral invasion of privacy and liberty. Chaplin described himself as having no political convictions I am an individualist and I believe in liberty. Perhaps referring to the Hollywood blacklist he once said These are days of turmoil and strife and bitterness. This is not the day of great artists this is the day of politics.'A King in New York' was filmed at Shepparton Studios in London and the film does a very successful job of imitating the hustleandbustle of the Big Apple. As well as expressing his stance on McCarthyism Chaplin also aims a few effective jabs at commercialisation and popular culture prophetically predicting the prominence of commercial chainstores cosmetic surgery and reality television when King Shahdov is unwittingly coaxed into attending a televised dinner party continually baffled as to why his lady interest Dawn Addams keeps unexpectedly launching into advertisements. Though my review has stressed the political implications of the film 'A King in New York' also works pretty well as a light comedy and I almost died laughing when Chaplin walked into the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities with a firehose attached to his finger. Michael Chaplin's impassioned tirades on the degradation of America were also a riot to watch even if the young actor can occasionally be spotted mouthing his father's lines. Owing to its somewhat disagreeable stance towards the United States Chaplin was unable to find any willing American distributors and so 'A King in New York' remained unseen there until the 1970s. Freedom of speech indeed.".

He doesn't leave a stone unturned movies music high culture television education fame and especially the communist witch hunts. Best of all he still exhibits his comic brilliance and almost all the jokes land. Chaplin's son Michael is very good as a young boy who espouses communist ideals without the slightest provocation. The film ends without resolution as this dark period of American history was still going strong. Only the hope that it is only a phase is expressed but otherwise the darkness is left to brood. People have accused the film of not being subtle but it is far more so than the infinitely more popular The Great Dictator and also more so than his other two talkies Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight. All of those films are great but they all end up with Chaplin telling us directly what he wants us to walk away with. A King of New York is even if it has its clunky moments an exceptional achievement. It's about time that it was rediscovered. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the last film starring Charlie Chaplin and he went on to do only a very brief cameo in the last film he directed THE COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. And while it lacks the quality of many of his famous fulllength films it is well worth your time.One of the reasons I say that the film lacks quality is the unevenness of the film. While the music Chaplin composed is very good and parts of the film are quite touching other parts look a bit choppy and some of the camera work is rough. But considering that mediocre Chaplin is still head and shoulders above most other work this can all be forgiven.Chaplin plays the deposed benevolent king of a fictional European country. When he arrives in America he is treated like a celebrity and he intends to make it his new home. However over time his opinion about living here sourspartly due to the intensity and shallowness of American culture but mostly due to the zealous antiCommunist movement of the day.The film consists of two parts. The initial portion is pretty lighthearted and involves Chaplin's becoming acquainted with American culture such as TV Rock and Roll and even plastic surgery. While I have heard some comment that this makes the movie seem too episodic and lacks focus I actually liked this part and found it charmingeven though not all the gentle ribbing worked in every case.The second part begins when Chaplin visits an odd progressive school in the city. Here children are encouraged to express themselves and avoid inhibitions. In reality it means that the kids are brats and have absolutely no discipline. This is a pretty funny segmentparticularly when Chaplin is introduced to the editor of the school paper actually played by Chaplin's 10 yearold son Michael. This kid Rupert is incredibly obnoxious and instead of discussing politics with the democraticnatured king he speachifies about the evils of all government and sounds a lot like Leon Trotsky! Although it is not apparent at first this little vignette actually changes the course of the film. A bit later Rupert is seen wandering about New York in the snow all alone. The king sees him and takes pity despite their political differences. He feeds and clothes the kid and Rupert repays him by telling people that he is the king's nephew. Well people think that because the kid sounds like a Communist that the king must also be oneleading to a lot of confusion and a few laughs.It turns out that the kid had run away from the school after his parent had been forced to testify before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. The parents admit that they had been Communists in the past but refused to implicate others so they are jailed for contempt. Next the committee subpoenas Chaplin to testify while federal agents begin badgering Rupert to get him to talk. This leads to a very tiring and badly written part of the film. On the way to testify Chaplin gets his finger stuck in a fire hose and he eventually has to charge into the committee room with it still stuck on his hand. Then the hose gets connected to another hose and turned onat which point Chaplin thoroughly douses the committee. This part of the film just isn't very funny and lasts way too long.Despite this hosing the scene abruptly ends and newspapers announce that Chaplin is cleared and he is once again beloved by the American people. Why and how this occurs is beyond me as the last scene ended with the committee charging him with contempt! It is like there is a missing scene explaining how this all occurred. Regardless Chaplin is tired of the hysteria about Communism and vows to return to Europe. On the way he stops to see Rupert and finds his spirit is broken...as Rupert was tricked into betraying his parents' former associates. The film then ends as it shows Chaplin and his trusted aid flying out of New York.While Chaplin denied that this film was an attempt to get back at America for its shabby treatment of him in the early 50s it is pretty obvious that this movie is a comedic and very poignant attempt to do precisely that. It reminds me a lot of the Woody Allen film THE FRONT though it preceded it by almost two decades. While it was true that there was significant infiltration of our government by Stalinist spies based on recent data released by the Kremlin along with legitimate concerns many innocent people were hurt just because of their political leanings. Chaplin's leftist beliefs and movies that depicted the little guy as being oppressed by an uncaring Capitalist society came back to haunt him during this era of fear. In the end he was forced to return to Europe to live out the remainder of his life. So in many many ways this movie was an autobiographical film wrapped in comedy.Now as for the good and the bad about this film. The film has many amusing little segments and is quite charming. Its autobiographical aspects make for an interesting insight into Chaplin's psyche and even without that it is a pretty good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin's A King in New York is a fine film to see when it's a laidback afternoon and it comes on TV as it's a bit of a surprise to come upon. It's a later Chaplin film where he's no longer the iconic Tramp yet in a way the logic of one of those films in terms of the society at large is still being toyed with. This time instead of being on poverty row with holes in his shoes and a sweet and enduring love for a street girl he plays a king whose country has gone to war and without many prospects financially comes to America to do commercials for products that he would surely rather not be pushing on the public. As life does imitate art as far as the stereotype goes it does have a ring of constant truth Chaplin at the time was an exile kicked out of America for being a supposed communist and with his nonprolific career going a little bit on the slide he made the film as a quasilight attack on American consumerism of the vanity and stupidity that can come out of prosperity.But at the same time there is still the sensibility that Chaplin loves life and individuals if not certain groups. This can be seen in the child character one of Chaplin's own sons who through his very intelligent but arrogant manner is one of the nicer and funniest characters in the film. While a lot of the humor sometimes rather dry is in seeing Chaplin's King and his assistantbutler talk of money problems and in the observations of the 'other' the best scenes come in showing what levels King Shadhov has to sink to in trying to pay his expensive hotel bills and stay afloat in a strange land. My favorite scenes where Shadhov's botched plastic surgery debacle where it's funnier seeing the King trying not to laugh at a slapstick spectacle than the actual spectacle itself and the scenes of the King trying to shill the items often to the dissatisfied directors I'm reminded of Lost in Translation and in fact Chaplin's scenes are probably more successful than Coppola's.Although the film is preachy at times it's best when Chaplin goes for the more succinct jabs as opposed to the grandstanding ironic since it worked perfectly at the end of the Great Dictator the overall highspirited and serenely theatrical direction makes this a worthwhile effort. Far from being the controversial film it got a reputation as following a nonrelease in the 50s in the US it's only a cunning satire with moments light and foreboding and it deserves to be seen just as much as Chaplin's classics if only by his fans who might be apprehensive at the filmmaker making too many 'statements'.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great film that was neglected by the good old US of A when it was released in the late 50's. It was brandished as being to critical of the political atmosphere of the United States at the time. It's funny that Chaplin could manage to offend both Adolf Hitler The Great Dictator and the fascistlikeinspired 'anticommunist' movement of the 50'searly 60's U.S.A. There is actually a common link in those two movements Naziism and the 5060's 'anticommunist movement in the USA but I won't get into that here. Anyway it is sad that this film is overlooked as it is one of Chaplin's best and should be looked as one in a career overview of this great filmmaker. Besides him in the film there really is not any aweinspiring actoractress but Chaplin brings out the best in everyone and elevates them from eternal anonymity to something of recognition. His son Michael Chaplin for example is used quite wonderfully in this film. I later bought Michael Chaplin's late teenage memoir 'I Couldn't Smoke the Grass on my Father's Lawn' based on seeing him in this film and him impressing me so. It's too bad he could not develop more as an actor or recording star he released a single in Britain in the mid60's. I heartily recommend this film. See it and be open minded. Take a look at the way your country was run 50 years ago and ask yourself have things really changed this day in age when the 'communists' have know been replaced by the 'terrorists'.".

If anything Chaplin's voice and accompanying ability to express himself with words enhanced his screen presence by providing a new dimension with which to appreciate his seemingly limitless talent.I'm not sure just how to explain this other than the fact that I watched most of the film with a big grin glued to my face.  I marvelled at the subtleties of Chaplin's performance which distinguish him not only as a silent movie actor but as an actor of ANY era!  In today's world of overthetop silliness and questionable acting passing as good comedy his performance is a clear indication that intelligent comedy is not an oxymoron and that the King of it is the same person as the king of slapstick.If you're the kind of person who appreciates the subtlety in Woody Allen's humor you will find yourself marvelling at A King in New York and you will see and hear! a part of Charlie Chaplin you may not ever have known existed.".

	schema:headline " The Complete Chaplin!";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course Charlie Chaplin is mostly remembered for nonspeaking roles. A King In New York is a satire by Chaplin about his impressions of America. It is refreshing to see a movie that is critical of America. Chaplin plays a king of a fictitious eastern European country who is forced due to a coup to flee to New York City. Chaplin show his versatility as a talking actor by really sincerely getting down the mannerisms of a European monarch. He is an older man but very charming. Soon however the king finds that his natural goodness and true compassion is exploited by commercialism and political opportunism. At first the king is entranced by America's freedom but soon discovers that American is a brash society of loud big bands and brash advertising and movies. When the king finds himself broke he is used by a beautiful young woman Addams to do advertisements. Addams excellently plays the superficial American. She is always smiling but ever criticizing about the monarchs age and lack of television persona. When he gets selfconscious she says 'No you're great. You just can't appear on TV with a sagging face'. She convinces him to get a face lift but it ends up that his face is so tight that if he laughs he will end up in the hospital. The evening after the face lift he unfortunately goes to a club and is subjected to slapstick humor that literally forces him to go back for emergency surgery.The movie's only flaw is that at times it gets a little dull. Other than that it is a brilliant look at America  where image and appearance are everything. The climax of the movie deals with McCarthyism. For dare helping out the child of disgraced communists the child played by Chaplin's real life son the king is forced before the Committee On UnAmerican Activities. The conclusion of the movie is very funny. In conclusion this movie displays the full range of Chaplin's great talents. His comic touch his dramaticism his political satire his slapstick gifts and his kind demeanor are fully displayed in this film. I highly recommend this film.".

Chaplin show his versatility as a talking actor by really sincerely getting down the mannerisms of a European monarch. He is an older man but very charming. Soon however the king finds that his natural goodness and true compassion is exploited by commercialism and political opportunism. At first the king is entranced by America's freedom but soon discovers that American is a brash society of loud big bands and brash advertising and movies. When the king finds himself broke he is used by a beautiful young woman Addams to do advertisements. Addams excellently plays the superficial American. She is always smiling but ever criticizing about the monarchs age and lack of television persona. When he gets selfconscious she says 'No you're great. You just can't appear on TV with a sagging face'. She convinces him to get a face lift but it ends up that his face is so tight that if he laughs he will end up in the hospital. The evening after the face lift he unfortunately goes to a club and is subjected to slapstick humor that literally forces him to go back for emergency surgery.The movie's only flaw is that at times it gets a little dull. Other than that it is a brilliant look at America  where image and appearance are everything. The climax of the movie deals with McCarthyism. For dare helping out the child of disgraced communists the child played by Chaplin's real life son the king is forced before the Committee On UnAmerican Activities. The conclusion of the movie is very funny. In conclusion this movie displays the full range of Chaplin's great talents. His comic touch his dramaticism his political satire his slapstick gifts and his kind demeanor are fully displayed in this film. I highly recommend this film.";

However Chaplin's tone in this film described by some as bitterness I would more accurately call incisiveness.Of course this movie had to be made in Britain and wasn't shown in the USA for about 20 years until after the youthquake of the late 1960's and the changing of the generational guard proving Americans are not fond of having their foibles and hypocrisies pointed out to them in a rather obvious manner.Some of the more satirical aspects of the film including the film trailers TV advertising the reality television show Chaplin about 40 years ahead of the curve on that one and the whirlwind feel of New York City represent rather gentle pokes at a society in which to remind everyone Chaplin had worked in and made his fame and fortune in for over 40 years.It's only when the Senator McCarthy inspired storyline takes hold around halfway through the film that the story turns markedly more serious. Chaplin sprinkles the film throughout with references to the US Constitution and freedom of speech and American blood boiling. Clearly he is on the side of freedom versus totalitarianism and against the witch hunt like tactics of HUAC that destroyed American careers drove people into poverty or exile and provably never found one person that was a real imminent danger to American society. Looking back from this point almost everyone agrees that HUAC and its blowback were a blot on the history of the United States and its aspirations of freedom and rightfully so.Although this aspect of the film is a bit heavyhanded and the rather sad ending is somewhat disappointing but rather realistic within the context of the times I feel that this only detracts mildly from the comedy on offer Chaplin's amazing screen presence and artistry as a writer actor and director. It is enough to make me wish he had done more than three talking films in his career. Yes that guy in his 60's up there on the screen with the gray hair certainly isn't the little tramp of 1920 but he is a character almost equally as compelling and much more formidable.Not mentioned by many is the fact that Chaplin even composed the score for this film which is in itself worthy of praise.

He had to leave America because he was accused of having communist tendencies. I see that he had problems with Americans but in the mid 70's he had been officially redeemed.

Why don't you judge it reasonably dear American IMDb users?For those people who do not know any background story about this filmThere was an important biographical turn in Chaplin's life in the mid 50's he actually shot A King In New York in Switzerland. He had to leave America because he was accused of having communist tendencies. I see that he had problems with Americans but in the mid 70's he had been officially redeemed. He was not a communist even that he supported Russia in the WWII was just because he had to position himself against Hitler.

This was quite a performance and although I do not know who that boy was I hope he has gone on to do well for himself.We also have the advertising woman which rounds out the characters  the political child the commercialism of the woman. What does it all mean? I am not quite sure. But the film is such a fine critique of McCarthyism and commercialism. Indeed does anyone think we are not inundated with pointless ads? The Communist aspects are a bit harder to judge. At the time he probably received great flack for this indeed the film was poorly received. But he was also not completely innocent  he certainly had leftist leanings despite his denial of such. Perhaps not strictly Communist but most likely he was sympathetic. And why not? The king was a Communist from 19401950 and then resigned. This seems fair  it was not until after World War II that America became antiSoviet. Looking back today 50 years later it all seems silly.".

Chaplin and his wife Oona may have made at the time what I see as a pandemic cult mistake that many made at the time of imagining that the Bolsheviks could have somehow meant well but the reaction from politicians at the time was much worse. For them an exorcist was and is needed but such politicians were and are into an evil hopelessly too deep. Some of them even say that they've heard of Moses Jesus Christ and Apostle Paul. Have they? Finally Chaplin's script and delivery were superb. If this was 1957 this was an encore from the Golden Age.Here is an addendum to this review. The purpose of congressional committee hearings is to gather facts opinions etc. for providing guidance for possible future legislation and so the naming of names has nothing to do with this. In other words the investigators for these committees always had all of these names in advance all the time and so the committees were merely playing a trick in order to humiliate the witnesses and to score points with the voters. This means that the judges should have always found that it was the committee chairmen who were in contempt of court.".

It is not just slow it is boring predictable and the story lines weak and poorly developed. The film is nothing but a succession of sex scenes divided by short periods of horrible dialogues and awful acting. Don't get me wrong I am fine with the sex as long as there is something else there to be told in the story but this is clearly not the case. So what do you get? Well a bunch of pretty faces and nice butts surrounded by horrible acting and worse direction. The soundtrack is equally bad apart from the noise from the club scenes the music is annoying to the extreme of not being able to understand what the characters are saying. Somebody should tell this director what a volume control is and that when a viewer realizes the existence of a soundtrack the music has been badly chosen.So summarizing if you are looking for a movie with a good script and well developed story lines go somewhere else.

I cracked up laughing a lot of times during this film but I really did not enjoy the ending at all. It didn't need to have a sad ending and the sad ending just made you realize how little a story line this movie had. It's strange because Spanish movies are the movies I enjoy the most out of world cinema and I guess I just had high hopes for this film to be just as spectacular and perfect as all the previous Spanish films I've seen. I recommend this movie but would also recommend to press stop 15 minutes before the end.".

Yes it's that type of movie sex drugs and club life Spanish style they're no prudes and I like it. But there's more to it than that. Within this promiscuous hedonist environment people are trying to find a match for their desires. The storyline where one guy Mario Casas is secretly in love with his best straight mate Yon Gonzales is particularly well done. The film is anything but shallow.

It would also be wrong to say this is a story about violence between Korean and Japanese gangs in the 60's because even though there are many violent scenes depicting this it's not really relevant. I think more than anything it's a story about the 60's in Japan about sexual liberation about freedom about music about doing what you want.Basically I recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Quality film making from Disney";
	schema:reviewBody "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that you're probably going to be disappointed.The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.No he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.The fact that he did make it against all the odds is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.Honestly as a movie buff it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar charactersby employing vulgarity overt sexuality or excessive violence.It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.That being said the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed  bigger budgeted movies it will be a movie like this one that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.And while we're at it hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive well acted portrayal.".

	onyx:emotionText "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that you're probably going to be disappointed.The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.No he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.The fact that he did make it against all the odds is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.Honestly as a movie buff it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar charactersby employing vulgarity overt sexuality or excessive violence.It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.That being said the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed  bigger budgeted movies it will be a movie like this one that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.And while we're at it hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive well acted portrayal.";

Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and parttime school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him but thru his will and determination to make it because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a bluecollar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more reallife NFL movies are made about players because Invincible sets the standard.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact from the production notes Wahlberg went through actual football trainingcoaching being there with the team for every play and practice gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerismcadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.Papale and Vermeil  they needed each other or fate brought them together. In a way both are in the same boat struggling to gain confidence by the rest of the team. Against all odds they did it and won over the rest of the South Philly Eagles team and the PA fans. Yes it is inspirational. Yes it's been told before. Why so different? This film being NFL sanctioned is the more earnest in getting it right in every respect for authenticity. The shots of the different plays and athletic moves get up close and real with a trained acting team and augmented sound design.Double duty as director of photography and director of his debut feature film Ericson Core faithfully puts us in the year 1976 recreated. The Jim Croce song that started the film I Got A Name is reminiscently catchy and hints at the personal struggles of Papale. With Sara Knowles Gattaca production design Susan Lyall Mississippi Masala costume design vital Football Coordinator Mark Ellis Miracle who studiedchoreographed the plays and moves for specific film shoot and having Vince Papale and Dick Vermeil as consultants at hand Brad Gann's script and a strong supportive team of producers all made INVINCIBLE unarguably a worthwhile film to see.I went into the cinema with no expectations  feeling fortunate to see Wahlberg and Kinnear both in one movie. I find the film heartwarming a tearjerker for me too. It encourages roots remember the buddy friends neighborhood community and parents who'd stand by us. The tenacity to not give up  keep trying focus on task at hand  doing your best is no failure no matter what others may think. The integrity of one's character and believing in oneself is not easy to sustain in hard times. Support system close to you is important Papale has Janet's encouragement and Vermail has his wife's timely reminders. We need such spirits genuinely emanated in films like Invincible. Greg Kinnear came a long way from the remake of Sabrina opposite Harrison Ford. His diverse roles in As Good As It Gets opposite Jack Nicholson Auto Focus opposite Willem Dafoe The Matador opposite Pierce Brosnan and Little Miss Sunshine along with an ensemble of talents demonstrated how vastly skillful he's become. Mark Wahlberg can be underrated  it's almost all him in Boogie Nights funny fantastic in The Big Hit quietly solid in The Yard opposite James Caan 'funkily' good in Rock Star smooth action in The Italian Job remake gritty action in Four Brothers  he holds his own in a wide variety of complex and challenging roles be it Three Kings or I Heart Huckabees.".

The movie is based on a true local guy makes good story and quite entertaining although after searching online for Papale it appears that they may have taken a bit of dramatic license with some of the details. The story telling and acting were good. I think Kinnear's presentation of Dick Vermeil I remember seeing Vermeil on the local T.V. a lot back then was outstanding. Mark Wahlberg gave a credible performance as a determined underdog here he seems to be maturing as an actor and from what I could tell was in good physical condition to play this role. Kirk Acevado and Mark Raspoli put in good supporting performances as sometime supportive friends and relatives. The movie is an O.K. family movie if you don't mind a bit of swearing and sportsfootball violence tackles blocks and those sorts of things.I grew up in eastern Pennsylvania and can remember the atmosphere in my home town and to a lesser extent Philadelphia at that time. The decline of manufacturing labor disputes and unemploymenthardship on workers and their families was well presented. My recollections of the Eagles were that the team was pretty weak and the fans being very vocal in their disappointment this is a Philadelphia tradition for all their sports it isn't just reserved for football. Among my favorite scenes is some neighborhood football that brought back some memories although our games were a bit less brutal. There are a number of funny scenes in the movie and quick oneliners which I won't spoil here.".

	schema:headline " From A Philly Boy  A Feel Good Story That Does A Good Job Recreating 70's Philly Life";
	schema:reviewBody "First off  I'm biased. Let me get that out of the way first. I grew up in Center City Philly during the 70's and am a lifelong Eagles fan. So I was pretty excited to see the movie to get juiced for the upcoming 2006 Eagles season while also hoping to relive Philly life from 1976.The movie starts by giving us some background on the plight of the 1975 Eagles a pretty bad team and Vince Papale a man pretty down on his luck. Little did both the team and Vince know their fortunes were about to change with the arrival of Dick Vermeil the new head coach of the Eagles.The basic need of any biographical movie is that it MUST establish a relationship with the audience in order for us to be emotionally connected to the movie. I would say that Invincible only does a soso job with this. For example I recently saw Walk The Line if that movie does one thing well is it makes us really care about Johnny Cash and June Carter. On the other hand Mark Wahlberg's version of Vince Papale keeps us at a distance while offering only limited insight into what really makes Vince tick. It doesn't help that the script keeps Mark's lines to a minimum. This doesn't seem to jive with the real Vince Papale a very high energy man who always has something to say. On the other hand Greg Kinnear does a GREAT rendition of Dick Vermeil. He really nailed Dick in personality and mannerisms.The best part of the movie are the visuals. The movie does a great job recreating Philadelphia life in 1976 what it was like to be an Eagle fan in the 70's and 1970's NFL life before the megamillions contracts and cushy locker rooms with every amenity imaginable. These aspects of the movie I thoroughly enjoyed.However there were a couple noticeable misses in this recreation. There was no mention at all of the 1976 Bicentennial in the movie. This was a pretty big miss since the entire city was wrapped up in the celebration. Another thing that puzzled me was the woes us attitude from the Phiilly fans in the movie. This really wasn't the case in Philadelophia at the time. Yes the Eagles were bad but the Phillies made the playoffs that year the Sixers went to the NBA finals behind Dr. J and the Flyers had just won two Stanley Cups. While I'm on the portrayal of the Philly fans some of it was a little over the top. When the Eagles are losing by several touchdowns late in the game everyone doesn't stay to boo and we certainly don't threaten other fans to stay. I laughed at most of it because I knew it was more caricature than real life. But I know there are people out there who think thats how Philly fans really are. From me to you it's more myth than fact.Overall I'm giving the movie 7 out of 10. But if Vince Papale were a Giant I'd only give it 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never underestimate the power of a good story decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's Invincible starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries including Remember The Titans and last's year's golf film The Greatest game Ever Played so they know their stuff.Invincible is the biographical tale of downonhisluck Vince Papale Wahlberg who is a pretty fair street football player in Philadelphia in the mid1970s. He is also a substitute teacher but when he loses that gig is forced to tend bar parttime.Meanwhile his team the NFL Eagles  mired in several seasons of lastplace finishes making the franchise the joke of the NFC East  hires a new head coach Dick Vermeil Kinnear who decides to hold an open tryout for players. It's looked upon as a joke and hundreds of untalented and outofshape clowns show up at Veteran's Stadium for the event even Vince who never played college ball and is sure he is not good enough to get a second look. On a fluke however he is the only walkon allowed to go to training camp.Meanwhile he becomes sort of a neighborhood celebrity and develops a sweet love affair with his boss' cousin Janet Elizabeth Banks The 40YearOld Virgin the TV series Scrubs a diehard New York Giants fan.He impresses Vermeil enough to make it down to the final cut but what happens after that you'll have to find out yourself.Wahlberg might be a tad bit small for an NFL player he's much smaller than the real Papale but he is appropriately wellbuilt and his lowkey performance gives real pathos to his character.It's Kinnear however who steals the picture. I must admit when he first appears on screen there are a few giggles but he eases into the role of the harried skipper whom many did not expect to last the year and does a tremendous job.Lastly since the story takes place in 1975 the year my old favorite team the St. Louis Cardinals won the NFC East you would expect the soundtrack to blast some high quality tunes. In this respect the film does not disappoint. Tunes from The Who Jim Croce BachmanTurner Overdrive Canned Heat Edgar Winter Group Grand Funk Railroad Rod Stewart Elvin Bishop Rare Earth and others highlights this moviegoing experience.A bit sappy at times but overall a nice little biopic that is one of the more inspiring movies of 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person i am a fan of his films and his work and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home since i remember Vince Papale how bad the Eagles were Dick Vermeil and of course the infamous Tom Landry so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too and thankfully i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film and for the most part it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting which for me was the essence of this film and that was camaraderie support atmosphere and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too the seeming Ah who turned out to be a courageous selfsacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead remake.I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects with the exception of The Fast and the Furious and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number 83 taped on his back and he saw his friends playing football in the mud a longheld tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment strikes and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes this film was very formulaic. But the film was inspired by a real person a son of Philadelphia the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end for a less abrupt denouement but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage determination the American dream family and friends. Those aspects came through very well even in spite of Papale's lifelong struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans.".

I was happy to see Michael Kelly too the seeming Ah who turned out to be a courageous selfsacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead remake.I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects with the exception of The Fast and the Furious and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number 83 taped on his back and he saw his friends playing football in the mud a longheld tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment strikes and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes this film was very formulaic. But the film was inspired by a real person a son of Philadelphia the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end for a less abrupt denouement but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage determination the American dream family and friends. Those aspects came through very well even in spite of Papale's lifelong struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans.";

His performance is completely flat. Not only does he not try to give his character life but he is not even likable. Sorry Mark but no Oscar nod for this one! As for his football story it proves to be enormously dull. The sequences follow the usual Disney sports movie mold never breaking free in a single area. Greg Kinnear who is typically fantastic struggles to give Coach Dick Vermielle some actual personality and character. He wants us to sympathize with him but he comes off as simply pathetic. The lifeless football story never even comes off the ground. The final game scene is anticlimactic involving Vince making an unimportant play that means nothing.The romantic aspect of the film is even worse. Elizabeth Banks plays Vince's love interest who he marries after the end of the film. She tries doing a New York accent for about five minutes before abruptly switching to her normal voice. Her performance itself is bland and vapid like the rest of the film.Still I understand that some people really like this film. I can honestly say that I didn't. If you're a huge sports fan and care little about bad acting and boring slowmotion shots you'll probably like it. If you're looking for a goodquality film with an exciting plot you'll hate it.

The football scenes were so intense I cringed at how painful they looked. I loved the fact where they just show the humdrum of everyday life without trying to make everything appear beautiful. They background of South Philly portrayed was wonderful. Mark Walburg did a marvelous job as Vince Papale. To Kevin Conway who portrayed Frank Papale WOW!!!! You sure can make a girl cry. The remaining cast were perfect in all their roles. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This movie would be great for boys and girls who love football and those who don't.

The teamwork aspects that are displayed in the football scenes are awesome. The Soundtrack sounds pretty leveled out and catchy. I think they use a Nickelback song in it. Side of a bullet if I am not mistaken. This will for sure storyline wise beat out Snakes on a plane and is good to even show the family. The Film is owned by Disney so you can't go wrong with that.

The screenplay and dialogue were extremely tired and clich while the film itself drags along at a slow pace. This film doesn't even try to present the story of Vince Papale in an interesting or enlightening way. Instead Invincible only uses the same old formula that every sports movie before it developed. I guess the writers just felt tired of trying and went through the stacks taking ideas from Remember the Titans and Rudy. I almost felt psychic. I've seen this same old crap a thousand times before and I don't need to see it a thousand times more. Don't get me wrong I'm not against Vince Papale or the story of his life but I think justice hasn't been done for Vince. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance one word disappointed. He's a great actor but he was just not at his best. Let me just say that this was one of the few movies I've ever seen in my lifetime that I actually felt like sleeping through.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNING Rarely have I ever been so disappointed by a movie especially one I had such low expectations for to begin with. I went into the theater expecting a nice comfortable predictable Rudy rehashed themed especially for my favorite city in the world Philadelphia. I was not expecting nor did I particularly desire great cinema or stunning originality I would have happily settled for a welldone version of a marvelously entertaining clich. What I got was a movie that more than anything else seemed hopelessly unambitious it didn't seem particularly interested in old standby truisms or anything particularly resembling a story. Sure there were a couple of scenes ripped straight out of Rudy including one where two guys get into the pit and have to hit each other but mostly it was a a meandering moping and unengaging retelling of one man's life in football totally lacking in any dramatic fire. And I'm a big Eagles fan!None of the players on the 1976 Eagles are particularly featured replaced instead with a general grumbling about Papale being on the team. So clichd though it would be there is not even an attempt at a first I hate you then I respect you and finally I stick up for you and help you become an established member of the team story line between one of the established players and Papale. There is a passing gesture at this sort of plot device nothing more. Instead the story such as it is focuses on the relationship with Papale and Dick Vermeil. Even that lacks much dramatic tension each week Papale is still on the team until Vermeil calls him into his office and tells him to bring his playbook  usually what he does right before he cuts a player  in order to tell him he's made the team. Surprise! There is hardly any dramatic tension here and this is the crux of the story. The other subplots are equally lacking in any real rising action or in at least one case sense. Papale's first wife left him and called him a loser but it's OK because he nearly immediately meets a hotter girl who is a Giants fan but still a good person. Yawn. In another subplot Papale's dad supports him but suggests he should resign himself to the idea that he is just a regular guy and will never be anything more. Boy does the younger Papale show him! Not only does Vince make the Eagles but on the day of the Eagles' home opener his first day in Philadelphia in uniform he forgets to get his Dad a ticket as we discover when we see his father at a bar watching the game on TV but still cheering his son on with a bunch of other barflies  how nice. Finally in the one that makes the least sense of all one of Papale's best friends continually reminds him what a loser he is no matter what he does. He gets through the open tryout  he's a loser. He makes it past the first cuts  loser. Next round of cuts  loser. After he makes the team  loser. After he doesn't play well in his first game against Dallas  loser. Presumably this would have gone ad infinitum but mercifully the movie ended. Why does his friend despise him so much? Even the movie doesn't seem too sure  it just seemed like it would add something to the plot I guess to have this sour grapes character there at every turn to remind Papale that whatever he's achieved is only dust in the wind and that soon he'll be nothing again. One positive note the attention to uniform detail is heroic. In 1976 the Dallas Cowboys who normally have a stripe running over the crown of their helmets that is bluewhiteblue changed to redwhiteblue to commemorate the bicentennial. The movie has the 'Boys in the correct uniform. And the Eagles are wearing that 1976 Philadelphia patch that uses the number 76 to make the crackandclapper in the Liberty Bell. I only wish attention to this type of detail made it worth while. The Vet mostly looks like Franklin Field with benches where the seats should be. Moreover the movie's story is decidedly uninspiring  I can't see how this movie would hold any interest to anyone outside the Philadelphia area.".

To be sure there were the typical cliches did anyone not know that the security guard was SO dead!. However the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace and the tension builds towards the reasonably satisfying climax. Performances by the lead characters were generally quite good. I found Mark Wahlbergs character to be quite convincing and quite menacing though I agree he would certainly benefit from some speech coaching. The two young female leads Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano did a good job playing the victims and certainly add value to the film for their attractiveness alone. The standout performance for me was that of William L. Petersen as the father. Most of his actionsreactions rang true to me. Was Fear a great movie? Not really. Was it a good satisfying and ultimately entertaining way to spend 97 minutes? Yes indeed. Even my wife stayed awake till the end and that's worth an 810 alone.".

I'd read the synopsis in the TV guide and the plot sounded like one of those psycho killer stalker from hell thrillers that were being churned out without any thought in the mid 1990s . Considering it starred singer Marky Mark  Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen who's a rival to Eric Roberts in the straight to video  cable TV movie stakes I didn't think this was going to be up to much While not being a classic thriller FEAR certainly did hold my attention  probably because much of the characterisation is credible . All too often in this genre the actor or actress playing the villain really goes to town showing the audience what a bad ass they are thereby parodying the role . Mark Wahlberg as David is very restrained for the most part which makes David and credible character and his on screen chemistry with Reese Witherspoon's Nicole is believable  you can believe these two characters are genuinely in love with one another something that is all too rare in this type of movie I should also point out that much of the movie revolves around the interaction of Petersen's Mr Walker who is concerned about his daughter's relationship with David . You can't blame the guy for wanting what's best for his offspring and it enhances the credibility of the story . It's refreshing to have a more thoughtful approach to this type of genre because if people start turning up dead after 15 minutes then things start to get silly  so the violence is kept to a minimum until almost at the end of the movie which does suffer something of a plot hole because no one seems to have a mobile telephone at readily hand and don't tell me professional people didn't have mobile phones in 1996 . Also watch out for references to STRAW DOGS  THE SHINING and NOSFERATU at the climax Even if you're burned out on those 90s stalker from hell thrillers you could do worse than watch this on a wet Friday evening".

Milano is a delight to watch even that she's not very required in the movie but still shines in the few minutes she appears. Second and best of all Fear goes directly to the point and makes it very easy to watch. SPOILERS There's nothing much to comment about Fear except for some infamous scenes like the dog's head the drilling in the hand and the three sex scenes.There are some Slasher elements a la Scream in this movie that in the time were very effective stabbing dog's head cut off minimal gore and a psycho killer and worked very well in order to create a tense atmosphere. The ending is quite predictable and expected. The actors they chose perform surprisingly good. If the plot is not very interesting then the least you can expect is to feel some sympathy for the characters. Whiterspoon is tender and beautiful and you totally believe her when she has different feelings for her boyfriend. Wahlberg delivers a good performance as a crazed angry boyfriend. Come on everybody feels anger jealous acts... this is exactly where I think that Fear succeeds. The movie is directed to a teenager audience that immediately feels similarities in their personal life with the events of it.

	schema:reviewBody "Warning may contain some small spoilersIt's really funny with better marketing this film may have done better business.  What I remember seeing about this film was how evil and maniacal David was going to be.  You knew going into the film that he was going to do some really bad things after his facade as the good boyfriend was over.  But really the whole first half of this film has the same feeling as Pretty In Pink or Some Kind Of Wonderful.  When I was watching how Nicole  Witherspoon was quickly falling for David's charm and sweetness I was intrigued.  There are some great moments in here that explore young love and my favourite scene in the film and one of my favourite scenes ever that deals with young virginal sexuality is the roller coaster scene in the film.  Everything about it was pure and honest. David  Wahlberg  and Nicole get into the front seat of the roller coaster and she is wearing a very short skirt.  The ride begins and then the music starts.  The song is Wild Horses by a group that I am not familiar with  no it is not the Stones  and they begin to move.  David begins to inch his hand cautiously up her skirt.  Her facial expressions are perfect.  She is apprehensive but excited and after a brief resistance she lets him touch her.  The roller coaster ride becomes a metaphor for how she is feeling. Nicole has now just had her first sexual experience of any kind and David has her.  He knows it's only a matter of time before he will take her virginity and she knows it as well.  On this level the film is perfect.  Exploring young love is a delicate situation but director Foley handles it with ease and he even shows the beauty of how love can make you feel.  It's just too bad that the film has to take a different path at the conclusion because this could have been a great coming of age love story.  I'm not saying the psycho elements to the film are terrible I'm just saying that the innocence of the love story seems to work and fit better in here.  This is a film that reminds us of what it was like to fall in love for the first time and what it was like to make love the first time.  And I enjoyed it for that. I do recommend seeing this film but it just seems like two movies that could have been one.  But it is enjoyable and the actors in here are great.  Even Mylano and Petersen as Nicole's best friend and father respectively are fun to watch.  So it is a good film.  But again not to be redundant but I liked the innocence of it better than the vigor.".

	onyx:emotionText "Warning may contain some small spoilersIt's really funny with better marketing this film may have done better business.  What I remember seeing about this film was how evil and maniacal David was going to be.  You knew going into the film that he was going to do some really bad things after his facade as the good boyfriend was over.  But really the whole first half of this film has the same feeling as Pretty In Pink or Some Kind Of Wonderful.  When I was watching how Nicole  Witherspoon was quickly falling for David's charm and sweetness I was intrigued.  There are some great moments in here that explore young love and my favourite scene in the film and one of my favourite scenes ever that deals with young virginal sexuality is the roller coaster scene in the film.  Everything about it was pure and honest. David  Wahlberg  and Nicole get into the front seat of the roller coaster and she is wearing a very short skirt.  The ride begins and then the music starts.  The song is Wild Horses by a group that I am not familiar with  no it is not the Stones  and they begin to move.  David begins to inch his hand cautiously up her skirt.

I recommend this as a good film to rent for a night with the girls or if you are just in the mood for a thriller with real good looking people.

	schema:headline " Family Tensions As Naive Girl Dates Psychotic Boyfriend";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is visually strong suspenseful and extremely entertaining but the way in which it depicts family tensions is its greatest achievement. A teenage girl's relationship with a young man from the wrong side of the tracks soon sparks off numerous problems that are down to her father's overprotective instincts and the girl's natural rebelliousness but the dramatic possibilities are then heightened even further due to the specific dynamics that exist within the girl's reconstituted family.Nicole Walker Reese Witherspoon is the nave 16yearold who after previously living with her mother moves into her father's suburban home in Seattle. Steven's William Petersen an overworked architect who lives with his second wife Laura Amy Brenneman and her young son Toby Christopher Gray. When Nicole and her high school classmate Margo Masse Alyssa Milano go to a local rave Nicole meets David McCall Mark Wahlberg and is instantly attracted to him. He's exceptionally polite softly spoken and seems very gentle and considerate. David instantly makes a positive impression on Laura and Toby when he visits their home but Steven instinctively takes a dislike to him. This naturally creates a rift between him and Nicole and makes her even more determined to continue the relationship.Things suddenly change one day when David sees Nicole hugging her school friend Gary Todd Caldecott and is overcome with jealousy and rage. In a sudden and violent outburst he brutally attacks Gary and roughly pushes Nicole to the ground. After the attack Nicole is left with a black eye and immediately stops seeing David. This incident reinforces Steven's negative feelings towards David but it isn't long before Nicole surprisingly rekindles the relationship. Steven is incensed and angrily forbids David from seeing his daughter again. David however is totally obsessed with Nicole and as his fury grows the revenge he takes on the Walker family becomes progressively more violent until his actions eventually lead to a terrifying conclusion.The ways in which conflict grows between the generations is shown very effectively in this drama because whilst it's natural for parents to want to protect their children from pain exploitation or bad experiences it's also entirely natural for teenagers to want to explore life in the way that their instincts dictate and not be given advice which they just regard as being interfering by parents who want to spoil their fun. The tensions in the Walker family are also complicated by the stepparents' desire to be accepted by their adopted children and also the uncertainty that children can feel about a parent's new spouse.Reese Witherspoon does a great job of portraying the mixture of naivety and growing maturity that's typical of a 16yearold and Mark Wahlberg is particularly good in the scenes that require him to express his anger. William Petersen provides the other standout performance as the father who's left frazzled by being overworked having to contend with his concerns about his daughter and trying to cope with his wife's unreasonable attitude to his work commitments. Overall this is a movie which provides some pertinent observations on family life in the 1990s in a story that's perfectly paced and delivered in a style that's never dull.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is about as bad as movies get. Nothing to see here move along. If you must know the threadbare plot follows 16year old Nicole Walker played by Reese Witherspoon. Sure is a long way from this garbage to an Academy Award for Miss Witherspoon. But I digress. Anyhow young Nicole falls in love with seemingly sweet nice perfectly charming David McCall played by Mark Wahlberg who somehow managed to salvage an acting career after appearing in this movie and thus was spared a lifetime of Whatever happened to that Marky Mark guy questions. Of course if David is as seemingly wonderful as he initially seems this movie would have a different title. As it is David soon reveals himself to be a murderous lunatic and everybody does not in fact live happily ever after.So what's wrong with this movie you ask? In a nutshell everything. The script is terrible with some of the most godawful dialogue ever heard. The characters are all clichd pulled straight out of so many similar and infinitely better movies that had come before. This film has nothing new to offer it's just a painfully bad rehash. It's meant to be suspenseful and shocking. In fact it's just laughable. Nothing here is believable the whole thing is over to the top to the point of stupidity. Don't even get me started on why Nicole's completely ordinary family lives in a home with more security features than Fort Knox. It's downright ludicrous an artificial attempt to make the climax of the film more dramatic. Unfortunately by the film's climax you'll be stifling yawns. If you haven't already given up and turned the thing off. You get the sense everyone involved with this movie would like to forget it ever happened. If you ever are unlucky enough to have to sit through it you'll wish you could forget it too.".

As it is David soon reveals himself to be a murderous lunatic and everybody does not in fact live happily ever after.So what's wrong with this movie you ask? In a nutshell everything. The script is terrible with some of the most godawful dialogue ever heard. The characters are all clichd pulled straight out of so many similar and infinitely better movies that had come before. This film has nothing new to offer it's just a painfully bad rehash. It's meant to be suspenseful and shocking. In fact it's just laughable. Nothing here is believable the whole thing is over to the top to the point of stupidity. Don't even get me started on why Nicole's completely ordinary family lives in a home with more security features than Fort Knox. It's downright ludicrous an artificial attempt to make the climax of the film more dramatic. Unfortunately by the film's climax you'll be stifling yawns. If you haven't already given up and turned the thing off. You get the sense everyone involved with this movie would like to forget it ever happened. If you ever are unlucky enough to have to sit through it you'll wish you could forget it too.";

	schema:reviewBody "FEAR 1996 Starring Reese Witherspoon Mark Wahlberg William L. Petersen Amy Brenneman Alyssa Milano Director James Foley   97 minutes   Rated R for violence sexuality language and drug useBy Blake FrenchFear is a desperate horrorfree thriller. It does manage to generate some heavy suspense in the twenty minute finale but that does not make the film worth seeing. It wastes the talents of the lovely Reese Witherspoon William L. Petersen and I suppose Mark Wahlberg too. I hesitate to state that Wahlberg's talents put to waste because I am not sure that beyond an attractive body he has any. And James Foleywhat in the world he is something else. After watching The Corrupter earlier this year and now this piece of trash not to mention his past flops The Chamber 1996 and Two Bits 1995 I begin to wonder about his career in the future.Fear takes a spin on the old girlfriend and boyfriendboyfriend is not whom he seems genre. The subtitle to this film is Together forever...or else but most of the movie doesn't live up to that clever plot point. The teenage girl in the picture Nicole Walker is well played by Reese Witherspoon but if I was in charge I'd have to say that Alicia Silverstone was born for the role. Although I hold nothing against Witherspoon. In fact I think she should get recognition for her performance this year in Election. I just think Silverstone has the punky street girl type attitude more than Witherspoon.Anyway the teenage girl in the picture Nicole Walker is like all other teens her age about sixteen. She has a father Steve who doesn't want his little girl to grow up a mother who takes her side and friends Billy and Margo Masse who may or may not betray her before the film is over. She has a hard time getting a date usually but when going out with her friends one night seeing a muscular seductive hunk playing pool named David the next time they meet it is almost love at first sight.  When he is introduced to Nicole's parents who naturally live in a house guarded with high tech security systems and camera surveillance along with a police officer watching over the mansionlike dorm the vibes are at first too good to be true then become quite bleak. After a few instances involving David and Nicole's friend Billy Steve begins to suspect something more to David than meets the eye. And guess what? He's right. First he discovers that David has no family or apparent history and then finds out his spent his childhood being shipped from orphanage to orphanage. After the emotional and physical battles begin Steve and David and Nicole changes her mind about this hunk who she was quick to judge. David's obsession with Nicole leads to some extenuatingand even murderouscircumstances.There is some character chemistry between the David and Nicole characters and the way their relationship is presented their circumstances are surprisingly believable. The problem with the characters instead of witnessing the development of the character's relationship we get scene after scene of David and Nicole sensuously making out and starring into each others eyes never actually letting us become involved. And the scenes which are supposed to be steamy and hot are strained and fake looking.The film is so desperate for tension which is not supplied by the script it even features a scene where Walhberg 1 pounds his chest so hard it gives him bruises in order to frame Nicole's father 2 creates a homemade tattoo on his chest that reads Nicole 4 ever and 3 concludes with an ending without any motive that precedes in the script. None of these things have any dramatic purpose in the film. The scenes where David deforms his body only prove to us that he has an uncontrollable love for a girl that not hates him but also we never feel anything in his young mind simply because of the lack of character development. So to make a long paragraph short the film is all build up and hardly no payoff.The filmmakers clearly desire to go for outright suspense and skip the terror. And under the circumstances they do a pretty good job. The ending is kind of interesting and Mark Walhberg does provide an evil eye to die for too bad he can't get over his flamboyant self esteemboth in and out of character. There is even a disappointing false first act that tries to make us believe Nicole and David are over with. Give me a break. For once why can't the girl be the psycho. Now that would be an original and engaging thriller.".

I managed to sit through all of it but for a fairly short film it dragged on and on for what seemed like an eternity and the only thing that I was really fearful of was that I might fall asleep with the TV on and waste money on my parents' electricity bill.With a thriller you are supposed to build up tension throughout the film and then release it all in a nail biting climax that leaves you gasping for breath and on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly simple idea but Fear manages to botch it up royally.You are introduced to a fairly tedious rich family apparently facing all sorts of problems and then after about quarter of an hour of mindless bitching the daughter meets supposedly the perfect boyfriend. As the guy says himself if something seems too good to be true it probably isn't meaning that he is obviously going to be a psycho. So much time is spent on them being loving together it doesn't really add anything to the plot except for making you want to throw up. One particular scene on a rollercoaster was particularly distasteful and quite disturbing for entirely the wrong reasons.The premise isn't actually that bad they probably could have squeezed a decent movie out of it if they had really tried but they decide to ignore subtly and hit you in the face with the obvious. They could have let the boyfriend slowly display his psychotic side flashing the audience hints that the girl doesn't notice so our fear for her grows the more and more the relationship goes on. The more she doesn't know he's bloody mental and the more we do the more we care. Instead they decide that he is going to display his mentalness right in front of her face by going ape and attacking one of her buddies all because the poor dude gave her a hug.After this the plot just gets more ludicrous and keeps going round in circles but somehow manages to get to a really promising climax. Just when I thought the film might just be able to redeem itself the director manages to mess up the ending as well. Brilliant.There isn't really coherent message to the film and the acting from everybody is well below par. The entire film plays out as an endurance contest for how many clichs you can handle before you are forced to turn the TV off.".

This movie has it all. Lust forbidden love obsession action mystery suspense reallife situations rebellion strong emotions that will grip you at times and a plot that will keep you intrigued all the way through to the very end. It's weird to see one of my favorite CSI characters in a movie where he got his start William Petersen who plays Steve Walker in this movie played Gill Grissom on CSI. If you haven't seen this movie and are looking for a good thrillersuspense movie to watch from the mid 90's....this is a must watch in my opinion!!".

Especially where there aren't any particular peak moments in the movie.About Cherry is about a young girl who leaves her dysfunctional family behind and moves to San Francisco with her friend. Here in the new town she starts making pornography for a living and earns good money without heeding the dark side of her job. With her family ties and friendships on the line Cherry balances a fine line which could easily tip her over.The story is average although it is quite painted out in stereotypical aspects and it is to the point where it starts to become a daytime soap show alcoholism pornographic business drug abuse family problems and so forth.The problem with About Cherry is the characters in the story as they are unfathomably onedimensional and just doesn't really show much personality or give you enough of them to make you care. You just sit throughout the entire movie with a shrug and occasional shake of the head.Be warned that there is an excessive amount of nudity and sexual references in the movie obviously as the movie does revolve around the pornographic industry. Personally I didn't care much for it because it was done to the point where it was too much bordering on being softcore pornography at times.Personally I did find that most people in the movie did fair enough jobs with their given roles but only a couple of them managed to stand out in the movie and those were Dev Patel playing Andrew Heather Graham playing Margaret and Lili Taylor playing Phyllis.I am sure if you are fans of anyone in the movie then you might find some greater enjoyment in this movie or if you have some kind of fascination with the way the pornographic business works then this might be something for you. But if you are watching this for entertainment as I did then you will not walk away with a 'wow' sensation because the movie just doesn't rock the boat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someday a movie is going to be made that will take us inside the adult film industry to show us the reality of what goes on there and what happens to the people who operate within it. When that film comes let us hope that it answers the most basic fundamental questions that we the audience will have How and why does someone get into that industry? What is their home life like? How does it effect their married life? What about their children? Are they worried about raising children while explaining what mommy does for a living? Are they worried about AIDS? How do you move into other profession while still carrying the stigma of being a porn star along with you? What happens when you reach the inevitable age when you are no longer sexy and photogenic? What then? That movie is still to be made because clearly About Cherry answers none of these questions. Here is a movie that promises sex but plays like a dull soap opera with a little nudity thrown in here and there. It claims to be a portrait of one woman's journey into becoming an adult film star but comes off as slow uninteresting and anticlimactic. It doesn't have any characters for us to care about nor any of the good parts that a lot of moviegoers will be hoping for.The movie stars Ashley Hinsaw as Angelina a twentysomething who lives at home with her alcoholic mother Lili Taylor and her mom's abusive boyfriend. That situation is hardly explored at all. We see the mother hugging the toilet and the boyfriend stomping about the house like an angry bear we see him only in shadow. Then we briefly meet Angelina's little sister whom she cares about but not enough to get her out of this unhappy household.One day cashstrapped Angelina gets a slight suggestion from her current boyfriend Jonny Weston that she try a nude photoshoot with a company that runs a porn site. Why not? It might be an easy way to make money. She does and with the money packs up her things and heads for San Francisco with her best friend Andrew Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire.In The City by the Bay she goes to a lavish party where she meets two people. First is Francis James Franco a lawyer with cocaine addiction who gives her expensive dresses and takes her to lavish parties. He soon becomes her new boyfriend. The other is Margaret Heather Graham who directs porn films and suggests that Angelina might perfect to star in her next film. It isn't long before she finds herself embroiled in the business under the name Cherry.What happens next is exactly what you expect. Angelina gets involved in the adult film industry and starts making money. As she does all kinds of problem begin stirring up in her personal life. The problem is that they are all problems that we can predict before the movie starts. It is a surprise that Francis has a problem with her profession? Is it a surprise that mom comes to visit finds out about her new career and abandons her? Is it a surprise that questions arise about Angelina's real age? Is it a surprise that she catches Andrew having a good time with one of her movies? Do you care about any of this stuff? It is difficult to care because none of this stuff is the least bit interesting especially a badly written subplot involving Margaret's relationship with her lover Jillian that breaks up over questions of Angelina's age. Their breakup scene in which they have angry sex is silly and awkward and disturbingly voyeuristic.About Cherry comes from firsttime director Stephen Elliott who cowrote the screenplay with reallife porn star Lorelei Lee. Their script is a mess. They want to comment on the scummy world of the porn business but Elliot employs a soundtrack that romanticizes it. The movie offsets a few fleeting sex scenes very few with dramatic moments that contain long passages of meaningless dialogue.As for the sex there are only a handful of scenes showing Angelina in front of the camera but they are all shot in a sleazy voyeuristic way that goes nowhere runs way too short to be of any interest. Yes there is some nudity and Miss Hinsaw is very attractive but we get the sense that the director has gotten caught up in the moment and forgotten that he is suppose to be making a point. The end of the film when Angelina's world has completely come apart is  much like the rest of the film  one of the most confounding conclusions you'll ever experience.American films that explore sex with even an ounce of maturity are so rare that it is heartbreaking when an attempt goes bad. Here was a movie that had the potential to ask a lot of questions and explore a subject that we might have found interesting but blows the opportunity at every turn. We are not far into this movie before we realize that About Cherry isn't really about anything at all.".

Most often media portrays us to be drug addicts and low lives. In About Cherry it is shown that there is not one outcome. The film shows that a woman can make a healthy choice when presented with less favorable situations. All too often we only get to see those whose lives fall about and thus the film perpetuates the stereotype of the Sex Worker. We are not who you think! I read quite a few of these reviews and I am aware that as soon as a film comes out to show a woman in the sex industry to be strong and come out on top it gets trashed. The reason being it challenges those stereotypes that people hold on to so very strongly. Not long ago gays and blacks were portrayed the same way in the media. ie... the villain was always some crazed lesbian or cross dresser. We love to vilify that what we don't understand.Whether you like the film itself or not is one thing. But please don't tell me it's not realistic until you've worked 10 to 20 years in the industry and know what your talking about.Sorry I know this sounds like a soap box but it's so very crazy how many people will talk about an issue they know nothing of. I liked About Cherry. If nothing more than for the message.

I don't even know why the girl got into porn in the first place. It was not like she had abusive parents or was extremely poor and had no other prospects in life. In other words there was just nothing miserable or hopeless about her life at all so why does she decided to make such a drastic life changing decision? The movie is never really clear on it and lets stuff just happen without letting it have an emotional impact neither.So maybe her life starts spiraling down once she gets into porn? No on the contrary actually. She has more money and friends than ever before so what is the movie actually trying to do or say? Bottomline is that it's trying to be dramatic without letting anything on the screen come across as dramatic. What a weird and terribly ineffective approach for a drama to take.It's as if the movie itself also realized that it's drama and main character weren't really working out since it decides to throw in a bunch of more characters with each their own things going on. Some of it feels out of place while some of it does indeed work out more interestingly. It gives the movie at least some variety.So no I actually didn't completely hated watching this movie but it still made me constantly go what's the point of all of it and why am I watching this in the first place?And the ending...well it wraps things up but it doesn't ever reach a satisfying conclusion with anything. The movie just ends without making it feel like everything is done with as well. The movie does indeed leave more questions than answers but on the other hand you won't care enough about this movie or any of the characters to truly want to see all of the questions getting answered.A mostly failed independent drama that you real easily could do without.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie about a hot young woman getting into the porn industry staring James Franco and Dev Patel? Can't go wrong right? Wrong!What I liked I liked the fact that without watching porn I got to see an amazingly beautiful Ashley Hinshaw tease the camera have sex multiple times show her breasts and play with herself. I enjoy any movie where young people spontaneously leave the town they have spent their whole lives in and hit the road with only the clothes on their back. My favorite part of the film was the fact that it was almost a feminist movie at the very least it had speckles of feminism. Cherry is left and called a disgusting whore by a man James Franco she was falling in love with called a huge disappointment by her mother and loses her best friend because of how she has chosen to make money. A woman exercising control over her own body scares the living poop out of 95 of us men but Cherry doesn't care too much about what people think.What I didn't like I have seen James Franco in a lot of movies and of course Freaks and Geeks and have enjoyed each and every one. I didn't even know he was in this movie until the opening credits which was a pleasant surprise. Then I met his horribly clichd character a man who dreamed of being an artist as a child was put down and instead became a lawyer. He know has money but always wonders what could have been. Because of these regrets he is a drug addicted narcissist. If before I watched someone would have told me that Franco plays a clichd part I would have still assumed his acting would have been enough to make it enjoyable it wasn't. Dev Patel although I haven't seen him in anything besides Slumdog Millionaire was respected in my mind. Unfortunately he also badly plays a clichd character. The nerdy probably gay best friend of a hot chick who watches said hot chick fall in love with other guys and is therefore miserable. The scene where their roommate Paco takes Patel to a gay bar is one of the most unbelievable horribly acted scenes in this wacky movie. The award for worst most unbelievable scene goes to the part of the movie where Cherry and Patel first arrive in San Francisco. They have never been to the city apparently have little to no money and set up an interview for a room in a loft. The interview lasts less than a minute they meet Paco Paco shows them the room they say they'll take it and they begin unpacking. Seriously? I doubt this could even happen in the smallest community in America.I can write pages upon pages about how bad this movie was but I'm getting bored and feeling suicidal just from these short paragraphs. After posting this review I will do everything in my power to erase the memory of this film in order to still have some respect for James Franco.".

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered this movie last summer when Heather Graham was doing some promo work. Being familiar with the website the movie's based on I was pleased to stumble across the DVD.Whilst I'm sure that porn insiders believe they have a unique tale to tell including our writer the reality is that most entrants to pornography come from similar troubled backgrounds. Ashley Hinshaw does a good job with the material she's given. She's certainly beautiful further emphasised when compared to the stalwarts sharing a dressing room with her. The issue here is that there's simply not enough material to stretch this out.The viewer can all too easily discern that it's heartbreaking to watch an innocent soul get trapped within such a vile industry. We've collectively witnessed countless documentaries and fiction that's hammered this point into our consciousness. Where this movie succeeds is showing that it's not always a cautionary tale. Is the industry as vile as one would expect? There's an element of professionalism in the manner that contemporary porn companies conduct themselves. This film makes no effort to portray the seedy act of hardcore porn as being produced haphazardly. I was glad of this as it's lazy stereotyping to suggest that in a digital world there's still fat guys calling all the wrong shots behind the camera.Hinshaw conveys the naivety you'd expect when embarking upon Angelina's journey but over time her independence grows. Whether it's distancing herself from a difficult family and worshipful best friend to accepting more personal and emotionally troubling roles at work. The progression seems credible with minor pacing issues troubling me. It's difficult to comprehend how much time passes between each stage of Angelina's process.Hinshaw's Angelina has to deal with a boyfriend and a best friend both male both with wildly different expectations but similar opinions of her work. However when the story falls back on their objections perhaps I was unfairly expecting more than those objections on their own. James Franco plays a smaller role and I suspect he'll be thankful. There's no exploration of his potentially intriguing character at all which is breathtaking considering his talent and reputation. My question now is what attracted Franco to such a limited role irrespective of how much screen time it involved? The main issue I have is the quality of the dialogue. There's one particular sequence where the characters simply repeat themselves across multiple scenes which stands out for criticism. Porn insider Lorelei Lee has writing credits which explains the accuracy and fluidity of the porn terminology but also the lack of emotional depth in the script. A solid movie could potentially have become a good one. Any film such as this will hope to use the lead character's personal relationships as a crutch as it's the only way to bring this type of movie to life.Having recently watched this season's Hollywood Reporter Roundtable for 2013's Best Actress projected nominees the one constant theme they agreed on was a dearth of quality material to go around. Sally Field Marion Cotillard Amy Adams and much more bemoaned the struggles of lead roles worth their attention. Perhaps this is why young Ashley Hinshaw took such a risk to bare all for this movie. It's become fashionable to risk a career to lay claim to a 'gutsy' or 'ambitious' portrayal to pad a resume. Fortunately for Hinshaw this is certainly no Showgirls but it's a million miles from Monsters Ball.All things considered this is still worth watching but don't drop everything to accommodate. The sex scenes aren't too intense or overbearing. If anyone's looking to watch this film only for the nudity then there's enough to sink your teeth into. Hinshaw's got an incredible body and Heather Graham's exactly as you know and love her.610 for me.".

The plot summary really oversells this film and made me believe that it actually might be a good film I didn't look at its IMDb rating prior to watching it.The problem with this film is that it just seems to lack any sort of depth this extends to both the plot and its characters. With this being a drama on the porn industry I expected it to explore the ups downs and consequences of one's involvement within this industry. This film explores some of the ups quite well and we also see some of the consequences on those around Cherry as a result of her new found career. What it fails to explore is the downside and given the subject matter that's where I thought a lot of the focus would be. Cherry takes cocaine and seemingly ends up unaffected by this  she falls out with her parents and again seems unaffected by this. Cherry then has a bust up with her friend Andrew when she catches him watching porn. At this point I thought the film was turning a corner and felt that there may be some sort of realisation or insight but once again the writers stop that thread dead and move on to something else. Worse still the film suggests that Cherry ends up with film director Margaret  this isn't clear as the film shifts from them having a drink in the bar together and then finds them living together in the next scene. Did anyone else think that was a bit weird? I think the worst part of this film is that it felt like it had no message and nothing to say I mean Cherry is arguably happier at the end than she was at the start? She doesn't seemed to have suffered that badly at any point during the film. Whilst I think that saying this glamorises the industry is perhaps going a bit too far I did feel that it didn't explore the downsides very well and for me that's sending out a fairly dangerous message particularly to younger viewers.Personally I found this film to be shallow and somewhat pointless. It didn't really have anything to say and didn't really explore Cherry's relationships with her family and friends. Worse still it failed to provide the audience with any sort of commentary.

	schema:headline " About Cherry takes a dark journey into the adult film industry";
	schema:reviewBody "There have been numerous films to come along regarding the adult film industry but usually come off a bit comical. Thanks to films like Boogie Nights they showed the darker side creating something a bit more interesting. The latest About Cherry tackles some of the same style subject matter but from a bit different perspective. Will it be able to deliver the needed emotion to make this work or will it take a more artsy route losing its edge? About Cherry follows a troubled girl who moves to San Francisco and gets involved in the porn industry and a cocaineaddicted lawyer. This film is pretty much along the same lines as Boogie Nights but doesn't have its charm or star power. The performances here are well done but the film just seemed to limp along at a slow pace. At times it was hard to figure out what this film wanted you to get out of it other than just sadness. This slow decent of this young woman is an interesting concept for the film to work from but the lack of emotion throughout just left it a bit stale. Nobody was bad in this film they just seemed to not be giving it their all to deliver any of the drama you really care about. Most of this issue seemed to be more due to bad dialogue than bad acting. Kudos go out to the cast and crew for taking the chance to deliver an proactive movie and going towards that extra mile to deliver but there was just numerous missed chances here.Even with the addition of great actors Heather Graham James Franco and Dev Patel this movie just can't handle delivering what it set out to do. With this type of film it will affect everyone different so make sure to head out and give it a shot. If it evokes some sort of response whether good or bad then in the end it was an effective film.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie is like a porno trying to have a story except with hardly much nudity if that makes any sense. The movie tries to show the spiraling down of a innocent girl who ends up joining the porno industry. The thing is there isn't any moments that shock or hits the gut or psychologically show the desires of men and women. The movie Bad Guy by Kiduk Kim or even the movie Compliance which I seen had more of a shock factor. And the build up makes the audiences care for those movie or at least get their attentions. This one I could barely sit through and was bored with the superficial and fake characters who I can't see how anyone can have sympathy for them. Maybe I am just being a bit cold but no one is likable in this movie. It's just really shallow people doing really shallow stuff. Maybe it's trying to show the selfish and messed up side of humanity but it did a pretty plastic job of that as well. The message seems to be in this flick is if your bored with your life or not satisfied become a porn star kinda deal. The makers of this flick thought the main payoff is to show Ashley Hinshaw topless and it's still not worth sitting through this atrocious movie. James Franco is also in this and I don't know why he even bothered. I doubt he needed the paycheck so much to the point he had no choice but to be in this flick. In fact him being in this is probably the main reason the studio decided to greenlit this movie. And the fact that it has Ashley Hinshaw topless.310".

	schema:reviewBody "I was struck by the refreshingly matter of fact approach to the adult industry. It wasn't judgmental or some sort of cautionary tale just a tale about characters who work in the field. The portrayal was albeit a somewhat sanitized one but then again most films treat industries that way. No doubt cowriting the film with Lorelei Lee an active porn actress had a strong affect on the tone toward an industry that puritan moralists abhor.What struck me was that I didn't really find any point to the film. There were no lessons learned no insights gained or epiphanies discovered by any of the characters. Angelica was not a weak character made strong or a confused individual finding clarity. The subplots were underdeveloped and often abandoned without any real resolution. Even the implication of stepfather abuse was shown on screen but then abandoned. Why resurrect her alcoholic mother later in the film when it was superfluous? What exactly was her relationship with Andrew? We are led to believe he might be gay and then ultimately he isn't? That struck me as quite unrealistic. Strong attractions are often acted upon in close quarters. A scene with him feeling her up in her sleep would be more telling and realistic than spending 10 minutes of screen time on her mother and sister.I am not sure what the purpose of the Francis character was? No romantic relationship was really developed likely due to too little available screen time so when he dropped the judgment bomb on Angelica it sounded very hollow and without grounds. Probably due to the fact that very little screen time was given to develop the two and so no real loss was empathetically felt by the viewer.I could go on but what I truly see here is that there were two films crammed into one. There was so much material that could and should have been developed into two projects.Things like 1. The evolution of Andrew's relationship with Angelica as a Porn star. 2. Angelica's falling into the relationship patterns of her mother 3. Margaret's relationship issues stemming from attraction to a porn starlet she works with. 4. Angelica sorting out her sexuality as a result of her work activities in the porn industry. 5. Angelica's relationship with her alcoholic mother and the sister she left behind.Any couple or perhaps three of these plot lines would have made for a compelling story in itself. To Shoe horn all of this into one film is simply too much it would be too much for Chris Nolan who successfully pulled off Inception!I didn't hate this film I was mostly disappointed by it. Like a parent being disappointed in an underachieving child.The performances were excellent but the story was too dense and ambitious for a single film.I look forward to more of Lorelei Lee's collaborations. She has an insight that should be mined.A good film that could have been greater.".

	schema:headline " Cop out";
	schema:reviewBody "This film had every opportunity to make a fair commentary about sex work being legitimate work. But instead opted for the softball ending. The third act was utterly disappointing in how unbelievably compromised it was. From Franco's drug addled boyfriend character turning to denigrate Cherry to the total lack of consequence surrounding Margaret's relationship ending and her just simply replacing her former longterm live in girlfriend with Cherry.

Not in the sense that it doesn't portray the sex industry correctly I'm not qualified to make a judgment but in the sense that many of the events that occur and the reasons that drive our protagonist into the porn industry are not hard hitting enough. For instance at the start we see Cherry with her boyfriend who compliments her beauty and suggests she takes professional pictures so everyone can see her 'beauty'. This scene ignites her willingness later to enter the porn industry. I think the movie would have been better if they added a bit more darkness into the movie. I get that this film aims to challenge our perception of working girls by showing us not all female sex workers are manipulated or forced into the porn industry against their will. But there was room for the film to delve more deeper into the psychological social or environmental issues that may have influenced her decision or motivated any of the other 1 dimensional characters in the movie. As opposed to watching her hanging out in a stripclub touching herself up in front of a camera hooking up with a wealthy drug addict dumping her best friend shacking up with a lesbian colleague and ending up the other side of the camera. The End. That is not a movie that's 102mins out of our lives that we will NEVER get back! In a nutshell this is a movie about how a young women sleeps her way to the top by becoming a Lesbian.Massive disappointment!".

That the story is so good that it can play catchup or compliment movies like A.I. another one of Kubrick's unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 710 but I'm upping my vote to 810 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. note of course scifi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie.. and there is some noticeable reuse of Conan in there but all composers even the great John Williams seem to reuse in part some of their stuff".

That movie scores higher on IMDb than this movie does and that is a down right shame because I would give TN a 1 out of 10 or 4 out of 10 if I were being more fair but I would give THIS move Cherry 2000 a 7 out of 10 at least. What does this all prove? That movie ratings can sometimes be misleading. That someone can tell you a movie is awful and you would find that same movie great and vice versa. So what this ultimately means then is that you have to watch this movie yourself and come to your own conclusion. As for myself I was pleasantly surprised.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a really hardcore scififantasy fan so of course I did really enjoy Cherry 2000. David Andrews and Melanie Griffith had great chemistry together and this preData android Cherry 2000 albeit an intelligent sex toy gave the plot an amusing and very human twist. Basically when Sam Treadwell's Andrews robotic playmatebestonly female friend 'dies' he desperately needs a replacement. An exact replacement. He braves the wilds out in the desert to reclaim his lost love. How will he find his dream girl? Spoiler! By finding another one! Sam hires a Tracker Edith Johnson also known as E.. E is a sexy capable hard woman Griffith. Although E is the antithesis of everything Sam held dear he finds love eventually....just not in the arms he expected. A classic love story with a futuristic twist this isn't exactly fodder for an academy award however the acting was decent the story was well written and overall the experience stays with you. These are pretty much the things I look out for when I'm rating a movie. Since most of the story is set a world very reminiscent of Mad Max and Waterworld fans of the postapocalyptic type of fantasy should really enjoy this movie. Heck give it a chance. I'd rate it as being about 2 points above Waterworld on a scale of 110. The effects were remarkably good for it's time. Not much if anything actually.... was fake or CG'ed. Even though the story is set in 2007 most people I know are able to make the leap to suspend their disbelief and enjoy this ride. Give this one a try if you like scifi!Fans of less subtle movies true dramas regular romances will probably dislike this movie. Either they won't get the subtle jabs at society and the human condition or they won't enjoy the setting. Overly analytical philosophical types probably won't enjoy this film either. It does take a long time to get the main point across.".

E is a sexy capable hard woman Griffith. Although E is the antithesis of everything Sam held dear he finds love eventually....just not in the arms he expected. A classic love story with a futuristic twist this isn't exactly fodder for an academy award however the acting was decent the story was well written and overall the experience stays with you. These are pretty much the things I look out for when I'm rating a movie. Since most of the story is set a world very reminiscent of Mad Max and Waterworld fans of the postapocalyptic type of fantasy should really enjoy this movie. Heck give it a chance. I'd rate it as being about 2 points above Waterworld on a scale of 110. The effects were remarkably good for it's time. Not much if anything actually.... was fake or CG'ed. Even though the story is set in 2007 most people I know are able to make the leap to suspend their disbelief and enjoy this ride. Give this one a try if you like scifi!Fans of less subtle movies true dramas regular romances will probably dislike this movie. Either they won't get the subtle jabs at society and the human condition or they won't enjoy the setting. Overly analytical philosophical types probably won't enjoy this film either. It does take a long time to get the main point across.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Cherry 2000 I saw it on the Los Angeles area Z Channel and if I remember correctly when they showed this film it was not scheduled for theatrical release. I think they were showing movies of Melanie Griffith because Working Girl had become so popular at the time and they were showing what a range this actress had from actionadventure to abused secretary. And Melanie Griffith does have that range.Cherry 2000 didn't look finished when I saw it but what I loved about ti was it's story. I've all but forgotten about it until recently when one of the premiere movie channels showed it. In looking at it now it could easily be renamed The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County  this film was really perceptive for 1987  and it's only 20 years later! There is a running joke in the film that makes me review Cherry 2000 this way  back then I didn't catch it. Today it's really funny.The joke They ask the man looking to replace his robot where is he from? He replies Anaheim. That's in Orange County. Why is it a joke? Well...Cherry 2000 was a female robot that was made as a companion for men. She was blonde pretty perfect breasts perfect hips very attentive to her man had an A.I. chip of all the right things to say all the right things to do.Cherry 2000 was perfect for coming home to when he had such a long day at work. This man was used to his Cherry 2000 and his A.I. Cherry 2000 program that was programmed to look sound and do whatever he wanted. Unfortunately Cherry 2000 short circuited and he needed to get a new one. In trying to replace his Cherry 2000 he found that it was obsolete. The body but not the chip. Newer models of female robots were available but he was really into his Cherry 2000 Another running joke is the line Ah yes a Cherry 2000! Great hip action! so it was suggested that there might be a Cherry 2000 model out in the wastelands of robots. He could take his pre programmed chip and insert it into one of those Cherry's. Only way to get there was to find a 'tracker' to take him in to the Wasteland and get one.The only sane and semihonest tracker he could find was a woman  gasp  a real woman Played by Melanie Griffith. Melanie was skilled tough and also...feminine. So this man had to go into dangerous robotic wasteland territory with a real flesh and blood woman to find a Cherry 2000 robot that he thought was the only woman that could make him happy.As I pointed out the story was a good story the acting was fine the production and post production values were light which took away from a lot for me as I watched it. It was kinda on the Mad Max level of production but for this story it needed more production values to succeed.It is a cautionary tale  and it looks as though it was perceptive. We are there especially in Orange County with the prefabricated programmed woman. This is not a Stepford Wife per ce. But it is an ideal and a manipulation of what some men think a woman should be say and do all by the flick of a control  easy to control as flipping on a light switch. That is until  you reinsert yourself among real humans real women non altered flesh and blood and find out what you're really missing which our male does.A funny nice lowkey production cautionary tale action love story film.".

It's no wonder then that our protagonist Sam prefers to stay at home with his sexbot a vintage Cherry 2000 model who is essentially a traditional subservient housewife. Unfortunately during a frothy romp in front of the dishwasher his Cherry malfunctions leaving him no alternative but to hire a guide to take him to the dangerous zone to find a replacement model at the robot junkyard. This guide turns out to be a spunky independent woman played by Melanie Griffith! and...you can probably guess the rest but that doesn't mean it isn't fun getting there. While it's true that several plot points wouldn't hold up under close scrutiny this is a B movie so that sort of adds to the charm. No real complaints here and it was interesting seeing Griffith in that role.".

The film has no objectionable material and leaves you with a nice feeling. There are animated films or animatedreal life combinations like this that advertise familyfriendly viewing but don't really deliver instead sneaking in sexual innuendos and the like.Not here. This one is pure moralswise except for one scene near the end when the mom Geena Davis tells Stuart and their son she's still proud of them even though they just got caught in a big lie. Inferring that the lie was okay since everything turned out okay. Other than that nothing but good messages were heard and seen all around and this is a funny movie to boot.

I thought those kinds of films only existed with the name Pixar stamped on them or the occasional Dreamworks. The film largely compiles odds and ends from the first film to try and lift the sequel off its feet but its sweet goodnatured charisma and kinetic warmth make the seventyeight minute endeavor worth it.The Little family are still happy vibrant and warm in their quest to give their new mouse sibling Stuart voiced by Michael J. Fox a home he can be proud of. Yet the mother Geena Davis still worries that Stuart's small stature gives him the unfair advantage in sports and life itself while the father Hugh Laurie is more of an optimist and feels that if a Little applies himself he can be quite the character.The main themes Stuart Little 2 tries to explore however are not about doing anything you want to do and proving that being small isn't a limitation but a welcomed challenge like the first film but more about siblings that drift away from each other. Stuart's older brother George Jonathan Lipnicki is beginning to spend more time with his friends rather than Stuart and while this is a natural part of life it is nonetheless heartbreaking to the mouse himself who begins to view himself as just a pest no pun intended.Stuart begins to befriend a small yellow canary named Margalo Melanie Griffith who he rescued after seeing her being pursued by an ominous falcon in the sky. It turns out Margalo is in cahoots with the falcon to steal valuables from homes all across New York City but little Margalo keeps that secret away from Stuart when she discovers how kind and gentle he really is.Stuart Little 2 isn't particularly compelling or a very lifeaffirming film but it's a genial warm picture with great computer effects wonderful yet subtle themes on sibling relationships and a plethora of jokes that kids and adults will find pleasing and joyful.Starring Geena Davis Hugh Laurie and Jonathan Lipnicki.

	schema:reviewBody "As of present May 2010 I have never read the E.B. White classic Stuart Little however I have had the delightful privilege to see the two films based loosely upon its content. The first Stuart Little released in 1999 was a very sweet and charming little family picture that I enjoyed immensely as a kid and still do to this day. I remember I also enjoyed the sequel Stuart Little 2 when I was younger but now having rewatched the film for the first time in a long time I discover that a rare instance has occurred I enjoy the movie more now as an adult than I did when I was eleven. Perhaps it's because I now understand the adult humor and Snowbell's hilarious lines better but overall Stuart Little 2 is a very good picture.In the sequel Stuart Little voiced by Michael J. Fox now has a quintessential relationship to his family. His human brother George has accepted him as a sibling and the cat Snowbell is now his pal instead of his enemy. However poor Stuart feels a little leftout in the world because of his small size and his lack of real friends. That is until a little bird named Margolo voiced by Melanie Griffith literally drops into his life from the sky pursued by a vicious falcon. When they are clear of the evil bird's talons Stuart and Margolo develop a very strong very heartwarming friendship while teaching to the younger audience members very important lessons about life and friendship.Those messages were communicated to be very well when I was younger and they still are today. I'm not exactly sure why I like Stuart Little 2 more as an adult than I did as a kid but maybe it's because I can understand the full extent of it. The filmmakers made the right choice to film it as a family picture incorporating elements that children can understand but leaving in great moments of comedy to keep the adults interested. More so than in the first one the picture is kept upbeat by the hilarious presence of Snowbell the cat voiced by Nathan Lane who has one terrific oneliner after another. A favorite moment of mine is when Snowbell is serving as a tool so Stuart can speak into a payphone. Their time runs out and he asks Snowbell for more change. The cat looks at the mouse standing on his head and cackles out What do I look like? A fanny pack? Stuart Little 2 is a real treat to look at with some gorgeous cinematography and a deliberately overpainted New York City with everybody in the movie wearing extravagant outfits. The special effects used for Stuart Margolo Snowbell the falcon and the other animated characters in the film is very good best exemplified by the eyes of Stuart and Margolo. Their eyes are solid black with no visible pupils but the animators carefully manipulate the characters' expressions to mirror every emotion that could be asked for from a reallife performer.Perhaps the best element of Stuart Little 2 is the change of pointofview from the first one. In the original film most of the plot involved the Littles' difficulties in adopting a talking mouse as a child and a great portion of the film was people looking down upon little Stuart. Here the story takes place on Stuart's level from his pointofview and we come to associate and identify more with him this time around. I also really like Hugh Laurie Geena Davis and Jonathan Lipnicki as Stuart's adoptive family who do a really good job at maintaining the illusion that they are communicating to a twoinch mouse adopted as their son and treating him with loving affection.But the best scenes are the scenes of Margolo and Stuart particularly a little scene where they are on a date at a makeshift drivein movie theater sitting in Stuart's model car in front of a television watching Alfred Hitchcock's marvelous 1958 film Vertigo which we later learn is a poignant choice as there are some parallels in the relationship between Stuart and his avian companion.Stuart Little 2 is a wonderful family film. Some may question my judgment and wonder if I exaggerate just a little in shelling out my highest rating for this film. You may ask maybe it's good but is it that good? Well maybe not on some critical scales. But the way I review movies dissecting and analyzing but more or less reporting how I personally responded than no not in the least. I enjoyed Stuart Little 2 so much every little second of it was a gem for me and I more than enthusiastically award it ten stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "While less isn't always more the makers of Stuart Little 2 resisted the temptation to pad it out from its shorthand running time meaning it goes by quickly and painlessly. Not that the actual plot of this followup to the original charmer is hard to take in itself Stuart is starting to feel a bit left out and when Margalo the wren literally drops into his life he gets a new dimension.In terms of technical levels it's only slightly easier to fault Margalo looks a bit too cartoonish to be real unlike Stuart Little himself and the falcon that's the movie's villain  but then again Melanie Griffith the voice of Margalo always seems like a cartoon anyway but the story by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and the movie's producer Douglas Wick is what makes this ultimately inferior to its predecessor what helped drive Stuart Little was our hero's wish to be accepted by his human brother and by the cat  sneer all you want but the family message was hard to ignore. For the sequel it's more standard  the friend who's acting out of ulterior motives at first but then turns out to be a real friend etc. Stuart isn't so much the protagonist this time and it hurts a little.So the freshness is reduced but this still isn't stale  the charm and humour of the first movie remains Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell This better be important. Margalo is missing. I'd better be more specific  I meant important to ME. and the human Littles remain just right  loving but not without making you want to slit your own throats. HBO Family has recently aired an animated version with all the principals except Hugh Laurie absent  it'll have to go a long way to live up to the two movies. Injoke for score fans Alan Silvestri slips in a quote from his Back to the Future theme in the climax.But I can see why this didn't do as well at the boxoffice as it should have  having a soccer match plus including Gilbert O'Sullivan AND Celine Dion on the soundtrack was asking for trouble...".

Not that the actual plot of this followup to the original charmer is hard to take in itself Stuart is starting to feel a bit left out and when Margalo the wren literally drops into his life he gets a new dimension.In terms of technical levels it's only slightly easier to fault Margalo looks a bit too cartoonish to be real unlike Stuart Little himself and the falcon that's the movie's villain  but then again Melanie Griffith the voice of Margalo always seems like a cartoon anyway but the story by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and the movie's producer Douglas Wick is what makes this ultimately inferior to its predecessor what helped drive Stuart Little was our hero's wish to be accepted by his human brother and by the cat  sneer all you want but the family message was hard to ignore. For the sequel it's more standard  the friend who's acting out of ulterior motives at first but then turns out to be a real friend etc. Stuart isn't so much the protagonist this time and it hurts a little.So the freshness is reduced but this still isn't stale  the charm and humour of the first movie remains Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell This better be important. Margalo is missing. I'd better be more specific  I meant important to ME. and the human Littles remain just right  loving but not without making you want to slit your own throats. HBO Family has recently aired an animated version with all the principals except Hugh Laurie absent  it'll have to go a long way to live up to the two movies. Injoke for score fans Alan Silvestri slips in a quote from his Back to the Future theme in the climax.But I can see why this didn't do as well at the boxoffice as it should have  having a soccer match plus including Gilbert O'Sullivan AND Celine Dion on the soundtrack was asking for trouble...";

Also the plot is too predictable although that probably won't matter much to children who are after all the film's target audience.These are really minor quibbles though.  Stuart 2 is a fine movie both for kids and adults.  The special effects are welldone all the actors do a good job in their roles and the dialogue has some real gems.  Particularly noteworthy is Snowbell the cat voiced to hilarious perfection by Nathan Lane.  He gets all the best lines and steals every scene he's inhe even upstages Stuart himself!

Every moment between Margalo the bird and Stuart is sweet and charming and especially the moments with the real characters are sometimes very funny. Another nice thing is the creation of the mouse and bird itself. Since Stuart or Margalo is in almost every scene in the movie there is always something nice to look at.

Flashbacks from the first film reminded me that first we saw Stuart was in an orphanage  and that's that and all Mrs. Keeper mentioned about Stuart's parents was that they were smashed by falling cans which in certain aspects raised me a flag about this little mouse There's more to this character... WAY more. Then questions started flooding into my head Who exactly is Stuart? What's his history? Who WAS Stuart? Where and when's he from? How come his mouseform able to speak languages that is understandable to humans? Was he once a humanlike creature then somehow got turned or reincarnated into a mousehopefully reincarnation? If so what happened and who is or was his biological parents? If his reincarnation into a mouse grant the mouse power to communicate with humans then what's his heritage? Stuart sailed beautifully in the first film and here he flies like an ace combat pilot  did he carry those on from his previous life? Stuart and Margalo hit it off pretty fast  like old flames was there past connection rekindled and Margalo was actually his girlfriend or fiance from his previous life? Were there stories to that previous life? What happened? What happens next? ...A lot of these questions overwhelmed my thoughts and I rarely see that happen even in these days' bigbudget filmsnot even Avengers movies can spark that kind of inspiration so believe me when I say I wanted to give a ten for this film. Though sadly the ending's pretty harsh Even when they are pretty much in love the canary's still restricted by her migrant habit to the south or else she'll freeze to death in winter. Really wish they had not been that hasty to cut off this movie that soon turning it into a highlevel scifi fantasy romantic drama might even explain a lot of things. Master White wrote the original script but he didn't made preparations to my questions should they arise... and now that he's gone those questions became exploitable loopholes don't they? Maybe instead of all the pointless Disney remakes that could potentially ruin the onceclassic tales they could spare some efforts to make Stuart Little great again?

She lands in Stuart's miniature car to escape a falcon but the real story is that she is a thief under threat by this falcon. She is forced to steal Mrs. Little's wedding ring. She disappears and Stuart is determined to locate her and face the falcon. Directed by Rob Minkoff who made the horrible first film as well as the Disney masterpiece The Lion King. Michael J. Fox voices Stuart the mouse determined not to be outdone by his small stature and face odds larger than life. Melanie Griffith voices the soul searching Margalo who discovers friendship and a life outside crime and oppression. Nathan Lane steals scenes voicing Snellbell the fluffy cat with an appetite for food but shies away from danger. Strong themes for families regarding making a difference regardless of one's size.

Like the original this is another great family film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and not just the young kids it's targeted at. The sequel does everything just as well if not better than the first film.I'm surprised at how poorly 'Stuart Little 2' was received not only with the ratings on IMDb but it also didn't do well at the boxoffice. Considering the sequel has more adventure and in general more fun than the original I don't see why so many people seemingly didn't like it. I always thought the 'Stuart Little' films were impossible not to like!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the trailer in 2002 but I didn't see the whole film until some time later. I saw the last third of it on 25th March 2007. Stuart Little 2 contributed to an adventurous evening. It follows on from the first film very nicely and the characters and animation are brilliant. Stuart is cute and Margalo is sweet.Throughout the film I experienced that feeling of bonding with the characters and feeling like I was actually there with them. I was also interested to learn the meaning of the silver lining. Falcon is a great villain and the sequence at the park is really fun to watch. Stuart fixes George's broken plane saves Margalo and flies through the park with Margalo at his side. Falcon gives chase but loses them while the Little family follow them in a taxi. Stuart using Mrs. Little's ring to reflect the sunlight at Falcon is a clever idea  as is using a handkerchief as a parachute! The kamikaze attack works and Falcon falls out of the sky and into a garbage can Monty is scavenging in.One scene I love is when Margalo and Stuart embrace each other. It's in the music video as well. That moment warms the love in my heart. Marcelo bids the Little family farewell and leaves with the other birds to migrate South. Stuart says the silver lining is that Margalo will be back in the Spring. The Sunset over New York is beautiful  as is the song I'm Alive by Celine Dion. No family should be without this adventurous adventure!".

	schema:headline " Stuart is the most adorable mouse ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Stuart Little 2 on television and even though I've seen it before I have to say it was great. This film in my opinion took a steady improvement from the prequel. There's more action excitement and wonder to it which is fantastic! The characters were all brilliant. Stuart and the bird are so adorable! Snowball the cat well from wanting to eat Stuart in the 1st movie to being best friends in this sequel I have to say it's all good. Also I think the chemistry between them is really sweet because they embark on the adventure together with no one else but them and there's a lot of friendship going on. Also it's great to see that Snowball always has Stuart's back like when the other cat in the restaurant wanted to eat him he just stuck up for him.Stuart's personality has widened. He's not only the sweet and adorable mouse but in this movie it shows his heroic instincts. This mainly approaches at the end of the movie where refixes his old aeroplane and flies around New York to stop the Falcon and save Margalo. Which purifies his bravery and cleverness.In terms of animationwise it was good. Stuart and the bird looked believably realistic. However my only negative point is The Falcon who could have looked more inthisworld it looked so computeranimated that it somewhat gave away it's evil instincts.Like I said this sequel took a good improvement from the prequel. In this movie there's a lot more plot and excitement to it which scores on the fun factor. Stuart embarks on a mission to save his bird friend Margalo meeting adventure along the way I mean that's the sort of genre that keeps me on the edge of my seat.Overall I would love to watch this movie again. It is simply a wonderful family film. To be honest I think this film classifies as my Top Ten favourite Family films! Why? Because it's fun charming and enjoyable. Definitely recommend.".

Snowbell the cat was probably supposed to be the comic relief amidst all the sentimental mayhem but was a massive failure. The falcon just went into the same category as the friendly undersized budgie shotgun fodder. I felt sorry for my little brother who had to go through this rather unenjoyable pastiche. Things I learned from this movie Falcons are nasty vicious bloodthirsty pickpockets cats are afraid of having their house burgled by strange undersized budgies Sentimentality in films is like syrup.

So when the second came out I wanted to see it because I just knew it would be just as funny and cute as the first one.LIE!!!!!This is by far one of the stupidest movies I have seen in a long time. And I like kids movies too. But the plot did not make any senseFirst of all WHY and WHAT would a falcon want with a stupid diamond ring? Falcons aren't greedy and they don't need the money. That just doesn't make any sense to me.Second of all WHY and WHAT would a mouse be doing in a SOCCER FIELD? And NO WAY would a mouse ever survive that. I know it's a kids movie but even kids movies have to make SOME sense!Third of all I HATED how everything in the Little family was all goodygoody nothing can ever go wrong here. That was NAUSEATING!The jokes were okay too. Except the one where Stuart says I should start wearing a cup. What was the point of that? It wasn't funny not to mention that it's gross!On the positive side I liked the idea of Stuart helping a canary. I like how it teaches kids to befriend and help anyone no matter how different they are. I also like the idea of how Stuart Snowbell and the kid I forget his name all work as a team to save Margelo. The cats were funny too.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSI kinda like the opening song Put a Little Love in Your Heart by Mary Mary. It's a cute song and it went well with the movie.So overall I only recommend this movie to parent that have REALLY small children. That way they'll be too young to realize that absolutely nothing in this movie makes any sense! Jessie".

It wasn't funny not to mention that it's gross!On the positive side I liked the idea of Stuart helping a canary. I like how it teaches kids to befriend and help anyone no matter how different they are. I also like the idea of how Stuart Snowbell and the kid I forget his name all work as a team to save Margelo. The cats were funny too.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSI kinda like the opening song Put a Little Love in Your Heart by Mary Mary. It's a cute song and it went well with the movie.So overall I only recommend this movie to parent that have REALLY small children. That way they'll be too young to realize that absolutely nothing in this movie makes any sense! Jessie";

While the movie is very intense it is not unbelievingly depressing primarily due to Damian Lewis' outstanding performance as Keane. He befriends a single mom and her 7 year old daughter and those scenes manage to convey a mix of sadness humanity and foreboding as we see Keane struggling with his inner demons. Most Hollywood actors would give a scenerychewing performance of grief and madness  but Lewis gives a searing contained portrayal. He shows us this man's humanity but does not flinch from also exposing his flaws including drug abuse and physical violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Keane is a searing portrayal of mental illness. Dominated by an intense tour de force performance by Damian Lewis of the titular character on screen in closeups for the entire film writerdirector Lodge H. Kerrigan throws us into Keanes disturbed mind set from the get go as we have to continually judge for ourselves what is his grip on reality. His struggles with what may or may not be paranoid schizophrenia or a breakdown triggered by guilt are conveyed Dogme style with no A Beautiful Mind tricks. Through his mutterings and movements we see the world from his tormented perspective as he painfully relives what is either a trauma or a delusion and ache with him as he selfmedicates with booze and drugs. We alarmingly get to understand his mind even as we fear for his safety and others around him particularly each time he drinks a beer.Lewis uses his leading man good looks even disheveled to show how manipulative and disarming a person with a fractured mind can be. We can viscerally feel his efforts to control his thoughts and behave responsibly when the stakes are very high. He uncannily captures the look of disturbed men seen unfortunately frequently on the streets of New York I was punched by one once after he stared at me fixedly in a store and who are brought to public attention openly after a subway platform pushing or inexplicable knife attack.The ambient sound design brilliantly captures Keanes highly stimulated perceptions and keeps us at the edge of our seats in agony as to what sound or sight could set him off. The ambient song selections are beautifully selected to heighten his emotions including the 4 Tops' I Can't Help Myself. The people who briefly interact with Keane are excellent character actors who create whole almost as damaged individuals with just a few lines particularly Tina Holmes as a coke head and Amy Ryan as a single mom with significant problems. Abigail Breslin is one of the sweetest children on screen in a long time and her projection of trustingness adds to the poignancy of her scenes with Lewis that have the audience holding their collective breaths for their unpredictability.The film makes excellent use of realistic locations in New York and New Jersey with a gritty very urbansensitive cinematography. The credits include thanks to Fountain House and Project Return which work to help the mentally ill fit into society. I wish more hopeful information on what is being done were added. Keane is a profound example of the moving simplicity of the storyteller's art revealed by brilliant acting through characters that portray the human spirit.".

Unfortunately I can understand the isolation paranoia and desperation that William Keane expresses in this movie. And it expressed with an alarming verisimilitude.Despite my first comment that 'Keane' is a film without artifice there are elements to the structure and editing that show the directorwriter had made extremely subtle uses of film technique to compress heighten and intensify William Keane's psychological character. Finally I must add that this film is an emotionally rewarding experience providing a denouement that is cleansing and healing  a 'happy ending' that smacks of real life not the strange and manipulative world of formula film making.

Right from the start you see the agony of William Keane Damian Lewis as he searches for his missing daughter and you can't help but feel like your in his situation his emotions leap off the screen and come right at you. Then you start to see how tortured he is especially when you learn he's suffering from schizophrenia and he's basically self medicating himself. This film is worth your time and has a good cast. Damian Lewis should get most of the credit he's performance is Oscar worthy. He was his character not an actor playing a mentally unstable man.

Unfortunately in Europe we don't get to see many Indymovies but this was a rare opportunity for me to see an excellent one. It's the kind of movie that leaves a lump in your throat after wards! I was constantly wondering if this child that he lost at the busterminal was real or just a fragment of his imagination. Also when he takes care of another child while it's mother is gone for a few days you start wondering if Keane is not going to hurt or kidnap this child! Most of the movie you really feel for this guy. Especially because the camera is so close on him all the time. It feels as if you're actually following him wherever he goes.This movie looks very real no special effects no beautiful makeup or costumes. The acting is what acting is all about you don't see the actor but you see the character! It sometimes feels like your looking at a documentary. Real Oscar stuff! Keane is the kind of movie that touches you even long after you have left the theater!".

I was constantly wondering if this child that he lost at the busterminal was real or just a fragment of his imagination. Also when he takes care of another child while it's mother is gone for a few days you start wondering if Keane is not going to hurt or kidnap this child! Most of the movie you really feel for this guy. Especially because the camera is so close on him all the time. It feels as if you're actually following him wherever he goes.This movie looks very real no special effects no beautiful makeup or costumes. The acting is what acting is all about you don't see the actor but you see the character! It sometimes feels like your looking at a documentary. Real Oscar stuff! Keane is the kind of movie that touches you even long after you have left the theater!";

You really feel like your are with William Keane you can feel what he's thinking. Then the story will take an unexpected turn...see I told you it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This film is definitely thought provoking and sensitive to all facets of the human being. It's one of those films that you can see repeatedly and get something new from it each time.

From the start it is clear that his daughter went missing sometime ago and the film gathers a feeling of a man who was once sane being tortured by the abduction of his young daughter whilst in his care. The film follows his journey over several days to what appears to be the peak of his grief and pain to possibly the point at which his can begin to get his life back...I was lucky enough to see this film at the London Film Festival where Lodge Kerrigan and Damien Lewis where present and did a question and answer session after the film ended. The mental disorder issue and the issue of the truth of William Keane's lost daughter were eluded too. Lewis said he believed that the daughter did exist as it gives purpose and integrity to the character allowing a greater feeling for his situation. As writer and director Kerrigan made some comments about the film and why he wrote it saying that there is a lot of missunderstanding of mental disorders especially in the states and not enough sympathy or as much as there could be.The film feels very real and this is due to the live sets that are used and the whole film being shot with a handheld camera and all but a couple of scenes using natural lighting. It is real and it touches you as the credits began to role the cinema remained very quiet as I believe that the vast majority of the audience required sometime to take in what they had just seen. I challenge you to watch this film and feel nothing whether it be for the character of Keane or for the everyman on the street.".

There is no musical score the ending is abrupt you end up with more questions than you started with and you walk away feeling unsettled and not at all content. That's what makes the movie great. The silence and quiet adds to the intimacy and tension the lack of resolution leaves you lost in thought even days later. Soderbergh said that the movie was of primary interest to film makers and film critics. It is a character study so if you think what you are getting is another version of Flightplan you are in for a terrible disappointment or wonderful surprise depending on your tastes. 90 percent of the film simply follows Keane around on his daily routine. We see him eat lunch we see him look for a job we see him paying rent we see him trying to function normally. Then we see him trying to quiet those demons that make it impossible for him to function normally. The scenes between Keane and the little girl Kira are tense and heartbreaking. We see Keane lucid and clear for enough time to really understand the tragedy of this situation. A glimpse of who he could be or who he was and the contrast with who he is now is crushing. We feel his agony when no matter how he tries he can't keep up that lucidity 2 days in a row. We feel sad because even though we already knew it we know this little girl can't save him she can't help him. We know that if his missing daughter were to show up unharmed tomorrow he still wouldn't be okay. The biggest question seems to bewas the daughter real or is she a delusion? Not one person in the film suggests or offers clues to that answer. After thinking about it I say does it really matter? What matters is that William Keane believes she's real. Everything he does is based on that belief. The fact that he himself is not seen by people adds to his frustration.".

Almost nothing happens for 100 minutes nothing in the sense of plot development so it really is up to Lewis to make his troubles come alive. His problem is that his daughter disappeared when he was with her in a bus station and a year later he is still looking for her trying to recreated the events that surrounded the mystery.But what strikes the viewer is maybe impatience not with the narrative but with the presentation of it. The movie ends up being a recreation of the tortured mind the angst the regrets of this young father. And so the movie recreates that anxiety in the viewer. It seems impressive on some detached level but it doesn't quiet work. The shaky camera the constant striving and looking the endless lack of progress makes for unpleasant viewing. That doesn't mean it isn't interesting but it isn't enjoyable. Oddly enough many movies about terrible things manage to rise above their terribleness and the movie becomes moving or enlightening or simply aesthetic. Keane doesn't try to do any of those things.It would help if Lewis were able to create a more sympathetic type. You do want him to succeed but you also don't want to really spend an hour and a half with him like this. When a second character a young woman arrives halfway through it seems like a crack in the gloom but then she doesn't become a major character. Her daughter gradually does but only in a symbolic waywe never quite get to know or sympathize with the daughter directly.This is all more analysis than criticism really. But it's a heads up for people looking for a certain kind of emotional drama. A movie like Julie has a filmic richness that takes an even worse situation about a child and makes it gripping. Keane remains in the mind and emotional troubles of its main character and in Lewis's hands that's not really enough.".

Being a film director I'd just completed a short drama Open Secrets about mental illness so was keen to see how this subject would receive the big screen feature length treatment.I found the protagonist's acting first rate and was totally immersed in his realism. But I must admit I found the plodding narrative and sudden plot twists a bit strange. For instance he exhibited all the manic behaviour of a typical bipolar individual then as soon as he met the lady with the young girl in the hotel his behaviour became charming and sensitive. I've done a lot of research into mental illness for my short film and I know that mental patients on a 'high' do not become normal by simply switching their illness 'off'. Mental illness is not something that can be flicked on and off randomly by the individual concerned and yet here I found that to be the case here. The protagonist would became crazed with mania then suddenly in the next scene he would be contrite and mellow.Top marks to the filmmakers though for a brave attempt at a difficult topic though. The film looks beautiful with great cinematography and editing. I felt that the script was where it could have been improved upon. Perhaps the actor's performance was improvised in which case it was an excellent job but still lacked narrative clarity. After about half an hour of viewing the film I began to wonder whether I could last the entire length of the movie.As I mentioned I have mixed feelings about this film. On the one hand I didn't really enjoy the film as it has a weakish story but on the other hand the film is a landmark because there aren't many feature length dramas about mental illness and this one was pretty good in many respects. Overall I was glad to have seen the film on cable TV and not paid to see it in a cinema as I don't really think the film fully justifies paying a ticket price.".

	schema:headline " Tour de force from Lewis and Kerrigan";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw Clean Shaven about ten years ago and it has always stayed in my mind not least because it committed to celluloid one of the most toecurling scenes I have ever witnessed but because it managed to portray a man who is mentally broken. It did this in a most effective way. So much so that I have always kept an eye out for anything by Lodge Kerrigan since. Ten years later with two more filmsone destroyed under his belt the director has put together what on the surface seems an almost paper thin storyline but is in fact an intense and gripping film about a man coping with the loss of his daughter. Throughout Kerrigan puts the camera in Damien Lewis's face which builds up a claustrophobic atmosphere that does not let up at any point. There are some intensely powerful moments and these are unbearably moving. Kerrigan allows us to think that possibly William Keane has imagined the daughter although my own opinion is that she is real. Damien Lewis goes to a place that must have been very uncomfortable for him and manages to give us a glimpse into the life of a very damaged and haunted man.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw Clean Shaven about ten years ago and it has always stayed in my mind not least because it committed to celluloid one of the most toecurling scenes I have ever witnessed but because it managed to portray a man who is mentally broken. It did this in a most effective way. So much so that I have always kept an eye out for anything by Lodge Kerrigan since. Ten years later with two more filmsone destroyed under his belt the director has put together what on the surface seems an almost paper thin storyline but is in fact an intense and gripping film about a man coping with the loss of his daughter. Throughout Kerrigan puts the camera in Damien Lewis's face which builds up a claustrophobic atmosphere that does not let up at any point. There are some intensely powerful moments and these are unbearably moving. Kerrigan allows us to think that possibly William Keane has imagined the daughter although my own opinion is that she is real. Damien Lewis goes to a place that must have been very uncomfortable for him and manages to give us a glimpse into the life of a very damaged and haunted man.

Keane patrols the hustling bustling Port Authority Bus Terminal of New York City where he was with his daughter when he took his eyes off her for a brief moment only to lose her possibly forever. Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected or possibly triggered a panicky inner voice that speaks to him or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station a perfect metaphor for his situation replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination. He is met with disdain indifference or plainly ignored. Keane is in hell.Living on a disability check and residing in a New Jersey flophouse Keane manages to daily sojourn back and forth hoping for a glimmer of recognition is that her purple coat in the distance? that he lathers himself into a feverish foam of hope or worse fearful pessimism and finds himself getting a cheap drunk on in a bar trying in vein to listen to Sugar Pie Honey Bunch Can't Help Myself on the tinny jukebox to either assure him or drown out his inner rage unnervingly maddening having anonymous sex with a stranger in a throbbing club's restroom scoring cocaine to amp up his courage to go on staggering the street howling his daughter's name and sadly returning to his empty room to sleep a dreamless troubled sleep soothing himself between wracks of sobs of pity and horror.One day Keane sees a single mother and child Ryan and Breslin both excellent arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner. Lynn informs Keane that she and her adorable daughter are en route to Albany but are awaiting her husband's word that he has located a new suitable home for the family. Keane recognizes in himself what he used to be  a father to a young girl  and becomes a defacto member of this temporary family when Lynn asks him to watch over Kira and the results are heartbreaking.Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with CLEAN SHAVEN featuring a schizophrenic character actor Peter Greene best known as the racistrapist doomed Zed in PULP FICTION attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met. Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a tooclosefor comfort distance in which the handheld camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy  you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod and win but this independent film is small in scale and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh. Lewis who shined in HBO's miniseries BAND OF BROTHERS and was the best thing in DREAMCATCHER a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance. Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role talking to himself sudden outbursts of nearviolent rage crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing and possibly selfafflicted curse. We are never 100 certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs I recognized one gutwrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad shy Kira a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become. The words I love you have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human. Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me What do you think happens to him? proves to be the mark of a firstrate filmmaker. Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest forgiveness. Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.".

	schema:headline " You can't ignore Keane it is an important and very moving film";
	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I had the opportunity to experience Keane with some friends at the Landmark Century Cinema in Chicago. Keane is an extraordinary film created by a truly exceptional filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan. I had read many reviews and comments and thought that I was prepared for the intense story but I wasn't prepared to feel both assaulted and uplifted after seeing this movie. Keane is only 90 minutes long but it feels much longer because it creates a very high level of tension but it is a subtle constant tension not like a breakneck chase scene in an action film. The movie quickly invades your soul and then seduces you onto an emotional rollercoaster. The tension comes from the fact that it all seems very real and you cannot help but care and worry about the characters. After the movie I went into the washroom and I was shocked to see that my face neck and chest were all blotchy and red I've never experienced such a strong response from viewing a film before.What can I say that hasn't already been said more profoundly by others? Keane is a brilliant and unique film and it is without a doubt Damian Lewis's finest performance  and that is really saying something because he is a wonderful actor who is capable of conveying great feeling with his eyes and body and with a minimum of words and without overacting. The movie very realistically portrays poverty and mental illness and makes you feel great compassion for William Keane at the same time that you feel frightened and uncomfortable. You want to comfort William and pat him on the shoulder and say don't be frightened it will be alright and the next moment you want to avoid him and get away as fast as you can because he is scary and disturbing and you never know which William you will encounter next. And on top of all this you feel great fear and concern for Kira the very sweet and innocent child who becomes the focus of William's unpredictable attention and wonderfully portrayed by Abigail Breslin.The film's action covers only a few days and it very clearly portrays the hell that is this man's minutetominute existence with excruciating detail. William is basically a good person but he is driven to acts of selfdestruction and violence by his illness and the central tragedy that dominates his life  real or imaginary. Watching how hard it was for him just to deal with the minutiae of daily living was agonizing. When the film ended with incredible abruptness a man in the row in front of us let out a large gasp as though someone had just punched him. Very few people just got up and left many stayed all the way through the credits and there was no conversation as we exited the theater the silence was deafening  you could actually hear people thinking.In discussing the movie with my friends later it was clear that we had all been deeply affected in different ways and had varying thoughts about the film. For example one suggested that perhaps Keane had really kidnapped Kira and that the film was told backwards after losing her? Another an actor was very impressed by that fact that this very mature film was only the director's third movie and she was amazed by Damian Lewis's bravery in taking on such a complex role with such fearless selfless dedication. Still another was surprised at how natural and unscripted the movie seemed  as though we were really sharing this man's reality especially the scenes between Keane and the little girl. We were all worried about William and Kira and wondered what will happen to them as if they were real people because they are  they represent many real people who live on the fringes of our society. It was clear that this movie will be with us all for a long time to come.I hope I am not giving the impression that Keane is a depressing film because it's not and it ends with the basically decent man that is William Keane triumphing over his illness  at least for the moment. You feel hope for William not despair. You want him to get well because he is a good person.When I was driving home out of the city I saw a dirty wildlooking street person begging for money at the side of the road. I have always been taught to avoid such people because they are dangerous and not to give them money because they will just spend it on drugs and alcohol  nothing that I saw in Keane disputed those beliefs but as I stopped to give the poor man some money it occurred to me that after experiencing this film I could no longer just ignore someone like him. If you have a chance to see Keane  do it it's really important.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Keane Damian Lewis is a man looking for the his missing daughter who he claims was abducted several months ago. In between searching for his missing daughter Sophie he befriends Lynn Bedik Amy Ryan and her daughter Kira Bedik Abigail Breslin. Keane becomes attached to Kira because his missing daughter Sophie would be the same age. Throughout the movie Keane struggles to keep his illness in check especially around little Kira. But he can only keep it up for so before it all comes out.I've read several reviews from critics and as well as other moviegoers both good and bad. I ended up watching the movie twice in one night. I was taken aback by the intimacy director Lodge Kerrigan had the camera constantly on William Keane Damian Lewis. It felt like you were shadowing Keane's nearly every move from either over his shoulders or as you stood next to him.Within the first 15 minutes you get the sense there's something wrong with Keane. He continues to go back to the Port Authority to hopefully find some clues as to the the whereabouts of his daughter. At some he talks to himself and convinces himself some random gentleman has something to do with his daughters abduction. He follows him and proceeds to knock him down and continues to throw punches at him while asking where his daughter is. As abruptly as he started his eventually pulled off the man and walks away talking to himself. It makes you wonder what's going to happen next? Things begin to change as he befriends Lynn and her daughter Kira. At one point Keane is asked to take care of Kira. There were some great scenes where we get to see him as a normal guy helping Kira with her homework and eating McDonald's.The scene I was really touched by was while Keane was telling Kira how to do better at Skeeball he began to feel what I call his demons begin to surface as he turns away from Kira. He begins shouting at no one in particular and at the same time he begins to struggle to keep them at bay. As Keane sits and deals with sadness Kira walks over and holds his hands in hers. I feel as if the roles of adult and child are switched as she is the one consoling him.This movie is easier to watch than it is for me to describe. There are so many emotions and feelings that are given and taken from you. Damian Lewis William Keane did an exceptional job of not overplaying a man struggling with this mental illness. I also think little Abigail Beslin Kira Bedik did an excellent job as being able to play the scenes so convincingly especially the Skeeball scene. Two thumbs up to director Lodge Kerrigan and the actors involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent film that microscopically examines the despair and emotional journey of a father who searches endlessly for a kidnapped daughter and clearly suffers from other psychiatric illness. KEANE is fine example of filmmaking with a low budget that brings to life this side of society we pass every day yet rarely interact with or want to acknowledge. Production values are consistent with the lean approach but one can gain much from the depth and range in Damian Lewis's performance of a mentally fragile and out of control man who finds it almost impossible to move beyond his obsessive approach of finding his daughter. It is not until a series of encounters with a single mother and her daughter give him some sense that there can be sanity in his world. The suspense element is subtle but engaging. Serious audiences of independent film will find some production and script flow flaws but overall an excellent compelling venture into a world most of society never experience. This film is heavy on story yet is a positive for the film as it allows the audience to form its own opinion of Keane and his life. Has much critical acclaim from highly regarded reviewers such as Manohla Dargis of The New York Times Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times The Village Voice's Dennis Lim and Time Out's Anthony Kaufman.".

I've seen movies that have been nominated for Academy awards that were less entertaining than this.

The novice in question is a NYC cabbie played by Stallone. So she brings him home with her to the country and has to turn him into a cowboy basically. It's a fish out of water story.

Of course Rhinestone is filled with the obvious stereotypical portrayals of rural residents.  However it is not rude or mean spirited to the populace located below the Mason Dixon line.  In a fashion the movie rather celebrates and embraces those individuals.  Believe me there are some memorable moments to this cinematic adventure.  Just give it a chance  spend 111 minutes laughing at Stallone and singing with Dolly.

I sat down expecting to laugh AT the movie not WITH it because on paper the idea of Sylvester Stallone learning to become a country singer so that Dolly Parton can win a bet with her sleazy manager sounds like a train wreck of Biblical proportions. But y'know what? In spite of myself I found myself chuckling at the screwball humor in RHINESTONE. Stallone is not exactly known for his comedic stylings but I have to give him credit he gave it the old college try in his role as a mumblemouthed NYC cabbie who tries hard to discover his inner redneck. Dolly Parton well she's Dolly Parton. She made quite a few movies in the late 70s and early 80s and though she may not be considered a great actress she's light funny and easy on the eyes as well. Some of the priceless moments include Sly's fringed sparkly stage wear which wouldn't have looked out of place in the Blue Oyster Bar of Police Academy fame Dolly punching out Tim Thomerson Jack Deth would be horrified at how easily she took him out! and Sly's race through the mean streets of 1984 Times Square on horseback to rescue Dolly from her manager's clutches. On the musical side well let's just say I doubt that the soundtrack album to RHINESTONE burned up the charts back in '84. Dolly can sing anything and make it sound good so Sly should be grateful that she joins him on stage in the big finale to salvage his performance and I use that term loosely. I doubt Sly Stallone looks back on this movie with much fondness but considering that I was expecting a total cheese fest I was pleasantly surprised by this fluffy '80s comedy. They really don't make'em like this anymore.".

So Dolly takes Sly back home to Tennesee and teaches him some country so he can sing right for the rhinestone crowd. Of course Sly is obviously a fish out of water and picked on by a few country bullies including Dolly's ex who isn't over her. If this sounds like you might like it you probably will.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can you say Oscar snubs? Think about the range here... Dolly Parton a friendly country singer? Sylvester Stallone a complete moron? I want awards all around! And that's just the acting. The story is also quite the ringer... Dolly Parton makes a bet that she can turn an illiterate marble mouthed Stallone into a country music sensation. Wait don't just run out to the video store and pick this little gem up I have much more to say. This might sound like sassy romantic comedy with sprinklings of musical bliss laced throughout but it's much more. Rhinestone is by far and away the funniest movie that I have ever had the privilege to lay eyes on. It's got it all ethnic stereotypes snappy one liners and Sly on a horse. It's a shame that I didn't really see that because I was in a Rhinestone induced fetal position for most of the latter parts of the film. When the film mercifully came to an end I was left with only one emotion Utter pity and sadness for Parton. Not for Stallone though. All I could muster for him was touch of anger and heapin' helpin' of disdain. But Dolly I like her. I don't know much about her music but she seems like a nice lady. The fact that she had to endure hours days and weeks of hearing that arm wrestling' grenade throwing mountain climbing Russian punching Judge Dredding Tango  Cashing embarrassment attempt to sing is a tribute to her apparently good nature. Somewhere at the end of this muddled disaster Sly wins over the crowd is obviously on his way to Nashville. Only problem is he sounds exactly the same as when he started! But now everyone thinks he's good...I guess the music business is more than I grasp. All that said it is hilarious. Sure you laugh AT it rather than WITH it. But who am I to judge? There is one scene in the movie that will make you laugh AND was intended to be funny that's the unfortunate wanna be singer who belts out The Day My Baby Died. The actor pulls it off and I have to admit the song is pretty funny. My only conclusion is that it's the lone part of the movie that Stallone had absolutely nothing to do with. Just a hunch.".

One wonders how she is able to breath in these tight outfits much less talk and sing. Richard Farnsworth plays old codgers pretty well. Sylvester steals the show playing a character so unlike anything he had played before or since in fact. Well the basic New YorkEast Coast type of guy seems to be a constant thing but to take him out of Tennessee and attempt to make him into a country singer? Unfortunately we see why his singing career never took off despite his attempts to sing funny he sounds like a drunk in a karaoke bar at 2am and moves like he trying to do halfremembered Mick Jagger stage routines.Funny movie though his yelling and screaming while playing the organ made me laugh even before the scene's real punchline was revealed.Recommended if you enjoy getting good looks at Dolly Parton's early 1980s figure and like seeing Stallone make fun of himself. Show this one movie with a selection of his early porn work and make the debacle complete.".

The first is when we meet Peck's character in the organ room  the second is the hilarious scene around the dinner table. I bust a gut watching that scene. So funny. One important thing I've learned in studying film is that there is a difference between a film you love  a great film. They can be one in the same as is the case with a film such as The Godfather Part II. This is an masterfully made film that I enjoyed. Or they can be separate. For instance I recognize that Slumdog Millionaire is a well made film I just didn't like it. I didn't connect with it. I didn't care what happened. And on the converse I recognize that Rhinestone isn't really that great a film but I really enjoyed it. I connected with the characters it made me laugh  I generally found pleasure in it. So I rate it 1010 for enjoyment.Love to Steven Peck".

Happily i was wrong this was hilarious.The story is well done and one that was entertaining. I was expecting to fall asleep during this film but i stayed awake the whole time and didn't yawn once. Sly looked well out of place in this picture but that was the whole idea and he does it brilliantly playing a New York Cabbie who don't know the first thing about country music. And when he sang during the first half of the movie it was in stitches. He was excruciatingly awfuland I was literally crying laughter. However when he did sing with the lovely Dolly Parton he was good. This film is kind of like Rocky meets Nashville with a great performance from everyone involved.Rhinestone is one of those gems of a movie that is a classic later on in it's years. This is Sly at his comedy besthe don't play it for laughs he is just himself so to speak. Forget Stop or my mom will shoot or Oscar this is Sly at his comedy best. he can do comedy and it shows right here.I dare you not to be tapping your foot by the end. This will go with my Good Sylvester Stallone films.".

The reality of the Stallone demographic as opposed to the Schwarznegger demographic for reasons I do not fully comprehend but the facts speak for themselves is that his fans do not get into his forays into comedy. This was proved again later in Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot uneven and trivial but amusing enough on its own terms and Oscar a marvelous fauxopera satire that was never properly appreciated.Back to Rhinestone  Ron Liebman is properly obnoxious in his role and Tim Thomerson makes an amusingenough villain. Stallone is every bit the fishoutofwater NYC cab driver who suddenly finds himself in country show biz. I found some of the one liners are HILARIOUS with most of the rest at least smiles  no annoyingly inappropriate which is more than I can say for the highly praised Sideways.If you can put aside undeservedly trashed reputations the Hollywood business section and ridiculously low IMDb ratings spend 100 minutes with Rhinestone. It will make you laugh.".

Especially you guys  watch this for Dolly Parton as Jake now what kind of lady's name is that anyway? Please don't give this a 1. This movie is like the West Side Story of the 1980s!

It sure is one of my favorites. Sylvester Stallone actually helped write this script and with Dolly Parton's magical voice singing all of her own songs this movie is easily one of the best of it's kind. Stallone shocked me with his albeit slight musical ability. It worked well in Dolly's songs and with the theme of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why do so many hate this film. It's a lovable filmIt's very entertaining very funny. It's good clean humor that you can let your kids watch. That scene where Sly attempts to play the song Devil with a blue dress on while shouting and yelling as he pounds on his organ...only to look through the window and discovers that he had just interrupted a funeral......that is one the funniest moments in movie history.I also loved the scene at the beginning of the movie when a new singer auditions for a job at Freddy's night club by singing a song he had written called The Day My Baby Died ...the songs starts out okayand even sounds like a good country song until midways through the song when the lyrics start telling a story of how his new bride died when she left him at the alter to go plow the fields and then her wedding dress got caught in the wheels of their John Deere tractor and dragged her down and ran over her... the song is hilarious......I recommend this movie  its good clean fun.some of the jokes in this film were inspired by real life events. Example When the singer at the beginning of the movie first enter on stage he is heckled by member of the audience. After being heckled the sing looks down at the heckler from the stage and says Hey Shut Up and then lifts up the microphone stand and bends it in half.... that scene was loosely inspired by a real life incident that took place in 1968 where a up and coming singing cowboy named Waylon Jennings was scheduled to play a music festival in New York City. Waylon was the only nonrock hippie era musician in the entire show. When Waylon got on stage he was heckled by a member of the audience who yelled Take your cowboy sh!t back to Nashville ... Waylon became outraged that this man was heckling him before he had even heard him play....so Waylon bent the microphone stand in half threw it down and then pointed at the heckler and threaten to get off stage and kick his a if he heard another peep out of him.  years later Waylon Jenning went on to become one of the most popular country  western singers ever.Other jokes in this film were also based on real life story accounts of various country music singers.".

I imagine that the various Italian American image organizations would have bridled at the thought since this character did for Italians in this country what Steppin Fechitt accomplished for black people. They should have put together a trailer for this film stating He has been compared to Shemp Howard Pinky Lee and Rags Raglan. When Dolly Parton takes the acting honors in a film that you appear in Sylvester then the Marlin Brando comparisons were probably premature. There are two types of really bad movies and it is really not fair to mix them together. Movies like Manos and the Roller Blade Seven are pure garbage and they were intended to be. The filmmakers had no money no talent and no discernible script or the ability to obtain oneto work with. They produced a piece of trash. It is inevitable like night follows day. The people who rent the tape or CD know it's junk. Their friends even tell them that it's miserable nonsense before they see it. They don't care. It's like sticking your tongue into a cavity. Your going to do it anyway you don't care if it hurts. That's what makes this type of bad movie much worse Somebiody was trying to make this good!! They had socalled Big Name High Profile talent a large budget to work with and I presume competent script writers and directors. Didn't anybody actually look at the rushes of this film or did Stallone's STAR power intimidate everybody.One look at he scene where Stallone is singing horribly and bobbing up and down in that Reservation Indian hat should have been enough to stop the whole project in its tracks.Lets start over. I think we can work up a new plot line where the rednecks push the city kid too far. They try to bath him and give him a short haircut. He escapes to his taxi and starts to run everybody over. He makes it to the singing engagement just in time to see Dolly get raped by her manager. He kills him and blows up the whole town. Richard Crenna is a country record promoter and he flies in from Nashville to extract Nick. A little similar to something else but it will work.

Bingo fish out of water meets My Fair Lady!Small problem.  Stabone despite all of the studio tricks in the world and songs written to limit his need to actually sing is absolutely the worst singer on earth.  And I imagine on the set because Stabone is Stabone nobody told him.  I'm guessing they said sounds great Sly!  And you're as good as Frank Stabone.When Stabone sings it sounds actually like he is gruffly saying Ruh Ruh Ruh into the microphone.  Then Dolly and her friends say Wow he's great! which seems unlikely.  The script is filled out with some incredibly lame jokes delivered by Stabone who in addition to not being a singer is also not a comedic actor.  There is also some sort of romance supposedly blooming between Stabone and Dolly which again seems somewhat unlikely because he is a young handsome inshape dude and she is some sort of weird hugebosomed southern anomaly possibly created in a laboratory.I would like to see this shown in midnight movies.  I believe it would draw great raucous crowds who would come back week after week.  After that perhaps a broadway adaptation in 10 years.".

Dolly may not be the greatest actress either but hell she CAN sing and I thought I couldn't stand country!and she's adorable in a way that even reminds me of Marilyn Monroe. Love it when she laughs too. Well and with support from actors such as Ron Leibman Razzie nominee? This guy is funny and appropriately slimyand Richard Farnsworth THE STRAIGHT STORY always a pleasure to watch. The singing? Well if ya like Dolly's singing there's plenty of it in this film. And Sly ain't that bad either. Not great but hey what you expect given the story. This is supposed to sound like this this ain't the biography of say Garth Brooks! I even liked the macho country singer singing about his girl ending up in pieces lol.I know this ain't the greatest comedy of all times this ain't a rave review and people especially critics like to make fun of Sly and Dolly.

What makes that performance notorious and infamous for all like me who witnessed it was that it was clearly meant to be the triumphant climax of the saga of a hardworking underdog hero in the style of Rocky. I can tell you that Rhinestone is to blame for a traumatic childhood memory. I was a teenager visiting my aged great uncle and aunt with several others in order to spend some precious family time. After dinner we started watching the video with reasonable hopes knowing that my Great Uncle Bob enjoys western music.

We readily see that Cheyenne Autumn is completely different from any other western movie and not only from the remainder of Ford's work.Compared with other western movies the main difference and innovation is that here any killed man is a REAL tragedy that exhaustion famine cold violence are REAL sufferings for the miserable people on the screen not just for the Cheyennes even for the whites. And all that is shown us by Ford ruthlessly uncompromisingly. The fact that the director stands for the Indians is not as much innovative as it seems.

The movie is split into two parts by a comic interlude the episode placed in Dodge City which is actually a farce. I think that Ford wanted to pay a homage and bid his personal farewell to the old silent westernmovies of the 1920s when his career started. The funny situations are deliberately over the top see the sensational licentious joke when Wyatt Earp Jimmy Stewart realizes that he actually had met the girl in Wichita... In any case a somewhat gloomy mood permeates even this comic part. The main characters are all aged greyhaired and seemingly lifeweary.

But it is tough for me to face John Ford's desperate vision. After all what I most like in the movie is to see once again Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr on horseback in their blue uniforms by the way why are they uncredited?.

	schema:headline " The bizarre Dodge City slapstick farce segment justified";
	schema:reviewBody "I think of this film primarily as Ford's last and best cavalry film which happens to center on the historical escape of the northern Cheyenne from their hated lethal Oklahoma reservation and attempt to make their way back to their homeland in the Yellowstone region. It rather follows the formula established in Fort Apache where we have a new commanding officer of a fortplayed by Fonda who sees it as his main responsibility to keep the local 'Indians' under control. He regards 'Indians' as inferior beings and underestimates their military prowess resulting in his Custerlike demise. In this film we actually have two such officers in Major Braden and Captain Wessels in different time frames. They lack Fonda's arrogance but nonetheless are determined to follow their superior's harsh orders in dealing with the renegade Cheyenne. In contrast Richard Widmark takes on John Wayne's role in Fort Apache as a very conflicted secondoften first in command trying to give the Cheyenne a break while maintaining his status as a cavalry officer. His Quaker girlfriend played by striking blond Carol Baker has run off with the Cheyenne. Being an Irish Catholic Ford identified with certain other often persecuted Christian sects such as the Mormons in Wagon Masters and the Quakers who had tried to get food for the Irish during their famine years.Many of the details of this historical incident are fictionalized. For example it's implied that the Cheyenne felt compelled to give themselves up at Ft. Robinson to avoid certain death from winter exposure and starvation. In fact one group successfully overwintered in the sparsely populated infertile Sand Hills region of Nebraska which had abundant game if not bison. It's not acknowledged that the Cheyenne did sometimes raid kill and rape settlers when they felt it necessary for their survival or as revenge for past massacres. Thus there was some justification for the panic among Europeans. It bothers me that filming obviously was done in Ford's favorite places on the Colorado Plateau which looks nothing like the prairie country that most of this historical trek took place in. On the other hand the Ft. Robinson massacre was relatively accurately portrayed. Of course Widmark's journey to Washington and the journey of the Secretary of Interior out to Montana are pure fiction if providing a promising resolution to the Cheyenne's problems.It's not made clear but these Cheyenne were eventually given a reservation in their preferred habitat minus the bison. The characterization of Secretary Schurznot Shultz well played by Eddie Robinson as a 'good guy' has some historical support but is overblown. Robinson asks his portrait of Lincoln one of Ford's heros for guidance. Although we follow only one cavalry group in fact many thousands of soldiers from several forts as well as many civilians were involved in trying to recapture these couple hundred Cheyenne.Famous Mexican actress Dolores Del Rio at age 60 has a fairly prominent role as a Spanish woman who has joined the Cheyenne the only such woman who speaks English. Her most remembered line repeated is the defiant They will not go back in response to the fort commander's received order that the Cheyenne must return to their Oklahoma reservation even in the dead of winter.Now as to the much maligned Dodge City slapstick farce episode which superficially seems little related to the rest of the film. At one level try thinking of this as the bonus comedy short which happens to be inserted within the main feature film as part of the intermission instead of its usual place. Ford knew that occasional humor sometimes involving slapstick was an important ingredient in his successful films. In this case the laughs are nearly all concentrated in this bizarre segment. But it's also clear that Ford meant this episode to have serious relevance to the main point of the film. In part it's meant to burlesque the striking contrast between the white man's often out of touch corrupt urban world with that of the Native American's viewpoint of themselves as merely one part of a complex web of the natural world. In the last portion most of the town including a wagon load of prostitutes and an open bar wagon go galloping out of town with guns blazing and a wagon of explosives and ammunition to counter a reported nearby party of rampaging Cheyenne. But this hysterical mob goes in the opposite direction from the reported location of the Cheyenne! They encounter one lone Cheyenne on a distant hill who causes further panic with one bullet which blows up the munitions wagon. This segment no doubt is meant as a satire on the huge number of soldiers and civiliansand their general incompetence deemed necessary to track down and tame or kill a few hundred fleeing starving Cheyenne. Jimmy Stewart as Wyatt Earp plays his dominating role in this farce to the hilt quite possibly his best if least understood film performance! Actually his character is a carbon copy of his character in the beginning of Ford's previous Two Rode Together. Watch also for Ken Curtis who wants to pick a fight with Stewart while the latter is card gambling. Stewart shoots him under the table in the foot discombobulating him. Then Stewart supposedly extracts the bullet from his foot. Curtis is most remembered for his role as Festus in the TV Gunsmoke series. However believe it or not he was Frank Sinatra's replacement as Tommy Dorsey's lead male singer in 1941! He was also director Ford's sonin law and had been included in minor roles in many of Ford's previous films. Elizabeth Allen a tall striking brunet plays the pushy lead prostitute ending up upside down bloomers showing in a fastmoving carriage in the laps of Stewart and Arthur Kennedyas Doc Holiday!".

	schema:headline " Underrated John Ford Western";
	schema:reviewBody "This was John Ford's last Western and it is generally viewed as a weak film. It has been described as his apology to Indians for his allegedly negative portrayal of them in his earlier films. If you read the statement he made to Peter Bogdonavich he doesn't actually use the word apology. He says he just wanted to a make movie told more from the Indian point of view. This makes more sense because most Ford Westerns with perhaps the exception of Stagecoach and Rio Grande dealt relatively fairly with Indian characters. I don't think he had much to apologize for. This movie is underrated by critics. I'm not sure why. I thought it compared favorably with his better work. Here are the positives about the movie It may be Ford's most beautiful film. He lingers in Monument Valley far longer than the logic of the script would dictate. He knew this would be that last time he would shoot there. The results are spectacular.The film has a stately almost regal pace with an excellent accompanying soundtrack. This matches the pace of the central plot element  a six month journey by foot.It manages to never be dull. This is quite an accomplishment since there is no real hero no real heavy and very little violent conflict. It's an example of very fine low key storytelling.Although this is a strong Indian point of view movie it never becomes condescending or maudlin. Both sides are presented with respect and complexity.I've read much criticism of the Dodge City comic relief interlude. I thought this was fantastic segment. What a pleasure to see old pros like John Carradine James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy do cameos in Ford's last Western. Ford understood the importance of inserting comic relief into Westerns which are normally tense dramas in need of counterpoint. This is even more effective in the fundamentally somber Cheyenne Autumn.Almost all strong Indian point of view movies are relentless downers that include no comic relief. For example Devil's Doorway Broken Arrow Dances With Wolves. Ford doesn't compromise on his traditional heavy use of humor in this movie and he also includes a somewhat optimistic ending. The ending may seem unrealistically positive but it is actually at least partly rooted in historical accuracy from what I've read. Of course in the big historical picture there was no happy ending for the Indians. The question is who wants to watch a movie that is that depressing? Ford strikes a good compromise here. Carol Baker is an underrated actress. She has a great screen presence and is very good in this film. Her character was very credible if maybe a little too good looking. If she's a typical 1880's Quaker chick I would have had to rethink my religious affiliation.Now here are some things that kept the movie from being betterWidmark looks great but I wish his character had been a more active player in plot developments. It's not best for the male lead to be too much of an observer. Also he is way too old to be Carol Baker's romantic interest.The Indians are poorly cast with the use of mediocre Hispanic actors. I can't believe those weird bangs are authentic hairdos either. If they are I would have invoked artistic license to change them.The subplot with the split between the Cheyenne leaders and the final confrontation at the end was poorly drawn poorly acted and pointless.There are a few plot holes. The only one that really bothered me was the Cheyenne somehow managing to smuggle 20 rifles into their holding facility in the fort in Nebraska.Finally this isn't really a fault but I wanted to mention that I'm torn about Karl Malden's character. On the one hand it seems very odd to introduce a German officer who's oppressing the Cheyenne because he's only following orders. Do we have to implicate the Germans in our genocide? Don't they have enough problems of their own on this issue? On the other hand I guess the point was to draw a comparison between the Holocaust and the destruction of the American Indian population. This was probably a very aggressive and controversial idea in 1964 for Americans anyway. The Germans I've known over the years never had a problem mentioning it to me.

	onyx:emotionText "This was John Ford's last Western and it is generally viewed as a weak film. It has been described as his apology to Indians for his allegedly negative portrayal of them in his earlier films. If you read the statement he made to Peter Bogdonavich he doesn't actually use the word apology. He says he just wanted to a make movie told more from the Indian point of view. This makes more sense because most Ford Westerns with perhaps the exception of Stagecoach and Rio Grande dealt relatively fairly with Indian characters. I don't think he had much to apologize for. This movie is underrated by critics. I'm not sure why. I thought it compared favorably with his better work. Here are the positives about the movie It may be Ford's most beautiful film. He lingers in Monument Valley far longer than the logic of the script would dictate. He knew this would be that last time he would shoot there. The results are spectacular.The film has a stately almost regal pace with an excellent accompanying soundtrack. This matches the pace of the central plot element  a six month journey by foot.It manages to never be dull. This is quite an accomplishment since there is no real hero no real heavy and very little violent conflict. It's an example of very fine low key storytelling.Although this is a strong Indian point of view movie it never becomes condescending or maudlin. Both sides are presented with respect and complexity.I've read much criticism of the Dodge City comic relief interlude. I thought this was fantastic segment. What a pleasure to see old pros like John Carradine James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy do cameos in Ford's last Western. Ford understood the importance of inserting comic relief into Westerns which are normally tense dramas in need of counterpoint. This is even more effective in the fundamentally somber Cheyenne Autumn.Almost all strong Indian point of view movies are relentless downers that include no comic relief. For example Devil's Doorway Broken Arrow Dances With Wolves. Ford doesn't compromise on his traditional heavy use of humor in this movie and he also includes a somewhat optimistic ending. The ending may seem unrealistically positive but it is actually at least partly rooted in historical accuracy from what I've read. Of course in the big historical picture there was no happy ending for the Indians. The question is who wants to watch a movie that is that depressing? Ford strikes a good compromise here. Carol Baker is an underrated actress. She has a great screen presence and is very good in this film. Her character was very credible if maybe a little too good looking. If she's a typical 1880's Quaker chick I would have had to rethink my religious affiliation.Now here are some things that kept the movie from being betterWidmark looks great but I wish his character had been a more active player in plot developments. It's not best for the male lead to be too much of an observer. Also he is way too old to be Carol Baker's romantic interest.The Indians are poorly cast with the use of mediocre Hispanic actors. I can't believe those weird bangs are authentic hairdos either. If they are I would have invoked artistic license to change them.The subplot with the split between the Cheyenne leaders and the final confrontation at the end was poorly drawn poorly acted and pointless.There are a few plot holes. The only one that really bothered me was the Cheyenne somehow managing to smuggle 20 rifles into their holding facility in the fort in Nebraska.Finally this isn't really a fault but I wanted to mention that I'm torn about Karl Malden's character.

The picture is an epic portrait of the historic story about celebrated Cheyenne they are actually Navajo telling dirty jokes in their native tongue and their legendary feat leading the tribe on a journey to freedom  uprooting them from the Yellowstone and resettling them in distant Oklahoma . This majestic flick illustrates the callous disregard with which the government treated the Cheyenne in the 1880s as the US agency fails to deliver even the meager provisions due by peace treaty to the stubborn tribe in their stark desert reserve without proper supplies for survival  then the starving Indians have taken more abuse than it's worth and break it too by embarking on a 1500 miles trek back to their ancestral hunting grounds  being led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife Ford was urged to cast Richard Boone and Anthony Quinn  as both had Native American blood  Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland who were of Mexican descent were cast instead . Meanwhile  proud Cheyenne tribe square off US cavalry commanded by Thomas Archer Richard Widmark who leads his army on a wild chase across the barren plains in this saga of the old west . Red Shirt Sal Mineo  John Ford would not allow Sal to speak any English dialog in the movie due to the actor's Bronx accent  a rebel Indian does the first shot against cavalry . Captain Thomas Archer goes to deal with Secretary of Interior Schulz about the unfortunate Indians Spencer Tracy was first cast as the secretary of interior Karl Shultz but had a heart attack and was replaced by Edward G. Robinson whose scenes were entirely photographed in studios including the climatic meeting scene between Shultz and the Cheyenne chiefs in which the background had to be done with screen process. The tribe refuses to surrender in this chronicle of a bitter fight between the tribe and the US cavalry in the struggle for the west.This sprawling epic film displays action Western  shootouts  drama and spectacular battles . It's a thoughtful piece for its time that had an original tragic ending and imbued with moments of sensitive poetry . This nice Western contains interesting characters  full of wide open space and dramatic moments . This classic  sturdy picture ranks as one of the most sentimental of John Ford's work .Thoughtprovoking  enjoyable screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface and suggested by Mari Sandoz in Cheyenne Autumn with screenplay by James R. Webb and based on a novel titled Last Frontier by Howard Fast who also wrote Spartacus . This excellent film featuring a magnificent performance by whole casting  including a topnotch support cast . Awesome Richard Widmark in a largerthanlife character along with a gorgeous Carrol Baker and a magnificent Karl Malden as deranged captain Wessels . In the film appears  as usual  Ford's favourite actors as Ben Johnson  Harry Carey Jr  Mike Mazurki  George O'Brien  Mae Marsh  Patrick Wayne  Dolores Del Rio  Ken Curtis  Elizabeh Allen  Willis Bouchey  and of course James Stewart as obstinate sheriff Earp . Ford added the segment with Stewart in place of an intermission  he didn't want people leaving the auditorium to go the bathroom or concessions counter even though the film was long and so he came up with the Wyatt Earp segment  Ford later quipped to Stewart that the actor was the best intermission in the movies . Outdoors are pretty good and well photographed in Super Panavision 70mm by William H Clothier and filmed on location in Moab UtahFort Laramie Wyoming Monument Valley Utah  Gunnison Canyon Colorado . Rousing and an impressive musical score by Alex North who composed other masterpieces as Spartacus and Cleopatra.This may not be Ford's best Western  as many would claim  but it's still head ad shoulders above most bigscale movies .You'll find the ending overdramatic according to your tastes  though it's lovingly composed by John Ford who really picks up battle  drama and sensibility towards the ending . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching . The motion picture well produced by Bernard Smith was brilliantly directed by John Ford at his last film . This powerful movie will appeal to Indian Western fans".

	schema:headline " Conveniently adapted story of Northern Cheyenne";
	schema:reviewBody "This film shows just a bit of the tragedy of Northern Cheyenne. The film or John Ford did not show that they initially fought together with Sioux led by Sitting Bull war in 1876 and were partially massacred by Custer. Later they fought once again and were defeated at McKenzie compelling them to surrender. Two years later the prisoners Dull Knife Wild Hog and Little Wolf were brought down as prisoners to Fort Reno from where they escaped and were later killed without mercy. Part of the survivors were killed later when they tried to escape from Fort Robinson Nebraska and the others finally confined to a reservation in Montana. Probably Ford wanted to show this story softly giving some feeling of justice to Captain Archer Richard Widmark but at the end the film became an approximate story of the reality. Cheyenne either northern or southern were expelled out from their natural areas they missed bull hunting and their ancestral traditions. Beside this historical considerations one must admit that Ford had a very good cast for the film with Widmark Carroll Baker always efficient Edward G. Robinson Karl Malden and others. The only thing difficult to understand was the scene with James Stewart as Wyatt Earp together with the veterans Arthur Kennedy and John Carradine which in my opinion was out of the context.Some people believe that Westerns are not more of use in Hollywood. I believe that some westerns giving real stories of what happened with the Indians are very much necessary to understand the history of the real American people. Geronimo Sitting Bull Dull Knife and others were not criminals they were only defending the land where they were born and raised. So their lives should be brought fairly to the screen in the coming future.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rediscovered Cheyenne Autumn recently and must confess to finding the temptation to hail it as almost the greatest of the John Ford Westerns irresistable.  I say almost as I realise that the claim needs a certain amount of caution.  When set beside the formal perfection of The Searchers My Darling Clementine and even She Wore a Yellow Ribbon Cheyenne Autumn has a few weak moments and certainly some longeurs.  And yet it has a monumental sweep that somehow outstrips them all.  Ford's final Western is an apologia for the white Americans' treatment of the American Indian and his own depiction of them as the bad guys in so much of his previous work.  Here the Cheyenne are the victims of White oppression forced to live far to the south of their natural homeland and desperate to return.  Depleted in number mainly through illness and starvation they set out on the long trek north beset on all sides by alien landscape conditions and the American cavalry in pursuit.  These pathetic remnants of a once noble tribe now consist of little more than a group of women and children  very few of the male warriors are left  accompanied by a white Quaker woman who has befriended them.  One American cavalry officer Richard Widmark in one of his best performances recognises their dilemma and does all he can to summon official awareness of their plight.  In a sense this is one of the finest of all road movies the protagonists forced to face the long journey home across a seemingly endless wilderness.  Only through an inner determination are the remnants of the tribe able to make it.  It is also one of cinema's most powerful documentations of man's inhumanity to man not light years away from Come and See and Ford's own The Prisoner of Shark Island. The film is badly flawed by the intrusion of a semicomic interlude depicting Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday more intent on card play in Dodge City than in what is happening around them.  This only serves to slow the pace of a film that is often prone to encompass peripheral detail to the detriment of moving purposefully forward.  But who can quibble when the end result encompasses one magnificent image after another in William Clothier's splendid 'scope photography and the only music score  by Alex North  that ever did real justice to a Ford picture.  For once we actually get away from those endless medleys of sentimental hymn and folk melodies with an astringency of style that matches the serious content of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the perfect counterpoint to early John Ford films such as Stagecoach. In Stagecoach every indian was painted as a bloodthirsty savage out to menace all of the civilized folk. Cheyenne Autumn on the other hand is a very revealing film... behind it all you can almost feel John Ford questioning himself and his previous views on American history. In this film it is the US soldiers who are painted as the brutal savages and the indians are the civilized folk. It's amazing to see Ford who practically built his career glorifying the chivalry of the western hero do a complete 360 to end up deglorifying it. I have the feeling that this was a very personal film for Ford and in that light it really does make him one of the great auteurs of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the wrong place to discuss the plight of the indigenous population of North America but there's no denying the Native American has got a raw deal over the last couple of hundred years and watching CHEYENNE AUTUMN you're left in no doubt whose side John Ford is taking . Wouldn't it have been so much better then if Ford had actually cast Native Americans to play the Cheyenne characters in the movie instead of latino actors ? Of course you can't say Ford was guilty of hypocrisy in doing this  in 1972 Marlon Brando sent an Indian women to collect his best actor Oscar in protest at the plight of the native population of North America . Only thing is that she wasn't an Indian at all she was of Italian descent . Same as the tear stained Indian chief in the legendary advert from the 1970s who weeps when he sees the litter the white man has left in his country  He wasn't an Indian at all he was an Italian American . Say what you like about Kevin Costner but at least he had the decency to cast red Indians in his liberal study of American tribes in DANCES WITH WOLVES I shouldn't be too hard on Ford since this was typical of film makers at the time  it didn't matter if you were Hispanic  Jewish or black you could still pass as a redskin . Hell if you were a white European by ethnicity you could still play an Indian  you'd just have to put on some brown make up and viola you're Chief Running Horse . No my criticism of this movie isn't to do with the portrayal of American tribes  it's all to do with a totally unfocused screenplay . There we are watching the white man stabbing the noble Indian population in the back once again  the Cheyenne have to trek across the desert plains then for some reason which is unknown to anyone except the producers the story cuts to Dodge City with the hopelessly miscast James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy playing Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday . Serious historical academics will also have a problem recognising these real life characters while the rest of the audience will wonder if this th same movie they were watching 20 minutes ago . Then we cut back to the Cheyenne trek again as we're left to wonder what the heck the Dodge City segment had to do with this aspect of the story CHEYENNE AUTUMN isn't a total loss . I'll repeat it does take the side of the Indians and refreshingly humanizes them and Ford deserves some credit in not casting John Wayne in Richard Widmark's role and like most of Ford's films the cinematography is breath taking but the movie comes crashing down due to the screenplay that seems to have two entirely different stories within its pages".

	schema:headline " Big budget liberal message movie is a mess";
	schema:reviewBody "Cheyenne Autumn was intended as the bigbudget western release of 1964 the followup to How the West Was Won with several of the same cast members and one of that film's directors. For a movie made in 1963 the theme is a bold one about the White man's illtreatment of the Cheyenne actually the North Cheyenne tribe and their 1878 journey back north to their homeland.Unfortunately the film is a mess and for a movie made by a top 'A' director it is surprisingly incompetently directed. Some commentsthe Dodge City sequence. I would have liked to see this expanded to a feature length film and released separately. It is very funny. However it doesn't belong in this film. What was Ford smoking when he put this in? Karl Malden's prototype Nazi officer who has Orders orders zat must be OBEYED. I HAF ORDERS. Malden seems to think he is auditioning for John Cleese's role in The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers. Couldn't someone keep him under control? And what about that huge pipe he pulls out of his coat at one point and then exits stage left after blowing out the sergeant's offered match? That made me laugh. A touch worthy of Peter Sellers. One can see the point being made but the execution is ridiculous. It was also amusing to see the German name of Edward G Robinson's character being downplayed presumably because the writers had forgotten that one of the major 'good guys' was also of German ancestry when they created the Nazi character. interesting historical footnote  the real Carl Schurz spoke with a thick German accent whereas the real Cpt Wessels was born in New York and likely didn't  he certainly was never a Prussian officer in the first encounter between the cavalry and the Indians Richard Widmark is summarily court martialled and put under arrest for reasons not apparent to this viewer was something cut out?. Later Widmark goes up to a soldier and asks where the major is only for the soldier to point to a body which is virtually lying at Widmark's feet being attended to by a physician. This is like something out of The Naked Gun. I had to rewind here to check I hadn't missed anything as it looked so stupid.the second skirmish with the Indians is appallingly choreographed and edited. After establishing that we are in some kind of shrubsemidesert area when Pat Wayne leads a cavalry charge the cavalry are shown charging over some flat sandy area which is obviously a completely different location. Then the Indians set fire to a few fakelooking shrubs and about five seconds later the cavalry's wagons and cannon are enveloped in flames despite being at least several hundred yards away. Richard Widmark and the rest of his command appear to be doing nothing whilst this happens although Wayne's men seem to be close enough for Widmark to be shouting at them. A quick cut and Widmark is personally helping save the cannon  what has happened to the hundred odd men in his command. Why aren't they helping? Who knows.Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland's mullets. Very silly and must have given the set hairdresser lots of chuckles. Didn't anyone look at any pictures of the real Dull Knife and Little Wolf? Still at least even they don't look as ridiculous as Sal Mineo.Surely someone must have realised that it sounded stupid to constantly refer to a major character as Spanish Woman rather than give her a proper name? There is no excuse for this as it's not even a real historical name.What did make me laugh was that most of the time it looked as if Little Wolf and Dull Knife's orders to the tribe were having to be translated for them by the elderly unnamed Cheyenne who was standing next to them in many scenes and was a real Indian a senior Navajo I'm guessing. Almost every time they said something in Cheyenne this guy would then turn round and repeat it to the other Indians. This again looked ridiculous Matters being brought to what seemed a premature conclusion by Edward G Robinson standing infront of an appallingly unconvincing piece of backprojection not even pointed in the right direction and mouthing a few platitudes. Had the money run out at this point? the Robinson scene is completely fictitious by the way.In short worthy in intent but incompetent in execution and in places mindnumbingly bad for an expensive film made by a talented director.".

However it is marred by several characters who seem to have been inserted into the film for no reason other than perhaps marquee value.The central narrative concerns the plight of the Cheyenne people who have been stranded on a reservation and have not been given the food and supplies they were promised. The leaders played by Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland take them on a 1500 mile journey back to their ancestral homelands. The military commander sent to track them down Captain Archer Richard Widmark is sympathetic enough to their cause that he eventually intercedes on their behalf with the head of the Interior Department Edward G. Robinson splicedin for the missing Spencer Tracy. The harrowing journey of the Cheyenne which takes its toll especially in the lives of the elderly and the young is shown in some detail.Unfortunately the film also includes a long sequence right in the middle of the film with Jimmy Stewart Arthur Kennedy and John Carradine  this sequence seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the film. While one is often inclined to forget a nonsensical sequence if it's just too darn fun this one is just pointless and distracting. I kept waiting for these characters to appear in the rest of the narrative.... but nothing ever happens to tie the events together with the main story. There's not even enough of a thematic connection for any but the most diehard apologist to make sense of its inclusion in the film.Also disappointing is Karl Malden's heavyhanded performance as an ineffective prison commander.Could have been great but I can settle for a good western on the right occasion and this one had enough good scenes especially the conversations between Widmark's character and Mike Mazurki's veteran campaigner to make for a solid film experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's at least one of the worst. John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn 1964 was supposedly based on the book of the same name the book's excellent but this movie's a total fail. For one the story focuses on what is known as the Northern Cheyenne Exodus wherein Chiefs Little Wolf Ricardo Montalban and Dull Knife Gilbert Roland lead over three hundred starved and weary Cheyenne from their reservation in the Oklahoma territory to eastern Montana. Google it and you can see the exact trail route. What's the problem? Well Ford shot the picture entirely in his beloved Monument Valley and surrounding areas in Arizona. Evidently Ford thought that we're all doofuses and no one would notice that the desert Southwest looks absolutely nothing like the Great Plains where the exodus actually took place. Imagine a movie taking place in the northern Appalachians but shooting it in the swamps of Louisiana it's the same gross contrast.I'm not suggesting by the way that films based on factual events always have to be shot at the actual locations but shouldn't the locations at least remotely resemble the actual locations? For instance although the story of Cold Mountain takes place in North Carolina and Virginia parts of it were shot in Romania but it was okay because the geography and climate is the same. Or take 1953's War Arrow which took place in West Texas but was shot in California it worked out because the CA locations were an acceptable substitute for West Texas not great but at least acceptable.If this weren't bad enough the story as played out in Cheyenne Autumn is so dreadfully dull and the acting so melodramatic that you'll be seriously tempted to tune out by the half hour mark. And then there's this utterly incongruent sequence with Jimmy Stewart as Wyatt Earp in Dodge City Kansas which again looks absolutely nothing like Monument Valley.Needless to say this film's so godawful you have to actually see it to believe it. In fact that would be the only reason for viewing it that and maybe having a good laugh. It's a cinematic abomination.What's crazy is that the current IMDb rating is 6.9. Can you believe it? I can only stock this up to Ford fanatics who can't face the awful truth that this great auteur barfed out such utter trash. And to think that this  his last film  was supposed to be some kind of apology to Native Americans for his onedimensional portrayal in past films. What irony.To add insult to injury the film is painfully overlong at 2.5 hours which feels like 4 hours.GRADE F".

And then there's this utterly incongruent sequence with Jimmy Stewart as Wyatt Earp in Dodge City Kansas which again looks absolutely nothing like Monument Valley.Needless to say this film's so godawful you have to actually see it to believe it. In fact that would be the only reason for viewing it that and maybe having a good laugh. It's a cinematic abomination.What's crazy is that the current IMDb rating is 6.9. Can you believe it? I can only stock this up to Ford fanatics who can't face the awful truth that this great auteur barfed out such utter trash. And to think that this  his last film  was supposed to be some kind of apology to Native Americans for his onedimensional portrayal in past films. What irony.To add insult to injury the film is painfully overlong at 2.5 hours which feels like 4 hours.GRADE F";

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately given the subject matter and the director Cheyenne Autumn fails to achieve the greatness of its aspirations. Injustice to Native Americans has along tragic history and the topic deserved a soaring film that brought those crimes to a broad audience. After years of depicting Native Americans as the villains John Ford was certainly the right director to cast a sympathetic eye on their plight and the film has many grand sequences that are reminiscent of Ford's finest westerns. The brilliant camera work of William Clothier captures the majesty of Monument Valley and often bathes the mountains and characters in the warm glow of sunsets.For some reason Ford felt that Latino actors were appropriate for the roles of Native Americans and Ricardo Montalban Gilbert Roland and Dolores del Rio do achieve a measure of dignity as members of the longsuffering Cheyenne tribe. While Carroll Baker tries hard as a Quaker woman who accompanies the Cheyenne on an arduous trek back to their homeland her bleached blonde hair immaculate makeup and voice undercut her efforts. The work of composer Alex North also sounds out of place. Best known for his scores for Spartacus and Cleopatra North's music here evokes Roman legions rather than the U.S. cavalry.However the biggest flaw in the film is a misconceived episode in the middle that features James Stewart Arthur Kennedy and John Carradine. As Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday Stewart and Kennedy perform a comedy routine that jars with the solemnity of the previous scenes. Indeed the entire Dodge City sequence is a western comedy and viewers would be justified in thinking that some film reels were mislabeled and an entire sequence from another film had been inserted accidentally. Whatever dignity and concern was established in the film's first hour are destroyed when the action moves from the Cheyenne to Earp and Dodge City.Cheyenne Autumn was likely conceived as a followup to the successful How the West Was Won. John Ford was one of the directors of that Cinerama film Carroll Baker Karl Malden James Stewart and Richard Widmark are featured in both films and the ads for the two westerns are strikingly similar. Widmark anchors Cheyenne Autumn and provides a narration much as Spencer Tracey did for How the West Was Won. However the earlier movie was a rousing adventure with a great score and an uplifting theme of westward expansion. Despite an overture and intermission Cheyenne Autumn is a small sober tale of racial injustice that has been stretched out and embellished with a jarring music score and a schizophrenic mix of comedy and tragedy that lays waste to some fine epic moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cheyenne Autumn is directed by John Ford and is a Hollywood telling of the Northern Cheyenne Exodus of 18779 where the Northern Cheyenne fed up with lack of food and poor facilities tried to return to their one time home in the North after having been located in the Southern Reservation by the United States Army. It stars Richard Widmark Caroll Baker Dolores del Rio Karl Malden Gilbert Roland Ricardo Montalban Edward G. Robinson James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy. Music is scored by Alex North and cinematography by William H. Clothier. It is photographed in Super Panavision 70 in various Utah locations predominantly Monument Valley.Does it ever matter who fired the first shot?John Pappy Ford's penultimate film and his last Western is epic in scope and production and seen as an honest attempt to redress the balance for years of misrepresentation of Native Americans in Hollywood though not necessarily his own since he I believe isn't on record as saying that to be the case? Thematically it's important and doesn't back off from being sympathetic to the Cheyenne's plight we root for them and rightly so. Yet it always feels like a film shot through the vision of a white man's eyes you find yourself wanting more from the Cheyenne perspective for them to dominate the narrative. It would have been nice to know some of the big players involved in the heroic and tragic trek back to Wyoming. It's also annoying that Ford or the studio chose to interrupt the flow of the story with the pointless light relief section at Dodge City. Which comes across as just an excuse for James Stewart and Arthur Kennedy to play Wyatt Earp  Doc Holliday respectively. And sadly they are not very successful in doing so either.As has been noted by many critics over the years the film ultimately rounds out as an honourable misfire from the great John Ford. The cast away from the loud and brash Dodge City collective are mostly fine. Widmark proves to be a watchable axis as the reluctant Captain tasked with returning the Cheyenne to the barren reservation. Baker does a nice line in sexy Quaker Robinson adds a touch of class late in the day while Montalban  Roland are excellent as Cheyenne chiefs Little Wolf  Dull Knife respectively. But all pale in the shadow of Clothier's magnificent photography stunning vistas that dominate the screen the colours so rich and splendid Monument Valley an iconic character of nature observing the Cheyenne desperately trying to get back to home comforts.It's unmistakably a John Ford picture with some inspired filming techniques but the heart of the story is lost due to a too long run time a daft mid point sequence and much extraneous nonsense. 610".

They were part of what made the Old West a dangerous place for they were always likely to attack a white settlement or wagon train hoping to scalp the men and rape the women. This made for great cinematic entertainment. But then our conscience began to bother us and so we started trying to make amends with movies depicting the Native Americans as victims more to be pitied than feared. Though such revisionist Westerns may be more faithful to the facts of the NativeAmerican experience yet they just are not as much fun and this movie is a good example of that.When the movie begins we see the pathetic Cheyenne Indians who are forced to live on a reservation in Oklahoma suffering from neglect at the hands of white men. They weary of this and decide to leave Oklahoma and return to their ancestral home in Wyoming with the army in pursuit. Now if I had been chief of this tribe I would have waited until spring because such a trek would be easier to make in warm weather. But no they leave just before winter is about to set in which only adds to their misery.Anyway things are moving along and left at that this could have simply been a boring twohour movie. But you know John Ford. He always has to put some corny scenes in his movies. I think he calls it comic relief. So we have this pointless painful segment about Dodge City where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday act silly. There is only a tenuous connection between this segment and what is happening to the Cheyenne and if it had been left out you would never have missed it. But it was not left out and that means that instead of a boring twohour movie we end up with a boring and painful two andahalf hour movie.".

It fortunately only lasts about 20 minutes that's short considering the overall length of the film. Jimmy Stewart is Wyatt Earp and Arthur Kennedy is Doc Holladay. Neither plays their role very convincingly and little energy goes into their performances. The segment believe it or not is played comically and is neither interesting nor funnyand it completely disrupts the somber tone of the film. Then abruptly the film returns to the Richard Widmark portion for the remainder of the film. Without this horrible guest shot within the movie with Stewart and Kennedy the film would probably merit a score of 9 as it really was a unique look at how some Indian tribes were forced into conflict by the reservation system. But with it the overall message is somewhat muddled and the movie just went on too long. It's sad though because the meaningless 15 of the film could easily be edited out to make a far more effective picture.".

Maybe he knew that too and wanted to do a little penance and that is why he put in that excerpt from Ribbon of the stagecoach rushing in and the driver tossing off some newspapers.

The first part of the movie also involves Carroll Baker as a Quaker but she disappears half way through with no explanation. The middle is interrupted by an extended scene starring Jimmy Stewart and Arthur Kennedy as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday in a slapstick comedy as if from a different TV channel. Then we're back to Richard Widmark now accompanied by Mike Mazurki. Suddenly they're under the command of Karl Malden playing a protoNazi. The message usually manages to be heavyhanded and preachy yet at other times it's not even clear where the director's sympathies lay. And in a bid to be an Important Film it goes on for nearly three hours. Somewhere in this tangled pile of celluloid there's a decent 100 minute movie but I'm not quite sure where.".

Then we're back to Richard Widmark now accompanied by Mike Mazurki. Suddenly they're under the command of Karl Malden playing a protoNazi. The message usually manages to be heavyhanded and preachy yet at other times it's not even clear where the director's sympathies lay. And in a bid to be an Important Film it goes on for nearly three hours. Somewhere in this tangled pile of celluloid there's a decent 100 minute movie but I'm not quite sure where.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly every shot in CHEYENNE AUTUMN is breathtaking in its beauty. It's unfortunate that the movie itself is so inconsistent. Starting out as the noblest of ventures John Ford establishes that his last western is going to be decidedly proIndian. The Cheyenne forced from their land and held on a government controlled reservation decide to move back. Cavalryman Richard Widmark attempts to stop them. In the middle the film comes to a grinding halt for a very bizarre and very out of left field episode involving Dodge City Wyatt Earp some hookers and a comic cowboys and Indians scene. Still the movie has a lot to offer not the least of which is Widmark's excellent performance. He's conflicted in his desire to follow orders but also very well aware of how cruel his orders are. Carroll Baker is a Quaker who gives him a run for his money. As Indians the seemingly implausibly cast Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland actually come across as well rounded and very intelligent. Sal Mineo has a nearly silent role as a hot headed Indian and the legendary Dolores Del Rio plays his mother. James Stewart pops up as Wyatt Earp in the aforementioned Dodge City sequence but he along with Arthur Kennedy as Doc Holliday are wasted. Featuring another great music score by Alex North.".

	schema:reviewBody "From director John Ford comes this moving tribute to the Native American. Unlike his early films where they were seen as uncivilized savages this film  Cheyenne Autumn  depicts them as they really are. Natives Americans who long wish to return to their Homeland. Set against the beautiful panoramic landscape these noble people set out across the open desert. Although it's 1500 miles and in the mists of subzero winter they struggle to reach their sacred ground where they wish to live with their children. Along the way their every encounter with the White man is met with racial hostility and murder. Their most threatening adversary is the American Press which decries the Indian as everything from bloodthirty barbarians to a marauding hoard of renegades. The inner story is of sympathetic Capt. Thomas Archer Richard Widmark a Calvalry Officer who understands their plight and attempts to see the Sect. of the Interior Edward G. Robinson to correct a grievous injustice. Within the Cheyenne Tribe are two brothers Little Wolf and Dull Knife Ricardo Montalban Golbert Roland who wrestle with conflicting methods as to how to win their ultimate victory. This is difficult as Dull Knife's son Sal Mineo is seen as dishonorable for coveting Little Wolf's wife. With a plethora of Hollywood stars like Mike Mazurki Karl Malden James Steward Patrick Wayne Arthur Kennedy Carroll Baker John Carradine Victory Jory and Ken Curtis this film nearly becomes top heavy. Instead the entire cast makes for a tremendous effort to establish what has come to be known as a John Ford Classic. Excellent film. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Cat's Eye is another horror anthology movie that I found to be a nice companion piece with Twilight Zone The Movie. The thing that surprised me about this film is that it's a suspense comedy loaded with thrills galore and dark humor. Instead of four separate tales Cat's Eye has just three with a plucky tabby cat intervening through all three stories. And all three segments are directed by the same man Lewis Teague. Stephen King wrote all three segments with the first two segments based on short stories written by King. The first segment is a black comedy starring James Woods in some of the funniest acting that he's ever done as a man who wants to quit smoking. He goes to a place called Quitters Inc. This clinic is run by a most unusual doctor played by comedian Alan King. Woods finds out quickly that their methods of trying to make smokers quit are odd. Very very odd. This story isn't really scary but it's downright hilarious with Woods trying desperately to kick the habit. King is also very funny as the doc. This is a very good segment. But my favorite segment of Cat's Eye is the second one. The late Kenneth McMillan stars as a ruthless gambler who kidnaps a tennis player Robert Hays from Airplane! who's been doing a little youknowwhat on his wife. McMillan makes a strange bet with the tennis pro walk on top of a short ledge around the gambler's high rise building 5060 stories up. This segment is a scary one with a few touches of black humor even though this segment isn't as funny as the first one. King wrote the third segment directly for the screen. He wrote it for a then very young preteen Drew Barrymore who a year earlier starred in King's Firestarter. Barrymore plays a little girl who takes that tabby cat in to live with her after the cat runs into her house. The reason why the cat ran into her house kitty spotted a little tiny gremlin strolling into the place. The cat comes in and tries to save the day. This segment is silly but fun. All in all Cat's Eye is an underrated gem. Funny scary and entertaining. out of four".

'The Ledge' also from 'Night Shift' concerns a risky walk around a tall building.  Both these stories are entertaining and filled with excellent humor and strong characters.By comparison the third story which is the climax to the whole thing is pretty slow and dull the only real humor being provided by a miniature trolllike creature.

The movie is actually a decent watch and fans of the original source material will enjoy it as well as the average fan. An added bonus is the fact that the man himself wrote the screenplay!!The movie is about a cat that has many adventures. Along it's way an image of a girl keeps the cat going to it's destination. Along the way he meets a man who has a smoking problem who'll go to great lengths to try and snuff his habit and the other is a broken down tennis player who's given a chance to redeem himself by completing a simple task. The cat's final destination is a girl who's tormented by a nasty little dude. WIll the cat affect those that cross it's past? What is that little dude that lives in the hole in the wall? All answers will be answered when you watch CATS EYE!A good adaptation and a nice film. The only thing I didn't like was the silliness of the last episode. Some of the events in the final chapter come off as very contrived and clichd. Other than that I had no problems. An enjoyable movie.Recommended.".

King's other movies Cujo Christine are sprinkled in as cameos many which will leave you giggling along with King's playful nods to himself I don't know who writes this crap as James Woods watches The Dead Zone St Stephen's School for the Exceptionally Gifted. It's better than I expected and better than a majority of horror anthologies out there especially for the time period. The effects  primary used for the third and final episode which has a more mystical spin on it than the previous two  are pretty good considering its the 1980s.

I truly loved this movie and I even convinced my whole family to watch it even my sister and that's saying something.This movie is in three parts the first two of which are short stories in Steven King's Night Shift the third being entirely new. Below I described the three parts in brief summaries only telling up to what the General is aware of. But there are still plenty of spoilers so be careful reading it.Prolouge We see a lone cat known only as 'The General' wandering the streets. After being chased by a dog Cujo and nearly hit by a car Christine he winds up on his way to New York City.Part One A man called Richard Morrisson is on his way to an agency called 'Quitters Incorporated' to try and quit smoking. The General is on his way to the same place after being captured by a man from the company. The General is used as an example of the 'treatment' they use at Quitters Inc. Later General escapes inadvertently caused by Richard.Part Two An old rich man known as Cressner is on his way home after visiting the casinos. After helping the General get through heavy traffic he brings him home where the cat sees an unusual sight. Cressner placed a wager with Johnny Norris an aging tennis pro who is having an affair with his wide. Norris has to walk the 5inch ledge along the top of the hotel Cressner lives. After managing to do so the General helps him out and at the same time escapes.HUGE SPOILERS Part Three The General arrives in a house where a little girl called Amanda lives. After much pleading her parents let her keep the cat. Two nights later as the General is put out for the night a troll emerges from Amanda's bedroom wall. This little demon first kills Polly Amanda's parakeet then tries to steal Amanda's breath. Fortunately the General gets back inside and keeps the troll from succeeding. Unfortunately he wakes Amanda's parents who believe the General killed Polly. Amanda's mom bring him to the pound after the rest of the family leaves for work and school. That night the troll comes back and so does the General. After fighting the General successfully kills the troll. This time the parents see what's left of the troll and let Amanda keep General.".

It had a couple of funny moments but I found it to be completely forgettable for most part.The third story General was the most interesting one without being so cheesy as Quitters Inc. Even when it could be seen as something dated by modern viewers I think it is still worthwatching. I liked the idea of one cat being the hero of the story opposed to the tired clich of the evil cat which became so common in cartoons and horror films. The Troll character reminded me of the movie Gremlins and yet I think that it was one of the most interesting characters from this film which were mostly stereotypes.Cat's Eye without being a masterpiece at least provides a decent amount of entertainment value that other horror movies lack specially those that take themselves way too seriously to the point of being pretentious.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie divided into three parts each separate story linked by the passage of a cat through it. The first two parts Quitters' Incorporated and The Ledge are well done adaptations of two  short stories that are amongst Stephen King's best writing. Admittedly they read better you can find them both in the Night Shift collection because a lot has to do with what the characters are thinking which you can't really do on screen. However they come about as close as possible here. The third part of the movie I think is written specifically for the movie and wraps things up nicely. Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film based on short stories by Stephen King three stories intertwine through the same cat. The idea seems good and in fact its an interesting way to bring to the cinema stories that alone don't justify a feature length. The big problem with the film is that it doesn't immediately make clear that we're seeing a black humor movie. The public fills the theater expecting a horror film or a thriller and leaves very disappointed. It's one of those cases where they expects one thing and the movie is something different. Its the fault of the public? Partly yes. But let us go on. The film is divided into three parts but the cat has increased protagonism in the last. James Woods and Drew Barrymore still making adorable child roles are the most notorious actors playing quite satisfactorily. You can never clearly tell what force pushes the cat through the film until find the girl and that is the biggest flaw in the movie for me. The film never scares us but it has a number of rather comical scenes that can impress the most sensitive people given the kind of humor presented.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable Stephen King anthology film is less Creepshow and more Twilight Zone";
	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King returns to anthology horror after the success of his Creepshow collaboration with George A. Romero. This time the stories are less EC Comics and more Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The first tale involves James Woods going to a clinic run by Alan King to help him quit smoking. What he doesn't expect is their extreme methods which include people constantly spying on him torturing family members and people hiding inside his house. Woods is as always intense and compelling as the haggard man and brings a lot of a fairly thin story. The second story is about Robert Hays taking a bet from a Las Vegas high roller who he's wronged that he can't make his way all the way around a high rise casino along the narrow ledge. This entry had a nice throwback feel to the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Man from the South which was based upon a Roald Dahl short story about a high roller who bets a desperate gambler he can't light his lighter 10 times in a row or else he has to let the rich man chop off an keep a finger. The third tale is the best and the one that's closest to traditional horror. Drew Barrymore plays a little girl who keeps telling her parents there's a monster living in her wall but her parents don't believe her even though there really is a creepy little monster. I think what I liked most about this segment are the Incredible Shrinking Man style of special effects used to animate the tiny monster particularly when it's a regularsized actor in costume on a giant set interacting with giant props. Loved that! There's a wraparound story about a stray cat who passes through each story but it's really not much of a story and the cat doesn't play any role in the other stories until the final one. Apparently there was originally more to the wrap around but it was cut out of the film. Besides the above named actors there is also Kenneth McMillan James Rebhorn Mike Starr James Naughton Charles S. Dutton and voice artist Frank Welker who's voiced everything from The Smurfs to Scooby Doo to Futurama to Aladin and the Lion King. Welker is credited as Special Vocal Effects which I'm guessing is the creepy little monster living in the wall. Also of note is that the film was photographed Jack Cardiff who has shot everything from The African Queen to The Red Shoes to Rambo so the film does look gorgeous. Overall this isn't the best King film adaptation but it's far from the worse and falls somewhere in the slightly above average range.".

In the opening scenes the cat is chased by a bloody St. Bernard Cujo and runs in front of a red car with a bumper sticker stating 'I'm Christine' obviously Christine.... In the segment Quitters Inc. a character is watching The Dead Zone and proceeds to say 'who writes this crap?' In the last segment The General a woman is reading Pet Semetary. All these references should make any King fan giggle and realise this movie is very tongueincheek.The first segment Quitters Inc. is the best of the three the short story is also extremely good. James Morrison James Woods decides to give up smoking by joining Quitters Inc. but at first finds their methods cruel and sadistic. Can he go along with their twisted game or will he fall to temptation? Also starring Alan King this segment is at times funny and at times creepy with an ending sure to shock.The second segment The Ledge is the second best of the three and is darkly funny. Johnny Norris Robert Hays becomes involved with a dangerous man Cressner Kenneth McMillian who loves to wager. However this particular one is rather twisted. The wager is if Norris can climb around a ledge at the top of an apartment building he gets money freedom and his girl. People with fears of heights will hate this segment as the majority of it is filmed up high and at times is very tense. Although in some scenes the special effects look rather dated this one is still a great watch.The last and weakest segment The General with Drew Barrymore is about a troll who lives in the girl's bedroom and tries to steal her breath. However the cat who we've been following is by her side trying to protect her. I found this segment to be the worst. I found the story silly and uninteresting the special effects were bad and it wasn't at all scary or funny.But I don't want to end this review on a bad note because this movie was very watchable and a very faithful King adaptation.

It's quite gripping but also has a wicked sense of humor. The second segment has Robert Hays the star of Airplane! as a tennis pro who having stolen Kenneth McMillan's wife and money is forced at gunpoint to walk all the way around a very high ledge on a building. If he makes it McMillan says he'll let him live. This was probably my favorite segment. It's like if Harold Lloyd's Safety Last was a horror film. The final segment breaks away from realistic horror. It's very silly but still quite entertaining. It has Drew Barrymore as a girl who is being stalked by a tiny troll. Only her cat the one who owns the titular eyes and who has a part in the first two tales as well can protect her. If the troll sounds familiar it's because it was voiced by Frank Welker who later used practically the same voice for Futurama's Nibbler. The cat is wonderful. The poor thing gets hurt in every segment but it turns out to be probably the most heroic cat in film history!".

	schema:reviewBody "Three short stories by Stephen King connected somewhat halfheartedly by having a cat appear in each of them. Only in the last episode the cat is really important in the others it is introduced arbitrarily. As I read there has been a prologue to the film that gives the third episode more substance more sense as there usually is in Stephen King's horror stories but the prologue was cut out by a producer.

	onyx:emotionText "Three short stories by Stephen King connected somewhat halfheartedly by having a cat appear in each of them. Only in the last episode the cat is really important in the others it is introduced arbitrarily. As I read there has been a prologue to the film that gives the third episode more substance more sense as there usually is in Stephen King's horror stories but the prologue was cut out by a producer.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King has had plenty PLENTY of great short story adaptions that could have been brought to the screen by 1985 especially since his book Skeleton Crew came out the same year. CAT'S EYE is a three part anthology of short story adaptions. Weather these are all his I'm not sure but I do know that this is not the best of his work if these are his. The movie opens up with the best tale out of the way first. QUITTERS INC tells the story of a man who wants to quit smoking but needs help doing this. He goes to the independently run company Quitters Inc for help. This will prove to be a big mistake as this company takes quitting smoking very seriously. And by seriously I'm talking about stalking and making you see things that aren't there in order to get you to quit smoking. I'm so glad I don't smoke I don't have to worry about the rising cost of cigarettes this company should be the least of his worries. The next story a bit weak is called The Ledge. A man must walk around an entire ledge of a tall building to win over another mans wife. To this day its a bit puzzling. A weak story but just enough material so that you don't get bored. The final story to the entry is The General. The General is the cat who just may be the hero of the movie. This cats mission is simple Protect a little girl from whatever the hell that is on the other side of her wall. Can this four pawed pussy save this childs life or will the cats nine lives be up? In CAT'S EYE's defense I do like how the stories are evenly divided up. That is each story is just over a half hour long a piece on average. The problem is is that the stories just don't have enough strength to make this film a whole. The violence is kept at a bare minimum however some scenes can still be downright terrifying so don't take the rating too lightly on this one. Bottom line This movie is for fans only for Stephen King lovers. I think that message got to us in the beginning thanks so much for opening the movie with a Cujo chase stopped by the Christine car! And the final scene of the movie? I can't tell you if that was cute or just plain creepy! I can't believe I'm undecided on that.".

He looks for those that had framed him  seeking vendetta . As Ted Giuliano Gemma who recently died by car accident freeing the town from a powerful owner Conrado San Martin  a great friend to Sergio Leone  he played a lot of films for him  usually as secondary actor and a corrupt Sheriff Douglas Francisco Rabal  Luis Buuel's customary's player married to Ted's old girlfriend Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott  using both gunning down and shrewdness .This TortillaSpaghetti Western is filled with action  thrills  horse riding  brawls and crossfire . This is a decent Spaghetti starred by Giuliano Gemma  a hero who after years of hard labor in a hellish prison in the desert  escapes from jail to seek revenge on the three men who framed him . Giuliano steals the show as a merciless revenger  executing thespian skills  bounds and leaps  twists and shooting and throughly enjoys himself . Recently deceased Giuliano Gemma is very fine in his ordinary role as a gunfighter who seeks vengeance against his eternal enemies  Conrado San Martin  Francisco Rabal  and their hoodlums . Giuliano Gemma  along with Anthony Steffen and Gianni Garco  resulted to be one of the greatest stars of the Spaghetti genre . Gemma in his beginning worked as a stuntman  practiced many sports in his life boxing gymnastics such as is well proved at the movie . Then the director Duccio Tessari gave him the first role as protagonist in the film  The Titani and the first spaghetti western films where he often worked under the name of Montgomery Wood  playing Western as A pistol for Ringo The return of Ringo and others as Adios Gringo Arizona Colt The price of power  Day of anger and later California. However his first big opportunity came with the important Italian director Luchino Visconti in El Gatopardo this was followed by important roles in Angelica  Tenebre  Young Lions and The master touch. Then he played his most significant roles in Il Deserto Dei Tartari and Il Prefetto Di Ferro . While Conrado San Martin played in Winchester Bill In a colt's shadow and various Westerns directed by his friend Sergio Leone  furthermore  he starred several Peplum and thrillers . In the movie appears usual Western support actors as Spanish people  Nieves Navarro  Milo Quesada  Manuel Muiz Pajarito  as Italian players as Ivan Scratuglia . It's a coproduction SpanishItalian and shot on location in Zaragoza  Barcelona  Alfonso Balcazar studios and of course Almeria  Spain . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction  excellent production design  and atmospheric cinematography by Francisco Marin  he creates a magnificent scenario on the little town and barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun . The music original by Armando Trovajoli composes an agreeable Spaghetti soundtrack  being well conducted and splendid leitmotif  it's full of enjoyable sounds and emotive score .This Western was inspired by the known and classic novel titled The count of Montecristo written by Alexandre Dumas . Other Spaghetti freely based on famous novels and plays are the followings  The Fury of Johnny Kid based on Shakespeare  being directed by Gianni Puccini with Peter Lee Lawrence and Cristina Galbo from Romeo and Giuletta . Furthermore  Johnny Hamlet1968 by Enzo G Castellari  The return of Ringo by Duccio Tessari also with Giuliano Gemma and inspired on the Odyssey John Il Bastardo1967 with John Richardson  based on books from Zorrilla and Moliere  Anche Nel West Cra Una Volta Dio  1968 by Marino Girolami based on Island of treasure written by Robert Stevenson and Apocalypse Joe with Anthony Steffen based on Macbeth and Hamlet .The flick also titled Days of Vengeance or Long Days of Vengeance or The Deadliest Gunfight or Vendetta was professionally directed by Stan Vance or Florestano Vancini . This Italian writer  filmmaker so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . His best films dealt with political events such as The case Matteotti The long night in 43 and Sicilian Jaque Mate  . He usually worked with Giulianno Gemma  his fetish actor  such as La Baraonda  Violenza Al sole and this Long days of vengeance . Rating  Good Spaghetti Western  it will appeal to Giuliano Gemma fans .".

The plot does not offer any surprise and sooner the viewer knows who the killers are.

I have seen most of Gemma's westerns and they have all been very good. This one is no exception.The music score is superb. It's good enough to want to buy the soundtrack if you can find it. The credits listed on my copy say the music is by Armando Trovaioli. IMDb's listing also credits Ennio Morricone. It's no surprise that Morricone had something to do with this score because it is definitely that good.The action is a bit slow during the first 70 minutes of the movie but the story keeps you interested and when the action heats up it gets even better. The acting is pretty decent overall. The dialogue is a bit confusing in a couple of places probably due to a poor translation of the original Italian into English but it's pretty minor and doesn't interfere at all with ones ability to understand what's going on.IMDb lists the US version as being 90 minutes long. My copy runs for 103 minutes. Perhaps it is the UK release.Another reviewer states that this movie has a Gothic horror atmosphere. I don't really see that in this film. If it is there it is not nearly to the extent that one sees in Stranger's Gundown Django the Bastard or And God Said to Cain. I recommend this movie to all spaghetti western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The memorable main theme of composer Armando Trovaioli's sole Western score a slow and stately trumpet soaring over acoustic guitar and rolling percussion kicks off 1966's Long Days Of Vengeance.As 2 prisoners carry out a daring escape from a harsh brutal military prison....we get our first look at Ted Barnett...... who as we discover later is serving his 3rd year of a sentence of 30 at hard labor...framed for the murder of an Army Colonel...as part of an elaborate plan involving  including the murder of his father....slave labor..gun running..  the ownership  control of a railroad.The story quotes quite clearly from it's inspiration .... The Count of Monte Cristo. Guiliano Gemma as Barnett..looking very much like the imprisoned Edmond Dantes....plots revenge against those who betrayed him. After making his escape ...and a NOT your typical day at the barber shop...he manages to find some helpers for his plan to exact revenge...from a traveling medicine show..who are VERY aware of the 10000 bounty now on his head.The only Western directed by Florestano Vancini ........he makes use of a good plot...with definite noirish elements fall guy out for revenge.. the shady former lover  here played by Nieves Navarro  as the femme fatale who may have access to evidence implicating the conspirators............greed redemption and payback. It's a good story...one could see it used in an 40's BW potboiler...as well as a lean mean 50s American Western..but here it gets the Spaghetti treatment. ...there's even a bit of ninja fare thrown in..to good effect I might add..as it plays into the final showdown..from which some will walk away unbowed but none will walk away unbloodied.Of course no Gemma film would be complete without the former stuntman's trademark athleticism.....he shows off his gymnast roots...but this is a slightly darker Gemma...the smile  the humor are there.....but also the grit of an avenger as one by one the conspirators are confronted......as evidenced by the lengths to which he'll go as he attempts to set the sides up for a fall...and by what he sets himself up for to carry out his plan.A good supporting cast....which atypically for most Italian Westerns features 2 strong female supporting characters...the fetching Navarro....and a nice turn by Gabriella Giorgelli as the aptly named sweet but feisty Dulcie...who proves equally adept w a guitar or rifle.The catchy  varied score contains a variety of themes  influences...ranging from Morricone to Toots Thielman's harmonica soundtracks. The stunning main theme appeared in Tarantino's Kill Bill during the Origin of ORen Ishii anime sequence. An interesting story..well told.. badly dubbed... nicely filmed....a nice fit somewhere in the middle of anyone's Spaghetti Western collection.Recommended.".

Days Of Vengeance of 1967 a Spaghetti Western based on The Count Of Monte Christo is certainly an enjoyable film but it is nevertheless quite a bit overrated among my fellow fans of the Italian Western. I personally found the movie great in the beginning but it gets a lot weaker throughout the second half as far as I am considered.Ted Barnett Gemma who has been wrongfully convicted to 30 years of heavy labour for the murder of his father escapes his brutal desert prison camp and longing for nothing but to take revenge on his father's real murderers who had put the blame on him...As mentioned above I really liked the first half of the movie a lot. Gemma's character Ted Barnett is a typical antihero driven by his desire for revenge. Unfortunately as the movie goes on Barnett becomes more and more of a 'good guy' who wants justice and peace rather than just to take revenge. One of the greatest qualities of Days Of Vengeance is the score especially the main theme by Ennio Morricone which Quentin Tarantino used in Kill Bill almost four decades later. Giuliano Gemma is cool as always in the lead beautiful Nieves Navarro who has been in quite a few Italian Westerns including Sergio Sollima's The Big Gundown 1966 plays her role very well most of the other supporting performances are also OK although not particularly breathtaking. Overall Days Of Vengeance is entertaining enough but in my opinion slightly overrated by some of my fellow Spaghetti Western fans.".

This movie initially should have been directed by Duccio Tessari director of the 2 Ringo movies both with Gemma but he had'n the time to do it so the producers took Stan Vance. The plot is quite interesting even if it is a simple revenge story you get little by little to know why the main character searches revenge and it's never obvious what is going to happen next. The photography and the make up of the movie are not so good but it has nice desert landscapes and a good music score. So for all the spaghetti Western fans this is highly recommended but possibly in a uncut version I even have a German version of this movie running just 100 min but it's not the same thing when something is missing even if it's not strictly necessary.".

The story is somewhat confusing with some key details seemingly left out. Also the movie is way too long at 111 minutes. If it had been cut by twenty to thirty minutes I think it would have run a lot better.Those problems however did not stop me from enjoying the movie... though I am a die hard spaghetti western fan.

One highlight of this is the amount of cameos by well known faces who seem to be doing this film for the craic. The cab driver reacts well to the madness surrounding him  you can almost share his tiredness at the end of the shift.

Then I saw a guy in a cab on BBC and the colors of the movie seemed okay You know when a movie is really dumb or bad it often has intense and bright colors. I wasn't doing anything at the moment so I left it on. Then I became more and more interested in it and decided to turn of the computer and focus only on the movie. I think this is a movie that truly represents the spirit of Christmas although I am still not sure what the hell that may be I'm sure this is it. Paul Dillon whom I did not know beforehand plays his character brilliantly. He's a quiet guy who somehow got into the job of cabdriver. He has to work on Christmaseve and he gets all these strange people in his cab who tell him about what happened to them lately and that's it! Fantastic. From there you see him trying to say the right things and that maybe is the most beautiful thing about this movie. The movie is really easy going you can just sit do nothing just watch and let it pass by. Therefore when watched alone late at night at Christmastime this is the perfect movie for the moment and deserves 10 out of 10 points.".

Although we don't really get to know much about the cab driver the viewer nevertheless feels some sort of attachment to him.

It was highly enjoyable and often comedic while at the same time thoughtprovoking and meaningful on a real life level.  Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is spotting the famous faces who turn up like Laurie Metcalf Michael Ironside John Cusak Gillian Anderson and most impressively Julianne Moore.  It is Moore's part that sparks the greatest conversation in the film examining the limits of human ability.

Probably 99 times out of 100 it's a false alarm but the 100th time...At the end of the film I sympathised with the cabbie where he's worn out he's got the echoes of dozens of conversations in his head and he's had some good times and some bad times.

Paul Dillon blew me away in this movie and it's rather awkward that he isn't in more movies. When you watch this movie and you see him for the first 5 minutes myself I thought 'typical cab driver'. And that is the beauty. Because the entire movie in my opinion begins with a generalization. A generalization of all things a cab driver. film making genius if you ask me So then we see this rather vulgar looking man perform his day to day job which entails hearing peoples problems and for brief moments becoming a part of them. Now like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the end of the movie showcases a person in its purest form. When the driver feels terrible about charging the girl Julianne Moore and the black man says you're a cab driver it hit me like something beyond this world. The driver was struck with a sense of grief and emotion. That what makes his character so SO good. He tries so hard to be a good person and learns who he is all in a day's work. Putting myself in the shoes of the driver in the movie throughout that day I would feel so bizarre at the end of the night. I think my mind would be full throttle and going at 100 miles a minute. And then we think about the beginning and how we figured this guy was just another lowly cabbie. Very compelling. Watch this movie.  Cheers".

All are played with conviction by a large number of talented actors ranging from the virtually unknown to very familiar faces in cameos.One of these wellknown faces is Gillian Anderson. It's fun to see her as a foulmouthed Southside girl a nice break from her prim proper Agent Scully persona. Also worthy of mention is Reggie Hayes as Dillon's final fare of the day. The dialogue between the two men is touching and provides a necessary respite from the overall dire yet entertaining tone of the film.I hope Will Kern graces the screen with another effort. This was adapted from his play of the same name and I'd like to see more from him.As a final note the video title Hellcab is perhaps misleading.

	schema:reviewBody "As the years go by this cabdriver gets less and less for the rides he's giving. Lousey tips! Oooh! Seeing the movie for the fourth time now prompts a review. This driver I always like but riders in there with himquite a few I don't. I must fast forward so as to not sit in there sharing the same cab with these inconsiderates.The cabbie is eventempered and tries to help people perhaps too much. One is a Steve who happens to be a deli chain executive fortunate to have the full attention of his date. He seems responsive and only later when she leaves does this man reveal the true intentions he has about hershe is meaningless to him she is being classically used. In this film the driver suffers the same fate he is used... used by a crack head to score dope used by a woman who has car trouble and causes trouble for the driver of her cab. Then too a body shop wants 185 to put on a new rear door pull with ash tray thus perhaps totaling more than Dillon the driver's total take for the day. He boldly takes it upon himself to often assist. He buys a young woman a donut informs Steve's date she is a plaything and while a woman ascends normal steps back to her apartment following a rape and subsequent abrupt discharge from the police station he sits in his cab still serving her by watching until she's through the door. Sometimes he's physically touched by his fares and hates it but with the architect who sings Tannenbaum better than any German ever would he extends a handshake that seems never to end.

	onyx:emotionText "As the years go by this cabdriver gets less and less for the rides he's giving. Lousey tips! Oooh! Seeing the movie for the fourth time now prompts a review. This driver I always like but riders in there with himquite a few I don't. I must fast forward so as to not sit in there sharing the same cab with these inconsiderates.The cabbie is eventempered and tries to help people perhaps too much. One is a Steve who happens to be a deli chain executive fortunate to have the full attention of his date. He seems responsive and only later when she leaves does this man reveal the true intentions he has about hershe is meaningless to him she is being classically used. In this film the driver suffers the same fate he is used... used by a crack head to score dope used by a woman who has car trouble and causes trouble for the driver of her cab. Then too a body shop wants 185 to put on a new rear door pull with ash tray thus perhaps totaling more than Dillon the driver's total take for the day. He boldly takes it upon himself to often assist. He buys a young woman a donut informs Steve's date she is a plaything and while a woman ascends normal steps back to her apartment following a rape and subsequent abrupt discharge from the police station he sits in his cab still serving her by watching until she's through the door. Sometimes he's physically touched by his fares and hates it but with the architect who sings Tannenbaum better than any German ever would he extends a handshake that seems never to end.

It was a strange little independent production one about a Chicago cab driver's strange passengers in the course of one Christmas night. It somewhat reminds me of the cool cult classic 'Night on Earth' which is similarly about cab drivers and their passengers except in an international focus with each of the five stories taking place in five different cities and emphasizing the ironic or humbling differences between the drivers and the passengers they engage in discussion with. This is somewhat similar in that respect where the cab driver is pitted against some of the strangest passengers who's few moments in his cab generate much anecdote worthy material.There is no main plot. It is just an array of characters passing in and out of scenes and our lone constant is the somewhat frustrated cab driver. The film is a nice distraction although viewers might find the incessant strange and overlyaggressive nature of several random passengers to be redundant or tedious. But just like 'Night on Earth' this is probably destined for some measure of cult fame which is already evident from the comments posted here on IMDb. The sheer outrageousness of the events and some of the conversation are likely to generate some laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's Christmastime in Chicago but the season is not very merry for the cab driver whose name we never learn. He ends up driving a number of quirky characters to places around the city and a lot of his experiences are not particularly pleasant. And the arm rest on one side of the back seat keeps falling off despite the driver's best efforts.This was a pretty good movie though not really the type I usually enjoy watching. I think it will appeal to a certain kind of person. All the acting performances were good and though I can't single anyone out as the best I really liked the first lawyer and the architect. The scene with the architect may have been the best in the entire movie.The sound went out a number of times during this moviebut it was often obvious what characters were saying. In a couple of cases I think the expression used could be abbreviated F. Y. I'm happier when substitute words are used on network TV though in this movie maybe it would have been too much work to fix the incredible number of bad words. I liked one scene where the driver said a bad word which of course I couldn't hear and a child walking by said to the adult with him or her probably a parent or grandparent 'He said !' I didn't like a lot of the music but there were several good songs. One was played when the two white drivers and the black driver were discussing whether they should refuse to pick up certain people. Another was used for the scene with the second lawyer. And of course 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' played near the end was very enjoyable for me. The credits listed a lot of Christmas songs that I didn't really notice. The decorations were nice. Few people in this movie seemed to be enjoying Christmas though.This was a worthwhile film but if you're not lucky enough to see it cleaned up for TV be prepared for some rough language.".

	schema:reviewBody "Net Worth is a very compelling story about 4 men in their mid30's who make a bet to see who will have the greatest net worth after one month. The catch they must all start over in a new city with no background just 100 and the clothes on their backs. It's a marvelous exploration of how the men come to evaluate themselves and their relationships through this process of surviving as fish out of water. Most importantly it never becomes sappy. These seem like real guys with some of the same issues as friends of mine and the story feels kind of like City Slickers with an edge.  Michael T. Weiss is riveting as Michael Winslow a charming ladies' man.  Daniel Baldwin is perfect as the smarmy stockbroker Robert Freedman.  Highly recommended and it will be appreciated by men and women alike.".

At the end we don't even find out what happens to all the slutty women in the movie. The director just treats them as the one two night stands and drops them off as such. Shame!

It's an intriguing film something different and appealing even though some of the subject matter is inappropriate.I saw the last word because it involves a 13yearold boy whose hormones are raging and his brief relationship with a grown woman. There is one sex scene that may make people squirm a bit so be forewarned. Other than that I don't remember anything else objectionable.I like the photography and always enjoy seeing the old days  here it's the 1920s and 1930s  portrayed on today's films with the great cameramen and directors of today. Also the South has some beautiful scenery that is eloquently on display here.The story is wellacted with reallife motherdaughter Diane Ladd and Laura Dern along with Robert Duvall and Lukas Haas. The latter plays the young man and was already somewhat of a star after playing the young Amish boy in the 1985 film Witness. Duvall is one of the finest actors of his generation so you always get a good performance out of him.This is a pretty lowkey story but never puts you to sleep. Modern day feminists might like this film was Ladd plays that role to the hilt. Dern also delivered making a very believable Rose.".

Although the film was edited for time as all films are the DVD provided more background information about the story through the commentary provided. Although I've never read the book  watching it again has made me decide that I want to. I count this movie with others of its' kind TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD FRIED GREEN TOMATOES THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER to name a few as providing a wonderful opportunity to become a part of another's family memory. These kind of movies are capable of evoking in us a remembrance of our own childhood and bringing out feelings of warmth and caring that many of us have in common.I highly recommend it for its beautiful photography and wonderful music.".

I find it irksome  and confusing. I would have preferred a different actor in that part a la Leslie Howard from the forties.The sepia cinematography was breathtaking and the street scenes amazing as were the two actors who played the younger children.The wraparound of the story didn't work at all. Rose deserved more that a verbal dismissal at the end. And the mother vanished inexplicably. Now there was a character. Too bad the viewer wasn't respected a little more.6 out of 10 for all that.".

The casting is attractive but no one is given much of a character to work with. The title role gives Laura Dern a vehicle for some overripe histrionics but despite her promiscuity Rose is simply one saint in a family of saints and every conflict quickly disappears to allow them all a chance to live happily ever after Rose is even spared the consequences of her constant physical 'search for affection' by a convenient inability to bear children.

She's sheltered by a family who are just like an ordinary family down the road but when she needs them stand up for her never caring about the so called caretakers of morals and virtues. A very intersting study if deep rooted charcters played equally well by the actors. 2 characters stand apart in the film one of the girl Rose played brilliantly by Laura Dern and of the mother played by Laura's real mom Diane Ladd. Robert Duvall is very believable as the head of the family in the southern in the 1930s. I liked the gentle pace of the movie and its buildup towards the end where Diane garners herself for a confrontation with the self proclaimed keepers of the virtues including her own husband. I like the way their Diane's and Robert's characters undergo transformations small ones but enough to keep the audience attached to the film at an emotional level. Even days after watching the movie you'd have the images of the cheerful sometimes confused lively and lovely Rose flashing in front of your eyes. And that's makes the use of a narrative which some people didn't like about this movie so appropriate. If I had known someone like Rose in my lifetime I would definately told this story to everybody I knew many times over.".

It's a story that for that period of time has probably been played out thousands of times in real life all over the country. A young girl without a family to raise her in those times is a real tragedy and Rose was doing the best she could..very lucky to even get the job and the home.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie gives a eyeopening glimpse of the 1930's and a hidden agenda of a very moralistic time. It is a charming story of the maid's attempt to walk the line between her own natural inclinations and the societies expectations for her. Laura Dern offers a very realistic and convincing performance that marks her as a great character actress. The interaction with her own mother in the supporting cast shows a natural adaptation to a role that is rare in such a young actress. Duvall is wonderful in a role that demands a vast understanding of human emotion and character study of his part. The set and old automobiles lend a real authenticity to this period in history. It takes you back to a simpler time but underscores all of the attitudes of the time. This is a movie to be enjoyed again and again at each opportunity. I highly recommend it.".

Carroll Baker plays a postulant in a convent who meets an English soldier Roger Moore during the Napoleonic wars in Spain. They both fall in love with each other and she goes to follow him leaving the convent. A Virgin Mary statue that she treats as her mother figure she is an orphan comes to life and takes her place during her absence. The postulant becomes separated from the English soldier and later becomes attached to different peoples in Spain gypsies a matador and a wealthy benefactor and becomes a singing star and dancer. She appears to cause the death of people who she comes close to. Eventually she and the English soldier are reunited in Belgium but the battle of Waterloo separates them again. She fears that she will also cause the death of the English soldier and decides to leave him in order to spare his life and to return to the convent. Upon her return the statue returns to its original location and the surrounding area's drought of several years during her absence comes to an end.The movie has a very stirring musical score and are well portrayed by Carroll Baker Roger Moore Walter Slezak and Victorio Gassman. The many different battle scenes bullfights singing and dancing performances are handled very well. Carroll Baker is better known for her more risque acting roles in other films and her different role here is a nice change of pace. The movie as a whole keeps up the plot and story flow very well. It keeps you interested throughout the film. My only gripe with the film is how the religious aspect was taken to conflict with the postulant's wayward tendencies. From my own personal raising as a Catholic the miracle did not make sense to me. The underlying message of the miracle seemed to imply that the postulant's departure from the convent had broken a sacred covenant with the Virgin Mary. It was as if she must stay there or else cause pain and death to those outside in the world. I have a relative who had entered a convent and said that she also did not understand the meaning of this movie regarding the miracle. When you are a postulant you are not technically a full fledged nun so you can at any point in time decide to leave on your own choice. You are only a nun in training during this stage. When you transition to becoming a novitiate is when you receive the habit uniform and have your hair cut. Even at this stage you have not yet reached the final profession stage taking the formal vows of poverty chastity and obedience. When she threw off her religious garments the atmosphere became stormy as if she had done something unnatural. The drought which occurred during her absence also hinted that there was anger at her leaving the convent. This runs counter to a forgiving and understanding God. I guess the fatalistic theme was something that I don't quite accept but that is my own personal opinion. Perhaps it was meant to be similar to the agony in the garden that Jesus endured before he was crucified? Jesus questioned what was going to happen to him and had to eventually come to terms with his upcoming death.".

	schema:headline " The Problems Of Circus Movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "The decline of the Marx Brothers does not begin with ROOM SERVICE which is hysterical at it's conclusion but with AT THE CIRCUS. Groucho always insisted that had Irving Thalberg lived his care would have made the other films in the contract after A DAY AT THE RACES as good as that and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. This meant that the film had to be taken on the road as a Vaudeville show and the material tested carefully. But Thalberg was dead and Louis B. Mayer was quite unsympathetic to these three clowns who were...well clowns and who had gotten too good a sweetheart contract from Thalburg in terms of profits. Mayer thought of comedians as interchangeable and could not care about allowing talented ones to test their material  you hand them a script and that was that they are paid to make it funny. If they don't you fire them.So it is traditional to blame AT THE CIRCUS GO WEST and THE BIG STORE on Mayer's hostility. That hostility played a major role there is just no denying it but in the case of AT THE CIRCUS there is another point that is frequently overlooked. In movies by comedians it was rare for a circus comedy to be really funny. W.C.Fields YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN was an exception  a truly funny circus comedy but it's strength was the film record of Field's radio feud with ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy. Had it been set in a movie studio or a bank or a foreign country it would have been just as successful. But other comedians were not as lucky. Charlie Chaplin worked two years on THE CIRCUS and while a good film it was not the great film he hoped to make. The atmosphere of a circus should have been inviting to comics  after all here clowns were really clowns. But for some reason the special needs of movie funnymen were hard to translate into the atmosphere of the big top. Possibly the best use of the big top as a comic background was in Laurel  Hardy's short film THE CHIMP. The first quarter of the film shows how they wreck the circus which was on it's last legs anyway. But the remaining three quarters of the film deal with the boys problems with a rooming house owned by a jealous Billy Gilbert and the title chimp they hope to sell to a zoo.With the Marxes the circus just does not absorb them too much. Groucho is there hired as a lawyer to assist Kenny Baker and his pal Chico. Harpo as Chico's brother is a circus roustabout. But there is little example of their involvement in the circus life of the troop or of the animals Harpo should have been involved with circus horses anyway. Bits of the film are actually quite good  like Chico and Harpo trying to find papers in Nat Pendleton's the circus strongman's room. They manage to turn it into a Christmas nightmare for poor Pendleton. And Groucho certainly has two great moments the business of trying to get on the circus train without knowing the password even one of the animals knows the password and his singing Lydia The Tattooed Lady.There were some cuts apparently. Groucho had a sequence where his trial skills were shown in a court presided over by Edgar Kennedy. One wishes they had kept that in the film.

	onyx:emotionText "The decline of the Marx Brothers does not begin with ROOM SERVICE which is hysterical at it's conclusion but with AT THE CIRCUS. Groucho always insisted that had Irving Thalberg lived his care would have made the other films in the contract after A DAY AT THE RACES as good as that and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. This meant that the film had to be taken on the road as a Vaudeville show and the material tested carefully. But Thalberg was dead and Louis B. Mayer was quite unsympathetic to these three clowns who were...well clowns and who had gotten too good a sweetheart contract from Thalburg in terms of profits. Mayer thought of comedians as interchangeable and could not care about allowing talented ones to test their material  you hand them a script and that was that they are paid to make it funny. If they don't you fire them.So it is traditional to blame AT THE CIRCUS GO WEST and THE BIG STORE on Mayer's hostility. That hostility played a major role there is just no denying it but in the case of AT THE CIRCUS there is another point that is frequently overlooked. In movies by comedians it was rare for a circus comedy to be really funny. W.C.Fields YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN was an exception  a truly funny circus comedy but it's strength was the film record of Field's radio feud with ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy. Had it been set in a movie studio or a bank or a foreign country it would have been just as successful. But other comedians were not as lucky. Charlie Chaplin worked two years on THE CIRCUS and while a good film it was not the great film he hoped to make. The atmosphere of a circus should have been inviting to comics  after all here clowns were really clowns. But for some reason the special needs of movie funnymen were hard to translate into the atmosphere of the big top. Possibly the best use of the big top as a comic background was in Laurel  Hardy's short film THE CHIMP. The first quarter of the film shows how they wreck the circus which was on it's last legs anyway. But the remaining three quarters of the film deal with the boys problems with a rooming house owned by a jealous Billy Gilbert and the title chimp they hope to sell to a zoo.With the Marxes the circus just does not absorb them too much. Groucho is there hired as a lawyer to assist Kenny Baker and his pal Chico. Harpo as Chico's brother is a circus roustabout. But there is little example of their involvement in the circus life of the troop or of the animals Harpo should have been involved with circus horses anyway. Bits of the film are actually quite good  like Chico and Harpo trying to find papers in Nat Pendleton's the circus strongman's room. They manage to turn it into a Christmas nightmare for poor Pendleton. And Groucho certainly has two great moments the business of trying to get on the circus train without knowing the password even one of the animals knows the password and his singing Lydia The Tattooed Lady.There were some cuts apparently. Groucho had a sequence where his trial skills were shown in a court presided over by Edgar Kennedy. One wishes they had kept that in the film. The poor portions mostly tied to the sickeningly sweet and naive Kenny Baker fighting the crooked James Burke are overwhelming. At least Groucho was able to have another session with Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Dukesberry Baker's aunt and poor Margaret gets shot out of a cannon in the end. But the drab spots outnumber the good ones. Not too bad but still just mediocre as a result.";

No joke flops in this Marx Brothers masterpiece. All three of the remaining brothers Groucho Harpo and Chico have a plethora of great scenes. Groucho has possibly his best line of his entire career. I won't ruin it for you. Chico's best moments are as Chiccolini in Duck Soup but he is nearly as funny here. The scene in the midget's room is as funny a set piece as ever existed. Chico also has a great piano scene. Harpo is hilarious as well playing a card game with a seal and he delivers his best harp number. Usually they're awful but the one here is great. He plays ambassador to the races again in this film as he did in A Day at the Races. He dances around with a group of black people who show up out of nowhere. These scenes might be dated but they're excellent in their context. I'd call them both scenes of great beauty showing harmony between the races. Margaret Dumont the fifth Marx Brother  well maybe we out to call her the fourth she's in more of them than Zeppo is!  is as funny as usual. The only let down is the romantic subplot but you probably come to expect that from Marx Brothers' films. Perhaps the one here will be funny to you. The guy is one of the biggest dorks in history. His girl isn't too bad though. She has a great musical number with a horse. But even the two together have a decent scene where they sing to each other while they are desperately trying to lose a waiter who's intently watching their courtship. At the Circus contains maybe the best climactic sequence of their career with the three brothers Dumont the villain and a gorilla swing around on the trapeze swings. The final shot is a doozy as well. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Roll Out the Barrel of Fun Chico!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Brothers themselves are a maniacal circus so it is only fitting that they would be the stars of the MGM feature At the Circus and for a latterday Marx Bros. film this one is very good in my opinion. Groucho as usual is uninhibited with wordplay sexual innuendo and insults for his consistent foil Margaret Dumont but try not to be distracted by Groucho's awful hairpiece. Bearing the snazzy name of J. Cheever Loophole Groucho supposedly portrays an attorney hired to help a traveling circus recover its stolen income. As circus employees Harpo and Chico are allotted plenty of opportunities to apply their unique brands of comedy. And the two romantic leads played by Kenny Baker as Jeff Wilson circus owner and Florence Rice as Julie Randall performer are very likable except for that really corny musical number called Two Blind Loves that they sing together Step Up and Take a Bow is considerably better. The rest of the cast like the circus itself is quite colorful.Probably the greatest highlight of At the Circus is Groucho's vocalizing one of his most beloved standbys for the remainder of his career Lydia the Tattooed Lady! As you listen to Groucho as Mr. Loophole sing the tune notice how everyone else around him particularly Harpo joins in the barrel of fun. Other highlights Did I just say barrel? Well Chico as Antonio Tony Ferrelli provides his oneofakind ivorytickling rendition of the Beer Belly er the Beer Barrel Polka complete with his hardtoresist smile and wink to the camera. It amazes me that Chico was able to smile at all what with the enormous wads of cash he blew away with his compulsive gambling. Punchy Harpo plays checkers while a friendly seal coaches him. Loophole and Antonio go through a badge bit at the train station during which the puns  horseplay never stop. While Loophole is trying to trap a cigarsmoking little person into a confession Antonio is too dimwitted to realize that he is bungling Loophole's plan. The wild ropetrapeze chase at the end to the musical accompaniment of Tiger Rag is hilarious particularly with Gibraltar the gorilla starting the whole commotion. And although AfricanAmericans today would be outraged seeing people of their race degrading themselves in this film I must admit that Swingali is not a bad jazz number.A few gags in At the Circus don't really work particularly the lengthy sequence of Tony and Punchy searching a bedroom belonging to an arrogant muscle man but not to worry.

	onyx:emotionText "The Marx Brothers themselves are a maniacal circus so it is only fitting that they would be the stars of the MGM feature At the Circus and for a latterday Marx Bros. film this one is very good in my opinion. Groucho as usual is uninhibited with wordplay sexual innuendo and insults for his consistent foil Margaret Dumont but try not to be distracted by Groucho's awful hairpiece. Bearing the snazzy name of J. Cheever Loophole Groucho supposedly portrays an attorney hired to help a traveling circus recover its stolen income. As circus employees Harpo and Chico are allotted plenty of opportunities to apply their unique brands of comedy. And the two romantic leads played by Kenny Baker as Jeff Wilson circus owner and Florence Rice as Julie Randall performer are very likable except for that really corny musical number called Two Blind Loves that they sing together Step Up and Take a Bow is considerably better. The rest of the cast like the circus itself is quite colorful.Probably the greatest highlight of At the Circus is Groucho's vocalizing one of his most beloved standbys for the remainder of his career Lydia the Tattooed Lady! As you listen to Groucho as Mr. Loophole sing the tune notice how everyone else around him particularly Harpo joins in the barrel of fun. Other highlights Did I just say barrel? Well Chico as Antonio Tony Ferrelli provides his oneofakind ivorytickling rendition of the Beer Belly er the Beer Barrel Polka complete with his hardtoresist smile and wink to the camera. It amazes me that Chico was able to smile at all what with the enormous wads of cash he blew away with his compulsive gambling. Punchy Harpo plays checkers while a friendly seal coaches him.

	schema:reviewBody "I used to think that At the Circus was the worst Marx Brothers movie but that was before my exposure to the agonies of Room Service. It's one of the worst at any rate. The action starts off with bad rearscreen projection and a tedious musical number involving characters we don't even know yet. Can't you just hear an ill wind blowing through these early scenes seeming to whisper this movie's gonna suuuuck? Well I can. It's almost fifteen minutes before Groucho turns up and nearly an hour before Margaret Dumont makes an appearance. Somebody better bring me a beer or ten to dull the boredom...Ah but I complain overmuch. There is still good material here diamonds in the rough. Though Groucho delivers his lines like he only first read the script yesterday and didn't like it much he comes alive as soon as he's alone with Dumont. And Harpo really shines in a mediocre vehicle like this his antics are alway charming even in the midst of his brothers dropping bombs. Certain segments  searching the strongman's room walking on the ceiling with Eve Arden  work wonderfully. Trouble is the thing doesn't hang together as a whole mostly because I don't care about the characters played by Kenny Baker and Florence Rice.Ah the young couple  the albatross around the neck of all late Marx Brothers movies. Whereas I could tolerate the likes of Allan Jones Baker comes across cloying and stupid and he's got one of those heliumsucker voices that just drives me up the wall. Rice is pretty  pretty enough that I wonder why she's got such a loser boyfriend  but what does she actually do? Our resident couple barely even interacts with the Marx Brothers so I have a hard time believing that they're all friends much less that they'd be so invested in each others' fates. A Night at the Opera did the same plot better.And so in my generosity I bestow the big two stars on this movie. I like it for the same reason I like Rocky IV it's more footage in a good series. Not necessarily good footage but more. And it's more enjoyable than both a work and b going to a poetry reading at my grad school so I guess it's got to be worth something.".

The brothers are all in good form here although they're mostly reworking old shtick. The scene in the midget's room is my favorite part. The obligatory lukewarm romance this time is supplied by Florence Rice and walleyed tenor Kenny Baker. The two also sing a couple of the movie's forgettable ArlenHarburg tunes. The only good song in this is also one of the movie's highlights Lydia the Tattooed Lady as performed by Groucho. A big plus in this movie's favor is the good supporting cast backing up the Marxes including Nat Pendleton in a Harpo wig James Burke Eve Arden and the always fun Margaret Dumont. It's an enjoyable movie if one lowers expectations and doesn't expect something on par with Duck Soup or A Night at the Opera.".

	schema:reviewBody "After 30 years I just rewatched this latterday Marx Brothers movie. After being loaned to RKO for Room Service the Marxes return to MGM without their beloved mentor there Irving Thalberg having died during their last hit picture there A Day at the Races. That movie was very enjoyable if a little long. This one is much shorter if not as funny. Still there's more than enough highlights here a couple of Chico and Groucho scenes like the needabadgetogetontrain and newcigarneededbutfromsuspectnotChico Groucho's number of Lydia the Tattooed Lady Harpo's number with some cool black singers mixed with his asalways touching harp solos Chico's piano playing and of course Groucho's wisecracks with Margaret Dumont the unofficial fourth Marx brother now that Zeppo left by this time. Oh and funny enough reunion with Nat Pendleton from Horse Feathers. Also Fritz Feld has an amusing bit as a symphony conductor. The romantic leads of Kenny Baker who I know from old broadcasts of radio's The Jack Benny Program and Florence Rice don't intrude too much so I didn't mind them or their singing. Oh and Eve Arden was also a hoot opposite the one and only Groucho. So on that note At the Circus is worth a look for any Marx fans out there still.".

Generally I also agree with that opinion though there are definitely many worthwhile moments in their last six films as well. And from those six At The Circus is arguably the best the only other possible contender is A Night In Casablanca. Although it suffers from the same flaws that plagued their other films of the period  mainly long redundant and in at least two cases even repeated ! musical numbers and a frantic climax that is more chaotic than funny  it also gives them some good material the badge skit the reconstruction of the crime the entrapment of the midget etc. and has a more energetic air than say Room Service or The Big Store. Their frequent costart Margaret Dumont doesn't appear until about an hour in the two romantic leads are largely forgettable but longlegged Eve Arden is notable for doing some of her acrobatic stunts herself. 12 out of 4.".

Their are the usual vices such as the the romantic subplot the sheer unbelievable fact that the brothers would actually help a circus that was badly in debt and apart from Groucho singing about Lydia the Tattooed Lady the songs are mundane and instantly forgettable. On the plus side however you have Groucho trying to get on to the circus train again trying and failing to get some money from a female trapeze artiste and of course a grand dinner party with Margaret Dumont. The two other brother Harpo and Chico also get some memorable moments particular when both of them play detective. Plus an unforgettable encounter with an orchestra. One of the most underrated Marx Brothers films from their stay at MGM.".
