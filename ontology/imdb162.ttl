Though their is the EverPresent crusty Captain that wants to have the license of the P.I. and the helpful insider Rockford Files Simon  Simon etc. etc. the movie has sometension and you don't find out the final twist until the end.  A few booboo's to look for When Linda is getting shot at in the alley she starts with the silver longbarrelled revolver from her boyfriend but it transmutes into a shortbarrelled blued handgun.  In her second appearance at the Union Hall she is braless and then has one on as she comes upon the crime scene where the Big Mouth's wife is killed.  I am told that 20 year old film that has sat undeveloped in a camera in an attic would probably not be able to be developed but no one was willing to say Absolutely Not. I applaud her for doing her own extended nude scene and not ripping us off with a body double. Most of the badges are authentic round Pittsburgh badges but at least one is a generic eagleontop badge.  All that being said rent it or buy it  it will be worth the price.".

I expected to sit down and watch a straight forward documentary  but this film is far from it. I think there is a new wave of young filmmakers who are really daring and this film certainly ranks up there. People in the audience were actually laughing throughout the film and there was a huge applause at the end am thinking this could be The Rocky Horror of Docs and screen at midnight theaters for years to come!!! The filmmakers show a real passion for their subjects which allows them to get close enough to them in a really subtle way. This is a world I didn't know existed and it is truly remarkable how sometimes films can present something in such a way that it takes your breath away. The scenes in Arizona are shocking yet the scenes in England are stunning. It is also quite funny and shockingly compelling at other times. Two very high thumbs up but not recommended for kids.".

This film tells the stories of young hopeful wannabe's and what they will do to try and become the next wrestling superstars of tomorrow.  With little money and lots of imagination these kids put on their shows sometimes in front of 1 or 2 people and act as if they are working the main event at WrestleMania in front of 50000 screaming fans.  The things they do may not be healthy and make you squirm but they want to prove that they have what it takes to make it in the big leagues.I dont want to give too much away but do keep your eye on the man named The Lizard.  His story is one of my favorites.  I would like to know what he is up to these days and if he is still going after his dream.  Paul Hough is a class act and has always been kind to me and deserves all the best after making such a great film.  If you liked Beyond the Mat I think you will find this more than satisfactory.  If you didn't see BTM give this a shot I think you will like it.  Brad Lee".

Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Well sadly there wasn't anything like that. The 3 stages of death part happens right from the beginning and its pretty much downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was pretty raw bare and unbiased. Not a bad thing but there is a narrator in this one. You'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary but he doesn't. Which would of been nice to have a message or reason for this doc.There was no real reason to have a narrator there should of been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes.It doesn't really explain the lives of these wrestlers either. It shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes which sound interesting but the reality isn't as great as it sounds. For instance mom watching her son wrestle with light bulbs and tacks for the first time at a public park. instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling They show her reacting to the camera instead of say a interview later on or just actually witnessing her reactions.Legitamit document wise this one ain't. The source material was flimsy to begin with. Nothing truly profound or interesting really happens. No conclusion to a few of the more interesting stories No real point or final thought to backyard wrestling edited together badly and its and its basically a cheap failed rip off of Beyond the Mat.Wrestling wise this is pretty boring. the better bumps are at the beginning and slowly become less amazing and shocking. If you have seen Japanese wrestling Indie wrestling or even Backyard Wrestling Dvds than this wont shock and awe you. If you want wrestling don't make the same mistake I did and see this one. Go get some CZW ECW or XPW Dvds instead.The only thing I got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be. Not for supporting self mutilation or doing dangerous stunts but their reasoning for committing these acts. The backyarders seem stupid for wrestling. Most of them are jobless and probably have a few issues in their head and wrestling is a type of therapy for them. Than the supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take the whole if ya cant beat em join em reasoning to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing themselves. School authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because its an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser extend doing drugs which is kinda funny since that segment took place in a rural town where like people live 20 miles from one another. People are stupid. Thats what I extracted from this documentary.If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts to someone brutalizing themselves in wrestling and basically what the back of this DVD promises get UNSCARRED the Life of Nick Mondo. Its more amazing and interesting than the Backyard and a lot more entertaining. Oh and its actually good.".

Since Draven and myself are backyard wrestlers this docu hit home very hard. The technical value of the film is about what you would expect a documentary about backyard wrestling would be. The subjects are interesting and the violence is very gruesome and intense. There are a lot of powerful moments in this film. It sheds some light onto a subculture that few know anything about. Like most other subjects there are those clichs and caricatures but this makes them completely human or inhuman in some cases. Even as a backyard wrestler myself I viewed many of these guys as plain stupid. I think if done with responsibility it makes me for a lot of entertainment and viewing. I might be biased when it comes to this considering I'm shooting a movie on the same subject and lived it for several years. My opinion of the film might be skewed but as a documentary it does what it sets out to do and that is bring you the viewer an informed view of a subject or world you perchance you have never seen before.

	schema:reviewBody "Once again the controversial subject of backyard wrestling makes it into the hallowed halls of The Two Sheds Review. This past Sunday March 12th Paul Hough's documentary The Backyard received it's British television premiere on digital station ITV4.Hough's documentary certainly makes for interesting viewing as he travels across America meeting a cast of characters that are both disturbing and compelling to watch at the same time. For instance there's the Gates brothers who stage fights in their mother's backyard and who come up with highly elaborate story lines involving their mother to explain their rivalry on videotape. There's also the 17 year old owner of Modesto Championship Wrestling billed as the Vince McMahon of the backyard scene who bosses his wrestlers around as if he owned their lives. There's an interesting scene where he chews out a young backyarder for arriving late then presents him with his opponent for the show a fat kid about three times his size.While there are those that don't support their children especially the mother who drags her son away from a match in a park the surprising thing is there are those who actively support what they do such as the parents of a youngster named Scar who underwent countless major surgeries as a child and an entire community in upstate New York that supports the local backyard federation. The only man who doesn't openly support them is the local high school wrestling coach.There's also a venture to my part of the world as Hough visits East Norfolk Backyard Wrestling located near Great Yarmouth a group of youngster I had considerable contact with a few years ago they wanted me to commentate on their videos an offer I naturally declined. Adam Yarco and his pals consider themselves superior to their American cousins and seem to delight in blading themselves to get the juice flowing.But perhaps the most compelling character of all is a 26 year old backyarder called The Lizard. With dreams of becoming a superstar we follow the Lizard around the circuit and to Las Vegas as he makes the final 250 for WWE's Tough Enough 2.It's the Lizard's encounter with the professional XRW promotion. It was interesting to watch as the Lizard was offered a professional debut but it's against a professionally trained shooter and he's asked to change his gimmick something that he's reluctant to do.In a fast food restaurant after the meeting he voices his fears to the camera of how the shoot fighter could cause him some serious harm and how he's considering pulling out of the match with a fake injury which he later does and while I could understand his concerns I couldn't help but think that he should have been voicing these concerns to his promoter rather than a film director. Later we see the Lizard attending a training school and making his professional debut.There's also a fleeting appearance from Rob Van dam who says what while he supports the backyard scene he thinks it should be more regulated which is something that everyone knows just isn't going to happen.In conclusion  while The Backyard makes for compelling viewing it's uneasy viewing at that. Seeing youngsters being put through burning tables and proud of the fact that they take bumps on broken glass still doesn't change my view of backyard wrestling. It's nothing more than disorganised chaos.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm seriously confused about how to properly write a critique on The Backwoods without being either overly negative or positive but nevertheless express my respect to the cast and crew for the film they intended to make. This is a genuine throwback to the era of 70's exploitation filmmaking with a truly grim atmosphere and uncompromising violence but at the same time it's completely unoriginal and derivative. I've read an extended interview with writerdirector Koldo Serra in which he declares that he doesn't understand why so many horror movies are being remade nowadays even though the originals aren't open for any kind of improvement. That might very well be true and Lord knows I wholeheartedly agree with such a statement but Serra goes so far in 'bringing homage' to the original classics that he practically copies them as well. The Backwoods isn't a remake of any existing 70's flick but it easily could have been since it bluntly borrows elements from Deliverance Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch. Cleverly set in the year 1978 so that the script at least didn't had to take into account malfunctioning mobile phones and navigation systems losing their signal The Backwoods revolves on two couples spending a little vacation deep in nearly impenetrable woods of the Spanish Basque region. Paul the oldest and wisest of the four bought the old house of his grandmother there and wants to show the beautiful region to his wife and friends. After some very unfriendly welcoming vibes in the local bar already the quartet faces the ultimate confrontation with the primitive backwoods community when Paul and Norman discover a neglected young girl chained up in a hidden cabin. The girl is the outgrowth of a humiliating family scandal and the local patriarch Paco so desperately want to keep her existence secret that he mobilizes the rest of the locals for an oldfashioned manhunt. The Backwoods is an uneven mishmash of a film in which downright powerful sequences are altered with dreadful clichs and predictable plot twists. The gritty and relentless atmosphere of 70's survival flicks is marvelously recreated but the script doesn't have the courage to genuinely shock the audience with twisted little details or perverted undertones like they did in the old days. The filming locations are stupendous and the producers managed to attract a fantastic cast including the brilliant Gary Oldman and Virginie Ledoyen. It's really a shame this film doesn't feature anything truly unique because I really wanted to like and recommend it.".

Two giants of the British screen Oldman and Considine add immensely to their characters Paul is brash and confident Norman is withdrawn and quiet. Their development when things go wrong is always interesting. If I have any criticisms its perhaps the ending can be seen coming but its still fun getting there Virginie Ledoyen is also a little wooden though that may be down to speaking in English. The cast of Spanish locals is also excellent and well chosen each one has that lived in face that suits that inbred feel. You'll have no problem believing these guys are capable of murder and rape.

Gary Oldman is obviously the only star in this movie but contrary to what the other reviewer said I believed the Spanish cast was good. It was interesting to hear Gary Oldman speak some Spanish and I give this movie 3 stars because of Aitana SanchezGijon and him.Aitana SanchezGijon who is an excellent Spanish actress that I last watched in The Machinist with Christian Bale and was also in other English language movies like A Walk in the clouds plays Gary Oldman's wife. She can express mystery and emotion without saying any dialogue. I think she is one of the best but underrated Spanish actresses today. Llus Homar was brilliant in my opinion and also the little girl.I was mixed about Paddy Considine. I think he is a good actor but next to Gary Oldman he was less interesting. In Cinderella man with Russel Crowe he was excellent and also in In America but in this movie he was only interesting when he was not in a scene with Gary Oldman but in scenes with the other actors he steals every scene. I think that shows how strong Gary Oldman is that brilliant actors like Considine seem to fade next to him.This movie is the first English language movie for Virginie Ledoyen since The Beach and I think it is fair to say that she will always be known as the girl from The Beach because she is a bland and boring actress. Even in french films she is dull because she lacks the range that other actresses her age have. In this movie she is not at all convincing as her character. She acts better in her 30second adverts for L'Oral.The biggest problem of this movie is the writing and the directing. Serra and his cowriter lack the skill in writing a coherent and original scnario. Stealing from other movies was a bad idea. There should have been more development in this to make it a real movie. Also Serra uses the camera techniques of 70's directors which is OK at first but when he does this all the time it is distracting and does not serve any purpose except style. We all know it is set in the 70's but the directing should always be related to the story because style is cheap and easy and anyone who works only on style with no script should just direct commercials and music videos. Skip this movie and rent Straw dogs instead.".

	schema:headline " Unfortunately a bit of a confusing mess.";
	schema:reviewBody "While holidaying in the Basque region of Spain two couples discover a child whose hands are severely misshapen. The child has been gravely mistreated and as a result cannot communicate. The two couples reluctantly decide to rescue her and report her circumstances to the authorities. However severe weather and the denseness of the forest surrounding their holiday home make it impossible for them to make a quick getaway. Soon the local inhabitants become aware that the girl is missing and they rightly suspect the holidaymakers of taking her. Suspicions and paranoia begin to fester and it isn't long before violence erupts. The villagers demand the little girl's return and her rescuers refuse to give her up. A deadly game of catandmouse ensues making a return to normalcy impossible for everyone involved.The premise for The Backwoods is an intriguing one. The idea of how quickly basic human instincts make situations spiral out of control is nearly always used to good effect in movies. For any writerdirector this concept opens up a myriad of opportunities to shock as well as to fascinate. This fact probably accounts for why this device is a muchoverused set piece. Films of this genre when well executed are guaranteed at the very least cultclassic status e.g. Deliverance and Straw Dogs. However when poorly executed the resultant films can resemble a confusing farcical mess. Unfortunately The Backwoods is an example of the latter.The Backwoods starts off well trying to develop the main characters before violence eventually erupts. However what we have learned of their character in the initial scenes gives us little insight as to why the characters react as they do to the situation they are dealt. For example Oldman's character Paul is the only one of the four main characters who is thoroughly determined to save the girl. At no time does he falter even when he could save his life by telling the villagers where the disfigured girl is. This character trait does not hold true because up to this point his character has appeared arrogant and overbearing with little or no regard for those around him. Having said this the four leads all give solid believable performances and for the most part cover up rather than expose the inconsistencies in their characters' nature.Apart from flaws in the development of central characters this movie has other problems. First the deformity that the little girl has seems too ludicrous to be believable. If you have ever seen Batman Returns and you remember the misshapen hands that The Penguin had you will get the idea. As a viewer the fact that the little girl has Penguin hands makes it hard to take her plight seriously. And finally the main reason why this movie is farcical rather than stimulating is the movie styles to which it chooses to pay homage. I can understand the stylish 1970svibe it tries to recreate and I can also appreciate the nods directed toward Peckinpah and Boorman. But what I can't understand is why the writer and director chose to insert a Sergio Leonestyle climactic scene. Up until the final scene the movie has tried to be dark and thoughtprovoking. Up until the final moments it has tried to teach the audience something about the human psyche it has failed miserably but it has tried. And then all of the sudden ten minutes before the end you have a manonman gunfight reminiscent of a spaghetti western. This ultimate fight appears to be forced and is very much out of place. The only thing that links this final scene to what has preceded it is the fact that the ultimate scene's outcome is as confusing and pointless as the rest of the movie.In short The Backwoods is a jumbled mess which is full of inconsistencies in character plot and style. The only factor that rescues The Backwoods from being a complete disaster are the proficient performances of its lead actors. If you want to watch a film that explores basic human instincts why not try Magnolia Pictures' The Signal. You will find that film a lot more entertaining and a lot less confusing than this shambolic piece of filmmaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "While holidaying in the Basque region of Spain two couples discover a child whose hands are severely misshapen. The child has been gravely mistreated and as a result cannot communicate. The two couples reluctantly decide to rescue her and report her circumstances to the authorities. However severe weather and the denseness of the forest surrounding their holiday home make it impossible for them to make a quick getaway. Soon the local inhabitants become aware that the girl is missing and they rightly suspect the holidaymakers of taking her. Suspicions and paranoia begin to fester and it isn't long before violence erupts. The villagers demand the little girl's return and her rescuers refuse to give her up. A deadly game of catandmouse ensues making a return to normalcy impossible for everyone involved.The premise for The Backwoods is an intriguing one. The idea of how quickly basic human instincts make situations spiral out of control is nearly always used to good effect in movies. For any writerdirector this concept opens up a myriad of opportunities to shock as well as to fascinate. This fact probably accounts for why this device is a muchoverused set piece. Films of this genre when well executed are guaranteed at the very least cultclassic status e.g. Deliverance and Straw Dogs. However when poorly executed the resultant films can resemble a confusing farcical mess. Unfortunately The Backwoods is an example of the latter.The Backwoods starts off well trying to develop the main characters before violence eventually erupts. However what we have learned of their character in the initial scenes gives us little insight as to why the characters react as they do to the situation they are dealt. For example Oldman's character Paul is the only one of the four main characters who is thoroughly determined to save the girl. At no time does he falter even when he could save his life by telling the villagers where the disfigured girl is. This character trait does not hold true because up to this point his character has appeared arrogant and overbearing with little or no regard for those around him. Having said this the four leads all give solid believable performances and for the most part cover up rather than expose the inconsistencies in their characters' nature.Apart from flaws in the development of central characters this movie has other problems. First the deformity that the little girl has seems too ludicrous to be believable. If you have ever seen Batman Returns and you remember the misshapen hands that The Penguin had you will get the idea. As a viewer the fact that the little girl has Penguin hands makes it hard to take her plight seriously. And finally the main reason why this movie is farcical rather than stimulating is the movie styles to which it chooses to pay homage.

The only reason I went to the screening was because of star Gary Oldman. After the movie ended myself and my colleagues wondered out loud why Gary Oldman decided to do this empty shallow movie which was full of clichs and obvious homages to Leone and movies like Deliverance that don't amount to much. A chance to play in Spanish maybe ? That is the only mystery we have in this movie  why did Gary Oldman do it ?The performances of most of the actors were good except for Virginie Ledoyen who still has not showed that she can play more than one style. I wished the producers had chosen a better actress who has depth and more chemistry with her costars. She was by far the weakest actor of the 5 main actors in this movie. Paddy Considine was good as her husband. I'm always impressed by Considine's performances and here he was the actor that gave the most impressive performance out of them all. Gary Oldman and Aitana SanchezGijon were effective as the other married couple. Except for Homar the rest of the supporting Spanish cast seemed like amateurs doing their first movie.This is a movie about incommunication and the effects but unfortunately that theme never gets fully developed. Besides the performance of Considine the only other good point of this movie is the cinematography. Everything else about this movie makes it more suitable for viewing as a directtoDVD instead of in the theatres. The people I work with did not buy the movie and no one in our company recommended it or felt it was worth it. I don't think Filmax sold it to anyone at the market. Oldman and Considine are good but 2 good actors are not enough to save a bad film. I miss seeing Gary Oldman in good films and hope he makes smarter choices in the future. Now I will have to wait for the next Batman to see Oldman in a good film.".

There is also a very good cast it got me thinking how did a small Spainsh film attract such good actors? The one complaint I would have is that the script was lacking a bit. The dialogue felt a bit forced almost as it if was translated from Spanish and then when spoken in English it seemed to be missing something in the translation. It just did not come across as believable at times. On the whole though there were far more positives than negatives and I would recommend this film to fans of genre cinema".

Utterly simple plot is quite logical here and it serves the main idea well. The terribly looking inceststricken locals are a real frightening bunch and the deaths are so tragic here that a heavy feeling never leaves the heart.

As many have already said this is a cross between deliverance and the hills have eyes in the basque country. Its a story about backward locals years of possible inbreeding and ancient cultural traditions that foreigners from more civilized parts don't comprehend and regrettably decide to take the matter into their own hands. My one gripe is the fate of gary oldman he was the dominant character in the movie so its crucial to know if he did die or not while its assumed he did if so the way he surrendered was completely out of character to what we had seen in the previous hour. This aside All the native actors were superb and the taut direction kept the suspense going there was no need for any Hollywood effects or an OTT music score the backdrop and the incessant rainfall did the job sometimes the best way of doing things are the simplest.".

Guillaume Canet a young charismatic actor added his name to this list which keeps on extending. With mon idole 2002 his first long feature movie is strongly rooted in the contemporary reality with the following topics the hypnotic power of television on the public and the relations of manipulation. However this exercise of style leaves a bitter taste in the mouth after the vision even if the result is far from being uninteresting.Do you remember professor Castro's leitmotiv in Alejandro Amenabar's thriller Tesis 1996 We must give the public what he demands.... The professor thought of the violence. Today the public wants not only violence but also daring TV shows pushed to the voyeurism. The satire is well here at the beginning of the movie during the TV show. Moreover later the film contains a significant detail Jean Louis Broustal breeds vultures. The metaphor is obvious. Nowadays TV shows especially TV reality occupy an enormous place in our lives and it can be source of wealth and respectability for the ones who run them. Besides Canet seizes the opportunity to deride them. The sequence when Broustal his wife and a friend of them are dancing in the livingroom dressed in silly costumes constitutes a good example. It wouldn't be fair to call Broustal's wife a grownup because she is still a child deep inside her. As for Broustal all in all he is an eternal pampered child who only thinks of having fun. Now to come back to the starting point Bastien Guillaume Canet is an ambitious young man who would like to climb the ladder in television. He has a project for the telly and he presents it to his manager Jean Louis Broustal Franois Berland. It is useful to add that Bastien is widely impressed by this apparently serious man. Broustal is interested by Bastien's plan and decides to invite him in his country house in the country for the weekend. But Bastien is going to find out that his real motivations are drastically different from Broustal's.It is quite easy to guess Canet's major inspirations. His movie finds itself halfway between Masques 1987 by Claude Chabrol for the setting the first part of the story the food and the cinema of the Coen brothers for the caustic tone. There are also strong echoes of une trange affaire 1981 by Pierre GranierDeferre. Canet seems to be filmloving to the core. He has also had intuition for the cast. Having hired Franois Berland a largely underrated French actor with a rich filmography was a good idea. Furthermore him and Canet are well followed by the rest of the cast. The satire is quite fierce the situations are comical the actors feel visibly at ease in their respective roles. So what is wrong with mon idole? Well first Canet's opus appears a little hesitating because it wavers between comedy drama and detective movie and as a consequence the young director has difficulty to find a unity and a lasting tone. Actually the first part of the movie is the most successful. Gradually we feel the suspense rising and Broustal's real intentions are taking shape. Roughly we discover that Canet offers us a farce. Problem it happens in the middle of the film and has strong chances to run out of steam quite quickly. So in order to restart the interest of the spectator Canet tries his hand at black humor the moment when Broustal's wife is involuntarily killing Broustal's friend and it is where the movie goes awry. In a way the young director artificially furnished the second part of the movie and it involves a lack of cohesion to the whole. As a result Canet wanders from his subject and his movie has difficulty to hold water.What can we say about his making? It alternates the best and the worst. There's a careful work on light and the scenery but Canet doesn't avoid the flashy effects like to prove his master of making.But if there's a thing in the film that is spoiled it is the music. About it mon idole has a common feature with Cameron Crowe's movie Vanilla Sky 2001 both present a badly used and sometimes too intrusive music. Maybe Canet's work is worse because a few songs in it by the feelings they bring out haven't got their place in a story like this one. At the end of the movie we hear Abraham Martin and John! What did Canet think of when he wrote this sequence? That's a real disgrace from Canet.Let's also regret a somewhat unsuccessful end because Canet couldn't use a thing that could have kicked the bull's eye immorality.So mon idole is an interesting but heterogeneous work which could have been much better. It's a shame for Guillaume Canet. But if he wants to shoot a second movie maybe will he correct his mistakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the set of a French TV show in the making we see the warmup man energizing as they do the audience of a Jerry Springerlike production called It's Tissue Time'.  A fascinating intro we are as enlivened as the TV audience as the story begins.  The sad truth of the attractiveness of live television shows shines through as guests are humiliated through the words of others a premise that is expanded on throughout the rest of the movie.What we gather in rapid fashion is that the assistant Bastien played by director Guillaume Canet cheering on the audience is an ambitious sort that wants to develop his own show after the styling of his chosen mentor It's Tissue Times' producer Broustal as played by Franois Berland .  There are complexities involving other characters right from the beginning including the presence of Broustal's wife the unhappy and reluctant companionship of Bastien's girlfriend Fabienne Clotilde Courau and the egotistically insufferable It's Tissue Time' host Philippe Letzger Philippe Lefebvre.A concept Bastien has developed for his own show is presented by Philippe and Bastien to the producer and after being invited to a party at a disco Bastien is further asked to accompany Broustal and his much younger wife Clara Diane Kruger recently seen in Troy' to their country home for the weekend.  Bastien's ambition overwhelms any trepidation he dismisses Fabienne's objections this is his big chance! he may have about the opportunity.  The idiosyncrasies of the couple are unsettling to him and to us as well portending a less productive and perhaps more involved weekend then Broustal has mentioned working on the TV project.So things begin to happen even on the ride from the disco to the country estate of Broustal.  The real reason for the invitation is slow in coming but is no real surprise as events unfold.  But the proceedings are as strange as the setting for them why does Broustal have an enormous cage with vultures how normal is it for that man's wife to be so interested in Bastien and why is one surprise after another perhaps normal in the affairs of Broustal and Clara?What is great about this film and what sets it apart from mainstream movies is the relentless nature of Broustal.  Franois Berland gives a performance not unlike that of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast a few years back.  Here is a character with enormous personal presence generally unlikable but with reserves of condescension and cynicism the likes of which can only be transmitted through a strong performance.  This is a good film with grityourteeth moments comic touches and the general cachet of Sexy Beast.  The Seventies feel is perhaps due to the Continental locale and dcor of a manor appointed to the taste of an avantgarde couple.  But what plays out at the estate is at times violent always sexually tense never touching and at all times unpredictable.  This film is not for one with mainstream tastes and children need not view it until well into their thirties.  Even the ending is a surprise and a pretty tidy tieup at that.Rating 3.5 Stars.".

Not a particularly relevant story you may think but note that the television was IN THE KITCHEN mere feet from the oven. That's how good this film is. It features possibly the greatest crazy monologue ever committed to celluloid the pubmicrophone scene two of the most disturbing murders in any movie I've seen and I've seen thousands one of the most unsettling relationships I've seen and an unbelievable central performance. This film is darker than dark and stranger than Eraserhead. Just as Bubby is on his own throughout the film so is the viewer.

Strong images and a deep sadness is present for the most parts of the plot. But it has another more interesting side and that is the naive and curious mindset of Bubby. how he deals with life and how i learns and how he imitates life is a lesson learned for everyone. To me it's all about being able to adjust to create even when all you have is shattered. There is a way in every situation. It may not be the common way it may not be normal but what ever path you find is right for you. The people in the film are real there is no glamour. Yoy believe their story even if you only get little sneak peaks of how things used to be. I would call it a feel good movie.

He hasn't left the house can't leave the house because mom's been busy having sex with him and perverting his spongelike mind. Early on the film alienates viewers by throwing in a scene involving the killing of a cat. We then follow Bubby as he ventures into the outside world and has a series of amazing hilarious adventures in which his outsider status is often misinterpreted. He fronts a rock band gets intimate with a real disabled woman Heater Slattery and discovers life beyond the walls of his prison. The film is extremely original and daring and Hope's performance as Bubby is totally believable. It was shot over a long period by a number of cinematographers although only Ian Jones gets IMDb credit. It has a unique anarchic tone and it is amazing watching how normal people interact with the unpretentious unhinged protagonist. Ultimately Rolf de Heer succeeds in creating a dark surreal powerful study of an outsider in a film that someone ought to double bill with Hal Ashby's Being There. It's a triumph.".

Prepare yourself for scenes of cruelty  humiliation  sexual abuse and psychological horror...there are some truly disturbing scenes. But take them for what they are without judgement see how they complement the story and Bubby's evolution and enjoy the ride. If you enjoyed Forrest Gump  or more to the point  Tom Hanks Then this is the adult version. It doesn't assault your heart strings the way Hollywood tries to do.

It makes a social commentary similar to that of Kubrick's film and at the same time it offends.

Nicholas Hope is fantastic as Bubby and gives a display like none that i have seen in a long while. It could not have been easy taking on the role of a retarded man and having to do the thing that he does in the film.As i have mentioned this film  is disturbing and may upset many people. i would not recommend it for family viewing but i would recommend it to any film buff.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say Bad Boy Bubby is one of my favorite films. I know your probably questioning my sanity right now. But really this is a film that is challenging and sometimes hard to watch. It's like seeing a child step foot in the world for the first time. Poor Bubby he's had a tough life. He's lived in a dirty room with his mother for more than thirty years. His mom Flo has convinced him that if he goes outside he'll die from the air. So Bubby wears a gas mask from time to time. His mom is cruel and abusive and even has sex with him. Bubby tortures his cat and messes his pants in the first twenty minutes of the film. The first part of the film feels almost like a John Waters movie. Many people will cringe and not want to see the rest of the film. Keep watching because the film becomes much more uplifting and emotional as it goes on. Bubby finally meets his long lost dad who is also abusive to him. When Mom and Pop are sleeping he kills them with plastic wrap. Bubby finally escapes confinement and sees the outside world. Music is something new to him as he witnesses a Salvation Army choir sing. The scene is very beautiful in it's stunning visuals. But Bubby also witnesses the cruelty of man. People yell obscenities at him and Bubby is like a child so he repeats whatever he hears. Bubby has problems with manners too he walks up to women and gropes there breasts and makes vulgar comments. Bubby means no harm he is innocent and child like. He meets an assortment of offbeat characters and finds comfort with a rock band who treat him like a brother. Bubby even has the ability to communicate with the mentally handicapped and finds time for love. He learns about philosophy from an existential atheist. My favorite part of the film is when Bubby goes to dinner to meet Rachels stuffy cruel religious parents. Lets just say he takes some of the existential philosophy with him. Rolf de Heer has created a masterpiece and cult sensation which has won many well deserved awards. Nicholas Hope is flawless in his performance as Bubby in fact he did research on autism to create Bubby's character. If you like films that challenge you watch Bad Boy Bubby. You'll discover that love overcomes all.".

When I first saw the film I couldn't help thinking that this is just what Forrest Gump would have been like if a young David Lynch had written and directed it. Mainly because there is no film more comparable to Bad Boy Bubby than Lynch's intense social commentary masterpiece Eraserhead. This film basically is a light Eraserhead but with a darker Forrest Gump type character as the lead. Both films stories and commentary are delivered in a similar manner. Though it would also be fair to say that Eraserhead is definitely far more complex in it's detailed metaphors and far deeper in it's overall vision and social commentary.All that said this film is a well under the radar standout in its own right.

He clings to moments of the rare affection with his horrifically bad mother who then turns back onto him with viciousness and confinement. He is physically an adult but emotionally and intellectually a compulsive neglected idiot child beast at best retarded by one of the worst mother characters in film history. Utterly panicked by his mother's mysterious warnings of the outside world which is to be feared and will kill you with poison. Eventually through an extraordinary series of unforgettably nasty and undeservedly violent homeward events he escapes and is forced to confront his fears and reality. Reality becomes bent around Bubby's innocent and pantomimic experience with the world around him. He is both taken in to be cared for and abused always with guileless acceptance of the innate harshness of the world by our protagonist. He knows no judgment and has nothing to measure his experiences to. Eventually for lack of a better explanation he becomes a rock star cult hero. Bubby is attributed with mastery of art and magnetism of which he knows nothing but which is sucked up by a seething popular audience. The popular turn in his fortunes still don't affect him at all and he wanders around his world with the gaping comprehension of no more than a mirror. Human love and emotion eventually find him and he grasps this in a very unconventional way which would find the normal man in the loony bin or prison Bubby finds fulfillment love and redemption. Honestly Bad Boy Bubby is the most disturbing feel good film I've ever seen. Further the first 30 minutes are a great litmus test of whether or not your friendloverfilm buff can handle your appreciation for twisted art. Truly awesome.".

I picked it up at the video shop a few times and put it back intimidated by its disturbing subject matter. Since returning to the States I have developed a strong fondness for all films Australian and went to check this out when it finally premiered at the UC Theater in Berkeley. Several people walked out but I was fascinated by this dark perverse but ultimately hang in there if you start to watch very uplifting film.  Bubby is Forrest Gump in hell and the jaw dropping claustrophobia and dysfunction of his world is a sewer to escape from.  But Bubby has a kind heart and a decent soul and much bravery is accomplished in his escape from his lifelong confinement.  Severely disabled people are treated with dignity and attention which is very rare in film.  I would highly recommend this film to the open minded.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bad Boy Bubby had been recommended to me while I was living in Australia in 1995.  I picked it up at the video shop a few times and put it back intimidated by its disturbing subject matter. Since returning to the States I have developed a strong fondness for all films Australian and went to check this out when it finally premiered at the UC Theater in Berkeley. Several people walked out but I was fascinated by this dark perverse but ultimately hang in there if you start to watch very uplifting film.  Bubby is Forrest Gump in hell and the jaw dropping claustrophobia and dysfunction of his world is a sewer to escape from.  But Bubby has a kind heart and a decent soul and much bravery is accomplished in his escape from his lifelong confinement.  Severely disabled people are treated with dignity and attention which is very rare in film.  I would highly recommend this film to the open minded.";

	schema:reviewBody "BAD BOY BUBBY is one of the most original and satisfying films I've seen in a very long time. Not knowing much about the film going into it  I figured it would be some sleazy revenge film featuring a RAINMANish lead character. What I got instead was something FAR more refreshing and interesting. The way this film manipulates the viewer is amazing as you feel the whole range of emotions by the time BBB ends  repulsion sadness joy alienation sympathy the list goes on and on. Although the film starts on a downbeat note and seems like it could easily slip into sleaze territory  it never does. Everything portrayed in the beginning of the film is put there for a reason  and it will all come out in the end...Bubby has been locked away in a bomb shelterlike apartment for the last 35 years. Bubby knows absolutely nothing of the outside world. No TV no radio no magazines  just his mother and a pet cat. Bubby and his mother's relationship is VERY strange and dysfunctional to say the very least... none of which is Bubbys fault. He only knows what he's been taught. One day Bubby's father comes home which is the catalyst to Bubby's lone introduction to the outside world. The following events and experiences are at once harrowing and hilarious as Bubby tries to fend for himself in the real world...I purposely don't want to give away any of the scenarios that happen in the film because they are all so strange frightening sad and heartwarming in their own way. BAD BOY BUBBY is a film to get sucked into as you experience the world from the eyes of a complete innocent. Certain scenes will not agree with mainstream film viewers  but I personally feel that BBB is ESSENTIAL viewing. Nicholas Hope is ABSOLUTELY convincing and amazing as Bubby and deserves serious credit for the power of his performance. I honestly can't find a single fault with this film. Definitely an overlooked minimasterpiece. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 1010 As a side note  do yourself a favor and watch all the special features as well  some very interesting stuff regarding how the film was shot using 30 different cinematographers!!! and how the concept of the film was conceived. Also included is a quirky short film that also stars Hope  CONFESSOR CARRESOR  that is also worth a look...".

It goes without saying that I never really appreciated the so called 'funny side' of the movie at the time and any innocence I had promptly left. This movie might have been my turning point.Anyway now watching it again I fully appreciate it as a piece of cinema including the black nature of the humour. Nicholas Hope is an incredible actor portraying Bubby and the subtleties of his character admirably. He deserves the highest praise for this performance. One or two aspects in the second half seem artificial like an ability to understand mentally disabled peoples thoughtshowever it serves to develop the end of the story to a pleasant conclusion. It's very well made and directed as well.I highly recommended it to anyone interested in underground movies that are also thoughtprovoking. I also highly recommend that you don't let your kids near this so take any relevant precautions. It'll be worth it because if you don't there will be sideeffects and I don't mean the innovative method of recording sound that was used.".

Bubby who has never seen the light of the sun because he has been told that the air outside is poisonous shares everything with his mother including her bath and her bed and behaves like an emotional child mimicking what his mother says and does yet beyond his twisted exterior he has a largeness of spirit that seeks redemption. Rolf de Heer's sensational Bad Boy Bubby was never released in the U.S. because of its objectionable material has become a cult classic and its upcoming DVD release on BluRay will undoubtedly bring more adherents.Like JeanClaude Lauzon's 1992 Quebecois masterpiece Leolo Bad Boy Bubby is a strange brew of ugliness and beauty combining utter depravity with spiritual transcendence. Though the circumstances of the film are implausible if taken literally it contains an emotional truth that makes it very real and quite disturbing. When Bubby's alcoholic father Ralph Cotterill pretending to be a priest returns suddenly after an absence of thirty five years to tell Bubby Christ kid you're a weirdo the stage is set for jealousy rebellion the creative uses of cling wrap and Bubby's first ever taste of freedom. Thrust out into the world he meets people who are in turn kind indifferent or decidedly hostile but no one senses his history questions his background or asks him about the circumstances that led him to his present condition.In a series of vignettes Bubby soon discovers the wonders of pizza then barely survives encounters with feminists a policeman whom he insults and is punched in the stomach a fellow prisoner who rapes him to the background of Scottish bagpipe music after he is arrested after accosting a woman on the street and a young woman from a Salvation Army band who seduces him. Bubby only begins to find his way when he shares some beers with a rock band in the back of a pickup truck and later assumes the role of their lead singer mouthing the few phrases and grunts he has learned from his mother ostensibly a comment by de Heer on rap music andor the entertainment industry and its creation of celebrities.When Bubby stumbles upon a school for the disabled where he is able to translate and understand the severely handicapped and falls for the plump and very giving nurse not coincidentally named Angel Carmel Johnson he begins his voyage toward self discovery and the recognition of his common humanity a testament to the fact that people act towards others in the way that they are treated. To say that Bad Boy Bubby is offputting is a gross understatement and cat lovers are urged to stay far away. It is raw crude and profane but has something to say about the modern world that definitely hits home.From its criticism of fanatical religious beliefs to its skewing of the entertainment industry and the way women are exploited in society Bad Boy Bubby is bold original funny and memorable. Much of its success is due to the amazing performance by Nicholas Hope who displays a mixture of innocence and menace. Hope personifies the manboy who is able to summon up the love that was buried inside of him during years of torment and abuse and makes us care about him. In spite of the overt atheism enunciated by a church organist who says that 'it is everyone's duty to think God out of existence Bubby's willingness to take responsibility for his life and the film's repeated use of heavenly music such as Handel's Largo from Xerxes suggests that there is a world of spirit and beauty that is always with us guiding us even in the darkest moments of our existence.".

It is one of the grittiest rawest movies I have ever seen and it works on a visceral level. The performances of Sean Penn and Esai Morales in this film go to show why they have both continued to be two of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. After seeing Penn as Jeff Spiccolli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High I was amazed by his range in this film although he was excellent in Racing With the Moon which if memory serves me right also came out around this time. Morales took what could have been a onenote role and turned it into a caricature of a revengebent punk but his talent even back then was clear that he was up to the challenge of putting emotion into the role and bringing some sympathy to Paco's plight. Clancy Brown and Ally Sheedy were excellent in their roles as well.The movie worked not just because the acting was great but because the story moved along at an exciting pace. It was suspenseful and was not overly clich or pat. Overall it was an unforgettable movie experience a strong cautionary tale that still makes people think.".

	schema:headline " Awesome film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys is a gritty suspenseful film dealing with drugs rape death and young delinquents existing in a hostile environment. I just want to point out that this is NOT the Michael Bay film of the 90's! This version of Bad Boys was released in 1983 to moderate success at the box office compared to the summer blockbuster status of the newer Bad Boys films. Rick Rosenthal Halloween 2 occupied the director's chair with strong support coming from Sean Penn Esai Morales and Reni Santoni. The story goes like this Mick O'Brien Penn is being held in a juvenile facility for the vehicular manslaughter of his rival's younger brother. The rest of the plot is a riveting tale of suspense as his nemesis Paco played by Morales rapes Mick's beloved girlfriend while Mick is still in prison. This vengeful act lands Paco in the same prison where our character Mick currently resides. What follows? You guessed it a barrel full of drama as a dramatic confrontation between Mick and Paco ensues! I first saw Bad Boys a few years ago after I purchased it for 3 dollars in a used movie bin. It ended up being the best three dollars that I ever spent! It really is that good of a movie. I realize I might be a sucker for early 80's dramas but I rank Bad Boys as the most underrated film of Sean Penn's entire career. It's hard to believe that he was only 22 in the movie having just come off the set of Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Esai Morales is solid throughout as Penn's rival as well. Apparently Esai used to get quite a bit of attention from young girls visiting the set. This left Sean Penn in a crabby and malicious mood which resulted in him getting a gym membership and having some prep talk with director Rick Rosenthal. For more on that conversation I suggest you listen to the films commentary track. All of the acting in Bad Boys is 100 percent believable at all times. I actually felt like I was in a deadly prison environment where one minute I have a best friend and the next he's making a stereo to blow up in my face! Oh yesBad Boys is that bad! On a more technical note I really enjoyed some of the steadicam shots that follow characters down various stairways and around sharp corners. There is even a mistake in the last 10 minutes of the film where you can plainly see a steadicam operator directly in the shot! But it is barely noticeable considering how intense the last few scenes are! The movie itself is rather dark in some spots which is probably the result of the lower budget price tag. But nonetheless this film is much better than any other teen angst movie of the 80's that I've seen including Coppola's 'The Outsiders' released in theatres only 2 days later!. There is really so much more to Bad Boys then I can write in these few paragraphs. It paints a dark picture for the American judicial system and an even darker picture for dramas of the early 80's. Please see this movie!10 OUT OF 10".

But to focus on the two leads is unfair to the host of other actors who put in magnificent performances particularly actor Eric Gurry as Barry Horowitz.Teen Mick O'Brien is a vicious gangster punk. When one of his armed robbery schemes goes awry a robbery of a drug deal involving Paco Moreno he unintentionally runs down and kills Moreno's little brother and ends up in juvenile prison. His cell mate is Horowitz. After an awkward start they become close friends and confidantes. Horowitz who has been there a while teaches O'Brien the ropes. Meanwhile prison guard and counselor Ramon Herrera actor Reni Santoni wants to set Mick on the right path but this is not an easy task.The prison officials have given authority over other prisoners to two tough inmates cell mates Viking actor Clancy Brown and Tweety actor Robert Lee Rush who get to hand out prison work assignments receive the profits from cigarette sales etc. They immediately come into conflict with O'Brien and Horowitz. O'Brien manages to usurp their position of authority leading to further conflicts. O'Brien's toughness and street smarts make him the winner time and again.The character of Horowitz a young Jewish boy who came to juvey after a botched revenge plot is worth a whole review by itself. What a shame that this magnificent actor Eric Gurry has appeared in relatively few films. Though he is small and weak and would appear to be of little help in a fight his wit dogged determination and superior intelligence help him to survive in this environment where he is very out of place. Despite being nothing like the other prisoners as the film progresses we learn that he has strong criminal tendencies and prison is probably where he belongs.Moreno seeking revenge on O'Brien beats and rapes O'Brien's girlfriend actress Ally Sheedy so he can go to prison and get even. Tweety is paroled and Moreno moves in as Viking's roommate. These kindred spirits promptly begin plotting against O'Brien.Circumstances take both Viking and Horowitz out of the picture leaving Moreno and O'Brien to face a final showdown alone.".

His cell mate is Horowitz. After an awkward start they become close friends and confidantes. Horowitz who has been there a while teaches O'Brien the ropes. Meanwhile prison guard and counselor Ramon Herrera actor Reni Santoni wants to set Mick on the right path but this is not an easy task.The prison officials have given authority over other prisoners to two tough inmates cell mates Viking actor Clancy Brown and Tweety actor Robert Lee Rush who get to hand out prison work assignments receive the profits from cigarette sales etc. They immediately come into conflict with O'Brien and Horowitz. O'Brien manages to usurp their position of authority leading to further conflicts. O'Brien's toughness and street smarts make him the winner time and again.The character of Horowitz a young Jewish boy who came to juvey after a botched revenge plot is worth a whole review by itself. What a shame that this magnificent actor Eric Gurry has appeared in relatively few films. Though he is small and weak and would appear to be of little help in a fight his wit dogged determination and superior intelligence help him to survive in this environment where he is very out of place. Despite being nothing like the other prisoners as the film progresses we learn that he has strong criminal tendencies and prison is probably where he belongs.Moreno seeking revenge on O'Brien beats and rapes O'Brien's girlfriend actress Ally Sheedy so he can go to prison and get even. Tweety is paroled and Moreno moves in as Viking's roommate. These kindred spirits promptly begin plotting against O'Brien.Circumstances take both Viking and Horowitz out of the picture leaving Moreno and O'Brien to face a final showdown alone.";

	schema:headline " Excellent Film But a Bit Too Brutal.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys tells the story of teen delinquents inside and outside of a juvenile detention facility. The acting is topnotch with very powerful emotional scenes that are not only realistic in their telling but make the viewer especially troubled youths perhaps think twice before doing something stupid.SPOILERS The main protagonist is Mick O'brien played masterfully by Sean Pean who has a rap sheet a mile long. He participates in a gangrelated drugdeal that goes horribly wrong and winds up accidentally killing a rival gang member's Paco Mareno played by Esai Morales little brother.Sentenced to a juvenile correctional facility for rehabilitation. Mick must deal with the harsh realities of the teen prison which is anything but a positive rehab influence. The inmates are constantly fighting harassed or beating up on each other. Inside trading of cigarettes drugs weapons and other prison paraphernalia is common. Overcrowding is an issue. This facility seems to have like 80100 inmates but only about 5 guardssupervisors to try to keep order.There are some VERY brutal and disturbing scenes such as an inmate getting pushed over a railing and you see his body and head crash into the floor where he is killed. Mick O'brien sees all of this but considering his troubles with the law is desensitized by it. BUT when Paco Mareno is sentenced to the same facility as O'brien for beating and raping Mick's girlfriend as revenge for O'brien's accidental killing of Paco's little brother tensions run high leading to a very climatic and bloody fight sequence between the two rival's at the film's conclusion.I'd like to give Bad Boys a perfect 1010 stars rating. However the film's brutal ending fight scene goes on a bit too long. The overall atmospheric conditions of the film is realistically dark and unpleasant. So I would advise people to have a strong stomach before seeing this movie. If you don't you might be turned off by the two brutal scenes described above and might want to avoid this film.However I DO recommend this film to troubled kids or kids who may be headed down the wrong path. It will make them think. Supporters of the film have said that the prison scenes are very realistic. If you can handle the violence Bad Boys is definitely worth seeing and a film that you will remember for the rest of your life.Update Upon watching the film recently I have updated the score from 810 to a 910.".

A lot of people with that rebel persona have come and gone but Penn's proved to have staying power in his adult roles.But it was a part like Mick O'Brien kid from the mean streets of Chicago that first attracted the movie going public to Sean Penn. Bad Boys is not your usual teen dream Brat Pack film. Penn's representative of some of the baddest of the bad from the Eighties.Penn's a high school kid from Chicago but the kind who only goes to school on occasion maybe to get messages from his hoodlum friends. A heist he plans goes horribly wrong and the little brother of another tough kid Esai Morales is accidentally killed simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.That last crime finally puts him in reform school and of course Morales winds up there as well. That's after raping Ally Sheedy who is Penn's girl friend. That sets up the final confrontation between them.Bad Boys is one of a long line of films going back to Wild Boys Of The Road dealing with the juvenile delinquent problem and the incarceration thereof. It's interesting how rape is used as a weapon in two instances here and how it's thought of that way. Morales rapes Sheedy as a way of getting back at Penn and in the reformatory the two who run the cell block where Penn and later Morales is put Robert Lee Rush and Clancy Brown use it as a way of establishing their authority. Brown who will tell you this is a method of enforcement belies his own gay nature with those muscle pictures in his cell. And O'Brien's cellmate Eric Gurry is also a latent case maybe more. His performance in many ways is the most interesting in the film. He's a nerdy kid who happens to be one unusual inmate for the place. He's been picked on and in retaliation bombed a bowling alley where his tormentors were hanging out. Not too many kids his age have the scientific knowledge to pull off that and what we see him do here. Still the film builds up to the climax between Penn and Morales and Bad Boys does not disappoint in the end. Bad Boys might have some charter Brat Pack members in the cast but John Hughes wouldn't be doing a project like this.".

Thorin.Mick O'Brien Penn a teenage criminal from Chicago finds himself doing hard time at the Rainford Juvenile Correction Facility after his latest robbery attempt ends in tragedy. Rainford is not a place where young thugs get reformed it's where they become harder and more prepared for a life of crime........ Teenage hoodlum movies are notoriously difficult to get right more often than not in spite of being riveting viewing experiences they come off as being exploitive rather than educationally observant. Over the years there have been one or two exceptions leading the way was Scum 1979 Alan Clarke's scorching appraisal of the British Borstal system and from America Rick Rosenthal's Scum influenced Bad Boys starring a prefame Sean Penn. Bad Boys is a rare old beast in the pantheon of young offender movies it manages to overcome inevitability and primitiveness of plot by giving thought to its central characters notably Penn's wounded animal protagonist. who remarkably isn't a perfunctory part of the plot. Sense of place too is given much attention to detail as Rosenthal gets in tight within the confines of this juvenile facility. Di Lello's script is thankfully free of the clichs that often detract from the drama in a prison based movie the moral choice heartbeat that pounds away in Bad Boys is never twee or shoehorned in by way of a necessity. The thematics exist on very real humanistic terms. Led by a spitfire turn from Penn cast are mostly great with Gurry engaging Sheedy tender Morales complex and Brown menacing adding a professionalism not often seen in films of this type.Problems arise when the film goes outside of Rainford's fences for it loses some pent up momentum. What made Scum so searing and oppressive was that it never left the Borstal facility claustrophobia and anger inherent were the order of the day. Bad Boys' makers choose to weld two concurrent stories on the outside with that of Mick O'Brien's fate it works in respect of the narrative outcome which with some annoyance is never in any doubt but at some cost to the mood created in the bleak interiors. There's also the issues of having to accept the ridiculousness of certain developments in the story. Be it the easy access to substances no real life prisoner would be allowed near or the leap of faith needed to imagine that the prison authorities would allow the final confrontation to become a reality we are asked to look the other way in order to get some hefty wallop into the drama.Violent and unflinching in its emotional honesty and supremely crafted on both sides of the camera Bad Boys one or two hiccups aside is a first rate drama. 810".

	schema:headline " Engaging film with flawed screenplay.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys certainly has a lot going for it on many levels but there are enough implausible moments in the script that keep it from any type of classic status. The story centers around Sean Penn playing an angry and violent young hood from the streets of Chicago getting sent to a tough juvenile detention center after accidentally killing a young boy during a botched robbery attempt. The balance of the story deals with Penn adjusting to his new confinement and having to prove how tough he is again and again. Once he has established himself as the toughest kid in the place the plot is turned on its side. The older brother of the boy he killed Morales is also sent to the facility... for raping and almost killing Penn's girlfriend as revenge for the boy's death! From the moment he arrives everyone knows that the score will have to be settled once and for all. Who will survive??Yes its a pretty good premise but too many detours are taken before the anticipated climax finally arrives. And many of them just don't make sense. First of all there is no doubt that Penn's character is one tough punk. Yet he is just not physically imposing enough to be the barn boss as the toughest inmate is called. Yes he whips the two punks who once held the title in a crafty manner but there would no doubt have been many others waiting in line for that title. Another problem deals with Penn's escape attempt. After learning of his girlfriend's rape he actually breaks out of the facility and somehow is able to make it all the way back to Chicago from the location several miles out in the country. Even if he were actually able to do this which wouldn't be likely notice how once he's captured and returned to the lockup they don't even punish him!! Uh huh! I'm guessing the escape and brief rendezvous with the badly bruised girlfriend were meant to establish some sort of motivation for Penn wanting to kill Morales. But honestly would this type of character need such motivation? Not likely. In addition Penn is momentarily taken to the state prison for adults and warned that this is the path he is headed down if he screws up again. And apparently this is why he initially refuses to fight Morales when he first arrives at the facility. Penn just wants to do his remaining time and split. Again not likely. A guy like this would not hesitate to accept a challenge from any man who violated his woman. Another problem deals with how Morales and Penn are left in the same cell block right up to the moment Morales is about to be transferred to another facility. Wouldn't it have been a better idea to keep the two sequestered from one another even if it meant putting one of them in the hole for a while??? But then we couldn't have had our final fight then could we? Oh well.There are a lot of good aspects of this film too. The acting is outstanding the casting is picture perfect and the locations look authentic. The film is full of surprises and a lot of them work. The Jewish whizkid who shares a cell with Penn steals every scene he's in. Look for a young Clancy Brown as the yard boss dethroned by Penn. Ally Sheedy gives a good performance but she doesn't look like she belongs in that neighborhood! And I like the fact that the film doesn't try to make Penn or any of the others out to be misunderstood kids. They are all rotten to the core and deserve their punishment! Despite some flaws with the script Bad Boys is still worth at least 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

For me this adds to the story.I've long held this movie high in script casting look for an uncredited cameo from Jamie Lee Curtis walking with an afro in the street in the opening sequence and its timelessness whereas movies like Colors or 8 Mile simply tap into the urban vein yet again for  substance.Bad Boys was party where it began...urban north Chicago 1982!

Quebec Rating13 Canadian Home Video RatingRshould be 18AThe film Bad Boysnot to be confused with the 1995 film of the same name is a prison movie starring Sean Penn.It has played on TV a couple of times and I have seen it twice.This is an excellent film.Its up on my list of favorite prison movies along with The Green Mile and Life.I have not seen Shawshank Redemption but I have read the novel and it is excellent as well.Unlike those movies this is a very brutal and violent prison movie.Don't watch it if you don't like violence.The film is about a young criminal named Mick O Brian.One day he gets into a shootout with some latino's when the cops come he drives away but loses control of the car and accidentally kills the brother of a latino gang member named Paco Moreno.He gets sentenced to prison.Paco now wants revenge on Mick so he rapes Mick's girlfriend and gets sent to the same prison as Mick.Its hard to choose who to root for in this film.Both men deserve revenge for what happened to them.While in prison they meet all sorts of prisoners such as Horrowitz a geek who can make bombs out of normal objects and two strong prison rapists named Tweety and Viking.Bad Boys is a very interesting prison movie and I recommend it to fans of prison movies.";

Sean Penn is incredible in his role and proves how great of an actor he is. The rest of the cast shine as well Ally Sheedy is touching as Penn's concerned girlfriend Esai Morales is realistic as a tough guy really p'oed with Penn. There are many unforgettable moments especially the scene where Penn excitedly visits Sheedy in jail only to notice her beaten and bruised really bad and begins bursting in tears. Its a real touching and shocking scene. The film is violent but never feels exploitive. Director Rick Rosenthal creates a great atmosphere throughout and keeps you rooting for Penn to get out of prison and get revenge. I agree that the end was soso but it wasn't your typical hollywood tacked on ending. This isn't feel good entertainment but a gripping unforgettable film. It isn't hard to see how Penn is one of Hollywood's most amazing talents.".

Penn gives a good realistic performance as a street tough in a juvenile detention center that is more like a normal prison. The ending is fairly dramatic and memorable.

But it was Bad Boys that cemented Penn's reputation as a rare talentan actor whose skill transcended his youth revealing a depth and maturity that the majority of his acting peers could only aspire to. That gravity and emotional dimension is evident throughout Penn's performance here as Mick O'Brien a chronic offender whose path to a Chicago juvenile corrections facility seems utterly preordained. The institution is hardly conducive to reformationit's a jail for problem kids and a cauldron for all the societal ills that sent kids there in the first place. Mick's there because he was involved in a shootout during a botched robbery of drugs from rival street gangster Paco Moreno Esai Morales whose little brother was killed when Mick accidentally ran him over with his getaway car. Overcrowding results in Mick and Paco's being sent to the same facility one of the film's few stretches of credibility and this leads to a rather predictable showdown that will take the jive prison's violence to its inevitable extreme. It's a shame this conclusion ultimately doesn't live up to the film's superior first hour but Bad Boys remains a remarkably authentic even touching portrait of troubled youth whose torment is conveyed through thoughtful and richly emotional development of characters. Director Rick Rosenthal who had previously helmet Halloween II maintains a vivid sense of setting within the correctional facility's cold walls and through the performances of Penn and a superb supporting cast including Ally Sheedy in her film debut as Mick's girlfriend Bad Boys emerges as one of the best films of its kind forcing the viewer to ask difficult questions about atrisk youth and the proper way to improve or at least preserve their endangered lives.".

What could have been clich was avoided by tasteful direction and excellent casting though I agree with one of the reviewers that Viking seemed too old to be in the reformatory as did his sidekick whose name escapes me. I did think that the character actor who played Viking did a great job. Penn is really amazing in this film. He never overplays. He really became Mick O'Brien. As a young actor I used to feel that Penn overacted. I considered him to be a bit of a show off until Mystic River and 21 Grams changed my perception dramatically. He's now become one of my top ten actors. I didn't know about Bad Boys. I was frankly blown away by his performance. The reformatory did remind me of Oz on HBO which is one of the reasons I couldn't stop watching it! I also thought the prison staff were very good especially Penn's counselor who doubled as a teacher and guard. I loved that Viking was singled out for his drawing revealing a sensitive side to him. It makes him more complex rather than settling for a stereotype of an evil dimwit. Next to Penn Horowitz was my favorite character. He was brilliantly cast and written. All in all a terrific film. Good to see a young Ally Sheedy doing great work.".

You get to feel a sense of hopelessness cause the correctional part of the detention center is not really there. They only get worse in there. Especially when they get your arch enemy to be in the same place with you. Then it is stupid to say stuff like do not fight and stay cool cause it's inevitable that someone wants revenge when emotions take over and reason goes right out the door. But it's stupid to take revenge 'cause it never stops.Nowadays especially in stupid Rap and Rb video's and in the lyrics very dumb messages are sent to kids that state that gang life is cool and there is nothing more important than having a lot of money a big house cars and women that are often referred too as nothing more then bitches and whores and also make statements about revenge on others.Even on MTV there is this zero braincell show called Cribs that shows these stupid people talking only about their material possessions thus stating indirectly the message that this is what is very important.I recommend this film to everyone who thinks positively of gang life and revenge cause it's not cool at all.".

Ellen Barkin plays the devious bad company recruiter who signs on ex agent Laurence Fishbourne whose 140 IQ proves no match for her physical talents. By bribing the compromised judge David Ogden Stiers they will rescue their client Walter Curl Spalding Grey from a lawsuit that claims that his company dumped cancer causing pollutants. Though the judge is a gambling philanderer he's in nobody's pocket and thus after taking the bribe votes his conscience on the case in question and then opts out after sending his girlfriend Gia Carides to the Bahamas with the money. Meanwhile Barkin maneuvers Fishbourne through sex into killing company head Frank Langella showing that IQ comes in a distant second to sex appeal. Nobody except maybe Carides and Stiers and to a certain extent Fishbourne is going to win much sympathy from the audience but the story stays on task all the way through and the observations it casts on corportate behavior are not so far out.".

It was great to see the plot unfold in unexpected ways and to see these characters mess with one another motivated only by greed lust and fear. Another aspect is the film's sleek and cold style. From the wardrobes to the apartments these characters occupy the film is pretty stylin'. And the acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the amoral Crowe Frank Langella is elegantly nasty as Grimes and Michael Beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of Fishburne's coworkers.

First the performances on the part of all the principles is just fine. Ellen Barkin is a surprise as a suave and elegant femme fatale. Fishburn is slow and considerate. This is not an action movie.

It's not overdone not inaccessible but not entirely realistic either.

	schema:headline " An OK dramathriller that really needed to feel tighter and have better dialogue";
	schema:reviewBody "Thrown out of the CIA for be suspected of stealing gold that he denies stealing Nelson Crowe finds himself a former spook looking for work in the private sector. This brings him to the attention of an organisation run by Vic Grimes one that excels in blackmail and corruption for a fee. Recruited by Margaret Wells Crowe soon finds himself in deep and almost immediately winning the trust of Wells. She repays this trust by offering him joint control of the Toolshed  in return for murdering Grimes. Meanwhile Crowe reports back to the CIA that the first stage of his infiltration has been successful but the CIA have other ideas of how his mission will end meanwhile the word 'trust' loses any meaning it may have once had as the various sides jostle to come out on top.The concept of a thriller involving CIA operatives and shady goings on combined with the question 'who can you trust?' will be nothing new to anybody and for this reason this film doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't do anything special either. The plot is full of twists and turns but none of them are really surprisingly or even that interesting meanwhile the 'thriller' aspect of the film never really gets up to speed and a big problem with it is the delivery. The story is a rather plodding drama at times and it could have done with being a lot slicker  dark but slick. Without many thrills the plot sags easily and the audience may feel almost bored at times considering the stakes are murder corruption and betrayal it is a surprising that it is so flat. The dialogue also suffers from being a bit flat contrast it with the sparkling dialogue of David Mamet in Spartan for example and this just feels clunky and lacking in effort.Of course having a great cast helps to counteract that but there is only so much that they can do at times but they still manage to have a good presence and add to the material. Barkin is sexy manipulative needy and cold all by turns  it is a role she can do very well and she rises above the material here. The rest of the leads rely on presence more than performance but they mostly succeed. Fishburne is always interesting and he excels at tough and cool making a good lead. Langella is cool professionalism and suits his character well. Beach is good Stiers is a wellknown face and fits his minor role well while Spalding Gray is a rather sad reminder of his suicide but he is very good in his character. Of course it is Barkin and Fishburne that dominate the film and both are pretty strong actually making up for wider delivery problems and making the material feel better than it is.Overall this is nothing special but it does enough to be worth watching once. The cast provide strong performances with good screen presences all round but the delivery is roundly flat and never gets as tight or thrilling as other films in the genre effortlessly manage. The plot is old news and the dialogue feels flat and lacking in imagination and effort rather taking the life out of the film and making it feel a lot more workmanlike than the names in the cast list would suggest it could be.".

Not to mention that it didn't care about the rest of the characters' fates which ultimately stamped it with the deficient mark and it is.Despite that it managed somehow to embody the concept of Bad Company whereas it's not a bad intelligence no it's more like evil association that must eat and eat till it eats itself in the end.

Ellen Barkin was awful aside from a poorly written role her face was so provocatively dead and originally she's pathetically sexy to be that irresistible Femme Fatale !Yes it's partly amusing acridly satirical with a nasty character capturing the outrageous sense of the 1980s' and the 1990s' erotic thrillers. But it's not a brilliant thriller inasmuch as a movie about utterly unfaithful world where all would kill or be killed simply for money and power.

When he is killed midoperation his handler goes to the only man who can replace him his twin brother.  However his brother Jake is a hustler in New York City and not spy material.  Oakes has nine days to get him ready to take over his brother's identity and take up the assignment.Despite the awful reviews I still decided to give this film a go because I was in the mood for a dumb film that really didn't require me to think even once this was that film!  The film deserved every bad review it got  the only thing you need to worry about is whether or not you can accept the massive weakness or not.  The plot is a real shambles and if you think about it logically then it all goes to hell.  The idea that this is a reasonable plot even for this type of film is absurd.  The script backs this up with dialogue that is fitting for a stupid comedy but not for the situations in the plot does it play dvd's?' or dialogue about Dr's Dre and Irving while trying to stall terrorists.  Some of it is funny but to be honest if you dislike Chris Rock then there will be practically nothing for you.The plot brings the bomb back to the US towards the end in an effort to inject tension and urgency into the action but it doesn't really work. The action is reasonably slick but it isn't ever really exciting  only polished like a product.  The action like everything else is quite clichd and not distinctive enough to really stand out from the crowd of other action movies.  The gags about race are subtle but still quite broad in the style of Rock.  I didn't find it offensive but I never really understand why films have to constantly perpetuate racial myths such as all black people listen to hip hop and like certain sports etc. Some of it is funny though.Rock is the main reason for this as I said if you like him then you should enjoy this as most of the comedy is driven by him even if nothing is anywhere near the sharpness of his act.  He is not very funny but he helps the film have an overall comic tone that works pretty well  Hopkins is totally slumming it.  He manages an air of cool detachment but the material is way below him and his autopilot light is on the whole time.  Stomare is poor and none of the villains really bring genuine menace  Eastern European hoods and clichs that they are.  Beauvais is sexy  but that is all she is here for to put on black underwear! Her character breezes in and breezes out with no real reason or consequence plainly all she is here for is to have a bit of sexy black ass in there  something that Washington doesn't bring.Overall this is a slickly made film that is clichd absurd undistinguished and not as entertaining as it intends to be.  Despite the fact that the film is very average and not really one to stand out it can be quite enjoyable if you are ready for that. If you can turn off your brain and lower your standards then this can be OK however just don't expect it to be great no matter what you do.".

It was not a role calling for a wild comic genius but one calling for a very seriousminded professional who is involved in trying to train a novice in just a few days for a deadly game involving a nuke.

	schema:headline " The latest Chris Rock action comedy that apparently doesn't realize that it's a comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Chris Rock stars as a CIA agent and a street hustler twin brothers separated at birth. When the more successful brother Kevin ironically the one who got his act together and made a life for himself yet also the one who got himself killed is shot escaping a touchy sting operation in which he and his team try to buy a stolen nuclear weapon with cyber money that doesn't exist in real life the CIA are faced with abandoning a 2 year project and risking themselves because their new enemies are going to want to know what happened to their deal or seeking out Kevin's twin brother Jake who makes a living whipping the crap out of unsuspecting chess players in Central Park and selling scalped tickets to just about any event you can imagine.At this point in the film it's clear that the premise is a remarkably strong one for an action comedy  the irony of having a street hustler suddenly thrown into a top secret CIA operation. And when you throw in Chris Rock as the hustler and Anthony Hopkins as his new mentor it seems that you simply can't go wrong. Unfortunately the movie seems to lose track of the fact that it is a comedy and in more ways that just forgetting to throw in some good oneliners.Bad Company was made and scheduled to be released before September 11th but was then delayed for obvious reasons similar to the obvious reasons that delayed the release of the much more incendiary Collateral Damage given its subject matter. Because the movie was written before the attacks the writers can't have been expected to have known what bad taste it was to center the plot on a stolen nuclear device that was meant to level a major city on the eat coast. I don't hold that against it because of the 911 attacks but only because it is such a tired premise. When are we going to see some good action movies that are about something other than one guy who has to save a whole city from terrorists with big bombs?There are points in the movie where it seems that the writers stopped and said Oh wait this is supposed to be a comedy' and threw in a few completely unamusing jokes here and there mostly in the form of totally inappropriate oneliners from Rock that almost invariably fall completely flat. He and Hopkins do however have a bit of chemistry onscreen but it is mostly wasted. This is a flashy Bruckheimer production obviously but it is one of the least interesting action films that Bruckheimer has turned out in years. Granted most of his productions are cheesy crap but this one even manages to be boring despite itself.I watched Bad Company right after watching Men in Black II and so was already prepared for disappointment but I found myself trying to figure out why exactly the movie is called Bad Company. Surely it can't be because the CIA is forced to employ someone literally off the street because he turns out to be remarkably bright and much more capable than they had anticipated. Then at the end of the movie just as the bad guy is about to get killed he says something about how we Americans think we're so great but we just sit here while people all over the world suffer and die and we just watch it on our televisions and grab another burger. This is of course disturbingly true and it is not a small part of the reason that four airplane were hijacked in late 2001. It's something that Americans love to ignore so that we can pretend we're victims. The victims on September 11th were the people in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families the country itself was not.Does Bad Company' then refer to the company that the rest of the world is in being in the company of America? It seems that the message that this film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and greedy country America is and how capable we are to ignore the suffering of the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and our heart disease instead of starvation. In this case I guess Bad Company's not such a bad movie after all. It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up call at the end but one that will probably be largely ignored along with the rest of the film. Ah well.".

The victims on September 11th were the people in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families the country itself was not.Does Bad Company' then refer to the company that the rest of the world is in being in the company of America? It seems that the message that this film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and greedy country America is and how capable we are to ignore the suffering of the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and our heart disease instead of starvation. In this case I guess Bad Company's not such a bad movie after all. It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up call at the end but one that will probably be largely ignored along with the rest of the film. Ah well.";

Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock act well in this film alongside the twisted Russian mafia boss whom was brilliant also to be found acting in the superb Guy Richie film 'Snatch'.

The beautiful strings and violin the elegance and subtlety gets butchered a minute in by tacky electronica. what a shame to have this masterpiece ruined.

I'm just a little frustrated right now that I spent  8 on this movie and two valuable hours.My vote 410.";

If I could turn back time and prevent this disaster it would make my life a lot more complete. Folks this is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen in years a travesty of filmmaking that drags on for two hours like Chinese water torture and never eases up. The story is ridiculous because we have a spy who is good he dies and what?! Y'mean he has a twin brother?! How convenient. Chris Rock tries his best to flex his comedic muscles but fails miserably as he tries to deliver these awful awful one liners that are not only terrible but you can see in his face that even he doesn't like the jokes. Watching him give these awful wisecracks is like watching a dying animal and you want to put him out of his misery. He serves one cringe inducing joke after another and never stops making this movie seem all the more awful. He constantly fumbles and jokes his way through the movie without a laugh to spare serving as the comic relief to a movie that might have been good had it not been served with such a poor actor. Chris Rock's character Jake is the quintessential AfricanAmerican stereotyped character in this movie he's poor uneducated wears a lot of gold chains and is a con man. Not to mention he shoves all these hip hop references down our throats expecting a chuckle but all he gets is dead silence. This movie is also poor in plot with its clich spy movie storyline that I've seen done millions of times in much better movies. Anthony Hopkins the poor man sleepwalks through this movie often looking tired and bored as he is forced to perform these drawn out tired monologues and terrible stunts while acting alongside Rock who can barely act. The movie also has these caricature villains who serve no purpose other than to scowl look dirty and talk about us Filthy Americans every second in the movie. We get it you're mean and intimidating can we move on now? Joel Schumacher a pretentious and overblown filmmaker tries his best to make up for the terrible script through these dramatic camera and action shots that just look gloomy and pathetic. He couldn't possibly make up for this embarrassment no one could.".

The screenplay by James Richman and Michael Browning tells the tedious tale of one Jack Hayes a ne'erdowell New York City shyster who is employed by the CIA to impersonate the twin brother he never knew he had a brother who was recently killed in action trying to retrieve a portable nuclear bomb from some Middle Eastern terrorists.  Anthony Hopkins plays Gaylord Oakes a seasoned CIA operative whose job it is to groom' Hayes for the mission.It would be hard to overestimate just how mediocre this production really is.  The storyline is flat and unimaginative the villains bland and colorless the humor weak and poorly executed the action scenes routine and strangely truncated.  The grooming' sequences are particularly unimpressive since Hayes seems like essentially the same person after the lessons as he was before them think of it as James Bond meets My Fair Lady'.  About the only news here is that Schumacher seems for the most part to have abandoned his Cuisinartstyle approach to directing and editing choosing instead to shoot and splice the film in a basically humdrum static way.  The result is a talky film in which no one says anything that is of even the slightest interest either to each other or to the audience stuck watching the spectacle. Apparently the action film genre has become so depleted of ideas that the best filmmakers can do at this point is to concoct a fantasy scenario in which a wisecracking Average Joe gets to save the world from total nuclear destruction in time to say I do' to that longsuffering girl waiting patiently back home.  This sort of preposterous premise may work well in Austin Powers'like parodies but it hardly merits serious attention in a straight actionadventure tale such as this one.  And frankly I am beginning to question the appropriateness of using the threat of nuclear annihilation by terrorists as a source for mindless mass audience entertainment.  When will some gifted filmmaker finally come along to address this issue with the kind of seriousness and gravity that it so obviously deserves?Neither Hopkins nor Rock can be faulted for their performances.  They do the best they can with the material they've been handed.  Hopkins in particular though needs to start signing on to more challenging assignments before the lease runs out on his reputation as one of the world's premier actors.  About the best that can be said for Bad Company' is that it affords us an opportunity to armchair travel to photogenic Prague remember SlaughterhouseFive'.

Spawning three official sequels it also easily remains the best of that series the second installment in particular being an instantly disposable piece of drivel.

	schema:reviewBody "Note some scenes described in detail.As usual for Borzage this is full of sentiment and the details of the plot are deadly. Never was the development of misunderstandings between two inarticulate people more aggressively one might say more ruthlessly pursued. When they're not playing Gift of the Magi he giving up the dream of his own radio store for the big apartment he thinks she wants they're busy each thinking that the other doesn't really want the baby. And how could Borzage resist milking the maternity ward scene with its inevitable ethnic crosssection older woman and troubled mother. And here's another version of that typical preCode era film pair the beautiful girl and the unhandsome blowhard boob.All that said this is still a very good film in spite of itself certainly deserving of its Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Borzage constantly redeems himself at the worst moments. A prime example the evening before the baby's due Jimmy goes out to fight four rounds of preliminaries at 10 a round to pay the doctor. Sally is lying at home convinced that he's with his drunken friends or worse and no longer loves her. Dunn's opponent is a meanlooking cynical paunchy guy who's about to knock him out in the second round. Oh the ironic crosscutting he's getting the crap beat out of him while she lies in bed anxious and bitter. But in a clinch Jimmy begs the pug not to knock him out because his wife's going to have a baby. Why didn't you say so says the obliging pug I've got two of my own. In an amusing moment they chat away while pretending to lambaste each other. This takes the curse off the sentimental plot maneuvering.And there are a lot of other fine sequences too. The film starts with Eilers in a fancy wedding gown being attended to by a dresser. She's so nervous she tells bestfriend Gombell who's dressed as a bridesmaid. As they do the formal bride's walk through the phalanx of bridesmaids in the corner of the screen one sees part of a tray of dirty dishes being carried by a waiter. Gradually the camera pulls back to show that they're modeling the gowns for a bunch of lecherous buyers. Then they go to Luna Park nice shots of the park. Throughout these early scenes there are plenty of sharp preCode wisecracks about how men only have one thing on their minds. Funny breezy stuff. They meet Dunn on the ferry on the way home the first guy that doesn't make a pass. The scene shifts to the couple sitting at the foot of her roominghouse stairwell. As they talk an old henpecked lush comes down the stairs and an older woman uses the hall phone to tell her sister that their mother has just died. That may be pouring the milieu on a bit thick Borzage style but this scene is beautifully played by Eilers and by the older woman and is quite affecting. Later when Eilers stays in Dunn's room no hankypanky it seems and he asks her to marry him her brother kicks her out of the house and Gombell the brother's gal walks too. Singlemom Gombell's little boy is a terror. In the morning he won't scram I want to see Dotty get out of bed. Sally is sure that Jimmy will desert her at the alter and that's the beginning of all the tearjerking plot elements.But the film goes beyond those elements with a richness of detail a generous painting of daily life in the city during the Depression. And when all's said and done what really makes the film and where Borzage ultimately redeems himself is in the performances. Eilers who somehow never got the recognition she deserved is beautiful and gives a strong sensitive emotional performancefor my money a more appealing one than most of Janet Gaynor's work for Borzage. Gombell another undervalued thirties player is really fine as the tough but goodnatured pal who doesn't let Dunn's dislike of her color her opinion of him as a good husband for Eilers. Her performance goes beyond the requirements of the script in very subtle ways. And Dunn well he plays the typical earlythirties boob of a husband but even he has a bravura scene when he breaks down while having to beg the expensive doctor to handle his wife's childbirth. Borzage films are always full of sentiment but not always honest sentiment. This scene with the doctor is full of sentiment but it's honestly handled and one can say the same for the whole film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mack Sennett once called Sally Eilers the most beautiful brunette in Hollywood and she was very eye catching even in roles that didn't give her much to do. Then Frank Borzage started a hunt for a couple of unknowns for a film he was directing called Bad Girl. Sylvia Sidney had starred in the original Broadway production which was an adaptation of a best selling book by Vina Delmar and ran for 85 performances in 1930. Borzage wanted to find a new romantic team to rival Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell and originally he had wanted Spencer Tracy but he was unavailable. Sally was picked and for the male lead a young fresh faced actor from Broadway  James Dunn. For a film debut he had the ease and confidence of a veteran. He was sensational and should have been nominated for an Academy Award.This was not a typical boy meets girl in the big city romance. It had more in common with The Crowd although without The Crowd's bleakness. When we first meet Dorothy Sally Eilers she is modeling bridal wear but she is not at all dewy eyed  she has all the answers and knows all the lines to keep the wolves at arms length. She meets Eddie James Dunn at Coney Island and while it definitely isn't love at first sight they end the evening in a heart to heart talk at the bottom of the stairs. Eddie is a rough diamond who claims he can't talk to women but somehow he seems to get on with Dorothy. Their's is a bitter sweet romance  it's real and something the audiences of the day could probably relate to.

Sally has some news of her own  and after Eddie has a tirade about the stupidity of bringing a child into a world of poverty  confesses she is going to have a baby.The rest of the film is concerned with mistaken feelings. Eddie thinks Sally is not keen to have a child but she is only trying to hide her joy because of his gruffness. Inside he is tickled to death and often stops parents with prams in the street to ask their advice he is also working overtime and risking his life doing amateur boxing to get Dorothy the best possible care. She doesn't know and thinks he is spending his time in bars and getting into fights. In one of the most heart wrenching scenes James Dunn plays with all the emotion he can muster trying to convince a society doctor to deliver Dorothy's baby. And for once a friend wasn't just part of the furniture. Minna Gombell was great as Edna Dorothy's best friend and mentor. It was a 3 dimensional part  Edna was hard boiled and tough but astute enough to realise that Eddie was a genuine guy.This role should have made Sally a star but it didn't. She and Dunn were paired several times but she became fed up and apparently refused to do Jimmy and Sally with him Claire Trevor was substituted. James Dunn became an overnight star. He was extremely likable and also had a warmth and talent that both critics and the public liked.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mack Sennett once called Sally Eilers the most beautiful brunette in Hollywood and she was very eye catching even in roles that didn't give her much to do. Then Frank Borzage started a hunt for a couple of unknowns for a film he was directing called Bad Girl. Sylvia Sidney had starred in the original Broadway production which was an adaptation of a best selling book by Vina Delmar and ran for 85 performances in 1930. Borzage wanted to find a new romantic team to rival Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell and originally he had wanted Spencer Tracy but he was unavailable. Sally was picked and for the male lead a young fresh faced actor from Broadway  James Dunn. For a film debut he had the ease and confidence of a veteran. He was sensational and should have been nominated for an Academy Award.This was not a typical boy meets girl in the big city romance. It had more in common with The Crowd although without The Crowd's bleakness. When we first meet Dorothy Sally Eilers she is modeling bridal wear but she is not at all dewy eyed  she has all the answers and knows all the lines to keep the wolves at arms length. She meets Eddie James Dunn at Coney Island and while it definitely isn't love at first sight they end the evening in a heart to heart talk at the bottom of the stairs. Eddie is a rough diamond who claims he can't talk to women but somehow he seems to get on with Dorothy. Their's is a bitter sweet romance  it's real and something the audiences of the day could probably relate to. They marry and Eddie can see his long cherished dream of owning his own radio shop within his grasp. Sally has some news of her own  and after Eddie has a tirade about the stupidity of bringing a child into a world of poverty  confesses she is going to have a baby.The rest of the film is concerned with mistaken feelings. Eddie thinks Sally is not keen to have a child but she is only trying to hide her joy because of his gruffness.

	schema:reviewBody "This precode drama nominated for a Best Picture Oscar is a delightfully witty yet potentially tragic melodrama about a pretty young model Sally Eilers who turns down all the wrong guys until she finds what she thinks is the right guy James Dunn. They stay out all night together much to her reluctance and the fact that she has a very domineering brother William Pawley makes her fear his reaction to her becoming engaged. While waiting for Dunn to show up so they can be married she learns that he's moved out of his apartment and been fired from his job. Fortunately she has a friend in the outspoken Minna Gombell who was prepared to marry her brother and walked out on him after he insulted his sister. This clever scene has Gombell seemingly supporting everything Pawley says to see how far he goes and when his brutality takes an extremely cruel turn the truth about how she feels comes out. Gombell is very clever in her admission of why she broke up with him telling Eilers He saved my life. They send you to the chair these days for killing your husband. Dunn shows his cynical sense of humor after hearing one of Eiler's neighbors fighting retorting There's a tenement for you. A woman dies a baby is born and a guy's wife won't let him eat Limburger.This clever script is as juicy as anything they were writing over at Warner Brothers for Joan Blondell or Barbara Stanwyck to spout and just as filled with insinuations as the dialog that Mae West would soon be uttering over at Paramount. When Gombell comforts Eilers she has tears behind her laughter telling her younger brother when Dunn finally does show up Open the door Floyd and if it's a man selling coffins tell them we'll take two! The drama occurs because Dunn gives the insinuation that he doesn't want children but she's pregnant from the night they stayed out planning their future together. Not necessarily a great husband Dunn spends more time trying to find work eventually turning to prizefighting than supporting his pregnant wife which brings Gombell down on him. So is she really a bad girl? Obviously in the eyes of her brother who raised her after their parents died and is morally appalled by the fact that she would marry Dunn so quickly rather than get his approval. Crisply directed by Frank Borzage with an excellent screenplay this is one of those early sound films that really sounds true to life and touches the emotions. Truly worth a rediscovery and in viewing the film it is easy to see why it won Oscars for screenplay and direction.".

However in the case of Bad Girl you wonder if the artist ever saw the film or had any idea what the plot was! First the figures on the poster look nothing like the actors in particular the guy is not anything like the 'everyman' James Dunn. Second the poster makes the film look like a sex movie or at least one with a LOT of sexuality! But instead it's just a nice Depressionera film about a nice couple who are trying to make a lives for themselves. And what it has to do with a bad girl is also anyone's guess!! Sally Eilers is a clothing model who is sick and tired of men always making passes at her or harassing her. So when she meets Dunn and he is relatively indifferent to her she is intrigued! Why won't he act like a boorish cad as well?! Eventually the two begin dating and fall quickly in love. Surprisingly the supposedly cynical Dunn asks her to marry him and seems happy with exactly the sort of life he said he didn't want. Then when she becomes pregnant she is worried as Dunn wanted to start his own business and didn't want kidsbut once again what Dunn SAID he wanted and how he reacted are quite different and he likes the idea of kids and doesn't mind deferring his dream. Seeing the occasionally toughacting Dunn show greater depth to his character was pretty enjoyable. There's more to the film but it's probably best you see it for yourself.While the movie obviously was wellrespected back in 1931 as the director received an Oscar for his direction and it was nominated for Best Picture it doesn't play quite as well today. This isn't to say it's a bad filmit just seems a little old fashioned and dated...but still very sweet. But despite its age it is worth seeing and is a decent filma good showcase for Dunn and a nice little romance.".

Otherwise it is completely different in every respect. Mordaunt Hall in his review in The New York Times even goes so far as to state that the only adverse criticism he could make of Bad Girl was its strangely unsuitable title. He was being sarcastic of course. He knew perfectly well how the title came about. He continues However that is of small importance for many a poor picture has boasted a good title.This mustsee movie is now available on a 1010 Fox DVD set. In fact I'd like to give this movie 1010 also but that deceptive title might annoy some people.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there was ever a movie with a misleading title this one is it. With the title Bad Girl the fact that it's PreCode and the movie poster showing a scantilyclad woman lounging in a chair with her arms raised while a man leers suggestively over her shoulder  you think this movie is going to be about a woman of loose morals like Jean Harlow or Marlene Dietrich.But it's not. Instead it's a romantic melodrama that tells the story of a young married couple trying to make it through their first year of marriage during the Depression. Dorothy Haley Sally Eiler marries Eddie Collins James Dunn a tough talking Noo Yawk radio salesman who is secretly a softie inside. In the movie's opening scenes Dorothy is a streetwise dress model who easily parries the advances of men who make passes at her. But after she marries Eddie she turns into an emotional girl with an overactive imagination. When Eddie is late on their wedding day Dorothy bursts into tears because she assumes he has deserted her.Dorothy isn't really a bad girl. She's just dumb as a box of rocks! Unfortunately so is her husband. Eddie and Dorothy spend the movie trying to make each other happy but they're both too stupid to realize they actually want the same things. This leads to an extended version of what Roger Ebert called the Idiot Plot where there are lame misunderstandings and the characters keep secrets from each other for no reason except that the plot requires it. If they would just tell each other those secrets it would solve all their problems but it would spoil the plot. It's called an Idiot Plot because the characters have to be idiots for it to work.Case in point. Soon after their marriage Dorothy finds out she is pregnant. But Eddie has saved up 650 to open his own radio store. Not wanting him to spend his savings on her Dorothy doesn't tell Eddie about the baby. Instead she tells him she'd like to go back to work to earn more money. From this Eddie concludes she is unhappy living in their onebedroom apartment. So he spends his 650 to buy them a big house and furniture which Dorothy likes but didn't really want. Only then does she tell him she's pregnant.Now this could have been handled as a variation on The Gift of the Magi. But in the Magi story the husband and wife actually learned something from their experience. Eddie and Dorothy learn nothing and keep making the same dumb mistakes.Eddie and Dorothy each wrongly assume the other one doesn't want the baby which results in more problems with their marriage. When Dorothy decides she needs an expensive doctor Eddie tries to earn the money as a boxer. When he comes home with bandages on his face Dorothy accuses him of going to a speakeasy and getting in a fight instead of staying home with her. For some reason Eddie doesn't tell her about the money he's won or that he got her the doctor she wanted.On a side note the movie's one great scene is when Eddie steps into the ring with the Champ. He gets beaten up pretty bad and is about to go down when he whispers to the Champ that he needs the money because his wife is having a baby. The Champ says Well why didn't ya say so? I got kids of my own! He then literally carries Eddie around the ring for a few more rounds all the time talking about his own kids.If this story had been handled comically it might have been a forerunner of The Honeymooners and The Flintstones. There were times when Eddie reminded me of Ralph Kramden. Instead we get a sappy romantic melodrama that is instantly forgettable.It's surprising that Frank Borzage won an Oscar for directing this claptrap and that the lame screenplay won an Oscar as well. Borzage made better films than this see Seventh Heaven and Street Angel and there were better directed films released in 193132 such as Charlie Chaplin's City Lights James Whale's Frankenstein William Wellman's The Public Enemy and Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel. But AMPAS was young then and young organizations are bound to make mistakes.".

His work represents even more clearly than that of Ford or Capra a combination of all that is the best and all that is the worst about US film.In the late twenties and early thirties he was looked at as the brightest hope of the US cinema and probably deserves the accolade of being the winner of more undeserved Oscars than anyone else before the advent of Ang Lee. Subsequently his reputation plummeted as did the quality of his films but he is now once again riding relatively high in critical esteem at least in respect of his early films.But even these are a vary mixed bunch. There are Borzage films I greatly admire there are several which i Find irritating most of the GaynorFarrell films but this particular 1931 film I absolutely detest.Its reputation for realism in the sense of naturalism that rare bird in US cinema is entirely unjustified. Any comparison for instance with King Vidor's excellent The Crowd 1928 reveals immediately how spurious and fake the realism is here. One reviewer talks of ordinary people not being treated with condescension. They are in fact treated here as complete and utter idiots and the entire plot revolves around perfectly stupid misunderstandings that are only possible because of the characters' extraordinary obtuseness. This is in turn set off by a fake naivety which is supposed to be charming but is just cringemakingly sentimental. I have difficulty in imagining any treatment that could be more condescending...and this makes it to my mind not just irritatingly sentimentalised as in the case of the GaynorFarrell films but virtually a kind of pornography that demeans everybody associated with it.That such a film should be set during an economic depression and ignoring any of the real problems of the time should concentrate on such trivialities may in part be due to the fact as another reviewer points out to the fact that the original novel was written some eight years earlier but in the context of 1931 it is absolutely grotesque although typical enough of the US cinema's reaction to the depression.It is in part just the familiar Hollywood problem with truth. While The Crowd was hated by the studios and unsuccessful with the public in practice the first tends to condition the second rather than vice versa this saccharine piece of junk won another Oscar for its director.".

First thing's first the title of this film and actually the original novel on which it was based I'd guess is just a marketing ploy to make it sound salacious. It's actually quite innocent even for 1931. Sally Eilers plays a gal who is sick of men flirting with her so when she meets one who doesn't James Dunn she falls for him. The big problem with the movie is that Dunn is an awful jerk. The film tries to show that his tough guy exterior is just a shield for his sensitive inner self but that doesn't excuse his behavior toward his girl who soon becomes his wife. He's constantly whining bitching and berating Eiler not to mention treating her best friend Minna Gombell like crap every time she comes by. Given the title I was kind of expecting Eiler to have to dump Dunn and make due as a hooker or something but it turns out the film has a lot of affection for the prick. It's not like he beats her or anything but my prediction for the rest of Eiler's life as well as that of the baby she has near the end is going to be really depressing even after the Great Depression ends. She might be better off as a hooker.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Kaplan's Bad Girls leaves an interesting taste in my mouth. It is an energetic and fun film offset by its ridiculous characters and plot. The believability factor in this flick is low which encourages its audience to view it as a swirling maelstrom of metaphor and symbol. Woman as defined by the early 90's can overcome any impediment and still be beautiful no need to become manly and lose her femininity to assert herself. The Western genre serves as a perfect tableau for this discourse because it is one traditionally dominated by men. Likewise the men in Bad Girls each represent an institution of American culture that is dominated by men and their mentality conveniently dispatched by the bad girls.Four whores raise hell by killing a Colonel and running out of town complete with unnecessary slow motion of Drew Barrymore shouting heeyah! and the humiliation of every man who crosses their path. The military traditional justice and Christianity are trampled upon left wondering how these motivated and hard working women could escape their clutches. The film from here takes some twists and turns and several complete circles. In short the whores chase a dream of establishing a home for themselves around a mill that Mary Stuart Masterson's late husbands owned countering the murderous advances of men with their own sexual flaunting. Gunfights smarmy dialogue pseudolesbianic encounters and female flesh fill the film to to a near bursting capacity much like Barrymore's bosom.It is not what I would call a smart film however it does present itself as an interesting fable about the empowerment of women by women who remain women. I would liken Bad Girls to that of the Freudian dreams of those who struggle against the man. I feel that it deserves to be seen at least once.".

The latter film softens the lead character by making her survival depend wholly on the Russel Crowe character. In Bad Girls Madeline Stowe eats up the dust on the west and shows a no nonsense gunslinger that has been rare since the Man With No Name hit his stride with a trilogy of spaghetti westerns that made Clint Eastwood a universal star. I can hardly ignore the great cinema style and the substance of this movie that transcends the gender of it's hero. Make no mistake about it this is Stowe's movie to win or lose and she comes away having broke the bank at Monte Carlo. See it with open eyes if you like westerns. If you don't see something else as this will surely disappoint. It is a western all the way.".

The four girls Cody Zamora played by Madeleine Stowe Anita Crown played by Mary Stewart Masterson Eileen Spencer played by Andie MacDowell and Lilly Laronette played by Drew Barrymore are great together. The story line may not be totally accurate from a historical standpoint but the action and acting are good and more than make up for whatever may be wrong. For me the story was more about the relationship that existed between the four girls without going over the line and making it sexual. For me Bad Girls was a winner.".

It is a story of the depth of friendship strength starting over finding love and fighting back. Who said women can't kick some butt.

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Girls is directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a screenplay by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner. It stars Madeleine Stowe Mary Stuart Masterson Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. The plot sees the four girl actors playing prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and a hanging escape. Suffice to say that they get into scrapes  double crosses whilst being pursued by the Pinkerton's.Being asked to suspend disbelief is one thing being force fed drivel masquerading as profeminism is entirely another. Bad Girls is a mess of a movie an insult to the Western genre the fans of the lady actors to the lady actors themselves who simply deserve much much better and arguably worst of all to women in general. The script is laughable serving only as an excuse for the gals to sling those guns and hips when possible and be abused and saved by men while the plotting is by the numbers as everything falls into place readily. There's even slowmo shots where they serve no purpose of enhancement. Throw into the mix that three of ladies look nothing like on the run outlaws all shine and span and make up with nice hair Masterson the exception as she has a modicum of believability about her well it's rather a depressing experience all told. Sure as a red blooded guy I'm not going to be turned off by Barrymore's shapely thighs adorned in white stockings or Stowe's truly gorgeous face but when the highlights of a girl Western is something that's only aesthetically sexy for men then they clearly have got it wrong.So what's the justification for it being so bad? Well the back story offers up the answer. Film was meant to be directed by a woman Tamra Davis ermBilly Madison  Crossroads but she was jettisoned a couple of weeks into production. The plan with Davis at the helm was for it to be a Western told from a female point of view. However Kaplan The AccusedUnlawful Entry was brought in quickly and the screenplay rewritten in a hurry. And boy does it show. Technically it's a duffer too Jerry Goldsmith's score is cheap in texture and Jane Kurson's editing is choppy to say the least. There's no eye catching cinematography Ralf D. Bode while the acting away from the script hindered girls ie the men is either a waste of time them being in it Nick Chinlund or badly directed James Russo. While Dermot Mulroney seems only to exist as being a link to Young Guns the boy version that this is clearly trying to ride the coat tails in on. If you want a good Western about the girls fighting the good fight then seek out George Marshall's 1957 film The Guns Of Fort Petticoat. It's a fun movie that at least has believable women fighting back under duress. Bad Girls tho is just bad in every department. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Madeleine Stowe as Cody Zamora is a hooker who shoots a man in self defense. Being what she is that is to say not being Mother Teresa she doesn't generate much sympathy in this roughriding town and the good citizens decide to hang her. Get on with it she tells them with Promethean contempt. They're about to do just that when three other young women of dubious repute rescue her at the last minute and ride off. In pursuit are a variety of justice seekers including Pinkertons and other law types one or two of them such as Dermot Mulroney and James LeGros aren't too bad. On the trail they run into the Jarrett Gang. Some of the bad girls and some of the pursuers as well carry baggage with them related to the Jarrett Gang. There is a violent shoot out.Now we must note here that the writers weren't reaching too far for original character names. The leader of the girls is Cody Zamora whereas the leader of the Gang is Kid Jarrett. I'd be surprised if the writers hadn't seen James Cagney in White Heat as a gang leader named Cody Jarrett. At least there were no Wades or Coles or Lukes or Matts although there was a bad guy named Yuma which is pretty bad.In fact though all four of the bad girls could as easily have been men or more easily. They WOULD have been men back in the 1950s or 1960s. But then I suppose the Jarrett Gang wouldn't have had an opportunity to treat Drew Barrymore to a lesson in Tough Love. At that though this is a BIG improvement over Westward the Women with Robert Taylor as a sadistic wagonmaster hired to cart a caravan of wouldbe wives out to a femalestarved Western outpost. Taylor consistently treats his wards like dirt and actually whips some of them when they don't work hard enough. There's nothing original here except the gender of the four leads. There is some suggested nudity but no simulated sex or anything else to pique one's interest. They just seem to have rounded up four popular actresses and thrown them into a wellworn dusty rut. The climactic gunplay is lifted straight out of The Wild Bunch as are a couple of slowmotion gunshots. No reason for it except that it had been done before.I thank the whole tenor of the pitcher is captured when there is a scene of them four hoorah gals asettin' around the camp fire and ahavin' a peaceful chat. All four of them is exquisitely dressed and unimpeachably groomed with modern hair styles and make up in full panoply. Not a hair out of place y'know? But the make up department has very carefully brushed a comely taupe area on one cheek or a smear of raw sienna across some otherwise impeccable forehead. That's dust and dirt from the road. They been on the trail fer quite a spell. And they talk like they just graduated from Wellesley. That's this here classy college back East kids. Not a single g is dropped at the end of a word like nothing or  as we rawboned cowboys like to call it  NUTHIN. How can writers and directors be so careless so contemptuous of viewers? Or maybe I'm mistaken. Maybe they have a different audience in mind. But if so what is it?".

Director Kaplan seems to think he's pulling off some revisionist coup by putting women in the central roles but he offers only lame stereotypes which combine the hoariest of old Western cliches they're prostitutes! with the emptiest of postfeminist attitudestriking they're the Spice Girls on horseback!. The real offence of the film though is its opportunism and dishonesty. These foxy chicks are ostensibly rebelling against the oppression of women specifically their objectification as sexual objects. But as they kick ass Buffy or Xenastyle the camera lingers on thier hot bods as it would in any soft porn exploitation flick. There's even a lesbian subtext to titillate the most jaded of gentlemen's palates. What purports to be some kind of feminist fable in fact has the sexual politics of your average issue of Loaded magazine. Better seek out the surreal Freudian poetry of Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar 1954 or the down and dirty realism of Maggie Greenwald's The Ballad of Little Jo 1993 for Westerns that have something substantial to say about sex and gender.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Girls 1994 directed by Jonathan Kaplan is definitely a typical Western. It has the riding the gun slinging and the cowboys and prostitutes to fill it out. Yet with one large modification the roles of the women are very different from what has come to be expected as the norm in this genre. The four leading women even in their given roles as prostitutes lead the movie and drive the storyline. The first woman Cody Zamora Madeleine Stowe shoots a man for not stepping away from Anita Crown Mary Stewart Masterson her friend and fellow harlot. A group of religious zealots that happened to be protesting the hotel where the women worked brought her out to be hanged. Anita and the other two women Eileen Spenser and Lilly Laronette Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore pack up to rescue Cody from the noose. From that point on they are wanted women. They have strong wills and challenge the men that wish to capture them or humiliate them. I like the idea of this movie in that you would turn gender roles in Westerns on its head but there are so many instances that made the movie predictable and played down the intended role for the women. The women regardless of how capable they are at shooting a gun and getting out of bad situations seemed to just make trouble for themselves. This might have been a way to show the human fallibility but it further perpetuates the Western genre classification. The only way they got out was though movie luck the event where the antagonists' bullets never reach the protagonists or miss them completely while the protagonist has perfect aim. My opinion of this movie is that it gets a little tedious has seemingly unnecessary nude scenes and is fairly predictable. This movie is merely entertaining on a superficial level.".

Perhaps it's the nature of what they do lined up against what's expected of them that makes them so bad that is to say putting their necks on the line and obliterating whatever male dominated spectrum exists within the world they occupy as they strive for independence and individualism. Perhaps that's what makes them bad the fact that they refuse to roll over for the majority of the men in the film and act like good little whores suitable to be looked at but nary heard. The titular girls do kill people but most certainly in selfdefence they fight and they battle away but do so against fair degrees of sexism they're on the run but their running is purely a result of pentup rage and sustained marginalisation. As it happens Bad Girls is a guilty romp through a west you couldn't really entitle wild about four gals just wanting a 'straight' American dream infused life but having to fight both misogyny and false charges brought against them along the way.The film covers the misadventures of a handful of women in pre20th Century America the ringleader and toughest of the lot of whom is Madeline Stowe's Cody Zamora a woman nary afraid to stand up to men nor those lecherous and out to harm either herself or one of her kind evident when we observe her react with violence to a patron's over exuberance at sampling the services of Drew Barrymore's Lilly Laronette. Stowe's reaction lands her in some seriously hot water the death sentence carrying with it an air of disenchanted inevitability about it in that Zamora stands before the gallows on account of preventing the elderly man from having his way rather than defending a girl from rape. After a straight faced Zamora demands the execution party gets on with it her three accomplices with whom she has been working most of her life and will spend the majority of this film with bound out of the wilderness and save both the day and Stowe's neck before charging off with her in tow. Fugatives to the law Zamora Laronette Andie MacDowell's Eileen Spenser and Mary Stuart Masterson's Anita Crown hole up out of town after a verbal demonisation from those back at the party point out they are both the enemies of the people religion and all things righteous.What transpires from this is effectively a weak rendition of 1992's Unforgiven only minus Eastwood's character and Freeman's character a tale about strong natured prostitutes maltreated but then themselves consequently being the ones whom go on the run as it's they whom are additionally stalked by a pair seeking their own brand of justice. Those men are two Pinkerton Marshals named O'Brady Chinlund and Graves Beaver men hired to track them down in this sprawling road movie of sorts and bring them to justice as the girls themselves attempt to get on with a more honourable way of living the allure of opening a saw mill in far off anywhere appearing particularly appealing. The film has fun with placing women at the forefront of its plot allowing its lead characters to charm trick and seduce their way out of tight spots and usually into tighter ones when they require some money rather than to throw around weight they do not have as might have been the case had male characters driven the film.The film isn't without flaw its goofiness encapsulated by the fact each of these girls maintains a relatively photogenic look throughout not once the years of abuse nor the results of their previous line of work really worming its way into either of their expressions nor overall demeanour and thus holding the film back from being the grittier tale it might have been. As time had passed and the four of them worked at that seedy tavern each of them appeared to master the fine art of gunslinging and sharpshooting Zamora managing to make bestfriendsworstenemies with a certain Kid Jarrett Russo a bandanna sporting low life thief with a small army of bandits whom waltzes around with a belt of bullets around his ribs along the way. The chase element is surprisingly effective a love plot to do with a young man named Josh McCoy Mulroney whom becomes mixed up in things or more specifically Laronette daft as it is good natured a later sequence featuring this additionally consistent in an unrealistic manner photogenic young cowboy arriving to save his dame on horseback out of a dynamite caused cloud of smoke suit of armour all that is missing rather ridiculous but then spun around when it is he whom needs the collective power of the four women to save his own life.There's a glum and rather seedy subplot to do with Jarrett and his pastinvolvement romantically with Zamora which doesn't quite sync up with the rest of the film's boisterous tone of romp and circumstance while Laronette's own swiping from the rest of the crew feels a little preordained or more obligatory than is desired since it is she who is the youngest of the four titular bad girls and it is she whom must then where the little dress her captors have lined up for her. You additionally feel their treatment of her might have been a little more sordid than it actually is but a ruthless sticking to the overall tone of the film demands a watered down version of whatever might have happened in the real wild west the taking of Laronette the result of Barrymore's sexuality when compared to the other three than that of any realistic plot driven reasons or mechanics. Flaws and frustrations aside and there are a glowing number Bad Girls is a daft but enjoyable frolic through hazy female empowerment and both action and western genre demands but done in a relatively fetching manner.".

	schema:headline " Rough content but beautifully bleak and harrowing";
	schema:reviewBody "People are probably right enough when they comment that this entire film essentially hinges on Harvey Kietel's impassioned performance as the corrupt and deeply troubled lieutenant of the title. Which shouldn't necessarily be taken as a shortcoming  an engrossing lead is the one key thing that any oneman character study like this needs in order to flourish after all. Whether sobbing howling or clenching his jaws in anguish or else hanging his head and sipping liquor in silence his acting here is always raw convincing and utterly compelling the kind of portrayal you'd be hardpressed to take your eyes off. The exact identity of his character is never revealed but the title informs us he's a 'bad lieutenant' a label seemingly confirmed by his tendency to indulge in substance abuse work up heavy gambling debts and even on occasion pull over a couple of young female drivers and use them as motivation for his own selfpleasure. Very lurid and yet the way that Kietel plays him also makes feel completely human. He conveys such pain and desperation behind his each and every immoral action that they never come across as nearly as shocking or vulgar to watch as they are harrowing. It's this alone that enables 'Bad Lieutenant' as a whole to reach the true extent of its potential  what could easily be read off as a plethora of fury drugtaking masturbation and fullfrontal nudity in practice translates very aptly into a sad and striking depiction of a despondent man who's lost his ability to see goodness in anything in life and who's sinking ever deeper beneath the weight of all those answers being continuously sought in the wrong places. As you've probably worked out by now this isn't exactly the balmiest movie you could spending your time with might be wrong but I don't think there's a single lighthearted moment to be found in the entire screenplay but if you can bring yourself to look past the sourness on the surface and instead feel sympathy for this bad lieutenant as Kietel's involving performance invites us to do then you'll find some considerable power lurking in its bleakness.So while it's Harvey Kietel who really and rightly brings things together in 'Bad Lieutenant' and makes it the affecting nearmasterpiece that it is it would be unfair of me to completely overlook Ferrara's role in this equation. He's provided the context against which our centrepiece man must function  a world so rundown sombre and nihilistic that trying to find redemption round here seems not only impossible but practically pointless. The mood is wellset by the everovercast skies killing rape and robbery are rampant and the Lt isn't exactly given a great deal to aspire to in his daytoday life. Kietel and his character are admittedly the only things here that come off as particularly outstanding  the vast majority of supporting characters are really all just part of this one big daunting backdrop with dialogue screen time and development kept to a strict minimum in each case  though personally I look at this as being more of an additional strength than as a weakness. That everyone else around him always seems so distant only increases the overall feelings of detachment and isolation that draw us deeper into the Lt's outlook.Christian faith and symbolism are pretty integral to the overall themes of this movie but even being nonreligious myself I find I can still get a good deal of emotional investment in it. It delivers its underlying issues  of nonjudgement and the potential for goodness in even the most repellent of sinners  with acute precision as reflected in the investigation concerning the raping of a young nun which the plot loosely revolves around. While this heinous crime only serves to strengthen the Lt's belief in the general depravity of the world around him the nun herself has found solace in her refusal to condemn those who wronged her viewing them instead as victims as their own confusion and despair. There are of course some fairly sharp parallels between this scenario and the Lt's own personal predicament which any viewer who's really come to feel for him will recognise  as displeasing as some of the things he himself gets up to may be and the way he incorporates further crime into his efforts to uphold the law there's that challenge lying at the centre of every scene as to whether or not we're really in any position to pass judgement upon him. All things considered is it truly a bad lieutenant that he is at heart or just well a sad one?I don't imagine that everyone will quite take to the conclusion this eventually leads to and which I'm not going to give away here but considering just how weighty a lot of the issues it addresses really are you never get the impression that Ferrara ever intended to come up with a cutanddried solution of any sorts. Instead he and Kietel have put together a polished and powerful piece of filmmaking that though it deals with some pretty disagreeable and at the time at least controversial subject matter is so rich in great acting well one great performance but it's easily worth the input of an entire cast and slick atmospherics that it becomes entirely captivating. In the end it's the surprising amount of depth and emotional muscle that it carries and not the notorious reputation that it garnered that 'Bad Lieutenant' really deserves to be remembered for  and remembered I hope it always will be.

	onyx:emotionText "People are probably right enough when they comment that this entire film essentially hinges on Harvey Kietel's impassioned performance as the corrupt and deeply troubled lieutenant of the title. Which shouldn't necessarily be taken as a shortcoming  an engrossing lead is the one key thing that any oneman character study like this needs in order to flourish after all. Whether sobbing howling or clenching his jaws in anguish or else hanging his head and sipping liquor in silence his acting here is always raw convincing and utterly compelling the kind of portrayal you'd be hardpressed to take your eyes off. The exact identity of his character is never revealed but the title informs us he's a 'bad lieutenant' a label seemingly confirmed by his tendency to indulge in substance abuse work up heavy gambling debts and even on occasion pull over a couple of young female drivers and use them as motivation for his own selfpleasure. Very lurid and yet the way that Kietel plays him also makes feel completely human. He conveys such pain and desperation behind his each and every immoral action that they never come across as nearly as shocking or vulgar to watch as they are harrowing. It's this alone that enables 'Bad Lieutenant' as a whole to reach the true extent of its potential  what could easily be read off as a plethora of fury drugtaking masturbation and fullfrontal nudity in practice translates very aptly into a sad and striking depiction of a despondent man who's lost his ability to see goodness in anything in life and who's sinking ever deeper beneath the weight of all those answers being continuously sought in the wrong places.

In a sense he can be compared to the likes of Scorsese however he certainly works in a different frame of honesty in mind in depicting his lead character and those he encounters. At the core of this extremely well made unconventional film is the best performance Harvey Keitel delivered in the nineties a bravado piece of work in which he bares all of the qualities that can make up the badness in the lieutenant. The Lieutenant spends little time with his kids and when he does is hardly happy and when he leaves them he goes into the underworld to do coke crack and heroin gulps down alcohol like Evian and tries to cling onto whatever dignity he has left in betting on the Mets in the championship series. When a startling case occurs  a nun is raped by two street kids  the lieutenant is on the scene however fogged in his muck and can't understand how somebody even a nun can forgive such a crime. This leads into the third act of the film and this is where the work propels itself into a higher ground mature spiritual and ultimately fascinating in every aspect. Overall Bad Lieutenant is a lean unabashed firstperson singular in a rather sophisticated delivery. We are delivered a character like Alex in Clockwork Orange for example who is not even a halfway decent person. But just by the way Ferrara and Keitel bring us into his world and the details of his existence a viewer can start to understand that the film works on other levels besides those of a conventional all around badcop story.".

The film is very graphic and terribly depressing but that doesn't make it a bad film. It is well written well edited by Anthony Redman well shot by Ken Kelsch and very well directed by Abel Ferrara.

This is a dark look at one man's struggle to match what he was taught about Jesus and Catholism and love with the filth and depravity in his world the crime his life his gambling and drug addiction and in his life his desires as seen in the scene with the two girls.Basically the story follows a cop on the case of a nun that was raped. However this is not really a sumup of the film.  For me the main issue is the struggle of how the Nun forgives those that raped her and how the cop cannot understand why she would do this and not feel the hatred and bitterness that he does.  This is the most powerful section of the film and is even more powerful when you put the rest of the filth around it.Keitel is amazing  this is his best performance.  Whether he is crying at Jesus masturbating over teenagers or sobbing while or drugs he is totally convincing.  His struggle to forgive and to allow others to be forgiven is part of his wider journey towards redemption.If you let it touch you then it is powerful the end being especially moving.  If you only see what he does as actions with no feelings no emotions and no reason then you'll probably hate it.This is not a fun movie.  Even if you like it you'll still find it challenging viewing but ultimately rewarding.".

	schema:reviewBody "BAD LIEUTENANT  1992 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchAbel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant could be a solid tale of spiritual redemption if not for the pervasive material through which the film demonstrates its immorality. It contrasts the most disturbing obscene human behavior with compassion and forgiveness but the extreme nature of the content and the film's insistence on it's portrayal swindles the spiritual impact. For once a movie deserves the notorious NC17 ratingthe Motion Picture Association of America's most restrictive emblem placed on movies submitted for a ratingbut the story contains a message that's more humble and spiritual than most inoffensive productions about spirituality.These filmmakers may or may not realize the potential religious impact their product is capable of achieving. It's a very religious film churches could use this to demonstrate the power of forgiveness and the strength of God's love. Unfortunately many audiences will misinterpret the graphic adult content and strong language as excessively dirtybut this is not a dirty movie. The content is necessary for the exceptional contrast to work. It displays the goodness in people through their wrong doings. Though I still wouldn't recommend gathering the kids around to watch this movie.Harvey Keitel plays a character whom the movie calls only Bad Lieutenant. He's at a stage in his life when human characteristics no longer matter. Filled with fury need and depression his temporary remediessex drugs and gamblingno longer fulfill his hunger for pleasure. But his family doesn't care anymore. He drops his kids off for school does bad things during the day and comes home to collapse on the couch at night. This character does not imagine himself as anything but bad. He interrupts a grocery store robbery only to let the thieves go on a bribe. He buys drugs from drug dealers in exchange for their immunity. He stops a pair of young women in a car only to blackmail them into an unpleasant form of verbal rape. The story takes a twist. Several low lives brutally rape a young nun. The nun who knows her rapists refuses to reveal their identities because she forgives them for their crime. The bad lieutenant cannot believe a victim can forgive such an atrocity. If this woman can forgive her debtors could anyone forgive his sins as well? Whether the bad lieutenant turns his life around I will leave you to discover. But this idea might be a side issue in the plot. Bad Lieutenant displays more of an interest in the dirty lifestyle of the title character than in his decision to seek forgiveness for his sins. Only during the final minutes does Keitel's character realize his choices. Surprisingly however the film's ending takes the easy way out in a complete refusal to look redemption in the eye. This ending blends in with the events because of stark honest realism but we never comprehend the character's intentions for the future. Dark and cringeinducing Bad Lieutenant is not a fun movie to watch and don't expect to hold your popcorn down if you walk in unprepared. Abel Ferrara and Zoe Lund wrote the script looking into deep private crevices of the human soul. They travel to places many people will find extremely uncomfortable. It's a harrowing character study portrayed through an unreserved courageous performance. Harvey Keitel takes a huge risk heremost actors would not want such a character to follow their public image. But Keitel does not hesitate to characterize the bad lieutenant without compromise mercy or restraint. Hats off to you Harvey.".

There is no solid plot no supporting characters and no reason to feel anything but disgust for Harvey Keitel. However you find me another actor who could have dug as low as Keitel did or take as many chances and I will bet you that it will take more than the time to cook a frozen cardboard pizza. It is hard to view a soiled life like Keitel was leading without being on the road yourself which wouldn't be pretty. The backdrop of a baseball series and Keitel losing chunks of money made it even crazier. Again I have to say absolutely great acting. Keitel has so many good scenes that this may be a career role for him. I give him a multitude of credit for taking the chance to play a totally unlovable character. Watch this movie at your own risk and know going in that this is an outlier in the sense of normal movie making. Don't bother grabbing a flashlight or even a spotlight and trying to find a plot. There isn't one. Just sit back and watch Keitel spiral down like a squirrel who missed the branch.".

The backdrop of a baseball series and Keitel losing chunks of money made it even crazier. Again I have to say absolutely great acting. Keitel has so many good scenes that this may be a career role for him. I give him a multitude of credit for taking the chance to play a totally unlovable character. Watch this movie at your own risk and know going in that this is an outlier in the sense of normal movie making. Don't bother grabbing a flashlight or even a spotlight and trying to find a plot. There isn't one. Just sit back and watch Keitel spiral down like a squirrel who missed the branch.";

	schema:reviewBody "What would this movie be without Harvey Keitel? It's so easy to see how this production could have gone terribly wrong. Just put Brad Depp in the lead role. There isn't a laugh in this story and Keitel makes you believe that there isn't a laugh to be had in the entire world. His movements are sluggish his voice an exhausted and perfunctory mumble. Except when he becomes agitated over the thought of winning money on a bet. His eyelids droop and his lips smack while a hooker puts on his tie and administers a mainliner and afterward he slowly slumps over in his chair like a stroke victim. That scene alone in its long takes would have established him as a powerful performer if he weren't already recognized as one. In two other scenes he displays a hairraising talent. The first is when he is drunk and crazed on some kind of unearthly dope with two women and we see him naked standing in front of the camera and he seems to rise on tiptoes his tensed arms lift from his sides his fingers fluttering and his face becomes a grimace of tortured pleasure as he keens toward the ceiling. I've never seen anything quite like it. The second is even more gripping. Drunk stoned abject he crawls into a church his lapsed Catholicism has emerged only gradually during the story and muscular control disintegrating he falls to his knees in the aisle and wails howls and ululates like a wounded animal expressing his self loathing and accusing Christ of not helping him while at the same time beseeching his forgiveness and help. It's hard to imagine anyone doing this scene better. It brings to mind Cagney's outburst in the big house in White Heat. There are other scenes that are superficially more shocking  the bad lieutenant whacking away as he coerces two naive New Jersey women into being naughty in front of him  but Keitel plays the scene morosely as if engaging in a biologically necessary but essentially uninterestingly quotidian act something to be gotten out of the way. The film itself alas doesn't quite match the quality of Keitel's performance. There basically aren't any other important performances. The story is all Keitel's. There is no explanation of how he came to be the thoroughly rotten piece of moral filth that he has but I'm not sure that's required. Explanations for complex behavior tend to invite a certain glibness in writers his Mom always preferred his brother or his potty training was deficient or something. We really don't need his Rosebud. The nun who is raped is preternaturally beautiful a glowing creature almost grateful for the opportunity to forgive. She looks particularly radiant when naked. MY nuns were never like that! And let's face facts we didn't need an image of the living Christ appearing in the aisle of the church especially since he looks like a skinny longhaired madeup actor. The black woman into whom he changes would have sufficed. The most confusing and maybe the weakest part of the movie is the lieutenant's idea of redemption. Is it a good deed when you finally corner the two unrepentant skunks who raped the nun sit down on a couch and smoke some dope with them give them stolen money and put them on a bus to make a getaway? That's his idea of mimicking the nun and her forgiveness? What's to prevent these two nun rapists from giving yet another nun a chance to forgive them a month or two down the road? This is a bleak and tragic story partly because after all is said and done the lieutenant seems to have no idea of how to turn Bedlam back into Bethlehem.".

Aside from the use of Pledging my Love by Johnny Ace it explores the theme of Catholic guilt and how one's temptation and hunger for evil can weaken spiritual judgments.  The climactic scene is great in which Keitel literally comes face to face with Jesus.  I wasn't a big fan of Mean Streets and think this film better explores its Catholic themes.  One may perceive this film to be sinful and it received tons of controversy. It's very rare that a movie is able to show rape of a nun and get away Scottfree with the MPAA.  I think the NC17 rating was mostly on account of the explicit nudity and sex.  I don't know why the hell people are trying to scare viewers by regarding this movie as graphically violent.  About all we really see are aftermaths of violence.  However the language is extremely blunt and that's about the only warning I can give.  Of course religious activists might protest its use of footage of Jesus on a cross and the aforementioned rape scene but they simply have to look closer at what message Ferrara is trying to bring out.  Cinema is an art form often misjudged by the prudish.  The scene where Keitel pulls the two young girls over is classic and I loved its darkly humorous element. Bad Lieutenant is an impressive character study and though it occasionally gets meandering and repetitive and seems to be missing something which I might be able to identify on a second viewing it's a moving story with terrific acting.  I wasn't too thrilled with the other Ferrara pieces I've seen King of New York and The Funeral but I was younger and I think I just had trouble understanding the subtle messages he delivers in his films.  Of course he specializes in gritty urban dramas like this being a Bronx native what do you expect so something like Bad Lieutenant naturally wouldn't appeal to general audiences.  It's unpleasant though somewhat humorous but life can be the same way.  You can't spend your whole life watching The Wizard of Oz.  Every once in a while you have to take a break and watch graphic character studies like this and learn a little something.  After seeing this movie I'm curious about checking out some more of Ferrara's work because I know he has talent.  I can tell this a movie I will have to watch again because it's not easily understood the first time around but I'm sure there's hidden messages that just flew over my head.  I still think the film could've had more substance but it's still an impressive work.My score  7 out of 10".

A very difficult movie to watch it is said here but I am bound to point out how difficult it must have been to assemble a film like this.Redemption as shown in film can be a powerful thing whether it be religious or moral or not. In Unforgiven Clint Eastwood's character has been redeemed and reformed seemingly and walks himself into what is ultimately a replay of his sordid and murderous past. In the end he reretreats from his reprise and disappears into the sunset. Here Kietel's character is not interested in anyone's redemption he is indulging in an orgy of self hate and self destruction.He violates every rule. He breaks the confidentiality of the hospital room the confessional he violates his body with drugs and sex and displays his depravity unabashedly whether he is stealing evidence placing illegal wagers or stopping two young girls in a car.And speaking of that particular scene NO ONE could have played that better than Keitel. The anger the sleaze it's more selfabuse than self pleasure. All cast members turn in stellar performances in the course of playing out Ferrara's sickening stunning and stark backdrop of filth  all his fellow cops seem to be dirtbags who drink on the job and gamble illegally as well.The ending and the events leading up to it make a lot more sense than has been realized. Keitel's character just gives up and when he gets the two perpetrators he's not looking to turn himself around he is performing a senseless act by giving away the money and turning them loose. When he is told that he needs to pay his bookie who will murder him without a second thought he laughs  he doesn't care and almost welcomes the idea of death. He makes losing bets but he clearly knows they are losing bets the scene with the other cops shows him telling them to bet the other way!. He berates the mobster who's booking the bets knowing he will get killed.The idea of forgiving the nun's attackers is so out of whack to him... that he actually does it bringing more focus to the dysfunctionality of his existence. He's going down he knows it he doesn't care. It's like reading a book and wanting to get to the end so you know how it ends.

	schema:headline " Depravity  Forgiveness  A Unique Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Human beings don't come much worse than this New York City police officer aptly played by Harvey Keitel an actor who has never cared who he offended in any role or never backed off from a challenging role.Keitel reaches new depths of depravity in this role which you can see in either an Rrated or a NC17 rated version. That should tell you something about this movie so be forewarned and read some of these other reviews many of which are well written. The NC17 version probably is there because of Keitel pulling a female motorist over and then masturbating on her driver side's windshield no they don't actually show it. Nice huh?At least  and this turned off the sickos who loved Keitel's immoral character  he repents near the end hallucinating that he sees Jesus and begging for forgiveness. As bad as he is he's always aware of his sins. Speaking of forgiveness there is a nun in this movie who gives a demonstration of forgiveness that is astounding and is a great witness to the bad lieutenant. Thus even though the movie is extremely sordid there are some a few very redeeming qualities here....but so many of the opposite that I can't recommend this. Yet it's a unique story so you decide but know what to expect.I did get one big laugh out one scene in the film the one where Keitel loses a big baseball bet and shoots his car radio in frustration. Some viewers think he should have shot the people who made this film! On the other hand I know a lot sports bettors who know the feeling.".

	schema:headline " The Cinema of Abel Ferrara";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Lieutenant 1992 has to be one of Abel Ferrara's most misunderstood film. The movie's filled with Catholic guilt and religious dogma. It's about a corrupt soul seeking a way to find redemption and to enter the after world with a clear conscience. Made for nearly next to nothing Abel Ferrara and Harvey Keitel make one of the most moving films ever made.Harvey Keitel stars as the title character. A corrupt police officer who dwells in his excesses. A man who has hit rock bottom and tries to go even further. But by chance he comes across a Catholic Nun who was savagely raped by two former altar boys. This enrages the Bad L.T. who has more problems of his own to deal with. After meeting with the Nun she forgives them because it's what she's been taught and what she believes in her heart. After hearing the Nun's response  it drives the Bad L.T. crazy because he believes that they should get just punishment but she refuses.The meeting with the Nun stirs deep hidden religious feelings that are still within the Bad L.T. After having a deep experience with the Almighty and his son the Bad L.T. tries to do the right thing so he can find salvation for his soul. All the while his little world that he created collapses from his past sins and vices. Abel Ferrara directs a film that he knows how to do. A gritty street level cinematic experience. There are no expensive set pieces or flashy wardrobes or special effects. It's as if Abel Ferrara is taking you on a guided trip through the deeps of a corrupt person who has a flicker of a conscience deep inside. Be forewarned because it is a rough ride and only for those who can stomach the material. The song at the end will stick around in your head for awhile. A fitting end to a great movie such as this.Highly Recommended.If you're a Catholic you'll understand the dogma more than those who are unfamiliar with the Church's teachings. They're a big part of the movie and a lot of people wont understand the motivation that drives the Bad L.T.".

	schema:reviewBody "In New York a corrupt and abusive NYPD Lieutenant Harvey Keitel is addicted in drugs and gambling and has a great debt with a shark. He takes advantage of his authority to make deals with drug dealers and criminals to get drugs and dirty money and his bookmaker advises him that he owes money to dangerous people. When a nun is brutally raped by two youngsters the Lieutenant chases the criminals but the nun tells him that she had forgiven the punks. The Lieutenant is affected by her religious principles and asks Jesus to help him. Bad Lieutenant is one of my favorite films by Abel Ferrara with a great story of addiction corruption forgiveness and redemption. Last time I had seen this film was on 27 September 2000 and after seeing once again I realize that Bad Lieutenant is a timeless movie that has not aged. Harvey Keitel has one of the best performances of his successful career in the role of a dirty cop that finds redemption in the end. Unfortunately this film is only available on VHS in Brazil. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Vcio Frentico Frantic AddictionNote On 21 February 2017 I saw this film again.".

	schema:headline " Bad movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has a few things going for it. The acting for one Harvey Keitel is of course brilliant and this is after all the movie which made him. I like the way the fasttalking football radio commentator acts as glue and ferment between the scenes and in the opening shot. And the infamous scene where the nameless bad lieutenant sexually badgers two Jersey girls is a brilliant exercise in cinematic story telling and proof yet again that what you don't show in a movie can be much worse than what you do show.SPOILERS ON If you haven't seen the movie the nameless bad lieutenant stops a car with a busted taillight. As it turns out the passengers are two outoftown girls who have snaffled the family car to go to a downtown club and they obviously don't want their parents to hear about it. The lieutenant then orders the passenger girl to turn around while he masturbates to the girl in the driver's seat simulating fellatio.Visually the scene is not explicit  you see no skin or privates. Mentally the scene makes great impact. The scene is much creepier than if they had visually shown the lieutenant raping the two girls. SPOILERS OFFBut in many other aspects the movie is direly lacking. It uses a streamofconsciousnessstyle of filmmaking where the scenes are shot in a documentary style and you have to pick out the story from the scenes. Well I was picking and picking and still looking for the story when suddenly the titles rolled. What I got at the end is this a supersexy nun has been raped but refuses to identify the rapists because she's a Catholic who forgives those who rape her and the fact that identifying the rapists might prevent them from raping others somehow never enters the picture. The Bad Lieutenant being a Catholic himself struggles with this but he eventually captures the perps and for some reason puts them on a bus. Roll end titles. The crooked copper has ameliorated himself by setting free two nun rapists.There is no protagonist no antagonist no suspense no plot no development. The movie is visually very stylish but I never for one second believed that a real cop could carry on his excesses the way the bad lieutenant did. There are endless dream sequences where he injects freebase cocaine into his eyeballs in the company of a bevy of Nebraskan hookers whilst betting the life of his dead grandmother with the Albanian mafia on the Yankees' winning the world series which unfortunately in itself is totally boring and unshocking to watch. There is never any moral conflict  the lieutenant is too far gone for that. And if he's able to carry on all these excesses and STILL hold down a job as a police investigator take care of his family AND maintain the physique of a competition body builder then he must be doing something right. I abide by the law and eat muesli and still look like a dead newt.Overall despite its reputation a bad movie with only a few good scenes. It just tries too hard to be shocking and metaphorical.".

Gutted of Schooly D's Signifying Rapper this is still a great film but it needs to be reinstated by Artisan entertainment in all futurereleases. It allbut ruins the tone of the film by its absence which is one of relentlessdecline and decay. Abel Ferrara is a hero of American cinema a nationaltreasure asmuch as Scorsese and a great chronicler of our sordidtimes. His is a cinema of morality and as ugly as things get in his films he is not celebrating the scum. The genius of Ferrara is that he shows the crimes the hatred the violence the disease the sex and emotionalbrutality with nogarnish or stylizationasis. Like earlyKubrick we get a really scary world shotthrough with dread often lit by one barebulb like a Sundaymorning hangover.There is nodoubt in my mind that this is Harvey Keitel's finesthour and he is a hugepart of the film. The nexttime you hear some dumbstarlet complainingabout nudity watch Keitel's masturbationscene and his drunkenbaby scene and you tell me what a real actor is. I cannot imagine a morefearless American actorexcepting Marlon Brando's performance in Last Tango in Paris or Vince Gallo in his Brown Bunny. But Bad Lieutenant is Ferrara's baby and we should thank him for making a truly Christian film about a man's descentintothemuck and his finalredemption in our urban hell. There isn't much to add about this film it tells the story. It is ironic that this came out rightbefore a major drugsandextortion scandal rocked the NYPD outlined at the end of Ferrara's superb Rxmas and I recall the Police unions having a fit over this one. But it's truethere are cops like this and there are criminals asdepicted in the film. It might be the first theatricalfilm to depict somany instances of cracksmoking dopesmoking and what has to be a real shootinggallery scene with Keitel and the lateZoe LundTamerlis. The vice is endless here just endless and it made me feel incrediblepity for both cops and criminals and all the wretched of the Earth. Bad Lieutenant is an excruciatinglydetailed portrait of our times and illustrates the eternalnature of suffering and the possibilities of redemption. As bleak as life can be there is hope in life and in this film. Abel Ferrara is America's finest badboy director and one of the few truly independent directors left he is uncompromising as we all should be in this life. If you can handle the truths of our urbanrealityas ugly as it can bethis is a film that could easily sitbeside your copy of Fritz Lang's M or any of the greatest Filmnoirs. There are somany moments that can only be described as both religious and appalling a forgottenpart of all religions where the divine and profane exist sidebyside eternally. The onlyother film I can relate this to is Orson Welles's Touch of Evil and I consider them equals in quality and meaning.".

Second this movie is not believable. The amount of drugs and alcohol that Harvey Keitel drinks smokes snorts and injects is unreal. Third this movie is slooooooow. There is hardly any dialogue in the movie. Much of the dialogue is inaudible. Fourth there is almost no plot or story. Characters just enter and leave the film with no explanation of who they are or how they relate to the main character. Things just happen without rhyme or reason. The movie really only has one character and we never learn anything about him except that he is addicted to everything.Usually a movie that contains gratuitous sex heavy drug use or graphic violence is entertaining at some level.

It is certainly controversial though a good deal less shocking the one expects it to be given the pretext.It feels like Ferrara and Keitel simply thought of all the vices they could and threw them into this character in order to make him as shocking and deplorable as possible without actually giving any thought to why he is this way. Of course we are supposed to assume that 30 odd years as a NYC cop has turned him into this beast of a man but that seems to me to be taking your audience for granted somewhat. In fact it almost felt like the primary purpose of this film was to be controversial and shocking rather than to say anything profound.Keital's character and his performance were so overthetop that the film almost felt like a parody. Our cop is smacked out and unable to control his bodily functions one minute but totally lucid the next especially when it comes to talking his colleagues into gambling with no explanation. In the scenes where Keitel is supposed to be exploring the depths of this evil soul and wrestling with this man's selfhatred to quote some of the more overzealous reviewers he scrunches up his face and makes a sort of howlingwhining noise akin to the noise an injured dog might make. Is this supposed to be career defining performance? Looked more like someone who got kicked out of drama school to me.All in all this quite simply didn't feel like a coherent film. Of course one could argue that it isn't meant to feel coherent as the titular nutjob is meant to be off his face the whole time but that would be giving this film too much credit. It is unsubtle overplayed and unconvincing. It is watchable like all Ferrara films for it's depiction of a time and place and its exposition of a certain underbelly of existence but it never really gets beyond this.See this film for the controversy but don't expect any more than that from it.".

The film bears a strong resemblance to the thematically surreal and contrived nature of a Coen Brothers film but the difference is that this one is more character driven than plot driven. More specifically this is a film that lives on one performance. Nicholas Cage for the first time in a while has done something worthy of recognition possibly even award worthy.He plays New Orleans cop Terence McDonagh recently promoted to Lieutenant. The film follows his latest homicide investigation. Due to a back problem and a drug addiction he is grumpy and unstable. He is sort of an anti American hero and the film concludes on a very bizarre note but clever anti conventionalHollywood manner.Though not Herzog's best it is certainly one worth watching. With each film I see from him past or present he continues to intrigue me but I think in this case it might be Nicholas Cage who deserves the most credit.".

I won't spoil bits by mentioning them but the film has several standout memorable scenes worth the price of admission alone. Herzog has always said that training for making films is 'life' not a stuffy film studies class etc. If you're familiar with his work or sensibilities you'll get even more insight into how cool this guy is after watching this film.

As Herzog said a better franchise would be based on his title Port of Call New Orleans. The combined title is a compromise which Werner Herzog was willing to agree to.Herzog was fun as always at the introductory remarks and the QA with TIFF programmer Colin Geddes. Telling anecdotes such as Cage asking him on the 2nd day of shooting what is his motivation and Herzog telling him not to worry about that just go with Evil is bliss and sometimes let the pig out! from the Bavarian colloquialism Die Sau rauslassen!  Las die Sau raus!.I'll confess that I had my doubts about this one simply based on the BLt title alone imagining that this was going to be some sort of embarrassing sequel that has been imposed on Herzog for some bizarre contractual obligation reason. Have no fear about that! This is a Herzog movie and a Nicolas Cage onarampage movie with all that those both imply. Even if certain clichs of the genre are adhered to the prostitute girlfriend the father who is an excop now drinking himself to death etc. these end up having totally different plot resolutions than you'd expect. Cage's second scene confronting the matron lady and her hairdresser alone is worth the price of admission. I know they don't give Oscars for roles like this actually maybe for Denzel they did but this is the best Nicholas Cage I've seen in years.Comment at the QA I have seen 20 movies at this festival and this is the most entertaining of all of them! I couldn't agree more and BLtPoCNO was my 22nd. BLtPoCNO rocks and Herzog rules! Seen at the Elgin TheatreVISA Screening Room the 2nd screening of 3 at TIFF 2009.".

And you won't find many in the real drug world as good at it.The supporting cast is excellent although I must admit I did forget Val Kilmer was even it at times.The texture the interwoven story lines the camera work. All superb. It's a Tarrantino film with a Herzog touch. Ask yourself how many interrogation rooms have you seen on television and in movies? Any of them have windows with traffic outside? Probably not. Good touch and the film has dozens of them.As for the iguanas and dancing mobster. These are apparitions folks. You know born of the effects of all those drugs on the brain. They are not symbolic. They are not misguided touches of the bizarre well maybe they are a bit. They are the demons of a drug soaked mind and of course they are all of of proportion.

	schema:reviewBody "This wildly entertaining police drama which takes place in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina begins with a police officer being decorated and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant after bravely saving the life of a prisoner who'd been trapped in a flooded cell. The officer's injuries leave him with chronic back pain and his dependency on the painkiller Vicodin soon develops into a powerful addiction. His situation then worsens when he starts using cocaine and heroin in ever increasing quantities as he degenerates into behaviour which becomes reckless immoral and criminal. This man's experience is harrowing and extremely disturbing so it's something of a surprise to find that his story is told in a style which is not only dramatic but also at times extremely funny.Newly promoted Police Lieutenant Terence McDonagh Nicolas Cage is put in charge of an investigation into the execution type killing of a Senegalese family of illegal immigrants and information he receives from a known drug user soon confirms that the family were involved in dealing on a local drug lord's territory. This puts McDonagh on the trail of gang leader Big Fate Alvin Xzibit Joiner.In the course of his investigation McDonagh loses a teenage witness and in an effort to get the boy's grandmother to disclose his whereabouts goes to the nursing home where she works holds a gun to her head and threatens to kill one of the residents an old lady with a serious respiratory condition but he draws a blank as it transpires that the witness has emigrated to England.McDonagh's girlfriend Frankie Eva Mendes is a drug addicted prostitute with whom he shares his drugs. When he goes to see her in a Biloxi hotel room and finds that a client has physically assaulted her he threatens the man and takes 10000 from him. This leads to a bigger problem as the man is connected to some gangsters and one of them demands 50000 from McDonagh and gives him only two days to pay up.McDonagh is also beset by other problems as his bookie is demanding early settlement of his gambling debts and his alcoholic father is busy drinking himself to death. To make matters worse McDonagh is then relieved of his duties and sent to work in the evidence room as punishment for the way he'd treated the old lady in the nursing home. McDonagh responds to this indignity by joining forces with Big Fate in a move which not only solves his problems with the gangster but also provides him with an opportunity to bring his original investigation to a satisfactory conclusion albeit by an extremely unorthodox method.This movie features an amazing amount of unrestrained craziness and eccentricity and some real laugh out loud moments. McDonagh's use of narcotics often causes him to hallucinate and on some occasions he sees things such as iguanas or a man's spirit breakdancing after he'd been shot dead! Nicolas Cage is ideal for the part of the corrupt cop who uses a lucky crack pipe as his talent for acting unhinged and hysterically funny at the same time is absolutely extraordinary. The intensity that he achieves in the role which enables him to convey so powerfully the depths of his character's suffering and determination is also very impressive.The worst feature of the movie is its title which is too long and misleading as it suggests that it's a remake or a sequel to Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant 1992. More importantly though its visual style and the inclusion of Johnny Adams' wonderful rendition of Release Me add even more enjoyment to what already is an extremely entertaining account of McDonagh's insane journey through drugs depravity and unconventional crime fighting.".

The story is appropriately set in New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina's aftermath and mainly shows what occurs to good people when bad people prosper. Nicholas Cage aside Val Kilmer doesn't probably manages to do much but Mendes and Dourif deliver convincing performances. Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant was a dirty depiction of a strongly damaged detective played by Harvey Keitel where leaving from the illusions of a druginduced cop ended up involving a lot of Catholic guilt.

It didn't entertain me during the movie and afterwards I picked out the parts of the film that made my experience even worse. The fact that detective Terence McDonagh got a bad back by jumping into the water. How then could he save the drowning inmate? These two pieces of the plot are the keystones to the rest of the film and it just could not happen. Whether the movie was meant to be a combination of imaginations of the detective I do not know but unlike a A Beautiful Mind the renderings of the fictions in an altered reality come across as work of a six year old holding a camera. Not a crafted piece of deception which the mind is readily able to do. Just irritating to watch. I personally do not think that the people who created this movie really cared about making this movie. Every plot twist was created not out of intrigue or imagination but out of convenience. The biggest nail in the coffin of why I think this movie was not created out of care was the editing. Five Six Seven or more times I saw the overhead microphone come into the shot including the shadow of the mike on one occasion. If I was to view the DVD in the future would I see crew as well it would not surprise me in the least. The police cruiser of detective Terence McDonagh driving to confront the young couples leaving the night club obviously has no right side mirror the stump of where it is attached is clearly there but no mirror. Very disappointing to say the least. Others have mentioned overacting and to me the simplistic characters show a lack of care in creating a film which on its surface was meant to be something of substance. It certainly was not that at all. What an awful film.".

I know I'm watching a movie don't remind me.The movie is also goofy in other respects as well. In one of the final scenes everything comes together for Cage he wins his football bet for the week his record gets cleared up the crooks get captured the legbreakers get off his back and it all happens in the span of about 30 seconds. I was reminded of the scene in Men in Black when Tommy Lee Jones uses his memory messerupper to make all of Will Smith's coworkers compliment him on his great work. I couldn't take the movie seriously and perhaps it didn't want me to but it didn't do a very good job of letting me enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This nominal remake to Abel Ferraras 1992 original isnt bad and its not really good either. Nicolas Cage stars as the titular cop who doesnt so much as bend the law as stomp it flat in his quest to do whatever. Cage isnt terrible but even his unhinged charisma isnt quite edgy enough and feels one dimensional. Even the nihilism of Harvey Keitels character in the earlier film had more of a point than this uneven drama.Terence McDonagh is a detective in New Orleans. We pick up his story shortly after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in an early scene he and his partner Val Kilmer joke about saving or not saving a prisoner in a cell in which the water level has risen past the mans head. As the criminal desperately treads water McDonagh takes odds on his survival before the firemen come to rescue him.As before our protagonist is investigating a crime. A family of five has been shot execution style in their home. McDonagh must of course pull out all the stops to solve the crime and thus get more power and money and keep his prostitute girlfriend Eva Mendes in nice clothes and a highclass hotel. He also has a serious drug habit shaking down clubgoers in exchange for not busting them for whatever it is they didnt do. McDonagh also has to deal with his father a recovering alkie and his fathers girlfriend Jennifer Coolidge a current alkie who live out in the middle of the bayou.But where Ferraras movie pushed the envelope and strained our sense of good taste Werner Herzogs alleged remake seems too straightforward. McDonagh is just another dirty cop who breaks the rules to get what he wants. In the 17 years between films weve all seen countless movies about dirty cops and Cages McDonagh seems no better or worse than any of them. Keitels unnamed lieutenant desecrated churches and pranced about in a naked drunken stupor but Cages cop cant summon up the cojones to do anything that wild and crazy. Or maybe its just that were all so numb to outlandish on screen behavior that theres not much that Cage and Herzog could have done to shock and awe us.Its worth noting that Ferrara when asked about Herzogs upcoming film didnt have much nice to say about it Herzog also stated in interviews that he didnt feel that his movie was a remake of Ferraras despite the title because he Herzog had not seen the original. Well you cant fault that logic right? I just didnt find anything horrible about this movie nothing that makes me really dislike it. But I also didnt find it wildly entertaining. It has its adrenaline moments and the cast tries but its just an ineffective film. Its fun to see Val Kilmer though and Mendes looks great.The trouble with this movie is that the connection to the original is tenuous at best it sort of feels like the Bad Lieutenant part was tacked on in an effort to sell more tickets. Nah thats unpossible. Hollywood would never use familiarity to make more money right? Cage is going to have to do far more of these to pay off his tax bill.".

Or maybe its just that were all so numb to outlandish on screen behavior that theres not much that Cage and Herzog could have done to shock and awe us.Its worth noting that Ferrara when asked about Herzogs upcoming film didnt have much nice to say about it Herzog also stated in interviews that he didnt feel that his movie was a remake of Ferraras despite the title because he Herzog had not seen the original. Well you cant fault that logic right? I just didnt find anything horrible about this movie nothing that makes me really dislike it. But I also didnt find it wildly entertaining. It has its adrenaline moments and the cast tries but its just an ineffective film. Its fun to see Val Kilmer though and Mendes looks great.The trouble with this movie is that the connection to the original is tenuous at best it sort of feels like the Bad Lieutenant part was tacked on in an effort to sell more tickets. Nah thats unpossible. Hollywood would never use familiarity to make more money right? Cage is going to have to do far more of these to pay off his tax bill.";

Nonsensical lines like Do fish have dreams? or I'll kill the three of you dramatic pause till the break of dawn delivered by Cage as if they were poetic clever or menacing make fun of both the typical cool 'oneliners' found in action and crime movies and the pseudopoetic supposedly 'deep and meaningful' lines found in many 'indie' movies.Perhaps the most convincing signs that the film isn't meant to be serious but is ridiculous on purpose are the overthetop acting of the abusive john that Cage kicks out of his girlfriend's hotel room repeating 'whoa' and pausing to say something like 'oh yeah' to the kid waiting in the hall outside! which proves it's not just Cage who was told to overact and the last shot  held for quite a long time on two characters sitting under a fish tank coming after the aforementioned Do fish have dreams? line which makes it seem like it has some sort of 'deep' or symbolic meaning with Cage cracking up just when we're growing impatient for something to happen followed by a sudden cut to black. Even the casting of Val Kilmer in the role of an unimportant character who had next to nothing to do and could have been played by anyone seems to have parodic intentions what has Kilmer done recently?.As some reviewers have pointed out the actual plot once you remove the stylized direction and acting is the sort of thing you'd expect to find in a low quality straighttoDVD mysterythriller. Especially when you consider that many of Herzog's earlier films while definitely being bizarre or 'quirky' weren't cheesy or campy but had definite depth of humanity to them it really seems like here he's making fun of the generic conventional material he was given rather than taking it seriously.In a way it reminded me of The Room but done deliberately with a larger budget more technical polish and with an established star and director who have proved their abilities in the past  all of which make it more likely for viewers to take what they're seeing seriously instead of seeing through the absurdity of it all.

	schema:headline " Is it really as outrageously wild and wacky and dark as its reputation? Yes";
	schema:reviewBody "Nic Cage is a living breathing cartoon character both as a person and as an actor and the best filmmakers seem to grasp intuitively that the best way to have Nic in a moviethe only way reallyis to first be sure they've got for him an appropriately comical ironic melodramatic or surreal story. This one happens to be all four to a serious degree. It also features compelling and offbeat relationships and unexpected wild action all of it slyly hypnotic and even gripping. It'd be fair to describe this film as a tense crime drama that's regularly relieved by comical gags if it weren't for the fact that the perfectly timed humorous beats are so damn hystericaland so weird. The outrageously absurd profoundly wacky moments so thoroughly overwhelm the more somber dark and disturbing momentsnot in quantity but in sublime intensitythat they thoroughly dislodge us from any dependable emotional or psychological perch and it's hard to know with any confidence from instant to instant what we're expected to feel or think which apparently is very much intentional. We're being toyed with and not coyly but blatantly maybe even wickedly.The director Werner Herzog is a connoisseur of contradiction and paradox as he's masterfully demonstrated in many of his films such as the bleakly absurd Aguirre the Wrath of God or the incredibly preposterous Fitzcarraldo or the often delightfully campy Nosferatu the Vampyre where subtle humor is so effectively collided against genuinely poignant drama. But this one's on a whole different level and it's entirely the fault of Nic Cage and his nearly demented turbocharged performance as an increasingly crazed spiraling out of control drug addicted crooked cop.As his character's condition deteriorates and his affliction and corruption possess him to the core not only does Nic begin to distort his appearance and posture to match his deepening pathology but his voice as well becomes increasingly warped as it grows more high pitched and nasal as though the mounting stress is compressing him like a squeeze toy. It's beyond silly but it somehow works at least on the level of his character's distorted perverted perspective.

	onyx:emotionText "Nic Cage is a living breathing cartoon character both as a person and as an actor and the best filmmakers seem to grasp intuitively that the best way to have Nic in a moviethe only way reallyis to first be sure they've got for him an appropriately comical ironic melodramatic or surreal story. This one happens to be all four to a serious degree. It also features compelling and offbeat relationships and unexpected wild action all of it slyly hypnotic and even gripping. It'd be fair to describe this film as a tense crime drama that's regularly relieved by comical gags if it weren't for the fact that the perfectly timed humorous beats are so damn hystericaland so weird. The outrageously absurd profoundly wacky moments so thoroughly overwhelm the more somber dark and disturbing momentsnot in quantity but in sublime intensitythat they thoroughly dislodge us from any dependable emotional or psychological perch and it's hard to know with any confidence from instant to instant what we're expected to feel or think which apparently is very much intentional. We're being toyed with and not coyly but blatantly maybe even wickedly.The director Werner Herzog is a connoisseur of contradiction and paradox as he's masterfully demonstrated in many of his films such as the bleakly absurd Aguirre the Wrath of God or the incredibly preposterous Fitzcarraldo or the often delightfully campy Nosferatu the Vampyre where subtle humor is so effectively collided against genuinely poignant drama. But this one's on a whole different level and it's entirely the fault of Nic Cage and his nearly demented turbocharged performance as an increasingly crazed spiraling out of control drug addicted crooked cop.As his character's condition deteriorates and his affliction and corruption possess him to the core not only does Nic begin to distort his appearance and posture to match his deepening pathology but his voice as well becomes increasingly warped as it grows more high pitched and nasal as though the mounting stress is compressing him like a squeeze toy. It's beyond silly but it somehow works at least on the level of his character's distorted perverted perspective. Often the soundtrack is emphatically offbeat quirky and disruptive working in counterpoint to the pace and tone of the unfolding action. But the musical score might then quickly shift to more traditional rhythms more in sync with the apparent mood of the scene which only renders those moments all the more unsettling. It's a very subversive technique inciting a creeping crawling uncertainty deep within the subconscious at a primal level a sincerely surreal experience punctuated so ridiculously so blatantly by the hallucinogenic appearances of those damn freaky iguanas.

	schema:reviewBody "Herzog's popularity and some might say his entire career came from his long partnership with the incomparable firestorm of an actor Klaus Kinski. In Herzog's own words their joint derangement must have converged to create great art. Whether Herzog was referring to Kinski's explosive fury on screen or something more insidious such as the real life allegations that Kinski sexually molested his daughter from age 5 to 19 we don't know. My point is that Herzog had the ability to draw on Kinski's madness  evil to create some very memorable films about precisely that madness  evil Aguirre Fitzcarraldo Nosferatu. After Kinski died Herzog's films were considerably less explosive although he still pushed those dark themes.Here in Bad Lieutenant Port of Call  New Orleans once again we get the familiar themes of madness and depravity and although it doesn't quite strike that horrifying Kinski vein it has moments of brilliance thanks to an excellent acting job by Nicolas Cage.We also get at the core a wellwritten story by William Finkelstein who wrote extensively for gritty TV crime dramas like NYPD Blue Law  Order and L.A. Law.It's the story of a rogue New Orleans cop who is investigating a series of murders while he himself flirts with depravity as he battles with drugrelated issues and moral degradation. What's important to note is the familiar Herzoggian theme of madness and the thrill of of evil on the human soul. Cage plays a detective who on the surface is a cooltempered  intelligent hero a likable guy really. But he begins to descend into depravity and there are 1 or 2 moments of outright sickening behavior such as falsely arresting then having sex with a woman in exchange for letting her go. This is not a film for the morally faint of heart. It is intended to morally shock us and that it does.But what's interesting is the way Cage's portrayal remains heroic the good guy unlike Kinski's villainous portrayals the monster. In the past HerzogKinski films presented us with a vision of evil which thrilled us in a guilty way as if we're passing a gory car wreck. Here we have the much more comfortable yet equally challenging perspective of watching a good guy who can't resist the thrill of depravity. So from a safer distance from evil we can watch the story unfold.I don't know if it's that subtle thematic difference or simply the idea that Nicolas Cage is not an alleged incestuous child abuser that made me enjoy this film in a lighter way. I should note that this film also carries much more humor and playful dark comedy than any of Herzog's other films I've seen. In the 2nd half of the film Cage's frenetic portrayal of a cokedup crackedup drug fiend was done a comedic air... along with some hilarious surreal visuals  music the break dancing scene had me laughing out loud.Ultimately we get a morality tale which is very gritty very comic very morally disturbing and yet it doesn't leave us with a sick feeling like certain other films which explore the evil nature of human beings. In fact with the exception of the disturbing sexual bribe scene Bad Lieutenant could almost be watched as a dark comedy from start to finish. It's a different approach for Herzog one which would be great to see him explore in the future.Final note worth mentioning since Herzog's early films were notorious for having real animal abusekilling that may disturb some viewers Yes there is a scene of a dead alligator with her guts spilled out and yes it is real. But according to the DVD extras the alligator carcass was purchased from presumably New Orleans animal control because it was a nuisance alligator eating people's pets and stuff. I think there was an American Humane no animals harmed disclaimer at the end of the movie.".

This is nothing but a campy pointless dull comedy or parody if you like employing all stamps of cheap police serials. Herzog does throw in a bit of 'Fear and Loathing' inspired puff which apparently should hint at some openmindness but since there is no idea or feeling or mood or anything behind it the puff remains a puff. I cannot get rid of the impression that the creators of the 2009 movie had the only aim of replacing the seriously bad Keitel's lieutenant with something much less problematic.The actors work is horrible in a sense that there is no sign of real life not a single one believable character. All are flat masks starting with Cage. The plot is reasonably twisted but again no sign of real life it's all kinda comic book story made up to entertain with no reference to any believable situation.

If you have seen Werner Herzog's other films then you will like this maybe not as much as some of his other films but there is a lot to like. Nicolas Cage gives a fantastic performance and is clearly back on form after the likes of Next National Treasure and The Wicker Man. The rest of the cast also do a good job but the focus is on Cage. The chosen location of New Orleans suits the film well and the cinematographer does a good job showing it. The script writer must also be credited for providing the film with interesting pieces of dialogue even though its difficult to tell what was improvised and what was not. This film is not for everyone though since the trailer shows it as a more of an crime thriller than a drama. If you are not a fan of art house films or films that have an offbeat sense of humor then you might not enjoy it as much as those who do.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite what you might think after reading my title I quite liked Bad Moon. It's good for a werewolf movie even though I sometimes had the feeling I was watching an episode of Lassie rather than a movie about a werewolf.A man and his girlfriend both American scientists on an expedition somewhere in the jungle of India were attacked by a werewolf. He manages to survive the attack and knows to kill the animal but his girlfriend has already been ripped to pieces and died a horrible death. Even though he survived the werewolf wounded him badly and now he's a werewolf himself. Despite popular believe the man doesn't only turn into a werewolf at full moon. He becomes one every night and there is no cure. His only hope is his sister and her son. He hopes that the love of his family will cure him from his disease.As I already said Bad Moon is an enjoyable movie. Especially the morphing technique when you actually see him turn into a werewolf is cool to watch. The story may not always be the very original it still does the trick. The same for the acting. There is nothing spectacular about it but it is very decent and believable. I give this movie a 6510.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with werewolf movies is that there's so few good ones. Since the dawn of the millennium we've had two good ones Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers and then there's the 80's duo of An American Werewolf in London and The Howling not to mention the Universal and Hammer takes on the legend...but seriously the werewolf tale is a classic story and it deserves more good films than just the aforementioned. Bad Moon while certainly not a bad take on the story is hardly one to add to the illusive list of good ones but it's still an enjoyable ride for the werewolf fan. It has all the elements to be a success decent effects a change sequence some interesting characters and even a bit about the legend itself. We follow Uncle Ted a man that has been bitten by a werewolf and decides to go and stay with his sister and her son in order to beat the curse with family love. However one thing he hasn't counted on is the family dog Thor who could end up being the family's one last hope of survival.The special effects in a werewolf film are very important as the monster is the centre of the tale and bad effects can easily bring a whole movie down. This movie is lucky enough not to suffer from bad effects and while the wolf isn't exactly lifelike it looks good enough and it also appears in the film quite often which is a nice bonus. The change sequence is a little suspect and has nothing on the change scenes in the werewolf films of the 80's but it's always good to see in a film of this kind. Aside from the werewolf element Bad Moon also draws on the idea of a strange uncle invading a film home for it's scares and the idea works quite well. Another idea that works better than I thought it would is having the main hero be a canine. Dogs are sensitive animals and the film also draws on the idea of a dog wanting to protect the family home from threats. It's also admirable how they managed to get the dog to certain things for the camera as I imagine that sort of thing wouldn't be easy. While this film isn't a great example of a take on the werewolf legend it's entertaining and I reckon that people who like werewolf movies will find lots to like about it.".

Thor has Flopsy running for his life with his tail between his legs and threatening to report her and Thor to the local sheriff. Later Janet gets a call from her brother Ted Michael Parewho's been away for a while on the Indian subcontinent with his fellow archaeologist and girlfriend Marjorie Johanna Lebovitz. Janet is more then happy to invite Ted to stay with her not knowing that Ted had picked up a little something in the wilderness of Tibet a vicious wolf bite when he and Marjorie were attacked in their tent by a wolflike animal that tore Marjorie to pieces and left Ted barely alive.At the house Thor senses that there's something strange about Ted and Ted knows it. Thor's got the drop on Ted for what he really is. Thor being civil doesn't let on to Janet and Brett who Ted really is in order not to spoil the family gettogether but keeps a close eye on Ted to the point where one night he follows him into the woods and sees what he really is A Werewolf.Ted to his credit does try to prevent himself from going out in the woods at night when there's a full moon and killing both people and animals by handcuffing himself to a tree in the forest. This doesn't work all the time with Ted breaking loose and attacking and killing a number of campers and neighbors.One night Flopsy sneaks onto Thor's doghouse with an ax in order to kill him for making a fool out of him by showing him up for what he really is a coward and chiseler. Flopsy instead of finding Thor is found by Ted in his werewolf mode and ripped to shreds. Sheriff Jenson Ken Pogue who Flopsy reported that he was attacked by Thor earlier in the movie has the local ASPCA take Thor to the dogpound to be euthanized for the suspected killing of Flopsy. With both Janet and Brett alone and Thor not being around to protect them Ted again turns into a werewolf at moonlight.

With the help of Janet blasting Ted with a full load of lead from her handgun Thor injured and bleeding then slams Ted right out of a top floor window killing him. Thor who was on deathrow just hours before ended up saving the day or was it the night as well as both Janet and Brett lives.Bad Moon is a pretty good dog coming to the rescue film with Thor stealing every scene as well as bone that he was in. The one thing that puzzled me about the hero of the movie Thor was what happened to him after he was savagely bitten and mauled by the werewolf? shouldn't he have also turned into a werewolf himself like Ted did or are werewolf bites only effective on humans not animals when it comes to making then into beasts! The answer may be that Thor being a dog he can't be effected by any werewolves bites since he's I know this is very hard to believe a beast already?".

Everyone is happy about the idea except for her German Shepard dog who seems to have something against Ted. What Janet doesn't realize is that her brother was attacked by a werewolf and is now one himself.I didn't see BAD MOON when it was originally released even though I love werewolf movies. I finally caught up with it on DVD and really enjoyed the movie so I decided to revisit it yet again on Bluray and I think it has gotten even better. Is the movie flawless? Of course not but at the same time there's no question that it's an entertaining horror film.What I enjoyed most about the film is that there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue as the main action takes place between the uncle and the dog. I really loved this aspect of the story and it was fascinating watching the dog and his reaction to the Uncle. I loved the way the dog could see the dnager that his owners were in and this aspect of the film brought an original touch to a genre that has had countless movies in it.The werewolf effects were quite good and I'd consider them oldfashion which certainly isn't a bad thing. Some of the violence is quite graphic for its time and there's no question that the three leads are a lot of fun and work well together. The real star has to be Primo the dog who plays THor. He is such a great dog actor and you can't help but say he's one of the best in the history of cinema. Yeah that's high praise but he's really that great and his reactions to things going on around here was just flawless.BAD MOON isn't going to win any major awards but there's no doubt that it's a very good and highly entertaining film.".

It really was hard to get through because she is a horrible excuse for an actress. How this woman had a career I can only speculate. Special effects not bad for an older movie. I'm not into horror and gore so I had to avert my eyes a lot but I do like WerewolfVampire movies if they have an actual plot. This one did and it wasn't bad. Would have enjoyed it much more with a half way decent actress. Didn't even require Alist just someone who knew how to express emotion.

It's strait forward horror it doesn't try to be anything else. It's short only 74 minutes I think and that a good thing because movies like this shouldn't be long. This is a straightforward horror film and its great for what it is. The end when he's changing in the woods was very suspenseful and when the surveyor bites it that was just awesome. Another good thing about this movie is the werewolf itself it's a great looking werewolf even though it's obviously animatronics but still badass and scary looking especially the eyes.One bad thing is the crappy CG transformation it was laughably bad.In conclusion this movie isn't groundbreaking but its fun scary entertaining horror that is well worth a rent.".

The size of the werewolf too many times in werewolf flicks the wolves are more like men than animals in stature. But in this movie there is a perfect blend of human and animal size and movement. And finally he's a white wolf i repeat a white wolf. I love this movie for going against the grain and showcasing a white wolf if the rest of the movie was completely awful watch it once to see the white wolf. There are also elements of this flick i hate. Mariel Hemingway is stiffer than Gray Davis in this movie not to mention the dog. Okay don't get me wrong i like dog's the dogs performance but to me it's an insult to horror fans and werewolf fans alike that a damn german shepard can kill a full grown werewolf! I hate to say it but it's just not realistic. That goes way beyond suspension of disbelief. two and a half stars".

There are also elements of this flick i hate. Mariel Hemingway is stiffer than Gray Davis in this movie not to mention the dog. Okay don't get me wrong i like dog's the dogs performance but to me it's an insult to horror fans and werewolf fans alike that a damn german shepard can kill a full grown werewolf! I hate to say it but it's just not realistic. That goes way beyond suspension of disbelief. two and a half stars";

Believable acting from animals is exceptionally rare but Primo nails his role as family pet and Pare's rival for alpha male status. All in all Bad Moon is worth a look especially if your into wolfman movies.".

What money they had probably went into the animatronic wolf since they apparently didn't hire a script writer or maybe they got one for free from a film school.  The plot such as it is doesn't have much in the way of traditional tension building we know exactly who the werewolf is and why he became that way from the very beginning.  There are a lot of long meaningful stares between Pare and the family dog german shepherd Thor who being a canine cousin knows exactly what the wolf is upto.  There are numerous children's movies with dogs as the lead actor the Benji series comes to mind but not that many adult oriented ones and there may be a reason  they're boring when not being cute.Pare not known for being a very good actor puts in a pretty good performance here  he communicates a fairly decent sense of desperation and self loathing.  Mariel Hemingway on the other hand sort of seems like she needed a few more takes to get it right and maybe they didn't have the money to keep the set going.  If that's not the case then she basically just phoned it in not much there while the kid is not quite as annoying as other cutesy child actors his haircut seems weird where the character is mostly bland.  Not a terrible way to waste not quite an hour and a half maybe on a rainy afternoon or late at night when nothing else is on but don't make a trip to the vid store expressly for this  there are other better horror movies out there.".

She shrugged her shoulders and sat down. So Bad Moon had to hope for patrons getting lost on the way to other movies. More tragedy.The movie began and dang it I liked it! Now Bad Moon doesn't have what one would call a complicated story. The wayward brother becomes a werewolf and moves in with his sister. That's it. But the werewolf makeup was great and the kills were fantastic. The hot babe who gets it at the beginning was appropriately bloody and of course the big climax scene with Thor was great.

Some reviewers complain about there being too much CGI in this movie but as far as I can tell there is only a tiny bit.

As werewolf movies go this is a pretty good little movie. Little actually being the keyword there because if there's a problem with this movie it's the running time. I mean 79 minutes come on !. That's way too short. It doesn't look to me like it was cut down though I fear they just didn't shoot anymore than what's on screen otherwise the DVD would've included outtakes I'm sure. I wonder why it's so short it doesn't make any sense afterall you want beastly action in a creature feature like this. What this movie needs to be really great are some more werewolf attack scenes alas we get only a couple when just a single one more kill would've done the trick. Oh well it's still a good werewolf movie and there's even a clip on a TVscreen from Universal's Werewolf Of London 1935 with Henry Hull. The beast itself in Bad Moon is great looking a bit like the creature in Silver Bullet. All in all a fine flick we should be happy they even make werewolf movies anymore. I guess it's true what they say legends never die no matter how oldfashioned the subject. Just stay away from CGI a guy in a suit will do nicely thank you.".

	schema:headline " A deflated and desperate ride through the formula of chaos";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sitter is a deflated comedy robbed of all laughs jokes and originality. It knows formula well but doesn't know where to go from there. It also knows how to pick a lovable lead actor who is consistently funny in everything he does. It's the second film to be released by independent filmmaker David Gordon Green this next to Your Highness. Both will earn a special place on my list of worst films for 2011.Even since Your Highness David Gordon Green has successfully put me in a state of neverending puzzlement. Here's a guy that has made back to back acclaimed independent features and now chooses to use his time directing lame directionless comedies without wit or a soul. The Sitter takes an already mediocre premise and refuses to push it off its feet into something more original or fresh. It understands the formula inside out but proceeds to disregard everything else.Noah Hill is a layabout who is lured into babysitting three children for his mom's friend so they can go to a party together. The kids are sexual confused Slater Record the pint sized fourth Kardashian Blithe Bender and the rebellious Latino Rodrigo Hernandez. What kind of children are these? They're not normal children. They feel like real people shrunk down to fit pint sized kids. Regardless their roles aren't at all funny.Soon after arriving at the job and discovering the chaotic duty behind it Noah's girlfriend Marisa Graynor calls asking him to deliver her cocaine at a party and she'll reward him with sex. Noah tries to get cocaine but Rodrigo winds up stealing an egg full of cocaine costing Noah over 10000.Oh and I'm not even going to continue from there. The film is relentless in its gags and events none of them even remotely realistic or the least bit funny. The biggest laughs in fact aren't even from Jonah Hill but J.B. Smoove who you may recognize as Leon from Curb Your Enthusiasm. I actually would've adored the idea of him playing the babysitter much more than Hill. Don't you hate it when that happens?

Green isn't the director who stays inside the lines so I was hoping he'd make a smarter comedy here.The Sitter is an exercise is cheap filmmaking. It relies on lackluster stereotypes recycled jokes and caricatures to function inside its dead formula. It's a miserable comedic workout.Starring Jonah Hill Ari Graynor Sam Rockwell Method Man Kevin Hernandez Max Records and Landry Bender. Directed by David Gordon Green.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Sitter is a deflated comedy robbed of all laughs jokes and originality. It knows formula well but doesn't know where to go from there. It also knows how to pick a lovable lead actor who is consistently funny in everything he does. It's the second film to be released by independent filmmaker David Gordon Green this next to Your Highness. Both will earn a special place on my list of worst films for 2011.Even since Your Highness David Gordon Green has successfully put me in a state of neverending puzzlement. Here's a guy that has made back to back acclaimed independent features and now chooses to use his time directing lame directionless comedies without wit or a soul. The Sitter takes an already mediocre premise and refuses to push it off its feet into something more original or fresh. It understands the formula inside out but proceeds to disregard everything else.Noah Hill is a layabout who is lured into babysitting three children for his mom's friend so they can go to a party together. The kids are sexual confused Slater Record the pint sized fourth Kardashian Blithe Bender and the rebellious Latino Rodrigo Hernandez. What kind of children are these? They're not normal children. They feel like real people shrunk down to fit pint sized kids. Regardless their roles aren't at all funny.Soon after arriving at the job and discovering the chaotic duty behind it Noah's girlfriend Marisa Graynor calls asking him to deliver her cocaine at a party and she'll reward him with sex. Noah tries to get cocaine but Rodrigo winds up stealing an egg full of cocaine costing Noah over 10000.Oh and I'm not even going to continue from there. The film is relentless in its gags and events none of them even remotely realistic or the least bit funny. The biggest laughs in fact aren't even from Jonah Hill but J.B. Smoove who you may recognize as Leon from Curb Your Enthusiasm. I actually would've adored the idea of him playing the babysitter much more than Hill. Don't you hate it when that happens? In the same movie you find an actor who is playing the secondary character but you wind up liking him more than the actor playing primary character and wish the film went through some sort of star reversal? The endangerment of the kids is sickening the jokes appallingly unfunny the setups are outlandish and the sentimentality the film tries to shoot for at the end is deplorable.

Jonah Hill suddenly turns from a sitter to a child psychologist or a shrink and the laughs stopThere's nothing wrong with wanting to instill some heart in an Rrated comedy the first Hangover movie successfully pulled that off with the underlying theme of friendship and solidarity but THE SITTER is bedridden with too many issues even the 'heart' gets confused. All of a sudden it becomes some kind of public service announcement for 'it's OK to be you'. It suffers from the same disease that victimized Your Highness also directed by David Gordon Green the script's got Fbombs to spare for the next century and that's all that the movie relies on.The three kids have pretty funny and interesting personalities and habits. So for a short while Hill's clashing with those personalities are good enough to get us engaged but once those personalities run their course they don't have much more to offer and so what's left is a series of predictable situations that are usually started or ended by Hill's literally hitting the brakes and that happens way too often.Hill is a funny man and I think he's proved that with Superbad Get Him To The Greek and more. As Noah the sitter Hill is just a guy who wants to help his mom and impress his supposed girlfriend the whole deal with the dad who abandoned him showcases Hill's dramatic side that we saw Moneyball but it goes back to the problem of this comedy not being able to stay comedy. Sam Rockwell as the eccentric psycho drug kingpin is mildly interesting but even if he doesn't manage to crack me up. THE SITTER is yet another disappointing work by director David Gordon Green whose 2008 comedy is one of the best pothead movies I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Elisabeth Shue's 1987 film Adventures In Babysitting a thousand times.".

Unfortunately my gut was correct and I am still seeking laughter.David Gordon Green also directed Pineapple Express and Your Highness neither my style but both clearly comedies. Jonah Hill has quite the track record of comedy films Cyrus and earlier this year made his first foray into drama with Moneyball. He has also recently lost a tremendous amount of weight so this was to be his final fat guy comedy.If you have seen the farsuperior Adventures in Babysitting 1987 with Elisabeth Shue then you know the basic premise. Hill does his mother a favor by agreeing to babysit her friend's three kids. This proves more challenging than Hill's character expected. The kids are Slater played by Max Records Where the Wild Things Are Blithe played by Landry Bender and Rodrigo played by Kevin Hernandez. The kids of course have various afflictions phobias and disorders ... but none as off the charts as Hill's character.Without going into detail the first scene is horrible and the movie somehow proceeds to get worse from there. There is bathroom humor a run in with a drug dealer Sam Rockwell a bitchy girlfriend Ari Graynor and a confrontation with a group of African Americans featuring Method Man. Every scene is predictable and generated no laughter from me or hardly anyone else in the theater. I always say that comedies are most difficult genre to review because everyone has a unique sense of humor ... but this one just offers so very little.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as comedy goes Jonah Hill has steadily made a name for himself as a star in the genre. Personally his films have always been hit or miss for me and I've come to the conclusion that his best work is reserved for those times when he has a solid usually more naturally comedic actor to support him. With The Sitter he is already at a disadvantage his main supporting actors are children and for the most part his abilities are frontandcenter for the entire film which was entirely his idea to begin with. The results are mixed at the best of times and for the most part lackluster in general.What immediately screamed at me about the opening sequence was trying very hard to get the audience's attention. I won't spoil the scene for those who haven't seen the movie but you'll agree with me once you do. Before I go much further let it be known that I am an extremely big fan of lighthearted irrelevant humor Anchorman is one of my most loved comedies for instance and for the most part these are the sorts of films Jonah fits into. The Sitter tries to emulate the formula of many recent successful comedies in terms of witty oneliners and clever tradeoffs between characters occasionally seasoned with a bit of more physical comedy. It's an old system of course and something I've more or less come to terms with as being the norm in popular comedic cinema. But what disappoints me about The Sitter is how many times it whiffs on the concepts seemingly custommade situations for Jonah's quick nonchalant wittiness are for the most part poorly written and performed. The more actionbased comedic portions of The Sitter involve a child with a penchant for explosives and some vehicle shenanigans that are rather uninspired and bland without the accompanying depth of creative dialog and jokes.At some point perhaps early on or perhaps towards the end the movie takes a sudden shift into the dramatic focusing on Jonah's character's relationship with his father or the troubles with his girlfriend. These aspects of the film ring as hollow and somehow incomplete in the face of a heavy dose of relatively immature and inane comedy. The character development is far too sparse and when it does take place far too blunt and again uninspired to merit the delving into such intimate places. What does work and this surprised even me is how Jonah's character relates to the children he is babysitting. Being an eternal child at heart Jonah's connection to his ward's problems feels perfectly natural and in certain ways touching to a degree. But ultimately it all feels out of place like a scarecrow in an empty field it would have a purpose if only it's surroundings were in better shape.The whole film moves at an increasingly agonizing pace at it becomes more and more clear that you're actually waiting for something funny to happen. Not to say it doesn't happen but the consistency is so off that it ruins the entire project. There's a certain level of bland uninspired atmosphere that permeates the film oozing out of it like a thick mud you cannot remove yourself from. And when you finally do when the mood lightens and you actually catch yourself grinning or maybe even shocked to hear a chuckle cross your lips you raise your foot from the mud...only to find your shoe still stuck in it. Relief turns back into aggravation and more than anything else you just want it to end.".

Most movies are answer me this how many movies have you seen where you were genuinely surprised at the ending. So naturally my expectations were lowered. But I thought the acting by the children was really good and Jonah Hill was as funny as usual. Also it dealt with a prevalent issue in many kids' lives coming out as gay. It dealt with this in a respectful and not overlysentimental way.Basically this movie is not trying to bag an Oscar and it is not high art melodrama stuff and it's not even close to being one of my favourite films.

The only problem is she can't go because her friends can't find a baby sitter. Noah reluctantly agrees to baby sit the friends children.The kids of course are all nightmarish and start acting out as soon as the parents leave. While Noah is struggling to contain the behavior problems his hot and cold girlfriend calls and asks Noah to come to a party that she is at. She promises Noah sex if he shows up and stops off to buy some cocaine for her. So Noah loads up the minivan with the kids and sets out for the big city. As you can imagine Hilarity ensues.Jonah hill has impressed as of late with some of his performances. His work on Moneyball was a standout and he stole most of scenes that he was in. Surprisingly he actually does a good job here as well. he delivers on some pretty funny dialogue that will actually garner a few laughs.The problem with The Sitter is just that its a terrible script. The plot is ridiculous and predictable. The scenes where Noah tries to get inside the heads of the kids and teach them life lessons seem overly contrived and forced. The movie plods along to predictable conclusions that we have seen over and over again from other much funnier movies.I don't know how they got Sam Rockwell to appear in this film but what a waste of time and talent. His character is redonkulous. I have no idea where they were going with his role and what they were trying to accomplish but lets use the word outlandish and leave it at that. There are few funny parts in the Sitter that you will get to see in the trailer below.

Jonah Hill is a very likable character in the film with an understandable ploy.

	schema:reviewBody "Not sure why this movie was made. It seems as if every offensive clich was abused to the max. This movie made no sense and it questioned the intelligence of every movie goer in the world. The kids were acting as if they were given a concept of a movie child and then allowed by the director to adlib badly. The resolution for the kids problems were so poorly done and the premise made me wish I never got on this ride. The blaxploitation of the 70's seemed to be revived in a gruesome side story which made me cringe. Sam Rockwell played his part with a comedic timing which made him a stand out in the whole thing. I am not sure what the movie says about today's entertainment writing in Hollywood. Jonah Hill acted as if he channeled the Greek movie into collaboration of improbably scenes. I guess the use of Method Man legitimized the ethnic scenes or something. I am pretty certain this production was not vying for the Academy Awards or the Golden Globe. The predictable story line just got dumber as it went on and on. This movie was about 45 minutes too long.".

	schema:headline " Winner of the worst script of the year.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sitter is Adventures in Babysitting with Fbombs forced drug humor and middle school sex jokes. Directed by David Gordon Green Pineapple Express Your Highness a man who is astonishingly coming out with his second most unfunny comedy this year and starring Jonah Hill who is unfortunately in Green's second most unfunny comedy of the year . The writers of this fiasco of a script are newcomers Brain Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka who seemed only to have pieced together scripts from multiple 1980's Bmovie style teen flicks and added in some dialogue which consists of crude jokes from their failed standup careers. The end result is that The Sitter may contain one or two funny jokes but they are buried within a dungheap of a script.Side Note This movie contains an all too unfortunate supporting performance from the great Sam Rockwell Moon that I do not wish to write about for fear of becoming too angry to continue with my review.The Sitter was more than likely an attempt by Hollywood to see how well Jonah Hill Superbad did as a leading comedic actor and not just the fat sidekick character. And while his performance is what it is the real flaw here is not with Hill's performance but with the storyline or lack of. Let me paint a picture. There is no storyline!!! In maybe the most idiotic plot since Cowboys  Aliens Hill plays random loserniceguy with zero potential as a human being Noah Griffith. Noah has a girlfriend that treats him like garbage. His mom asks him to take a job as a babysitter babysitting a motley crew of the most one dimensional children put on the big screen since 2010's GrownUps. He takes it for seemingly no reason. Noah makes some inexplicably horrid choices again for seemingly no reason which result in some of the cheapest slapspick comedic scenarios of the year and at the end of the night he learns a lesson but not really. That's it. No action in the movie has any justification behind it. This movie simply powers forward through a rolodex of shrug inducing jokes totally disregarding the fact that the audience probably isn't laughing. The storyline has absolutely no direction. As Noah takes the children on a drug run because the script deems it so the audience is bombarded with cocaine in the face jokes followed by an illconceived sentimental moment followed by a man's groin being set on fire and then back to the grossly overplayed sentimentality. It just doesn't flow at all. This script is so bad that there was even a point in the middle of this movie where Noah has an epiphany that acknowledges out loud his girlfriends true feeling towards him which should have altogether halted his quest to see his girlfriend or the entire point of the film and ended the movie. BUT NO! The plot moves forward despite this game changing revelation and why? Conceivably because Green as a director didn't catch or wish to acknowledge this egregious plothole in the script. So the audience must sit through the final fortyfive minutes of The Sitter as if that scene never happened.With a script as halfassed as this seemed to be one would assume that the characters throughout are bound to be just as problematic. And that brings me to the children. The children here are so underdeveloped that they aren't even people they are simply emotions used to move the razorthin plot along. A bratty little girl who uses foul language yeah that would have been funnier if I were seven a super emotional preteen boy whose storyline attempts to become sentimental but verges on borderline homophobic and a stereotypical Latin kid who thinks he's Scarface does not a film make! And as for those sentimental moments they are truly the most cringe inducing aspect here. I'm sorry but any movie that would have Jonah Hill giving out sappy life lessons is doomed for failure. But again Hill wasn't the worst part of the film. The fact is without Hill's likability as a lead actor The Sitter would have been unwatchable.Final Thought In the last few years Green seems to have developed a compulsion to only make terribly unfunny and bland comedies which center around potheads. But the biggest punchline of these films are how Green holds actual directors credits yet there seems to be no direction to any of his movies. It is simply a shame that Hill chose this film to show that he could carry a lead role in a comedic film. And while he does carry this movie with the help of Green and two hack writers there isn't much of a movie to carry. In the end The Sitter is the film equivalent of buyer's remorse whereas it looked incredibly funny from the trailer but is just the opposite once you find yourself sitting in a rather silent and rather packed theater for an unusually lengthy 81 minutes wishing you could ask for a refund.Please visit my page on Examiner.com httpwww.examiner.comx52464SanJoseIndieMovieExaminer and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

I seriously cringed so many times.It's not all horrible since there are a few laughs here and there and Jonah Hill tries his best so much. In a way I can't help but hate him for taking this role but without Hill it would be even worse. Also the only real likable character here is Max Slater's who manages to have some more quiet moments in the film but even he is completely two dimensional.

	schema:reviewBody "Many great films just sneak up on you  their greatness comes from their quirkiness rather than textbook qualities think cult classics of yesteryear like King of Hearts or Harold  Maude. PT's Bad Wives is XXX porn but has those same indefinable elements that led to greatness too bad IMDb voters give it a low rating for some similarly undefinable reasons.Certain scenes are cryptic notably an early pan down to the ground at an outdoor birthday party where we see a chunk of cake covered in ants but once the reveal is provided we see that PT and his screenwriter Dean Nash are going after some big game thematically.The ironic title does justice to its contents as we witness a minirebellion by suburban housewives Dyanna Lauren and Melissa Hill against the constraints of suburban living. Their husbands are the enemy even though they aren't terrible at all and the final reels become surrealistic as our heroines nearly morph into Patty Hearststyle armed combatants. But the sex along the way is superlative and lead Lauren was never lovelier with her figure a perfect 10 while sidekick Hill is consistently sympathetic. The instigator of all this rumpus is a demon or perhaps the Devil himself wily played by Steven St. Croix at the top of his game.What interested me most about such a classic discovered nearly two decades later on my PT retrospective via DVD is the strange and unpredictable nature of the movie. Shot in 35mm it looks great but is not flashy or amounting to any big deal  checking it out at a middle reel you wouldn't be able to tell any immediate difference from a hundred other Thomas productions. But everything seems to work the hallmark of mature artistry in cinema and rarely encountered anymore.With a new cast a sequel was made by the creative team a few years after but it is way too obvious and didactic in its messaging. Randy Spears in ultrasmug mode takes over Steven's role and is explicitly the Devil wearing a Zoot Suit no less! In the female roles are Raylene and April whose sex scenes make that movie but overall it comes off as silly compared to the original. Hopefully a new generation of porn will discover PT's magnum opus.".

Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her overthetop performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. There are some setbacks to Bad Teacher which stop it from being a great comedy. The plot devices used to move the story along are unconvincing and overplayed. Character transformations are equally unconvincing uninspired and rushed. Some scenes feel forced for the sake of cheap laughs or shock value. None of it though is shocking enough for this to be an effective method of comedy. Sometimes the characters feel a bit too weird even for the universe of strange the movie sets early on. Jason Segel's Russell is the most interesting character in the movie and yet for some reason is greatly underused. He pops up in pointless scenes simply to interject a laugh and then disappears for long stretches of time. Bad Teacher is a funny movie. The critics have not been so generous with their reviews but who listens to them anymore anyways? If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor you will find yourself laughing with this one. While the plot devices are forced and some of the humor could have been better with a more subtle approach overall this is a decent flick to chill out on the couch and laugh with. 710".

But this movie is not supposed to teach anyone life lessons it's not supposed to have some big moral message about how to live your life in a good way. This is a film for adults. And films for adults do not have to follow certain morals because an adult is expected to judge morals on their own without needing guidelines. An adult can enjoy movies with main characters doing things they would never find acceptable because it's not about agreeing with the character's actions.Normally I would rate this film 6 stars but I rated it 8 to keep some of the irrational reviews on here from bringing the score down too far. It has solid jokes a mostly good cast OK direction but also some really bad moments and the main character goes completely out of character towards the end to achieve the usual Hollywood we need a kiss! FAST!!! Happy Ending but overall a good comedy I would watch again with a great performance from Cameron Diaz.".

And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah Diaz is still a hot body and all but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb.

The storyline was boring and the jokes either overthetop or worst not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah Diaz is still a hot body and all but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could.";

Perhaps she liked the idea of showing off her body for an hour and a half. Because she is exceptionally hammy here in that respect. Every single character in this movie is unlikeable with perhaps the exception of the school superintendent who occupies about three minutes of screen time. Diaz plays an obnoxious character who uses and abuses others children foremost among them. Jason Timberlake starts out being a refreshing contrast to Diaz but after awhile he's as unpleasant as all the rest.The plot is exceptionally poorly constructed. We're supposed to care about how a psychopath drums up the 9000 necessary for breast implants? Admittedly I'm older than the target audience of this film. I admit I felt a bit of justice when the acnefaced teacher unfunnily named Squirrel caught Diaz at her game. But the plot disappoints again when Diaz outcons everyone anew. The unlikely ending seems as if it were slapped on because the writer couldn't think of any other way to release the audience from its misery. This movie is pure detritus and I'm really sorry my family wasted 38.50 including food to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today When the jokes hit they hit well but when they miss they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops their charm and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.Elizabeth Hasley Cameron Diaz is a foulmouthed bitter and quite nasty teacher that is keeping the job only to pay the bills after her rich fiance dumps her. Facing debt aging and loneliness Elizabeth starts setting her sights on a boob job and on a new rich teacher Justin Timberlake whom has also captured the attention of a manipulative rival Lucy Punch. The script was helmed by two veteran writers of The Office Gene Stupnitsky Lee Eisenberg as they use their nontelevision ratings boundaries to mix plenty of vulgar and raunchy humor with even some tidbits of cruel humor. Unfortunately their lack of boundaries led to a mediocre script.This film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved the script was convoluted and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs with one notable exception involving one of the odder sex scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script most notably the students the gym teacher Jason Segal and the main character's roommate Erik Stonestreet.Despite the writing being a fickle mess the cast was superb from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura this energy that can save the worst of films See What Happens in Vegas and it is no different here. Despite her smokingdrinkingvulgarmanipulativecynicalcruelsuperficial ways we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.Lucy Punch despite having a bit of questionable material delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often as he delivered the laughs every time he was onscreen with his wit sarcasm and Idon'tcare attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the fartoofew moments they were onscreen. The movie does indeed have its laughs but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume but he does have the comedic chops and timing and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.Bottom Line Bad Teacher was a great idea poorly executed but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later but by then its too late the potential was wasted. Either way you will certainly laugh you will remain entertained but will also be bothered by what it could have been.".

I didn't know what to expect I wasn't a Cameron Diaz or Justin Timberlake fan. Actually I only really was excited to see Phyllis from The Office.This movie was hilarious! Oh my gosh how could I ever dislike Cameron Diaz? My view completely changed about her! She doesn't hold back she delivers and has perfect comedic timing and brings insane positive energy to the movie. If it wasn't for Cameron this movie may have been soso. I say this because her character is very unlikable and shallow and rude on paper. Cameron brings charm to this character and doesn't necessarily make her likable but just makes her hilarious! So funny!The other actors are great as well especially the woman who plays Mrs. Squirrel! Go see it! Ignore the bad reviews! Decide for yourself!".

Several obvious sequels spring to mind here Bad Student Bad Principal Bad Janitor Bad Cafeteria Lady etc. The possibilities are endless. The American idiocracy apparently have an unlimited appetite for these mindless immature comedies that could all have been written by 12 year old boys. I guess these writers never run out of ways to portray farting male asses and men getting hurt usually by getting hit in the crotch. Thank goodness their talent was recognized and is being put to such good use.Everyone who had anything to do with this monstrously bad movie should be ashamed of themselves. The messages it sends are horrendous. If bad teachers start popping up in real life they should never be held accountable for their actions no matter how despicable they are.

	schema:headline " One of the worst movies I've seen since long";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to watch this movie because I got the impression that it could be a new kind of High School Rock or something similar. Simply a bad teacher who discovers that she really wants to do something good for her students and actually helps them in getting good grades and selfesteem. But unfortunately there is NOTHING of that in that movie!I don't even know how to begin my review of how bad this movie is. The only good thing about it is the cast Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake Jason Segal Lucy Punch Phyllis Smith... This movie almost SCREAMS for wanting to be a big funny comedy! The cast including Diaz is doing an amazing job fitting their roles. Especially Timberlake who is showing a rather odd kind of roll as the hot hipster new age idiot. But nonetheless all their effort doesn't save this movie from falling on its knees. Because this movie gets nothing right. The jokes are harsh nasty dirty and political incorrect. Some may find them interesting and funny because of that fact. I just find them typically MTVgeneration bad. The story and the pace in which the film develops are horrible too! It starts out by introducing how bad of a teacher Diaz is. She clearly shows that she has no interest in her students and their future lets them watch only movies each day and forces them to do national tests without them having learned anything. And when the students fail of course she yells and threatens them to do a better job. And what's more because threats don't work either she lets them stand in line at the gymnasium and throws basketballs at each kids face if the kid doesn't answer correctly to one of her questions. Seriously?? What is this movie telling us? That the education system in the US is messed up or that you can teach students better with corporal punishment? All that attitude is so unrealistic you wonder how she got her teachers' license in the first place.But sadly Diaz is never getting away from her attitude. She is never really growing or changing in that movie. She sleeps drinks smokes steals takes drugs is violent cynical lies and betrays all people around her. And gets always away with it. Right from the beginning of the movie until the end. What's worse she even gets a colleague of hers to be forced to move to another school AND gets the guy in the end who was chasing her through the movie the entire time. Wonder what he sees in her?There are only two scenes in the movie where you think that Diaz finally will change or at least show her real nice self. The first one is when she is smoking pod in her car and one of her students is giving her home baked cookies. For the brink of a second Diaz is softening up and gives her student the advice to loosen up a little stop acting like you're racing for congress. But she immediately finishes with You're hopeless kid. The other scene is after one of the boys in her class openly confesses his love to his crush gets rejected and runs away in his misery. Diaz chases him and when they finally sit down to talk about what happened she repeats herself I told you so many times a guy like you will NEVER get a girl like her. Take that ugly hat off your face!I became so frustrated by those small moments when it seems like Diaz finally will show us her nice self only to prove once more what kind of a sad and mean psycho she really is. This movie gives you nothing and is not rewarding to watch in any way. You will get no interesting story no plot twists no philosophical depth no moral message no happy ending. It's really one of these movies where you have to ask yourself how the script got past the producing rights in the first place. I can simply not recommend this movie to anyone.".

The cast including Diaz is doing an amazing job fitting their roles. Especially Timberlake who is showing a rather odd kind of roll as the hot hipster new age idiot. But nonetheless all their effort doesn't save this movie from falling on its knees. Because this movie gets nothing right. The jokes are harsh nasty dirty and political incorrect. Some may find them interesting and funny because of that fact. I just find them typically MTVgeneration bad. The story and the pace in which the film develops are horrible too! It starts out by introducing how bad of a teacher Diaz is. She clearly shows that she has no interest in her students and their future lets them watch only movies each day and forces them to do national tests without them having learned anything. And when the students fail of course she yells and threatens them to do a better job. And what's more because threats don't work either she lets them stand in line at the gymnasium and throws basketballs at each kids face if the kid doesn't answer correctly to one of her questions. Seriously?? What is this movie telling us? That the education system in the US is messed up or that you can teach students better with corporal punishment? All that attitude is so unrealistic you wonder how she got her teachers' license in the first place.But sadly Diaz is never getting away from her attitude. She is never really growing or changing in that movie. She sleeps drinks smokes steals takes drugs is violent cynical lies and betrays all people around her. And gets always away with it. Right from the beginning of the movie until the end. What's worse she even gets a colleague of hers to be forced to move to another school AND gets the guy in the end who was chasing her through the movie the entire time. Wonder what he sees in her?There are only two scenes in the movie where you think that Diaz finally will change or at least show her real nice self. The first one is when she is smoking pod in her car and one of her students is giving her home baked cookies. For the brink of a second Diaz is softening up and gives her student the advice to loosen up a little stop acting like you're racing for congress. But she immediately finishes with You're hopeless kid. The other scene is after one of the boys in her class openly confesses his love to his crush gets rejected and runs away in his misery. Diaz chases him and when they finally sit down to talk about what happened she repeats herself I told you so many times a guy like you will NEVER get a girl like her. Take that ugly hat off your face!I became so frustrated by those small moments when it seems like Diaz finally will show us her nice self only to prove once more what kind of a sad and mean psycho she really is. This movie gives you nothing and is not rewarding to watch in any way. You will get no interesting story no plot twists no philosophical depth no moral message no happy ending. It's really one of these movies where you have to ask yourself how the script got past the producing rights in the first place. I can simply not recommend this movie to anyone.";

Bad toll booth operators bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan WALK HARD and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies there have been some real good ones BRIDESMAIDS but most of them have been pretty forgettable PAUL. This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey a golddigging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fianc to tend to her every need but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell Jason Segel and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher Scott Justin Timberlake. Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little selfimprovement. Not becoming a decent person or anything just a breast enhancement. From then on she lies cheats and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery and the only one who suffers is the good teacher Lucy Punch who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE young Alex Malcolm McDowell robs rapes and commits horrible acts of violence but maintains a charismatic personality that allows the audience to root for him. Elizabeth Halsey in BAD TEACHER does not. The protagonist in this movie also happens to be the least likable person in the film. As a result the movie comes off as a little backwards. The character we're supposed to support Elizabeth is just a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities presented until the final act of the film. And I mean none. She was a golddigging fianc she's perpetually drunkhigh on the job and she coldly dismisses gym teacher Russell's advances without a glance in favor of stalking the new substitute with the massive bank account. It would almost make more sense if the film focused on Ms. Squirrel Lucy Punch living out her dream teaching career when troublemaking Elizabeth comes along and steals her thunder in underhanded ways. Punch should be the protagonist and Elizabeth the antagonist. But it's not instead we watch as the film's good guy punishes the bad guy for nothing other than doing her job and doing it well. Oh well whateverit's just a comedy after all. Antiheroes can be fun and it works as long as the film is funny which it mostly is. The movie is good for some laughs though it's tough to be anything but distant as you watch everything going down without ever really being drawn into the story.Cameron Diaz really is the best person for this role. Not because she's horribly unlikeable I assume she's not but because she's got a decent comedic background in her films and she's still capable of pulling off dropdead beauty. In BAD TEACHER she's the teacher we all wished we'd had in middle school. She really drives the point home when she volunteers to work the school's charity car wash so she can pilfer funds. The supporting cast in this movie is what really makes it enjoyable. Jason Segel is always great as a lovable schlub which pretty much sums up his gym teacher character and Lucy Punch is hilariously eccentric as Ms. Squirrel. I've also got to give credit to Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's friend Lynn. She's probably the funniest part of the movie as the softspoken conservative friend who wants so badly to be as cool as Elizabeth but can't bring herself to commit to the debauchery. Honestly the main character may be crap but the movie does have some real funny moments. I just don't know if there's enough to save it from fading out shortly after watching it. If it helps I find the movie is funnier the less sober you are when watching it.".

Absolute crap is being generous as a rating. The Razzies wouldn't lower themselves to nominating this piece of garbage. Run away from this dog it will be the biggest waste of time you will ever experience.";

There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.Justin Timberlake is good in playing kind of against character and does not care about what people may think. Jason Segel is almost underused in this one and even Cameron Diaz did not really have that many great moments overall. And for a movie that tries to stay raunchy it does even fail at combining that with the funny elements. While deliciously evil at times and good it also misses the point half of the time. Not really bad but not that good either I only watched the cinema release and not the extended cut".

	schema:headline " The voids of laugher speaks volumes";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Teacher had a strong premise for a comedy a teacher is really bad and hates her job. It was marketed a raunchy hardR comedy sadly it was a film that was lacking despite the best efforts of the actors.Elizabeth Halsey Cameron Diaz is the bad teacher in question who leaves the profession and forced to return when her fianc dumps her for her gold digging ways. She returns to John Adams Middle High JAMS and sets out to win over Scott Delacorte Justin Timberlake a geeky substitute teacher who is the heir to a watch empire. He particularly likes women with big breasts and Elizabeth plans to get a boob job but needs the money. But Scott himself is attached to Amy Squirrel Lucy Punch a quirky caring teacher who gets the best results in school. At the same time Elizabeth has a suitor in the form a GymP.E. teacher Jason Seagel. When Elizabeth finds out the prize for the best school results in the Illinois State Test is a big cheque she sets about to ensure her class is the best.The jokes were just lacking through the film. I was in a cinema that was 75 full and there were a lot of teachers in it and I can say with honesty that there was very little laugher a few chuckles and no belly laughs. That says a lot about a comedy because the point is to make us laugh. I believe one of two things happened either that the film was originally going to be a PG13 film and the producers thought that the film was more marketable as a Rrated comedy or the more likely that it was cut much of the swearing out to get a PG13 rating and failed. Most of the use of the F word in the red band trailer was cut out from the actual film. They were also plot points like when Elizabeth offered to tutor her students goes nowhere. The pace throughout was just very slow and Bad Teacher needed more snap.Acting wise the best performance was Seagel best person the film having the best lines with his role and the most grounded character in the film. He was simply natural as a gym teacher who just wants to have fun though he has a dodgy line which makes him sound like a potential rapist. Punch is solid and she is deliberately over the top as a quirky teacher but she does not have many good lines and Punch has to make the performance as physical as possible. She also gets very screwed over in the film. Diaz does her best but the character is not very well developed and her traits flipped like a switch. Most of the time she is shown as an uncaring person only interested in herself and only got into teaching for the hours but at the same time she does help some students and surely she should have cared as some point about teaching. She is also too ruthless she needed to be a deeper character.I also have to comment about the actual school On Wikipedia it describes JAMS as a school in a poor area it was certainly not it was in a very middle class area. I liked how the kids in the school actually looked normal and not in cliques like the jocks the nerds the pretty girls cheerleaders etc They were mixed. But at the same time it seems like that the teachers only have one class when I was in school the teachers had to teach classes over many years if they only taught one class then they would have a very short working week.Overall a big disappointment.".

The red haired girl Amy I think was trying her hardest to be the quirky antagonist but she just had no comic grace. Neither did Cameron Diaz either. The scriptwriters somehow thought lots of swearing and shouting were a good idea but alas they were wrong.The real problem here was that the concept of the bad teacher just really doesn't cut it in a high school setting. It wasn't funny. I assume that the writers were aiming for a sort of cross between shock swearing and possibly black humour? I really can't define it other than to say it was pissweak. Weird lines no comic timing a halfassed romance. It all adds up to not much and a waste of money.To be fair there were a few funny points but it was just so poorly directed.

	schema:headline " Winning hatred over through sympathy and love";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Raj Kanwar has directed many hit movies during the past two decades but Baadal 2000 is an underrated movie of him which was not successful commercially and not much talked about as well. I had seen this movie when it was released and found it much better than the hits given by Raj Kanwar Deewaana Laadla Judaai etc..Baadal cloud tells the story of an innocent child  Baadal Bobby Deol whose family members alongwith many other innocents were killed by a corrupt and cruel cop Ashutosh Rana under the pretext of eliminating the terrorists in the relevant campaigns going on in Punjab in 1984 . The terrorist Ashish Vidyarthi who was given shelter by Baadal's father Alok Nath saves him and fosters him. In his bid to seek his revenge from that cop Baadal also gets involved in terrorist activities. Fate drags him to the house of a kindhearted and rightthinking cop Amrish Puri whose wife Neena Kulkarni and daughters Mayuri Kango and Sana Saeed are also like him only but apprehensive of the looks of the stranger entering their house. Baadal whose heart is filled with anguish and hatred only gets melted by the unexpected love of this kind family and the sympathetic and considerate attitude of the police officer giving refuge to him gradually purifies heart. Besides he gets the romantic love of a jovial girl Rani Mukherjee too. However there is only one person in the world whom he cannot forgive and cannot cease to hate  the corrupt and cruel cop who had ruined his life. He has entered the top brass of the police system now courtesy the flawed promotionsystem in the Indian establishments taking the nondeserving ones to the top. Finally Baadal seeks his revenge from him and the fire of hatred in his heart gets splashes of water.Though Baadal has been made as a commercial movie filled with action thrill romance and the regular Bollywood formulae by default perhaps the screenplay is successful in rendering a strong message that all the terrorists are not bad by heart. Several of them are so because of the police atrocities leading to ruin of their lives.

Both the action director and the choreographer alongwith the art director as well have done their jobs pretty well. The action and dance sequences are quite impressive. The sketting contest in college of Rani and Mayuri is also amusing. Production value is high.Anu Malik's music is good.

Laal Garaara Jugni Jugni Tujhe Dekh Ke Dil Mera Dole and Yaara Yaara Mere Yaara Mere Yaaram are also good to listen and to watch as well.Baadal is not only an underrated movie of Raj Kanwar but also of Bobby Deol. He has given an admirable performance in the title role. He has displayed the stuffiness anguish and hatred embedded in the character through remarkable underplay. Rani Mukherjee has given such a performance in the role of a romantic and jovial girl that brings smile to the lips of the viewer. Late Amrish Puri has delivered a towering performance in the positive role and proved again that he was a class actor indeed. Ashutosh Rana as the villain is perfect. Neena Kulkarni Mayuri Kango Sana Saeed Ashish Vidyarthi Harish Patel Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Rani's father Akash Khurana as the rightthinking politician etc. have done complete justice to their assigned roles. Only Johnny Lever irritates.The hidden message of this apparently masala movie is that several not all terrorists of tender age at least can be brought back to the right path through understanding sympathy and love. They may also be grieffilled in their hearts with nobody sharing their pain and tears. Terrorism cannot be eliminated merely by eliminating the terrorists without differentiating between the hardcore criminals and the aggrieved innocents joining the terrorist groups. And a strict vigil is required on the activities of the perverted cops too who vent out their personal frustration through cruelty on innocents in their socalled antiterrorist compaigns and turn many innocents into new terrorists. I recommend this underrated movie to all the rightthinking Indians.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Raj Kanwar has directed many hit movies during the past two decades but Baadal 2000 is an underrated movie of him which was not successful commercially and not much talked about as well. I had seen this movie when it was released and found it much better than the hits given by Raj Kanwar Deewaana Laadla Judaai etc..Baadal cloud tells the story of an innocent child  Baadal Bobby Deol whose family members alongwith many other innocents were killed by a corrupt and cruel cop Ashutosh Rana under the pretext of eliminating the terrorists in the relevant campaigns going on in Punjab in 1984 . The terrorist Ashish Vidyarthi who was given shelter by Baadal's father Alok Nath saves him and fosters him. In his bid to seek his revenge from that cop Baadal also gets involved in terrorist activities. Fate drags him to the house of a kindhearted and rightthinking cop Amrish Puri whose wife Neena Kulkarni and daughters Mayuri Kango and Sana Saeed are also like him only but apprehensive of the looks of the stranger entering their house. Baadal whose heart is filled with anguish and hatred only gets melted by the unexpected love of this kind family and the sympathetic and considerate attitude of the police officer giving refuge to him gradually purifies heart. Besides he gets the romantic love of a jovial girl Rani Mukherjee too. However there is only one person in the world whom he cannot forgive and cannot cease to hate  the corrupt and cruel cop who had ruined his life. He has entered the top brass of the police system now courtesy the flawed promotionsystem in the Indian establishments taking the nondeserving ones to the top. Finally Baadal seeks his revenge from him and the fire of hatred in his heart gets splashes of water.Though Baadal has been made as a commercial movie filled with action thrill romance and the regular Bollywood formulae by default perhaps the screenplay is successful in rendering a strong message that all the terrorists are not bad by heart. Several of them are so because of the police atrocities leading to ruin of their lives. When the small kids are turned into orphans by the highhanded and heartless police of India isn't it natural that they take the wrong path alongside growingup ? Love begets love and hatred begets hatred. The way the sheltergiving family of Amrish Puri wins Baadal's hatredfilled heart with their love kindness and sympathy wins the heart of the audience too.

The film is probably best known for being cowritten by Clive Barker Pavlou would adapt Barker's RAWHEAD REX after this. I know Barker dismisses it now but it still has some interesting ideas and you can even see a bit of the genesis for his CABALNIGHTBREED in it. This is the kind of film studios should be picking up and remaking as it had a germ of a good plot but not the budget to carry it out. You can definitely tell that Clive had a fondness for BLADE RUNNER when he wrote this though. But unlike that film this can't escape its 80sness with lots of shoulder pads trench coats and neon on display. The cast is good although Lamb is an odd choice for a romanticheroic lead as he looks like a cross between Steve Coogan and Bill Maher. The mutant makeup leaves something to be desired though as their leader looks like a bulbous Andy Dick. Supporting players include Miranda Richardson as a mutant and Ingrid Pitt as a madame. There is also a moody synth score by 80s band Freur.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently bought George Pavlou's Underworld aka. Transmutations of 1985 which was sold as Clive Barker's Underworld for 4 Euros and I my expectations were not very high. It is hard to believe that the man who created such an essential and influential cult Horror flick as Hellraiser is obviously also partly responsible for such a piece of crap. I bet Barker's story must have differed a lot from the endproduct of this lousy flick. I'm personally a big fan of BMovies especially Horror BMovies and I would never condemn a movie for just being cheaply made or for poor scenery. Underworld however just fails in every aspect and is easily the worst 80s SciFiHorror movie if one can even call it a Horror movie I have seen  And I have seen a lot.After his former girlfriend highclass prostitute Nicole Nicola Cowper is kidnapped by 'eerie' mutants well that's what they're supposed to be private detective Roy Bain Larry Lamb starts to investigate and stumbles across a new extremely effective drug with atrocious sideeffects.Most of the acting is absolutely terrible the only two good actors in this piece of crap are Steven Berkoff and Denholm Elliott and due to a terrible script their appearance can't save this pointless movie either. The sceneries are terrible the costumes are just ridiculous.

	onyx:emotionText "I recently bought George Pavlou's Underworld aka. Transmutations of 1985 which was sold as Clive Barker's Underworld for 4 Euros and I my expectations were not very high. It is hard to believe that the man who created such an essential and influential cult Horror flick as Hellraiser is obviously also partly responsible for such a piece of crap. I bet Barker's story must have differed a lot from the endproduct of this lousy flick. I'm personally a big fan of BMovies especially Horror BMovies and I would never condemn a movie for just being cheaply made or for poor scenery. Underworld however just fails in every aspect and is easily the worst 80s SciFiHorror movie if one can even call it a Horror movie I have seen  And I have seen a lot.After his former girlfriend highclass prostitute Nicole Nicola Cowper is kidnapped by 'eerie' mutants well that's what they're supposed to be private detective Roy Bain Larry Lamb starts to investigate and stumbles across a new extremely effective drug with atrocious sideeffects.Most of the acting is absolutely terrible the only two good actors in this piece of crap are Steven Berkoff and Denholm Elliott and due to a terrible script their appearance can't save this pointless movie either. The sceneries are terrible the costumes are just ridiculous. Some of the mutant's makeup is OK but it's not good either the plot is just plain awful and nothing in this movie makes the slightest sense.

	schema:reviewBody "A prostitute called Nicole is abducted from a high class brothel and businessman Hugo Motherskille hires private detective Roy Bain to find Nicole I spent years looking for this movie after seeing a making of feature on FILM 85 . It struck me as a scifi horror film  a kind of QUATERMASS meets the body horror of David Cronenberg but for some strange reason it never appeared in any media reviews and this was a time when horror movies were rather fashionable  even an enjoyable mess of a movie like LIFEFORCE would be hyped by studios . UNDERWORLD didn't as far as know even receive a video release and the only time it seemed referred to was in Barker interviews when he stated he was so upset by the way George Pavlou ruined his work in this movie and RAWHEAD REX that the only way he wanted to make HELLRAISER was to direct it himself . Surely UNDERWORLD couldn't be that bad ?After seeing UNDERWORLD after a 25 year wait I have to confess it is indeed that bad . In fact the only recommendation I can give the movie is that everyone should watch it to see just how bad a film can be . The reviewers aren't kidding when they claim this one terrible movie . If a the screenwriter himself is so angry about the final product then that says everything you need to know as to a film's merits Much of the problem lies in the entire look of the movie for which director Pavlou must take full blame . It's like a very cheap and cheerless pop video and much of the acting is absolutely painful to watch . It's the worst type of bad acting  wooden acting which gives the impression the entire cast have been mainlining Valium . It says something when you're expecting Steven Berkoff to do his usual camp . OTT luvvie spiel but he's as wooden as everyone else Barker himself isn't entirely blameless for this fiasco because there's a problem with the storytelling . Effectively UNDERWORLD is a cross genre movie where film noir meets horror but the hand is played in the opening sequence where it's obvious that the kidnappers who abducted Nicole are not human . Perhaps the film would have worked better if the entire story had taken place through the eyes of Bain similar to Mickey Rourke's character in ANGEL HEART . As it stand the narrative is very very dull with the audience being one step ahead of the characters This is a bitterly disappointing horror film which is very dated in look and feel and it says something when Clive Barker himself hated it . The only good point is that it's so bad that it motivated Barker to take on the helm of HELLRAISER which in my opinion is the best horror movie of the 1980s".

This sure isn't Clive Barker like we know him from Hellraiser and even Rawhead Rex the other lousy collaboration between Barker and director Pavlou was ten times better than this. The story isn't very original and  more importantly  it never seems to properly take off. Pivot element seems to be a very addictive new drug developed by Dr. Savary but the side effects cause people to mutate so that they're forced to live in a secret underground community. The mutants kidnap the fancy prostitute Nicole because she appears to be immune for the horrible side effects. Amateur hero Roy Bain attempts to rescue heryawn! The acting of the entire is truly miserable and the Pavlou's directing is really really weak. Luckily his repertoire only exists out of two films! There's no tension at all and the few action sequences are tame and unexciting. You wouldn't know if it was a Clive Barker script if it wasn't for the use of kinky outfits and bizarre sexual undertones. Really what is the deal with Barker and his obsession for black leather? The overuse of bad music is really annoying and don't set your hopes on seeing grossout gore neither. The only slightly imaginative aspect is the makeup on some of the mutants and even then you get the feeling that they easily could have done more with it. I surely expected a lot more from this film especially considering the fact it was so hard to track down but I hope to convince people not to watch it! Transmutations a.k.a Underworld definitely is one of the worst 80's horror moviesand that says a lot!".

However Nicole seems immune to the drugs side effects  a group of deformed users want to know why it's up to Roy to sort this mess out  rescue Nicole...Known as Transmutations in the US this English production was directed by George Pavlou  quite frankly is crap. The script by James Caplin  Clive Barker based on one of his stories never really gets going it never involves you you never care about anything it's slow it's dull it's utterly predictable with a pointless twist you can see coming a mile off  it's just not much fun to watch either. Being based on a story by Barker you would expect plenty of monsters  gore but Underworld features a few tardily made up creatures who get about 10 minutes worth of screen time  absolutely no gore whatsoever. I'm sure the artwork on any DVDvideo release plays up the mutants involvement in the film but seriously they don't feature properly until past the hour mark  even then their presence is underwhelming. Most of Barker's work deals with religion  mystical reasoning behind his monstrous creations but here it all revolves around a drug yawn. Then there's the fact that London seems deserted the character's  dialogue are poor  for some reason everyone has bizarre names like Pepperdine Motherskille Fluke  Nygaard. We never learn why Nicole is immune to the drugs side effects either even though it's an important plot point it's a film where you just don't care about anything that's happening on screen.Director Pavlou also directed the Barker penned adaptation of Rawhead Rex 1986 a year later why did Barker choose him again? Underworld is a totally flat dull  lifeless 100 odd minutes. He seems to think as long as he bathes every shot in pink purple orange  blue neon that's enough to turn in a stylish flick well he's wrong as it gets very samey very quickly  since the on screen action is so dull the awkward lighting stands out like a sore thumb. Disappointingly the film lacks imagination as well the underworld mutants are just actors with lumps on their faces  apart from one brief scene at the end when someone pulls some skin of their cheek there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing. It's definitely not scary it's certainly has no tension  has precisely zero atmosphere.Technically the film is pretty good actually it's well made I suppose  looks very professional. How on Earth did they get such a good cast to agree to appear in this? Denholm Elliott Steven Berkoff Art Malik Ingrid Pitt  Miranda Richardson all deserve better than this.Underworld is a poor Clive Barker penned film I'd imagine most of the blame has to go to first time director Pavlou who probably ruined Barker's scripts Barker himself admitted he directed Hellraiser 1987 himself because of his dissatisfaction with the results of both Underworld  Rawhead Rex. A disappointing waste of time steer clear which won't be a problem as it's pretty obscure  hopefully it'll stay that way. Not to be confused with the Kate Beckinsale big budget horror action flicks Underworld 2003  it's sequel Underworld Evolution 2006.".

The abduction forces Roy Bain Larry Lamb a former associate of the group into action which he finds is not his doing and wants her back as much as he does. Investigating the disappearance he eventually finds traces that lead to Dr. Savary Denholm Elliott who has produced a strange white powder that's coveted by a race of deformed human beings who live in the underworld in the sewers below the city. Finding they are engaged in a war with him over the control of use of the powder in experiments he conducted years ago that turned them into their deformed state he agrees to help them in their battle against their demented enemies.The Good News There's only a few minor points in here that make this worthwhile. The main thing with this one is that the final confrontation is actually really good. The shootout between the two sides is really nice taking out some members from each side in acceptable gunfights while also utilizing some grenades as well. Mixed with the final confrontations in the underground lairs including the brutal gassing sequence and the single worthwhile kill in the film where one's head is set on fire and melts away all make these scenes the best part of the film. It's twenty minutes of pure excitement and interest mainly since it's the only part of the film that has any. The only other point of interest is the storyline which isn't that bad and doesn't really feel all that complicated or hard to figure out it just takes a while to get out. These here are all the film has going for it.The Bad News This was a woefully underwhelming effort for several reasons. The biggest one and the most interconnecting one is the absolute and utter dullness. Pretty much everything in here is either way to long to get to the point or just nothing happens. The mystery angle would've been nice had it lead to anything but here it just leads to tediously long stretches where he spends the time talking to everyone around which is just plain dull and when it just seems to go on and on such as the sequence in the club with the dancers or searching the lab for ideas about what's going on all of which are just plain boring and overlong and make the film just plain tough to get through. Since the only action scene is the final twenty minutes everything else until that time manages to feel very plain hard to get through. That's the biggest flaw with the film that nothing happens in here. The other flaw in here is the fact that the cheese level isn't good at all. The creatures look lame the disco soundtrack isn't any good and it's hard to determine what other elements are here are caused to help the film. It's still not as damaging as the other flaw but these here are the film's biggest problems.The Final Verdict Hardly anything worthwhile in here manages to be the main spoiler to a terribly underwhelming effort. Really only give this one a shot if these kinds of cheesy creature features are interesting for you otherwise then just ignore this one and seek out more worthwhile entries.Rated R Graphic Language and Violence".

	schema:headline " Changing relations";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a great regard for the Bollywood film director of the sixties seventies and early eighties  Raghunath Jhaalani. He has not been a high profile or very famous film director. But this underrated film director has directed very impressive and entertaining movies viz. Aaya Saawan Jhoom Ke 1969 Anamika 1973 Uljhan 1975 Bereham 1980 etc. Today I am reviewing a romantic social drama directed by him on a novel theme considering the trend going on in Bollywood those days. It's Badaltay Rishtay 1978 starring Jeetendra Rishi Kapoor and Reena Roy.Badaltay Rishtay changing relations has taken up two very important issues from the viewpoint of Indian society. Both have been relevant since ages were relevant at the time of the release of this movie more than three decades back and they are relevant even today.The first one is a girl's devotion after she is married to someone other than the person she has been in love with. Right from the movies of the black and white era to Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in 1999 the thing underscored is once the girl is married she had better respect the wedlock and the sanctity of the husbandwife relationship unless of course her husband is a bad person. Continuing to love her exbeau and longing to live with him even after getting married to someone is not desirable for the Indian girls. I appreciate this view with the addition that it is equally applicable to the boys too. Nothing is permanent in this world then why should we expect the relations to be the same throughout the life when enough water might have flown in the river ? The second one is the superstitions prevalent in the Indian society especially among the Indian women. There is little doubt that even the highly educated Indians have been utterly superstitious believing in illogical things and believing in what the astrologers foretell about them. The situation is not very bright in this regard even today. Especially the Indian females have been vulnerable to the talks of the astrologers making them apprehensive of their future or the future of their beloveds.The story of Badaltay Rishtay covers both the abovesaid issues. It's a story based on triangular relationship and set in Simla. Savitri Reena Roy loves Manohar Rishi Kapoor but a professor of astrology A.K. Hangal tells her that once she gets married her husband will die within 40 days of her marriage. The additional thing told to her is that if she marries again her second marriage will be a longlasting and joyful one. Believing it she marries Saagar Jeetendra who proposes her. Now Savitri starts counting the 40 days period after which she is supposed to become a widow and free to marry Manohar her first love. Here comes the twist in the tale.Manohar approaches the postmarriage home of Savitri and not only befriends her husband  Saagar but also wins the confidence of her inlaws. However Savitri is shocked like anything when he reveals his hitherto covered face which is of a greedy blackmailer who does not want her love but the money of her rich husband. He not only attempts on Saagar's life but also threatens Savitri to trap her unmarried sisterinlaw in his fake love if she refuses to obey him. These developments set up a very interesting climax in which Saagar comes to know of the facts on the 40th day of their marriage which according to the astrologer's forecast is going to be the last day of his life. The ending scene of the movie is again twisty and leaves a longlasting impact on the viewers.Both the messages of the movie  start life afresh with the wedding moment leaving your past behind as well as not to rely the forecasts blindly  are laudable and impressively conveyed. The screenplay has been skillfully written and aptly directed.Among the three main protagonists Rishi Kapoor takes the cake both in looks as well as acting performance. This was the first role of his career containing grey shades and he has delivered a stunning performance. He looks quite charming in the initial reels and equally hateable in the later reels. Jeetendra and Reena Roy are just okay. The supporting cast has done well.Heartwinning music composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal is the icing on the cake with the beautiful lyrics coming from the pen of Anjaan. Three songs are especially mentionable  Meri Saanson Ko Jo Mehka Rahi Hai Ye Pehle Pyar Ki Khushboo Woh Woh Na Rahe Jinke Liye Hum The Beqaraar and the title track  Na Jaane Kaise Pal Mein Badal Jaate Hain Ye Duniya Ke Badalte Rishte. Singers like Rafi Kishore Mahendra Kapoor Lata and Suman Kalyanpur have given their voices for the various songs.Technically the movie is up to the mark. The cinematographer has captured the beauty of Simla quite proficiently. The movie is not unduly long also. In fact romance comedy music emotions suspense all the ingredients of an entertaining movie have been intermixed in such a way that the length is not at all felt by the watcher.I wholeheartedly recommend this forgotten social drama of the seventies to all the movie buffs. Just start watching this movie and then the director won't allow you to leave the drama inbetween and keep you stick to your seat till the finish.My final words  it's said that change is the only permanent thing in the world. It's true to a great extent. Malefemale relations do change with the changes arriving in the lives of the people involved and if the change is desirable let it occur. After all human life is dynamic not static.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reena Roy gave an amazing performance in this movie. She looked absolutely beautiful and acted very well. In those days there was Reena Roy Hema Malini and Rekha. These were real beauties. Today there are half naked actresses and they are like this because they don't have beauty and substitute for beauty by exposing their skin. Rishi Kapoor the born actor as usual did a wonderful job. Jatinder's role was just normal. Nothing spectacular.The movie is about how after marriage wife should be totally committed to her husband and all previous alliances loves and relations should burn in the sacred fire at the time of marriage in case of Hindus.The music by Lakshmikant Pyarelal was absolutely melodious. Many movies have been made on this theme of three angle love till date but this was one of the original ones.".

These were real beauties. Today there are half naked actresses and they are like this because they don't have beauty and substitute for beauty by exposing their skin. Rishi Kapoor the born actor as usual did a wonderful job. Jatinder's role was just normal. Nothing spectacular.The movie is about how after marriage wife should be totally committed to her husband and all previous alliances loves and relations should burn in the sacred fire at the time of marriage in case of Hindus.The music by Lakshmikant Pyarelal was absolutely melodious. Many movies have been made on this theme of three angle love till date but this was one of the original ones.";

Jamie Draven gives an amazing performance as Jerry the vet who returns home to a world as alien as the one he was fighting in. His tormented soul struggles to fit back into society only to find that he is truly lost.Jerry can no longer relate to his wife and children and without giving anything away his anguish sets him on a path of self destruction. The only ray of sunshine on his tortured journey is that of his daughter Celina played with the maturity of a veteran actress by young Grace Fulton.The music is haunting in it's simplicity and underscores the torment of Jerry's character. The panoramic vistas seem to add a sense of normalcy and serenity to an otherwise harsh and brutal subject matter and they seem to enhance Jerry's yearning to find peace and redemption. But Jerry realizes that his dream to find peace and a new beginning only brings out more ghosts and memories of his past. He can't escape what he's done and he can't undo the terrible acts of violence he has committed. And when he meets Max also a war vet played by actor Joe Morton he is reminded with blinding clarity that the sins of the past really do follow you forcing you to face them with the force of a sledge hammer. Jerry is so out of touch with reality that he attempts to weave a new life for himself in the face of his brutally violent acts. He is so shattered that he believes he can simply step away from his past and step into a new life like changing a pair of pants. To his horror he discovers he cannot.The entire cast gave outstanding performances bringing the realities of war home and one can only wonder just how beaten and broken the vets who come home truly are. This powerful film gives us a glimpse into ravages of war and one cannot help but be affected by emotional whirlwind the characters go through as we follow them. Director Francesco Lucente has given us a movie without the tired clich flashbacks of war footage. We already know that war is physically devastating what Badland shows us is the devastation it has on the soul. It is truly a courageous film that will be the topic of discussion for years to come and a MUST see film.".

You cannot have sympathy for a character who does this. Cannot! Not to mention we're given nothing until the last say 12 hour of this unnecessarily long movie as to why this guy is suffering so much. No flashbacks no sudden reactions to noise or movement  stuff that real vets are suffering from. All we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't financially take care of her and his 3 kids. There really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current Iraq vets are going through.Additionally the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score. Its a catastrophe. It is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times Joe Morton. It foreshadows EVERYTHING you're supposed to feel and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely! Again this was a brutal thing this guy did and so seeing him get a new job meet a new blonde struggle behind the counter making toast is NOT appropriate! And really the ending? What a freakin cop out! How dare you.There are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers please don't bother with this one.".

You feel for Jerry the whole way through despite every decision he makes everything he does and doesn't do. It's a long film but the character is so strongly played you cannot stop watching and physically need to know how it turns out. Joe Morton and Grace Fulton also deserve accolades in their roles.The writing is great the story is consistently strong and this film deserves to be seen. In addition the scenery is beautiful.The speech Jerry bellows at Max under the tree is harsh but seems to be pretty close to the mark...what better excuse is there? It happens over and over. I imagine that this is part of the reason a lot of people seem to have missed out on this amazing film  do critics feel this is too honest for the mainstream? Sad if so because there's a lot of unworthy egorubbing films that are seen by millions. Will we ever learn?".

The scenario is well constructed acting is excellent as well as film direction. There are some glitches like a wound in the girl's hand that appears completely healed in a scene then is shown again with a bloody plaster on it in the next one but they are very minor.Overall it is an excellent film about the traumatic and dramatic results of war on the psyche and life of American soldiers when they come back to the States. Jamie Draven plays the role of Jerry an American soldier who has tremendous difficulties to adjust to normal life again. To make matters worse his wife thinks he is an ahole they live in a sordid home and environment with three children and a fourth one is in the womb. Jerry commits something tragic can't say what would be a spoiler and as a consequence engages in a dramaladen trip in his homeland with a constant refusal to accept full redemption leading to a tragic end for the only thing that could have saved him from himself can't say what again The penultimate flash scene could have been removed as it unrealistically questions the whole story's existence. Whereas the whole film could shock audiences that scene tries to come back on that jolt like they were not so sure about going the full length. Anyway fortunately it was a very short scene which you could choose to ignore".

I loved that I couldn't predict what he was going to do after he fled with his daughter. I was actually rooting for him. I wanted him to at least have one night of sensational love making with the angel that tried to save him. He deserved that and so much more after the life he had led.

The acting of the rest of the cast was superb. I sympathized with the sheriff one never appreciates life until your faced with death. I will highly recommend this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have the sequel of scifi western movie Oblivion.The first movie was a very great trashy scifi western comedy that does not take itself too seriousbut was too damn slow paced and boring at some points.Yeah the first movie has weird  cartoon like characters and cheesy dialogues lots of humorous oneliners and also bizarre special effects and costumes.But n actual plot and incoherent situations.It was fun too watch but the second movie is a bit better not a lot though just a bit we re talking about bad moviesdudes!.Actually the Oblivion was shot back to back with Backlash and so we are not talking about an actual sequel just the second part of a some kind of TV miniseries.I said that because the first 10 minutes are actually footage from the first movie  a summary for those who didn't watch the first oneJust skip this part.And the whole duration of the film is only 83 counting the 10 minutes of footage so i don t recommend this movie for those who didn't see the first part.Backlash is an incoherent and no actual plot movie like its predecessor.It begins from where the first movie left off.All the cast of the first movie reappears in this one except from those who die at the first part.But it focus more on LashMusetta Vanderthe female villain in the first movie.Vander is hilarious and too damn sexy in her role.Also we have new characters appeared the lethal bounty hunter and gentleman named Sweeney and the some sort identical brother of the main villain of the first movie Redeye called Jaggar.May Backlash be a little funnier than its predecessor with the same kind jokes but it is more fastpacedbecause of its duration not such a mesh and not so tiring.The acting is not good neither bad and the plot is not so cheesy like the first one but cheesy enough for a b movie fan and it also lacks of the action of the first because it centers on comedy and the clichs of the spaghetti westerns.The campiness of Backlash ensures that you and your friends may have a good fun drinking night on your couch if u have seen and liked the first.they just don't make low budget movies like Oblivion I  II anymore.The uniqueness of these two films a hybrid of scifi spaghetti westerns with elements of comedy horrorromanceand drama particular in the first Oblivion are the weird recipe for cult not classic movies that spoiled somewhere but who cares... i consider these films two of best from Full Moon. Yeeha!!!!!!!!!!! Also i forget to mention that the hilarious performance of George Takei as the alcoholic town doc is one of a kind and reprises his role in BacklashJim beam me up!".

	onyx:emotionText "Here we have the sequel of scifi western movie Oblivion.The first movie was a very great trashy scifi western comedy that does not take itself too seriousbut was too damn slow paced and boring at some points.Yeah the first movie has weird  cartoon like characters and cheesy dialogues lots of humorous oneliners and also bizarre special effects and costumes.But n actual plot and incoherent situations.It was fun too watch but the second movie is a bit better not a lot though just a bit we re talking about bad moviesdudes!.Actually the Oblivion was shot back to back with Backlash and so we are not talking about an actual sequel just the second part of a some kind of TV miniseries.I said that because the first 10 minutes are actually footage from the first movie  a summary for those who didn't watch the first oneJust skip this part.And the whole duration of the film is only 83 counting the 10 minutes of footage so i don t recommend this movie for those who didn't see the first part.Backlash is an incoherent and no actual plot movie like its predecessor.It begins from where the first movie left off.All the cast of the first movie reappears in this one except from those who die at the first part.But it focus more on LashMusetta Vanderthe female villain in the first movie.Vander is hilarious and too damn sexy in her role.Also we have new characters appeared the lethal bounty hunter and gentleman named Sweeney and the some sort identical brother of the main villain of the first movie Redeye called Jaggar.May Backlash be a little funnier than its predecessor with the same kind jokes but it is more fastpacedbecause of its duration not such a mesh and not so tiring.The acting is not good neither bad and the plot is not so cheesy like the first one but cheesy enough for a b movie fan and it also lacks of the action of the first because it centers on comedy and the clichs of the spaghetti westerns.The campiness of Backlash ensures that you and your friends may have a good fun drinking night on your couch if u have seen and liked the first.they just don't make low budget movies like Oblivion I  II anymore.The uniqueness of these two films a hybrid of scifi spaghetti westerns with elements of comedy horrorromanceand drama particular in the first Oblivion are the weird recipe for cult not classic movies that spoiled somewhere but who cares... i consider these films two of best from Full Moon. Yeeha!!!!!!!!!!! Also i forget to mention that the hilarious performance of George Takei as the alcoholic town doc is one of a kind and reprises his role in BacklashJim beam me up!";

What is totally special about 'Badlands' is the visual control that Terrence Malick applies to the story and his use of fabulous music to embed his amazing images in our mind. The 'Bonnie  Clyde'ish story could have been turgid but Malick turns it into a mythic journey.At the heart of Malick's method is the fabulous interior monologue by Holly explaining and ironically commenting on the story. Kit made me take my schoolbooks so I wouldn't fall behind with my studies.... This has been characteristic of each of Malick's films  Linda in 'Days of Heaven' and Witt in 'The Thin Red Line' have somewhat similar monologues  and 'New World' is monumentalised by the haunting monologuemontage with which it ends. Here it totally sucks the viewer into the story and makes the montages that it accompanies into just about the highpoint of seventies cinema. Alongside this Malick uses some of the most haunting music in existence. Whether it is Carl Orff or Nat King Cole Malick transports us with fabulous romantic imagery that perfectly balances it.I started on this comment determined not to use the word 'poetry' but I just can't avoid it. With nearly all filmmakers including very great ones the style that they present is very much prose  great prose perhaps but firmly rooted on the ground. With Malick we are taken emotionally to the stars by the lyric magnificence of the totality of his vision.It is said that Welles learned cinema by watching John Ford's 'Stagecoach' before embarking on 'Citizen Kane'. Every young filmmaker should watch this amazing masterpiece again and again and again and inform their work with Malick's matchless sense of true cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's really a shame that Terrence Malick didn't have the brilliant career he deserved at Hollywood. Shot with a nearly shoestring budget Badlands remains one of the most dazzling debut movies of all time. Malick's legend based on his long absence has helped it to become a cultmovie. Inspired by a tragic short news item which took place in 1959 a young couple who decides to commit a series of free murders to leave a mark in history the odds are that Malick's first featurelength movie inspired Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino for their dangerous and irresponsible Natural Born Killers 1994. Concerning Tarantino I read an interview about him in which he expressed his admiration of Malick's work. It shows that the author of Pulp Fiction 1994 has a great esteem for this talented and mysterious filmmaker. At the same time we can also note down that Malick's work inspired Bruce the Boss Springsteen two songs Badlands on his darkness on the edge of town album 1978 and nebraska on the eponymous LP1982.An American journalist had written that Badlands was the best mastered movie in the history of cinema since Citizen Kane 1941 by Orson Welles. One can judge this affirmation as exaggerated but it is nevertheless indisputable that Malick's opus strikes on numerous aspects an assertive and opaque story a fluid making a relevant screenplay an original photography which gives to the landscapes an image of desolation and lost paradise perturbed by a free violence. The work is also strongly steeped in a certain poetry.Concerning the two main characters a French critic had written that it was difficult to feel liking for these two irresponsible. I think that this critic badly analyzed the film. Terrence Malick doesn't try to make them likable to us. He describes them without kindness and condescension. They haven't got an imposing personality and live only through an intermediary myth. It is particularly obvious for the young man Martin Sheen who is obsessed with James Dean. One can also say that Sissi Spacek's voiceover which tells this dramatic story is of an amazing neutrality. Then unlike many criminal lovers Sheen and Spacek will live at the heart of this violence and the latter won't bring them together or take them away.With Badlands Malick was judicious for the choice of the actors. In a way his first movie enabled to put Sheen and Spacek on the map and it also launched their respective careers. Then what happened to Terrence Malick after this sensational debut movie? A second movie Days of Heaven 1978 starring Richard Gere as successful as Badlands. After that for twenty years nothing. However in 1998 Malick made a rather successful comeback with the Thin Red Line 1998. According to the latest news he would currently shoot a movie about the first years of America's colonization in the beginning of the seventeenth century. If my memory serves me well the movie will be released next year. Let's hope so...Like this?try these....gun crazy Joseph H.Lewis 1950you only live once Fritz Lang1936Bonnie and Clyde Arthur Penn1967".

	schema:reviewBody "In January 1958 nineteenyearold Charles Starkweather and fourteenyearold Caril Ann Fugate went on a murder spree in Nebraska and Wyoming. Eleven innocent people died. Most though not all of the killings were random. Starkweather and Fugate's story inspired several films including this one.In Badlands the pair's names were changed to Kit Carruthers Martin Sheen and Holly Sargis Sissy Spacek and their ages were altered slightly. From what I have read Starkweather and Fugate were emotionally detached and casual about the killings especially Charles once the initial murders had occurred. Both Sheen and Spacek do a good job of mimicking this nonchalant attitude. At various points throughout the film Holly narrates the story in an emotionless monotone voice. It's like she's reading a diary of what happened as we the viewers watch movie footage of the events.The film's title is appropriate given that the characters' inner lives must surely have been wastelands and given that the film's plot takes place mostly outdoors on the lonesome High Plains with its brooding and stark landscape.The film's color cinematography conveys a mood of desolation especially in those scenes that contain little more than the horizon expansive blue sky treeless plains and a couple of lonely desperados. At one point the color morphs into sepiatinted images of small town America as the whole country in fear takes up arms against the fugitives a photographic change that renders an almost documentary tone to the film.From time to time classical background music accompanies the senseless violence a cinematic contrast so stark as to make the film surreal. And of course the sequence toward the end where Kit and Holly with car radio on dance in the headlights as Nat King Cole sings A Blossom Fell is truly mournful and haunting.Badlands is incredibly understated and lowkey as detached as the characters portrayed. Director Terrence Malick conveys a simple uninvolved story packaged in a film that makes no effort to communicate either symbolism or thematic depth. Nor does the film render judgments about the characters or events. It's an approach that probably wouldn't work today. But it is effective and through the years the film has gradually become more respected as an excellent character study of 1950's teen rebels without a cause.".

Kit kills Holly's father and together they go on the lam and a few others get killed in the proceedings.This 1973 landmark film was the directorial debut of one Terrence Malick. It's been described by many as one of the most mature debuts in film history. The numbness of Sheen's and Spacek's characters is haunting and makes a very strong point and it's very hard to swallow. Spacek's voiceover which tells how she experiences life with Kit is disturbing and yet poetically beautiful. The sheer innocence of her character her brighteyed view of the world her acceptance of Kit's explanations make a stronger point in the examination of two completely alienated individuals than any other movie I can think of.Martin Sheen has never been better than here. His Kit obsessed with James Dean apparently is one of cinema's coldest villains. His utter detachment in all the proceedings is a wonder to behold. He's completely numb and that's more haunting than any outburst of rage. He's a flawed product of society. He doesn't feel evil he just doesn't feel anything. Sissy Spacek is also wonderful in her role giving a very memorable performance as Holly.Terence Malick's direction is superb. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is beautiful every frame simply looks stunning and he captures the era wonderfully. It's hard to believe this film is over 30 years old. The music is also very good with a catchy melody which seems to go well the innocence portrayed in Spacek's character. This almost feels like a children's tune.This film is considered to be loosely based on the real life killing spree committed by Charlie Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate in 1958. Starkweather was executed and up until his last day alive he said that Caril was just an observer but finally said she was as guilty of the killings as he even initiating some herself.Badlands however says in the end credits that the story is fictional.One of the best films of the 1970's.".

In fact the more I watch this film the more Spacek's narration is the highlight for me. It's great stuff.Being a Terrence Malickdirected film you know you are going to get some nice photography.

	schema:reviewBody "BADLANDS is an intelligent little film. We're given characters and situations and left to make our own conclusions. Based on an actual young couple who went on a killing spree across the southwest in the late 1950s the story has two young people doing their own thing with precious little in the way of ethics to guide them. It's interesting to note that both these kids substitute their own fantasies for any sense of order or responsibility that society may have to offer. The turning point comes when Kit and Holly decide to shuck their semblances of normal life for whatever their fantasies provide which unfortunately can't sustain them. Sheen's Kit is full of swagger and bravado it's almost easy for someone to see him committing robberies and serial murders. Spacek's Holly is more intriguing a soft vanilla invisible girl from a respectable emotionally detached home she seemingly possesses little in the way of what one would associate with a violent criminal. Yet she accompanies Kit with nothing in the way of reservations or regret. The chance to fulfill her vapid movie magazine fantasies if only by hiding out in the woods and applying makeup seem infinitely more palatable than her dull existence twirling batons in her yardit's interesting to note that one of the few things she takes away from her home is a highly romanticized Maxfield Parrish print. These misguided illusions along with her adolescent love for Kit keep her going to the end. A worthwhile exploration of the bland vacant American sensibility that values appearances or passive benign behavior over real ethics and personal morality. And definitely more relevant as the years have passed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Typical of director Terrence Malick's work Badlands revolves around a couple of loners who ostracise themselves from society and attempt to live in the wilderness. They eke out a natural existence living a romantic life in the vein of Henry Thoreau but gradually the outside world encroaches leading to conflict and eventually death.Our heroes are an odd bunch. She's Holly an ugly duckling and social outcast whose life was derailed by the death of her mother and he's Kit a loser who collects garbage and preys on little girls too naive to recognise that he's a bum. Like most of Malick's heroes they're in search of some idyllic haven a quest which takes them to the dustbowls of South Dakota. Like Malick's The New World in which both England and America were new worlds this film's title thus has a double meaning. Our heroes not only retreat into the badlands but away from what they perceive to be the badlands in this case the covert hostility of small town America.Though the film is structured as the hazy memories of a slightly older Holly its visual fabric is almost completely at odds with Holly's recollections. Kit and Holly perceive themselves to be deep and brooding loners akin to James Dean Bonnie and Clyde and medieval romantics but the audience is always aware that they're just a couple of flat and vapid personalities. In other words Holly wrongly annotates her own story and it is only gradually as the story unfolds that she wakes up to this fact.Kit is himself constantly proclaiming that he has things on his mind and yet everything he says and does proves otherwise. Kit's void is made most apparent by his obsession with James Dean. When others mention that he looks like Dean Kit's eyes light up his face brimming with a kind of narcissism. He's a nobody and comparisons to Dean allow him to expropriate if only for a little while somebody else's fame.Kit's disenchantment with self is emphasised during the film's final scene. You're quite an individual a police officer says as Kit boards a plane on route for the electric chair. Think they'll take that into consideration? Kit naively replies. Individuality and the fact that society does not cater for it is precisely why Kit and Holly find themselves marginalised.The people whom Kit kills coworkers Holly's father etc in his attempts to evade the law and maintain his freedom and relationship with Holly therefore demonstrate that Kit's rebellion is quite unconsciously a rebellion against a social order which wants him confined to the outskirts of society. The flights of the various individuals in Malick's Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line follow this same trend Richard Gere killing his factory boss and going on the run in the former film James Caviziel ditching the army and going on the run in the latter.But rather than treat sex love and freedom as a cynosure for unity and elation Malick depicts romance as the locus of division and indifference. Is that it? Holly disappointedly says after the couple first have sex a line which marks the point at which their romance begins to collapse.The disintegration of Kit and Holly's romance he begins to question whether she really was a virgin she begins to view him as a bum mirrors the couple's disenchantment with being free and living in the new world. But Holly's journey from romantic naivety to disillusionment also mirrors the arc of the film's philosophical metastory which charters a war between the Romantic Ideal of maninharmony with nature with the Post Enlightenment Ideal of man lording over nature.Romanticism began as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution and as a revolt against the social and political norms of scientific rationalism and the Age of Enlightenment. It favoured ancient customs folk art returning to nature spontaneity enchantment freedom and rejected rational and Classicist models in favour for a form of Medievalism which in theory helped one escape the confines of population growth urban sprawl and industrialism. In short the Romantic Ideal exalted a kind of gifted enchanted misunderstood loner whose creativity followed the dictates of his own wild inspirations rather than the mores of contemporary society. Such a romantic outlaw is found at the core of every Malick flick.So Malick's films deal with what German sociologist Max Weber calls Rationalization's disenchantment of the world in which society cherishes instrumental Rationality over and above value rationality to such an extent that magicspiritualityreligionethereality is slowly eroded. This process of devaluation or disenchantment gives rise to a condition of cultural nihilism in which the intrinsic value or meaning of ideals and actions is increasingly subordinated to a rational quest for efficiency control and the pursuit of mundane materials often by violence. Weber calls this the iron cage of specialists without spirit and sensualists without heart Holly's father is an artist but uses his talents on advertisements. In breaking free of their worlds and retreating to the Romantic Ideal Malick's heroes are thus searching for some mythical wholeness some nonexistent Eden which is unattainable precisely because all preenlightenment myths of wholeness have been displaced by the modern discovery of a plurality of worlds. The tensions of Malick's films however arise from the fact that the modern world which allows for all also allows for nothing. As plurality is threatening the Social Order attempts to reduce this threatening plurality  and the sceptical undermining of knowledge and morality it entails  to one universal world again by means of conquest and domination. And that is the paradox Malick explores the Post Enlightenment world which preaches multiplicity but seeks to impose its own unity its own singular Law imperialismcolonialismthe Big Other and the Romantic Ideal which promises some spiritual wholeness but delivers only the lawless malevolence of Nature.1010  Worth multiple viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Badlands based on the relationship between Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate and later an inspiration for Tarantino's True Romance and NBK never has a moment where something unrealistic curries. Writerproducerdirector Terence Malick leads his film along with a true emphasis on both the psychological nature of Kit Martin Sheen and Holly Sissy Spacek and with the uncanny knack for a relaxing style in his camera. At best Badlands is one of the successful homages to European cinema of the 1970's something that will last a long time due to its pairing of absorbing arthouse and perhaps mainstream sensibilities. At worst a viewer could feel bored with Malick's intent on running with his poetic ideas as a director. If there was any pretentiousness at all it went over my head this is a film that draws you into its tragic nature.Sheen and Spacek are totally believable as a couple on the run as Kit continually has a triggerhappy attitude to people after he shoots Holly's father. While Spacek holds the heart of the picture steady I'd have to say that Sheen's Kit is one of his best performances. He comes off in the perfect sense you wouldn't think for a second that Kit could be a killer that is until he pulls out his pistol. It works just as well that Holly is the narrator so that the viewer can understand where Kit's coming from and where he's going. If there is any distance between his character and the audience there's still a strong emotional connection through Spacek and their bond as a loving if dangerous couple.Overall Badlands is extraordinary in a way that doesn't cram its atmospheric from start to finish on the audience and it looks at young people in love however in such twisted circumstances in an honest way in how escalatory events create a disillusioned feeling in youth. That it's made on such a low budget gives it more merit. Kudos should go to the musical score by James Taylor Gunild Keetman and George Tipton too it's one of the best debuts of the 70's. A".

	schema:headline " Film Review  Badlands";
	schema:reviewBody "Terrence Malick's crimedrama Badlands 1973 loosely based on the reallife murder spree of Charles Starkweather in 1958 is a harrowing and bleak film on a teenager's murderous adventure with his girlfriend. The film is told from the perspective of Holly Sissy Spacek a lost teenager living in a dull South Dakota town. She narrates the love story between herself and Kit Martin Sheen a young charming man with looks that aren't dissimilar from James Dean. Holly is so smitten by him that she is corralled into becoming an accomplice during his killing spree which commences with the murder of her disapproving father. Initially the couple finds temporary relaxation living in a forest with wooden shelter and animals to feed on. However when Kit senses danger from three men holding shotguns he ruthlessly guns them down before they get the chance to threaten. This begins a pattern that transpires like dominos falling down one after the other as Kit murders anyone and everyone that stands in his path. The film is well photographed by Tak Fujimoto with beautiful aesthetics of the colourful vibrant and natural American countryside. This is the high point of Malick's film as well as the great performance from Martin Sheen. Whilst the story was engaging it became too repetitive and tiresome after the same scenarios occurring from place to place on their killing spree. Personally I found Badlands to be quite similar to Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde. However Penn's is a far greater film to Malick's as Bonnie and Clyde has a superior constructed narrative consisting of characters that were explored with more depthAlthough I didn't particularly enjoy Badlands it must be acknowledged that it is an impressive debut featurefilm from Malick which is the start of a lengthy and impressive career.".

	onyx:emotionText "Terrence Malick's crimedrama Badlands 1973 loosely based on the reallife murder spree of Charles Starkweather in 1958 is a harrowing and bleak film on a teenager's murderous adventure with his girlfriend. The film is told from the perspective of Holly Sissy Spacek a lost teenager living in a dull South Dakota town. She narrates the love story between herself and Kit Martin Sheen a young charming man with looks that aren't dissimilar from James Dean. Holly is so smitten by him that she is corralled into becoming an accomplice during his killing spree which commences with the murder of her disapproving father. Initially the couple finds temporary relaxation living in a forest with wooden shelter and animals to feed on. However when Kit senses danger from three men holding shotguns he ruthlessly guns them down before they get the chance to threaten. This begins a pattern that transpires like dominos falling down one after the other as Kit murders anyone and everyone that stands in his path. The film is well photographed by Tak Fujimoto with beautiful aesthetics of the colourful vibrant and natural American countryside. This is the high point of Malick's film as well as the great performance from Martin Sheen. Whilst the story was engaging it became too repetitive and tiresome after the same scenarios occurring from place to place on their killing spree. Personally I found Badlands to be quite similar to Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde. However Penn's is a far greater film to Malick's as Bonnie and Clyde has a superior constructed narrative consisting of characters that were explored with more depthAlthough I didn't particularly enjoy Badlands it must be acknowledged that it is an impressive debut featurefilm from Malick which is the start of a lengthy and impressive career.";

In his desperate desire to say something Real And Meaningful in other words arrogant and sophomoric about the horrible 1950s he uses Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate as an emblem of alienation in Ike's Amerika while minimizing the actual crimes they committed. Among other things Starkweather murdered Fugate's twoyearold sister by ramming a rifle muzzle down her throat until she choked to death. He also sexually assaulted a 16yearold girl before he and Fugate murdered and mutilated her. Neither of these crimes is so much as alluded to in the film because The Message is too important to be sullied by mere truth.So am I so out of touch?No. It's everyone else who is wrong.".

And that's all. Throughout all the events that unfold in this story some tragic some funny some frightening and some heartbreaking neither character expresses any strong emotion or any discernible personality. We know the characters LESS at the end of the film than we did at the beginning and that is just as unsatisfying as it sounds.Was Kit destined to become a killer? Were there signs we should have seen? Was there something in his past that drove him to this? Does he enjoy these killings? Or is he riddled with guilt and remorse? Is he conflicted or confused demented or brilliant? Director Terrence Malick never answers these questions. So why bother telling the story?Holly leaves us with the same void Is she secretly proud of her crazed violent protector? Is she mentally unstable herself for getting involved in this situation and allowing it to continue? What's wrong with her? What's going on here?!? She spends the movie in a dreamlike state with no reaction to the events around her. Even Kit's best friend who gets shot in the belly for trying to escape has no reaction to his own impending death... he sits quietly on his bed reading old postcards and bleeding to death. Restraining actors to this degree is a crime against the craft.The closest we get to any real insight is the contrived intentionallystilted voiceover from Sissy Spacek which ultimately reveals nothing. Our narrator's voice is detached disassociated and numb even with the advance knowledge of all that has happened and how. To tease the audience in this way is a defiant prank and not very funny.What could have been a brilliant movie is ruined by Malick's refusal to reveal ANY motivation for any of his characters. Heck we don't even understand why Holly's Father was so protective of her in the first place! A character study like this needs emotional highs and lows conflict confrontation... and after the first hour of watching Holly  Kit drift through this nightmare looking like they're stoned on painkillers the novelty begins to wear thin.I love Sheen  Spacek and I very much wanted to like this movie but it has been expertly crafted to communicate nothing. Badlands simply exists and if this was the stunt Malick was hoping to achieve his reward is that the film leaves no lasting impression.GRADE C".

The pair get friendly as they take walks together but Holly has to keep it a secret from her father knowing he will disapprove. When her father finds out he shoots her dog as punishment but neither Holly nor Kit are dissuaded from being together. Kit decides to leave town and take Holly with him when her father tries to stop him he kills him and heads off on the run.Although on the surface this sounds like a loversontherun film with a serial killer edge Malick's writing and direction prevents it from just being what you expect as he delivers a memorable debut. I first saw this about 15 years about when I was about 13 or 14 and at the time I only remembered that not a lot happened and that I was quite bored so I can appreciate why some viewers don't find this to their tastes. Watching it again the other day I found it much more interesting perhaps because I am older or maybe because I wasn't paying attention the first time. The film is slow but it is very interesting because of the characters that Malick has written and then allowed to develop out over the film. On one side we have the cold Kit who is a cold killer on one hand but breaks into a smile at comparisons with James Dean and the chance of fame. It has been done loads since but the look at the famehungry killer here still feels fresh.On the other side of the story is Holly. As narrator a lot of weigh is put on her but the way it is done she is more than just a story teller. While the on screen action tells us about Kit Holly's narration says a lot about her mind. Her fairytale singsong delivery and dialogue contrasts really well with the cold unromantic violence on the screen. Her denial and desire to explain it all away is clear but not forced down the viewer's throat. The cast respond well to the direction and both give restrained but strong performances avoiding showboating or pushing too hard. Sheen is strong holding back for the majority and coming out at the end. Spacek is the heart of the story and her innocent or nave character is played well both on screen as well as in her narration. Malick's direction is patient and as dry as the violence. The scenes are blessed with an open empty feel thanks to the impressive cinematography.Overall this is a slow film that is fairly empty if viewed on a superficial level just looking at the narrative. However the characters and the examination of their mindsets is what makes the film interesting and Sheen and Spacek both react well to that. It also helps that Malick has done a great job as writer and director while his cinematographers have produced a barren and pointless landscape to match the heartless and pointless killings.".

	schema:headline " A very beautiful film does it have any other purpose?";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been said that Badlands was in part a reaction to the romanticising of deviance and criminality in films such as Bonnie and Clyde. In that film the protagonists were played by two fabulouslooking charismatic not to mention talented actors. I came away feeling that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow would have been great fun to hang around withdangerous sexy fun.Badlands is not like that. Sure noone would really want to be like or spend time with Kit Carruthers based directly on fifties killer Charles Starkweather. But I was troubled by several aspects of this stunningly put together film. Essentially it is fine craftsmanship created around a very difficult subject with little exploration of the characters their motivations or the consequences of their actions. What remains for the viewer but a kind of detached voyeurism?Cruel and cowardly Charlie Starkweather was full of selfloathing believed himself a failure and felt his life was doomed to misery. Murder is a simple act that even the subintelligent can commit but it has staggering consequences. Having killed Starkweather changed in a way he grew. He felt himself to have achieved something. It completed the sad story that was his life.Kit Carruthers on the other hand slouches mumbles and poses throughout Badlands. We know almost nothing of his past. Of course the narrative follows Holly's point of view but since she appears to be in a dream and virtually clueless throughout the whole affair how useful is this narrative method? At the end Kit is pretty much his same inscrutable self as at the beginning except now he is famous. He's kinda cool and he knows it. When he kills it's as if he has met some unpleasant but important obligation that only he is qualified for. The murders themselves are sterilised just a bang and the victim quietly lies down. The sets and locations are picturesque the actors are picturesque the murders are picturesque...The 1957 film In Cold Blood is a gripping example of what can be achieved when something of the nature of spreeserial killers is explored when the consequences of their actions is stark and real and when the people inside them are glimpsed. And there are people inside badly damaged and loathsome but fascinating.".

	onyx:emotionText "It has been said that Badlands was in part a reaction to the romanticising of deviance and criminality in films such as Bonnie and Clyde. In that film the protagonists were played by two fabulouslooking charismatic not to mention talented actors. I came away feeling that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow would have been great fun to hang around withdangerous sexy fun.Badlands is not like that. Sure noone would really want to be like or spend time with Kit Carruthers based directly on fifties killer Charles Starkweather. But I was troubled by several aspects of this stunningly put together film. Essentially it is fine craftsmanship created around a very difficult subject with little exploration of the characters their motivations or the consequences of their actions. What remains for the viewer but a kind of detached voyeurism?Cruel and cowardly Charlie Starkweather was full of selfloathing believed himself a failure and felt his life was doomed to misery. Murder is a simple act that even the subintelligent can commit but it has staggering consequences. Having killed Starkweather changed in a way he grew. He felt himself to have achieved something. It completed the sad story that was his life.Kit Carruthers on the other hand slouches mumbles and poses throughout Badlands. We know almost nothing of his past. Of course the narrative follows Holly's point of view but since she appears to be in a dream and virtually clueless throughout the whole affair how useful is this narrative method? At the end Kit is pretty much his same inscrutable self as at the beginning except now he is famous. He's kinda cool and he knows it.

As a drama I give the rating which I entered as my official rating  1 out of 10 stars. This is no reflection on Martin Sheen or Sissy Spacek's talents or performances. Neither is it a reflection on the general plot since it was based on a true story a fact which until recently I didn't know. I own the movie and watch it from time to time but it's because I would give the movie about 7 out of 10 stars as a comedy. The dialogue is hilarious! My brother and I saw it in the early 80s on t.v. precable and laughed until we were almost crying. So anyway  I couldn't in good conscience give a movie that is categorized as a drama and is so horribly bad a good rating. If somebody recommended this movie to me as a great drama I would never trust their opinion on anything else again. Anyway it's interesting to see how differently people see this movie but variety is the spice of life. It's doubtful anyone will get through the current 12 pages of comments on this movie to read my comments but few movies I've seen if any have polarized audiences like this one. There's plenty of movies where people seem to either love it or hate it but this is the only one I can think of where the two opposing factions would give a movie the same rating for opposite reasons.".

	schema:reviewBody "Badlands 1973It's true what everyone saysthis is a kind of Bonnie and Clyde story. But don't get it wrong this has none of the depth or fascination or originality of that famous 1967 movie. It's worth seeing because this is director Terrence Malick's first big film. For those who follow his movies or avoid themthe negative reviews for his later work are astonishing you'll see the first signs of characteristic moods and styles and themes.This romanticized story set around 1960 is shamelessly nostalgic. It is filled with intentional references to earlier and better sources including Bonnie and Clyde itself and most outwardly James Dean. The violence is weirdly casual and frankly cruel and unfelt and I suppose that's part of the aesthetic distancing involved in what is really a college student's view of the world. Not that Malick was still in college he got out of film school four years earlier but his sensibilities came from studying film more than living it in my limited view. What he does without fail is pull together a great crew and cast and make the mechanics of the film really really good.So yes this is a very well made movie and it sweeps through upper middle of the country with a kind of schoolboy feel for the icons of the place and time. I wouldn't be so crude as to say it's like a giant and long Hallmark card on the surface but there you have it. Martin Sheen is really good in his role as a kind of wannabe James Dean and Sissy Spacek plays the naive 15 year old a bit too naively though she has a countrygirl innocence that sets up the violence well. Eventually without giving away much the two are on the run. And there are a couple of minor turns of events but really it's a routine tale told better before see They Live by Night for a great one and told with more honesty.The end is important and hard to talk about without giving anything away. But when you see it you'll see something that was talked about at the timethe glorification of an antiher the identification with a mindless and selfish killer. Al Pacino makes this the whole point in Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon two years alter. And here Malick makes it almost laughable and cheesy. And utterly unbelievable especially for 1960 especially after such a killing spree. Yeah a love hate movie. Looks and feels good but it lack depth and logic and sincerity despite it's sincere appearance. The worst mix of things possible.".

Other than the camerawork it is not at all extraordinary stuff. It has a formulaic story a messy plot and runofthemill characters. The acting is not much either and is a bit overdone by some of the cast members. Just because it is Swedish does not make any difference  the film is still as trite as today's horror flicks from Hollywood that are marketed at the younger generation. However the work of the cinematographer keeps the film from drowning.".

Old ghoulish folklore can always be used to create a great horror flick but the director has made some incredible faults. The sounds is bad... The effects are cheesy and bad at best. When a knife cuts someone it usually has blood on it? LOL. The actors does an okay job with a quite bad script. So I really don't have any heavy complaints there.But still its fun to see a Swedish horror movie I hope that more will be done but this movie was a complete waste of time.

Discovers a horrifically dark secret behind these murders and that off a recent suicide. The problem is that secret can have some big consequences on that of a respected student and his father who provides beneficial benefits to the school. While Sarah is digging further into this mystery there's a killer on the loose knocking off people. During the hundredth anniversary of the murders a party is organised but this night is when Sarah comes face to face with the killer.When I got to the ending credits I thought what a big waste of time I spent on this very lukewarm Swedish slasher. Other than the freely defined camerawork and glaringly grand location nothing else hugely appeals or breaks any new ground. Simply it looks great there's no denying that but its has to have more then strong polished visuals to back it up with because it doesn't go anywhere that we haven't been before and the tangled up story aimlessly plods about. If you going make a slasher with a plot structure that we've seen over and over again you might as well go out of your way to provide the big draw cards instead it decided to wimp out and come up with a rather mercifully plain offering. The story is very familiar that it's just simply worn out in its supposed twists and it doesn't provide much in a way of suspense so hopefully you would ask for some blood and TA then well sorry it cops out on those factors too.So what does it have going for it then! Well actually the haunting opening scene with its pulsating score that crops up at times makes a better impression than it deserves. The performances are fine if a little glum although the characters are your standard stereotypes waiting for their chance to be killed off. Like I said the film's features are attractively glossed up. But in the things that mainly count in these films all of that falls vapid. Please! Just add something in once in a while to make me sit up and pay notice in this drawn out fodder because nothing that is NOTHING ah other then camerawork and location setting is formidable and remotely enticing about what's happening. The deaths are incredibly lacklustre with most of it happening off the screen and when we did see one all we get was a puddle of blood in the most basic knockoff. Where was the atmosphere? Sadly with the countryside location and that of gloomy boarding school that has many poorly lit rooms there was nothing generated to get your skin crawling and that's a sorely missed opportunity.The screenplay is handled in a wilted manner and the script tediously strings along its muddled backstory and the coincidences that make headway are all a bit too convenient. When things start to unravel you can't stop thinking of why didn't this come sooner as pointless scenes cement themselves and the whole mystery becomes increasingly ragged with bits and pieces from other slasher flicks that aren't hard to pick up on. When it came to the sudden climax.. it had me thinking was that it!? Also the final scene was a bit puzzling in what it was trying to accomplish with the suggestion. The concept could've used some blatant energy to help with the stalk and slash moments too. Hence you know you're in for a jagged time when the murder scenes are even more boring than what's happening in between them.The film's production is well made and it might be a highly unoriginal slasher but what killed it for me was that is was so dead flat and tame in its execution that it just moulders away without much of a spark.".

The story is average early planting a myth of a ghostly killer on a path of revenge. The acting is quite good actually with a lot of the Swedish young elite in the acting ensemble. They perform well I think so a big  to them. The planting the element you plant early in a scene to make the viewer slightly aware that something is awry thereby increasing the tension in the movie and later reap the benefits by creating a scary finish is terrible.

The student heads down the basement... The killer of the movie now grabs the keys to the basement door. Unnecessary... You already know that this kid is gonna get it.

Now where could you find a slasher flick with those characteristics? This one is far better than most American slashers. It has some clichs but it's not as cynical as for example I Still Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream. The main plot situation is believed to be the revenge of the drowning ghost but the main problem really is that someone is taking his identity for unknown reasons. Who is behind the murders? What does Rebecca's suicide have to do with the whole situation? Watch Drowning Ghost and witness that it isn't what it looks. It's more than just a simple slasher.I must admit that the best feature about the movie is the acting. Rebecka Hemse Sara delivers a solid performance. She's firm brave intelligent and beautiful. That's my kind of woman! This girl seriously needs more important roles she has the talents. The rest of the cats also deliver a good performance and do not make fools out of themselves like in many American slashers. Also the visuals are great. The cinematography really helps to create the movie's atmosphere. This Swedish exteriors are great. Drowning Ghost may not be the best slasher film recently but it's a decent ghost story with slasher tones. I would recommend it for people who are not into violence or gore but still enjoy the slasher formula. This movie will keep you interested for it's plot beautiful lead character and some situations that are common in the life of a student.".

The Tree of Hands by the magnificent British master of suspense Ruth Rendell. The adaptation has nothing to do with the brilliant narrative she gave us with this novel. If anyone wants to see the best adaptation of a Rendell book I would recommend to see Claude Chabrol's La Ceremonie.Not only was that a superior film but it reveals the essence of the book with little effort. The problem with Alias Betty is Mr Miller's scenario. He has changed the basic premise of the book into something else. Now don't get me wrong it is a better film than some of the mediocrity coming from France lately.The big problem is with the character of the mother. Nicole Garcia is out of her range here. Not only that one never understands what's wrong with her even though she appears to be schizophrenic. She's a loose cannon up to no good. In the novel she's even more so. Betty is ambiguously played by Sandrine Kiberlain which in a way suits the character better. She is the only sane person around even though she is unable to control the mother. The minor side plots add to the story but everything at the end is resolved so easily that one wonders if anything like that is possible in life.

Get it at Amazon.I am somehow reminded in the storyline of this film of the work of mystery novelist Patricia Highsmith The Talented Mr. Ripley A Game for the Living etc. There is the same slightly genteel sense of mystery realism and a women's point of view that characterizes Highsmith's work. In this case we have a young woman who loses her fouryearold son and then unexpectedly gains another. This intensely personal experience is set in the strata of contemporary French society. There are people in the projects there is the underworld of petty criminals and prostitutes and in contrast there are those who live in country homes beyond the suburbs. It is there that Betty who is a novelist who has just published a best seller lives.What director Claude Miller has done with this material is to make it dramatic and to tell the story through the medium of film. That may seem obvious but how many film makers fail to understand the differences in media and end up with too much talk and too little use of the camera to good effect? Miller shows us commonplace scenes of the projects and contrasts them with the fine homes of the welltodo. He shows us the long limbs and slightly gawky beauty of his star Sandrine Kiberlain who plays Betty and he contrasts her to the fleshy woman of the streets and bars Carole Novacki Mathide Seigner who is the mother of the boy that Betty gains. He also compares and contrasts the craziness of Betty's mother Margot played with a fine fidelity by Nicole Garcia with similar more muted manifestations in Betty herself. There are interiors of luxury and grace and those of people living temporary lives in high rise block apartments. One gets a sense of France in the twentyfirst century adding texture and place to a woman's story that could happen in almost any city in the world.The opening scene shows Betty as a little girl on a train with her mother. We are told that her mother is suffering from some compulsive mental illness. We see her stab her daughter in the hand. And then we are fastforwarded to the present and Betty is with her son Joseph a scar on her hand without a husband going to her house in the countryside. Mother reenters and we see that she is indeed a mental case absurdity selfconsumed and insensitive. When the boy falls out of a window and dies from the brain damage Betty is in something close to catatonic shock but her mother thinks only of her own welfare and seems indifferent to anything else.And then comes the twist.I won't describe what Margo does now because it is so interesting to see it unfold. At any rate Betty is forced to come out of her depression and embrace new love and new responsibilities and to indeed commit a most criminal act that of running away with another's child. And yet somehow we are made to feelindeed the events of the plot compels us to feelthat she does the right thing in spite of her initial feelings and in spite of what would normally be right. Later on in the film there is another nice twist when the father of the dead boy returns and wants his share of Betty's success and fortune.What I think many viewers will appreciate here is that the players look and act like real people not like people from central casting. Alex Chatrian plays the second little boy and he is a charmer and beautifully directed by Miller. Kiberlain's laconic and wistful portrayal of a woman with so many choices won her Best Actress awards at the Montreal and Chicago film festivals. She has the kind of beauty that grows on you yet is not glamorous or glittery but when she smiles as she so seldom does in this movie she lights up the whole screen. And Seigner looks like a common woman not like a Hollywood star dressed up like a prostitute.The men are also interesting and also very real. Luck Mervil who plays Carole's boyfriend is restrained like a volcano that one knows will eventually go off and Stephane Freiss who plays the father of the dead boy and Edouard Baer who plays a scheming lowerclass gigolo are two very real varieties of men who prey on women.The ending is witty and satisfying and I can tell that Claude Miller has seen Stanley Kubrick's The Killing 1956 starring Sterling Hayden since part of this scene recalls the finale in that American film noir with the money flying out of a suitcase during a chase scene at an airport. Or perhaps that bit is from Rendell's novel which I haven't read and it is she who recalls Kubrick's film.This is a thriller that manages to also be an engaging chick flick if you will a commingling of character and story that is in the best tradition of film making and one of the best films I've seen in months.".

She is a single mother and has just moved from New York to France with her son of about four years old to a house in the French suburb. Her mother Margot Fischer Nicole Garcia is a deranged woman who lives in Spain and comes to France for some specific physical and mental exams. Betty has many traumas from her childhood due to the treatment spent by her mother.

Betty becomes very depressed and one day her mother arrives at home with a child of approximately same age as her dead grandson. She tells Betty that the boy is the son of a couple friend of her who had traveled on vacation and asked her to take care of him. Some days later Betty realizes through the news that her mother had indeed kidnapped the child. However Betty is very affectionate to the boy.

There is indeed at times the same air of unreality amorality and lawbreakers leading charmed lives. The characters may perhaps best be described as separate strands of seaweed on the edge of the Sargasso sea dead or at least lifeless to a certain extent but with just enough current to prevent them coalescing but touching drifting apart and touching again. Someone has already pointed out the 'borrowing' from Kubrick and it IS stretching credibility to have Stephen Freiss transporting so much money in such a beatup attache case in fact the entire end sequence relies heavily on coincidence that finds three people  one cop on vacation plus two people fleeing for various but linked reasons converging in the same place at the same time. Nicole Garcia has emerged as a very fine director L'Adversaire Place Vendome and was an equally fine actress as she shows here in a finely judged performance as what might be describes as a Fruitcake's Fruitcake she kicks off the film by stabbing her own young ten or so daughter in the hand for the flimsiest of reasons years later she inflicts herself on that same daughter Sandrine Kiberlain now 1 adult 2 successful  a bestselling novel a large house in a desirable location and 3 a mother herself. She finds it strange that her daughter Betty still bearing the scar of the knife wound is not prepared to leave her young son alone in the house and go out to dinner and later walking in the grounds she discovers the body of the boy her grandson let us not forget who has fallen out of the bedroom window and views it with a mixture of curiosity and detachment. A distraught and withdrawn Betty is hardly a million laffs so Mom thoughtfully snatches the first approximate lookalike she sees and brings him home like a cat brings home a mouse and blithely announces that two friends have gone on vacation and left their son with her. Betty's not buying this for birdseed and the truth does indeed soon emerge but here we are faced with another touch of the Highsmiths the mother of the kidnapped boy Mathilde Seigner is a hooker in all but name and not really concerned that her son has gone missing which is highly convenient. We're now pursuing one plot strand that explores Betty's gradual bonding with the boy another centered on Seigner's latest livein two months lover jealous of her involvement with other men and under suspicion himself sicking the police onto gigolo Stephen Freiss who may or may not be the father of the missing boy. Freiss's latest conquest a megarich younger woman has improbably gone on vacation for three months leaving him in charge of her very wellappointed house but little else. He mentions his new situation to Seigner over a coffee and she suggests he sell the house which he proceeds to do. The cops come to the house but figure he's innocent and leave it at that. One of the cops 'plants' the information that he's going on vacation any minute now. A little more of this and we have a set up where Kiberlain is taking the boy out of the country to start a new life Freiss is also leaving with a briefcase full of bread and a cop and his family are off on vacation all at the same time and at the same airport. A woman sitting next to Freiss asks him to mind her small boy whilst she goes to the powder room. He is happy to oblige. Cop sees him with boy. Chase. Briefcase opens. Kiss the money goodbye. Meanwhile Betty's plane takes off. If you can swallow all this you'll love it. The acting is of the highest standard across the board. Garcia Kiberlain and Seigner are three exceptional talents and they are well supported. In short a winner.".

With the English title of Alias Betty not an adequate translation from the French the neighborhoods of Paris witness tragic loss wistful grasping for hope and ludicrous scheming for illgotten gain.Sandrine Fisher is Betty an author with a very successful apparently first novel about her life and marriage during a fouryear sojourn in New York City.  Returning to a just bought beautiful house in the outer Parisian suburbs Betty  who makes it clear she's had it with New York's claustrophobic Alist social life  just wants peace and quiet for herself and her young son Joseph.  Immediately arrives her wacky mother Margot played very well by Nicole Garcia in town for medical tests that she won't trust doctors to perform in Spain where she and her husband settled.Motherdaughter conflict?  Sure.  Ranging back to Betty's youth?  Yep. Familiar?  Of course.  Sandrine is very believable as a daughter with a vivid and deeply rooted lovehate relationship with mom.  Mom may be worried about her health and want extensive medical tests but she's the kind of gal who'll outlive all the people she drives nuts.  And she IS nuts too.Hardly settled into her home Betty gets hit with the unspeakable tragedy of an accident claiming her young son's life.  If that isn't bad enough and is anything worse than the loss of a child? Margot thoughtfully picks up little Jose  for Betty as a replacement  for her lost boy.  Picks up? Right as in kidnapping.  Jose is the child of a complex and wounded character Carole Mathilde Seigner a woman battered as a child and available to as many men in a week as time will allow.  Who is Jose's father is a big question mark and dominating concern for some but not for Carole who seems to write off the result of her prostitution as an inconvenience. Carole hovers between likability and repulsiveness.  Mathilde Seigner invests her complex role with rapidly shifting emotions.Anything more would constitute spoilers.  Miller has given a fresh coat to the frequent cinema theme of casual interactions through the interconnectedness of the characters' lives as revealed by sharply etched encounters.  Sandrine Kiberlain a thin woman whose shoulders carry the weight of the story delivers a remarkably effective and nuanced performance.The resolution is alternately amusing and messy but overall believable.  A very good film.710.".

Jose is the child of a complex and wounded character Carole Mathilde Seigner a woman battered as a child and available to as many men in a week as time will allow.  Who is Jose's father is a big question mark and dominating concern for some but not for Carole who seems to write off the result of her prostitution as an inconvenience. Carole hovers between likability and repulsiveness.  Mathilde Seigner invests her complex role with rapidly shifting emotions.Anything more would constitute spoilers.  Miller has given a fresh coat to the frequent cinema theme of casual interactions through the interconnectedness of the characters' lives as revealed by sharply etched encounters.  Sandrine Kiberlain a thin woman whose shoulders carry the weight of the story delivers a remarkably effective and nuanced performance.The resolution is alternately amusing and messy but overall believable.  A very good film.710.";

In what certainly feels like the long run and somewhat immense back catalogue of multistranded films interlocking and connecting with a common thematic Betty Fisher's and her significant others is most unquestionably lacking a rawer bite and a more pleasing common thread. Placed into perspective something like Altman's 1993 film Short Cuts flew past and was a lot longer Betty Fisher plods along at its own pace and just has you constantly feel 'aware' that numerous tales are going on and that they're going to interlock at some point. Where Altman's opus was a more involving and felt far less ordained effort studying the nature of human beings and both mankind's reactions and attitudes towards death loss and spiritual companionship Claude Miller's 2002 film sideswipes a glance at motherhood or specifically parenthood. In short it's an interesting enough little drama which doesn't necessarily uproot the trees it thinks it does but does enough.Observe if you will one of the stories therein Miller's piece a short about a young boy named Jos living with his motherplusmale guardian in a rather downtrodden part of a big city. As Jos sits idly in one scene unguarded in front of a television with a collection of other tots his mother makes love to guardian Francois Mervil in a room down the hall and the screen displays a performance by an iceskater doing their routine. The underlying issues formulate one of which is more broadly linked to that of how a parent with a child decides to spend quality time at home with it when there are others out in the world whom for some tragic reason have lost a child and would no doubt do a great deal to try and recall the opportunity at garnering access to the sort of time Jos's father has available to him. Secondly after an idea in regards to the differing attitudes to parenting the notion of what's playing on the television screen is hinted at as content which could very well be anything the images captured by way of a collective gaze belonging to that of Jos and the other kids whom watch on with a stagnant awe at subject matter which is unguarded by those in charge and might very well have seen them exposed to any kind of imagery.A second adult whom features prominently is the titular Betty played by Sandrine Kiberlain a character whose past tragedy in life involves the subjection to a mentally ill mother whilst young and the injuries she suffered at the hands of such a woman. Now grown up with mother Margot Garcia now appearing on the straighter and more narrow having darted over to Spanish tourist spots on the off occasion she lives as an author in the same urban locale with her very young son Joseph  the film informing us that it will now be providing us with Joseph's story and that in itself just somehow manages to set an ominous beginning. Our suspicions ring true and Margot is responsible for one last slice of agony which deeply embeds itself into poor Betty's life their bickering downstairs and consequent inability to properly lock down Joseph's room in the evening results in the child clambering where one mustn't clamber before falling to serious injury later resulting in death. Between Betty's rightfully aggrieved reaction Margot suggests the kidnapping of another boy to fill the void.The aforementioned Jos is the second child whose story we observe the film's attitude as a piece trying to reflect ideas content and focus onto its child characters becoming more obvious Jos being a young boy out with his suave and fasttalking father a boy whom must pause with him as he chats or flirts with women out in public before venturing off to that apartment housing said girlfriend something Jos must again silently suffer through because of the actions of a guardian.

	schema:reviewBody "The English title on the Region 2 release does a much better job of luring us into this stylish French thriller part psychological study and part ensemble suspense story. Betty Fisher and Other Stories tells us about Brigitte Fisher Betty is her nom de plume a young woman who has written a successful novel. In New York she married briefly had a child and has return to Paris. She had an unpleasant childhood with a mother who at times would become irrationally angry. Brigitte's marriage lasted six months. Now her son is four years old and her mother has unexpectedly arrived for medical treatments. Days later Brigitte's son falls from a second floor window and dies. Brigitte Sandrine Kiberlain is distraught and depressed. Her mother takes steps to fix that...by stealing a fouryearold child from a lowerclass neighborhood and bringing the boy home for her daughter. Betty at first rejects the child but then slowly becomes attached. And we learn about the child's real mother Carole Novacki a surly young barmaid shoplifter and parttime prostitute. There's Carole's livein boy friend Francoise a laborer from Africa Milo the bartender with a short fuse where she works Alex the hustler longtime friend and occasional bedmate of Carole there's Eduard Brigitte's former husband who shows up and sees her now as a literary bread ticket. There is a whole cast of characters including the police who are searching for the stolen boy. Their stories swirl around Brigitte's story sometime overlapping sometimes just glancing by. The stories come together at Orly Air Port in a violent confrontation which leaves these people and their stories getting what they deserve. Which means some die some flee and some get on an airplane for Singapore. The director Claude Miller does two things very well. He not only involves us with all these stories he gives them all an overlay of uneasy tension. Especially with Brigitte her mother and the stolen boy there is an edgy dread that quickly establishes itself. It eases up only when we realize the boy will survive but there still is the question of what will happen to him. Miller also gives us some strong characters to get involved with even if we don't like them too much. There's no flashy acting moments just the steady building of information about these people which Miller lets us discover for ourselves. The actors in my view all do fine jobs. Sandrine Kiberlain carries the movie and she handles her character with depth and skill. Nicole Garcia who plays Brigitte's mother makes us nervous whenever we see her. Just how unstable is Margot Fisher? The story by the way is from one of Ruth Rendell's psychological thrillers. This is a movie which keeps something of a cool distance from the many goings on. I don't think this is a fault. It helps us examine Brigitte's evolving feelings and helps us make choices about the characters. I'd be surprised if any viewer doesn't finally agree with Brigitte's choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alias Betty promises more than it delivers. The early scenes in introducing us to two convincing lifelike characters suggest French film at its bestand one just wants to savor the building drama. However as soon as plot elements begin to insert themselvesa la Hollywoodcharacter development gets circumscribed. Betty Fisher shrinks in stature and in interest as the film progresses Margot becomes a bit tiresome and disappears and Carole grows more deviant and is killed off. In other words all three of these modern mothers are initially more and are capable of more than who they become.One never gets the impression that the Betty Fisher we first knowso original in looks physicality and responseis going to be a kind of child sop mother. Yes she does have a fatherless son and she is determined to do more by him than her neuromental mother did by her but this son is hardly his mother's keeper. Her care for him is not uncompromisingthe accident should be proof enough of thatnor is her deep depression over his death anything but understandable given her personal history. Thus she convincingly maintains this stance with Joe2 her responses to him being that of any career woman similarly positioned occasionally sympathetic but generally finding the kid burdensome. But soon the plot starts to get inside her head and wreck havoc with her well based and centered identity. New plot characters begin to proliferate.

The early scenes in introducing us to two convincing lifelike characters suggest French film at its bestand one just wants to savor the building drama. However as soon as plot elements begin to insert themselvesa la Hollywoodcharacter development gets circumscribed. Betty Fisher shrinks in stature and in interest as the film progresses Margot becomes a bit tiresome and disappears and Carole grows more deviant and is killed off. In other words all three of these modern mothers are initially more and are capable of more than who they become.One never gets the impression that the Betty Fisher we first knowso original in looks physicality and responseis going to be a kind of child sop mother. Yes she does have a fatherless son and she is determined to do more by him than her neuromental mother did by her but this son is hardly his mother's keeper. Her care for him is not uncompromisingthe accident should be proof enough of thatnor is her deep depression over his death anything but understandable given her personal history. Thus she convincingly maintains this stance with Joe2 her responses to him being that of any career woman similarly positioned occasionally sympathetic but generally finding the kid burdensome. But soon the plot starts to get inside her head and wreck havoc with her well based and centered identity. New plot characters begin to proliferate.

That's where the main problem of the film is the coincidences at the end look a bit farfetched and overthetop but are still believable.

Overall enjoyable and at times well observed and surreal as any film about Brussels should be.The only issue with this film is that it is too plastic. The writerdirector reveals his limitations in a number of sequences displaying a lack of a deeper intimacy of the Bruxellois. Poelvoorde Belvaux  Bonzel were much closer to the mark. Damiens is an absolute natural in his character as is the excellent Mourade Zeguendi. Putting their names on this to boost sales Marion Cotillard fills her shoes well but the usually entertaining Dominique Pinon seems like he's not sure what he's meant to be doing and therefore a little out of place. Much like the presence of Vedett beer in real cafes.The scenes in the disco cinema and cafe are particularly enjoyable and Damiens' mother's montchargestairlift is a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read a lot of the comments for this movie and think that many of you have missed the point.  The directors claim this to be a movie about friendship  and that the bonds of that relationship have nothing to do with the circumstances from which they are born.  I'm somewhat sceptical about that.  If you just wanted to make a movie about friendship it could be about nuns.  Or puppies.  Or just about anything. But Baisemoi which translates as Shag Me not Fk Me serves to highlight very clearly the moral hypocrisy that surrounds cinema and has done ever since the days of the Hayes Code.  The irony here lies in the fact that it is the explicit sex that caused the film to be banned in so many territories.  No one has a problem with the violence. Sure the violence might be simulated and the sex isn't  but they both occupy the same space on the screen.  And while it's legal to have sex in the privacy of your home the violence depicted could never be legal. After all you can see worse violence in Freddy vs. Jason and more explicit sex on any porn video you might choose so what is it about the combination that riles people so? I'll concede that the film is flawed and demonstrates the debutant directors lack of experience but for the challenge it sets to our jaded set of morals in the west it should be applauded.".

The directors claim this to be a movie about friendship  and that the bonds of that relationship have nothing to do with the circumstances from which they are born.  I'm somewhat sceptical about that.  If you just wanted to make a movie about friendship it could be about nuns.  Or puppies.  Or just about anything. But Baisemoi which translates as Shag Me not Fk Me serves to highlight very clearly the moral hypocrisy that surrounds cinema and has done ever since the days of the Hayes Code.  The irony here lies in the fact that it is the explicit sex that caused the film to be banned in so many territories.  No one has a problem with the violence. Sure the violence might be simulated and the sex isn't  but they both occupy the same space on the screen.  And while it's legal to have sex in the privacy of your home the violence depicted could never be legal. After all you can see worse violence in Freddy vs. Jason and more explicit sex on any porn video you might choose so what is it about the combination that riles people so? I'll concede that the film is flawed and demonstrates the debutant directors lack of experience but for the challenge it sets to our jaded set of morals in the west it should be applauded.";

	schema:reviewBody "It always interests me that anyone can really call this porn. This is an interesting film even if you think it's 'crap'. Why is it that all the men I know who've watched it think it's crap? I teach this film as part of a course and without fail all male students thus far have said it's 'not porn' and the thing they most objected to was seeing 'grannies doin' it'. Could it be the fact that for once we actually see men's faces when they come that disturbs so much? What we never or rarely see in porn is a male appearing vulnerable. In BaiseMoi this is explored. As is said above yes the 'plot' may be virtually nonexistent but isn't that the case with most regurgitated mainstream films anyway? This film isn't about stimulating an audience sexually be they male or female indeed it is just as objectionable to women as it is to men. But I do believe that the reasons are different. The feedback I've received is that men are expecting to be aroused either through plot character or scenes of a blatant sexual nature. Women are generally just intrigued and then often put off by the violence  by the women  that is often apparently unmotivated. We don't really see films where women are violent without 'good' cause it's too disturbing and dispels too many myths that potentially undermine society supposedly. Only just over a decade ago a film which by comparison views like Bambi was almost not made because it depicted 'female violence'. Thelma and Louise was viewed as a rather risky production.So I'm not surprised that BaiseMoi gets a slating. It may well be all those things that the above reviewer suggests and indeed there are elements I agree with. But this is an important film even if you watch it just to hate it. If you do hate it all I ask is that you really think about why you hate it. If you want CGI predictable narrative structure dripfeed invisible editing and to feel absorbed and immersed I knock none of these things then don't bother. If you're a thinking person who has an inquiring mind give it a go.".

Unlike some films this one doesn't in any way glorify violence though it merely shows the sad inevitability of it as far as its two main characters are concerned.Both Nadine Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach and Manu Raffaella Anderson routinely endure violation both in word and deed on an almost daily basis as sex workers prostitute and parttime porno performer respectively. The gang rape of Manu and her drugaddicted friend shown here is totally different from the clichd theymayprotestatfirst type of rape scene encountered in some adults only features. While the other girl cries and screams throughout and is ever more horribly abused because of it Manu adopts a facade of indifferent resignation cleverly robbing her rapists of their sadistic thrill. Rest assured that the scene goes on a lot longer than anyone would want it to and that it is very painful to watch which is the whole point of it. When Manu and Nadine meet and embark on their violent road trip fully aware that they ultimately can't 'get away with it' sex becomes a source of liberation to them. Like so many guys on the lam in any criminal buddy movie you can think of they take what they want when and how they want it casually discarding not always violently their casual partners postorgasm. One of the most common accusations at porn's address is that the explicit sex scenes dehumanize the people performing them but here that could not be further from the truth.Former hardcore actresses Lancaume and Anderson are both terrific in their parts and the sex they have and yes it is 'real' sex enhances their characterizations rendering them more complete. The 'cinema vrit' rawness of the digital video format in which it was shot interrupted by sudden flashes of style when violence erupts an artistic decision to give the viewer a feel for the power and pleasure the women derive from their acts as an escape route from their drab lives draws the viewer uncomfortably close to the action. Again that seems to be the point. So don't let the negative publicity fool you. BAISEMOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cinastes Despentes author of the sulfurous source novel and exporn star Coralie. You may love it as I obviously did or you may hate it but this is an important film that no one is likely to ever forget no matter how hard they might try.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in Helsinki Finland in June of 2000.  What caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie although itself French had been Banned in France.  Upon returning home to New York I discovered that one of the Art House movie theaters in the City was screening the film and so with my Finnish fiancee decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Boy did we ever.From the comments read here and the reviews I knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit.  Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions I went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our Gallic cousins.  Presumably as anyone who is reading this will know the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in France the movie has English subtitles.  The resemblance to Thelma and Louise however ends with that the sex is unusually graphic and in copious supply as is the violence a lot of stomping to death and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact.On an intellectual level one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence as manifested by the only sex these women know one is a smalltime prostitute and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films.  When they during their descent into crime and murder have the upper hand over their sexual situations they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand.  It is important to note however that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex of which there are severalbut innocent passersby a woman at an ATM for example as well.I myself do not really understand why the repeated pornmovie shots were all that necessary except to depict the physical contact as cruel unpassionate and debased and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms.It is a coarse and crude movie but in fairness it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances.  From one point of view the lives of the French underclasses is explored and it's pretty grim a travelogue for France it definitely is not perhaps that's why the French banned it.".

Yet there is one thing that always stirs my passion. I admire them for it. I wish we had an ounce of it in Britain.The best known examples of course are the film protests in 1968  a time when everyone was protesting about everything. But they helped indirectly to restore the international prestige of French cinema. When BaiseMoi was banned shortly after release in 2000 there were spontaneous street protests. Now this is a bit different  the film's artistic merits or lack of them are still a matter of debate. But I take my hats off to the French. I would love to see the British protest in the name of cinematic freedom. The ban was eventually lifted after separate protests signed by Parisian intellectuals.As you will already have guessed the issues around this film are complicated. And they get worse. There is a tendency to react emotively to any highly charged sexual issues. This tendency can maybe blind us somewhat when it comes to analysing more important ones.This is a film made by women about women living on the fringes of society. I was once importunate enough to argue with acclaimed filmmaker Gaspar No after a public screening of Irreversible that his film didn't address the issue of rape as well as Baise Moi. I still believe that although Irreversible is a landmark film for other reasons entirely. Most films about rape follow maleorientated story lines. They often emphasise the purely physical violenceaspect as in Irreversible or have a strong woman seeking and finding redress as in The Accused. The reality is that most rape victims are traumatised mentally and emotionally. Physical hurt as a result of violence is no less an issue but a separate one. Although The Accused looks at some of the metal trauma it ultimately plays out as a success story. Few rape victims take on such a masculinised determination to succeed against the odds. Odds which are still stacked against the victim.What I liked about BaiseMoi is that it eschews the womansurvivor scenario for a more realistic picture of lasting psychological damage. Films that show the real horror of rape may discourage it more than ones that show women 'getting over it.' One of the victims of rape in BaiseMoi actually 'lets' her assailants get on with it commenting to her friend afterwards that at least they didn't wind up dead. The rape and the violence of BaiseMoi convinced me that she probably hedged her bets wisely. Her lack of struggle didn't in my mind make her any the less a victim. And neither did the unpleasant fact that she was a parttime prostitute make her any more 'deserving.' This is something that it is not easy to live with. As a society we have moved past the point where a girl in a short skirt acting flirtatiously The Accused is 'asking for it' or 'deserving of rape.' But where is our cutoff point? The marginals in society are often seen as dispensable. Noone wants to acknowledge them  least of all mainstream filmmakers. Yet they can be just as much victims.Another thing I like about BaiseMoi is that the two girls that form a bond and go on a road trip are fully developed as characters. Like most young women they enjoy having a good time and going after boys. But they have been mentally scarred. One of them has been brutally gangraped and the other has watched her only friend being killed. They are not 'good girls gone bad'. They are fairly 'bad' already. But they are still victims. Beneath their bravado their mental deterioration is apparent. In Black Snake Moan the horrific effects of a redneck woman's history of sexual abuse and rape are given some time through Christina Ricci's great acting but the plot is driven by male characters towards a stupid and not very believable conclusion. In BaiseMoi it is the trauma that the women went through that drives the plot. Sadly one of the main actresses Karen Bach committed suicide in 2005. The film is arguably weakened by a change of style. The initial scenes are very realistic including the horrific rape. But then the main protagonists go on a killing spree reminiscent of Natural Born Killers on trash aesthetic. Perhaps this is appropriate  they live in lala land as long as they can. But it will confuse some viewers.To reclaim women's rights over their true sexuality to seize it back from the male gaze. It's always men who have a problem with a woman's sex that's their problem not ours. A noble aim by the filmmakers. But will feminists baulk when they realise that one of the directors and two of the stars have previously worked in hardcore pornography? There's no logical reason why sex scenes should only be in porn says Trinh Thi. Indeed Hollywood agrees. I am sure there are convincing psychological arguments but realistic sex still upsets many audiences personally I have more of a problem with overlyrealistic violence.This analysis has outstayed its welcome. I have laboured the good points of the film and rated it accordingly. On a technical level the idea of using only natural lighting also works well. But apart from its stand against censorship and the way it deals with rape the film is lacking in many respects. It was made on a very small budget and it shows. The acting is acceptable but not much is demanded from actors in terms of interiorisation and so on. There's a good soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film may probably be to argue over the issues it raises.".

Not cartoonish like Natural Born Killers but raw violence uncaring unmerciful and brutal.The sex is real but it is like nothing you see in porn films. The sex is driven by the women's needs it shows the vulnerability of men during orgasm and the men are discarded like used tissues if they are not killed when the women have been satisfied.They even have a Thelma and Louise plan to die together by jumping off a cliff. Circumstances do not allow that to happen and the ending is rather abrupt and somewhat lacking.Men joke about PMS but if it is anything like the rage depicted by the women who made this film you better watch out.

The sex is driven by the women's needs it shows the vulnerability of men during orgasm and the men are discarded like used tissues if they are not killed when the women have been satisfied.They even have a Thelma and Louise plan to die together by jumping off a cliff. Circumstances do not allow that to happen and the ending is rather abrupt and somewhat lacking.Men joke about PMS but if it is anything like the rage depicted by the women who made this film you better watch out. This rage is nothing to joke about.";

	schema:reviewBody "Amidst all the controversy about the pornostyle sex scenes random acts of violence liberal depictions of drug use and so on it seems the central question has been lost  is Baisemoi actually any good? Well the answer is No  not really.It starts well enough nicely setting up the two main characters with some very wellacted almost documentarylike scenes. Well I say nicely  the word seems hardly appropriate when these scenes include Manu and another woman suffering a genuinely harrowing rape while Karen prostitutes herself along with a liberal smattering of general sex violence and substance abuse. Nevertheless the opening is wellplayed out and directed with surprising flair especially considering that this is the debut movie for both its directors.However when the plot kicks in proper and the two women end up on the run together the film's interest begins to drop fast. Oddly the further out of control the two protagonists get the less exciting the story is  it gradually becomes a mere retread of countless other lowgrade revengeexploitation movies simply with a slightly more porno feel. By the denouement to be brutally honest I was bored stiff a stiffness which is nothing to do with the pornographic element of the movie I assure you.One of the main problems is the inherent lack of any kind of point. The beginning of the movie seems to be setting the film up as an analysis of our responses to violence  of how an upbringing in a cruel and violent environment can manifest those tendencies in ourselves  and also as a commentary on the parallels and links between violence and the act of fornication. However it completely fails to deliver on either of these promises in the second and third acts and increasingly one gets the feeling the film's only reason for being is that it thinks it is cool. Unfortunately for Baisemoi it isn't. It's a wasted opportunity. It's only real use is as a shock tactic but even this is wasted on anyone who's seen a porn film  the violence side of it is no worse than is seen in any number of straighttovideo actionthriller flicks.Ultimately all there is to recommend Baisemoi is a couple of impressive acting performances a few amusing lines of dialogue and a thoughtprovoking 20 minutes at the start. The rest sadly is nothing to get excited about.".

There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.Baisemoi had been described as Thelma  Louise with actual sex to me. Well it is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that everything's over anyway there is no way to hold back.Baisemoi had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male dominance in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.This is something that I had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. And they kill women. No they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal ways.How easily the heroines decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously. It was just all too much. Too much sex too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness rather than in conveying a story or making a point.Baisemoi left me with no impression hadn't set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world. So constructed unrealistic and over the top.There was nothing that I could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than Why did they make this terrible film? Had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film served a purpose I'd easily accepted it. But since I found nothing since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... I filed it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever EVER watch this film again and I now consider this to be the worst film I've ever seen. Worst not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didn't work.

	schema:reviewBody "I've just had the misfortune of sitting through this film. That it's title translates into 'F Me' in English was hardly promising  but I tried to keep an open mind throughout.Within minutes  I was left baffled by a plot that barely makes sense acting that makes daytime tv soap operas look like Oscar material and some of the worst directing I've ever seen.The violence within the film is highly graphic but nothing particularly terrible.  There's much worse in several critically acclaimed films that I really enjoyed  so that in itself isn't a problem for me.  What is a problem is that the film's protagonists have no reason for doing what they do  other than their graphic rape at the beginning.  If this film can be compared to 'Thelma  Louise' in any way its that Themla and Louise were both likeable people who ended up in a bad situation they couldn't escape from.  The leads in this film are not exactly likeable at the start of the picture let alone when they go on a killing spree murdering anyone and everyone that gets in their way.The rape sequence is very graphic  and certainly more realistic than your average Hollywood attempts.  But there is no real explanation as to why it causes the characters to lose control  it just does.  Obviously rape is a tramuatic experience  but this film seems to just trivilise their order in an attempt to score cheap 'shock points'.The explicit nature continues with sex scene after sex scene.  Blow jobs sex from both front and behind standing up lying down on all fours  whatever your dirty favourite  chances are its in here... and seemingly for little reason other than titilation.Chances of the film being saved by feminist undertones are not taken. Thelma and Louise took revenge on the kind of men who raped them this women just kill whoever they feel like.  Not even 'Ms 45' killed everyone she could  only men who she had an understandable fear of following her ordeal.Certainly not a film for the faint of heart I thought I could stomach almost anything  but watching them murder yet another person unjustly whilst having sex with yet another person who they later murder  it all became a bit too much.  I didn't so much find it shocking as entirely boring after a while.  That the potentially enjoyable scenes were scuppered by violence seconds before they could've gotten interesting didn't help either!To conclude  I learned nothing from this film.  It's appalling direction and somewhat hammy subtitles in English possibly identical to the French  but I couldn't tell you for certain as well as some dreadful acting from its leads... and worst of all  a jumpy nature that effectively ruined every murder  simply left me unable to find any merits within this picture.  I may have seen a worse film... but I'd be hard pressed to name one!Avoid like the plague!".

The most controversial thing about this film are the sexscenes which are  at times  hardcore. I admire the fact the makers had the guts to film them and even let it pass in the editing room but I have a suspicious feeling they did it just for the effect. The violence is also explicit and sometimes gory. But ladies nouvelle violence died about seven years ago. They also discuss the fact they should say something cool whenever they kill people. But somehow they never manage to really say anything important to make a statement. Okay they are both on the run and one of them was raped earlier in the film but they never give a clear motivation for the killing. Is it they want to have revenge on all the men? Well later in the film in a sexclub they also kill women.If you look beside the controversy you can see that this could be a good movie an evil Thelma and Louise but the makers are too much focused on the sex and the violence and that makes it nothing more than an exploitation flick.

In remembrance of ThrillerA Cruel Picture mixed with the plot of Thelma and Louise this movie fails to offer any original style at all. Many women state that men can't openly watch this film and that men are closed minded to films like this. Others conclude people don't like this film because it's too explicit. Well let me be the first to say that unlike the film makers most human beings are intelligent people specifically those commenting on this boardother than those that even consider this movie worthwhile. If you don't like explicit material than most people naturally don't watch it. And if you are new to the genre you're probably not starting with this film. Therefore we can conclude logically that most people seeing this film have experience with films by Lucio Fulci Pier Paolo Pasolini Gasper Noe Alejandro Jodorosky... The difference however between the above filmmakers and the makers of this film is that they offer intelligent thoughtout pieces that often work as metaphors of particular events. To say that this film is a metaphor of the way women feel towards a male dominated society is just ignorant.Some people say this film does not have a story unfortunately this is not true. The film does have a story a very simple revenge story that seemed to be written by aggrevated 8th graders. The directing in the film is insulting and it insults the other great film makers who spend long hours writing brilliant allegories and then translating through the film medium. This film if anything resembles that of a Troma film with explicit sex. The movie is almost laughably bad trying to achieve a high status through publicity. The violence is however well done and that does give the film some merits. But the inclusion of completely unthought sexual scenes ruins this immediately. It's not like people watching this film have not seen the act of sex before.When a movie goer goes to see a film specifically one calling itself an art film they expect to see fresh thoughtprovoking material. What we have here is a mess. Unfortunately this movie clarifies that not everyone can make movies. Women who like this film and argue it to be revolutionary are missing the fact that there are good writerdirectors out there that touch on women rights much more thoughtfully. Apparently this film is supposed to deliver some sort of message but in order to voice such a message you must first demonstrate a level of respectable intelligence that would allow a viewer to value the opinion of the writerdirector. This film never comes close to accomplishing any level of respect and clearly the filmmakers lack any knowledge AT ALL in filmmakingOther than the effects. If you're going to make a film that is controversial with a message be inventive with your film making be inventive with your story line be inventive with your characters be inventive with your camera shots. DO NOT THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU SHOW TWO PEOPLE REALLY HAVING SEX THAT YOUR FILM DESERVES RESPECT. The message in this film is so ineffectively delivered that I think I have scene porn films that offer more insight into life than this film.Anyways the only reason I felt compelled to comment on this film is due to the lack of people intelligently commenting on this film as a film. Nobody wants to hear that this film is bad because of the explicit nature and nobody wants to hear it is good on that account either. The moral of the story here is just because of a film is cutting edge doesn't make it good. Hey look at Island of Death for example that film was banned all over the place. Or even Cannibal Ferox which offers nothing but gore. The only problem is those films are designed to shock and entertain through the shocks this movie tries to offer a deep message embeded in worthless shocks just like IOD and CF. What this film is is a PORNO made by ACTRESSES IN THE PORN INDUSTRY with BLOOD no more no less. Anymore analysis gives the writers too much credit in life. Pretty much they picked up a camera one day and said instead of just having sex today lets simulate rape and call it art. WHO DOES THAT?".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen BaiseMoi on DVD several weeks ago. The movie made also a short run in Adult Theaters here in Mxico City as Vilame! but I don't think it scored high. I enjoy a pretty strong stomach and with the years passing by I became more openminded and tolerant thank God something good comes also with the aging process.... The movie contains a graphic rape sequence a few more explicit sex scenes and tons of gore and violence without being able to deliver a message. Perhaps it was supposed to be just a provocative movie but the violence in particular remains almost unexplained and gratuitous and therefore it can only be considered pure exploitation. Graphic depiction of violence and sex in movies absolutely don't offend me on the contrary if well done and essential to the plot I surely like it but I wasn't very impressed by this one. I mostly agreed with the comment posted on IMDb so I didn't feel any interests in posting another comment since there was not much else I could say. However last week I heard on the radio while listening to a variety program which deals with music and movies that on January 28th Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach Nadine one of the two main characters of this movie took her own life at age 31. A suicide news note is always a sad note but the suicide of a person who has gained certain notoriety usually and unfortunately stirsup a process of exploitation based on bad publicity and I wouldn't be surprised at all if the movie would make another run in theaters and the sales of the DVD would benefit of an important boost. How sad! Poor exploited Karen she surely was a pretty lady and perhaps even a fine person but at age 31 in spite of being still a young woman she already passed primetime which for an Adult Movie Star that's what she was whit 28 pornvids and one mainstream movie also classified as porn in her rsum is just about around that age. The porn industry system is allegedly very cruel and burnsup those girls who decide to go for it very quickly. The competition of new young hungry starlets perhaps became unbeatable and unbearable for her or else... We shall never know why she did it we can only guess she was profoundly unhappy and severely depressed. I wish and I hope I'm not the only one she has now finally found the peace and happiness she couldn't find in life. Karen REQUIESCAT IN PACEM!".

It gleefully fetishisizes violence rape drug use lesbianism domestic abuse sodomy robbery gambling blow jobs punkmusic revenge menstruation patriarchal oppression suicide and your good old fashioned nonsimulated sex. Most of the time the script feels like it's just ticking off boxes on some all inclusive list of kinks. And it's all done for the money shot baby every time. You know why it's porn? It's porn because it shows all of those things in detailed close ups but it has nothing to say about any of them.Directed in a classic DIY style and squarely falling into the New French Extremism movement it was made by twowomen. One a former punk turned massageparlour hostess and the other an exporn star. It features two other female porn actresses massmurdering and fornicating imdb won't let me use the word I want to use across France all in trash aesthetic video and shot in available light. It's a female power fantasy. An act of sexual reclamation that reverses the conversation on gender violence and it's created by actual sexworkers. So that in and of itself is interesting the actual film however is tedious and artificial.At times the movie does seem to show a passing interest in addressing genuine genderwar rage but that's all thoroughly lost in its own appetite for shock imagery and its desperate need to be offensive. I've read interviews where the filmmakers claim the movie speaks to all kinds of social injustices from class separation to racism and I suppose those ingredients are there in the mix but in the end this movie is really only concerned with being more pornography in a porn saturated world.Although the fact that the movie has been banned in several countries including France suggests that it's just the sort of artistic exercise society needs. Sadly. So there's that.If you're into camp actual on camera sex Raffaela Anderson is pretty hot and you don't mind a very intense rape scene why is the sex so real and the violence so cartoonish in this movie? I guess it's a pretty intriguing thing to watch.".

After separately committing murders two French women join together in a spree of crime and sex. Because both have endured abuse at the hands of men the movie seems to start as a selfrighteous parablebut the women's actions quickly degenerate into amoral near random killings with women shot as casually as men. One reviewer described BaiseMoi as Thelma  Louise with actual penetration but it's actually Thelma  Louise without Hollywood sentiment. By refusing to condemn or justify the protagonists' actions and by depicting both sex and violence with unglamorous realism BaiseMoi forces the viewer to respond in the most contradictory and basic ways. You may find the lead characters surprisingly sympathetic. Jarring unsettling and well worth watching.".

One reviewer described BaiseMoi as Thelma  Louise with actual penetration but it's actually Thelma  Louise without Hollywood sentiment. By refusing to condemn or justify the protagonists' actions and by depicting both sex and violence with unglamorous realism BaiseMoi forces the viewer to respond in the most contradictory and basic ways. You may find the lead characters surprisingly sympathetic. Jarring unsettling and well worth watching.";

What I discovered was that the most memorable thing about BaiseMoi was not its graphic sex or violence and there's plenty but rather this strange meloncholy intentional or not that drenches every frame of the picture. Every character in the BaiseMoi is flawed either they are abusive or they are abused victims or victimizers and it's really in the throwaway scenes like when a drug dealing acquaintance of one of the main characters is savagely beaten in an alleyway that BaiseMoi is most effective reminding us of the environment that prompted these women to do what they did.Although the filmmakers have mentioned in interviews that they were just trying to make an exploitation film and had to pull off the intellectual stuff after being threatened with an X rating it's clear that both women one of whom has worked in pornography possess an anger that burns so deep within them that they can't seem to acknowledge it themselves.Ironically there's even a scene in the film where the two antiheroes murder a bourgois psychologist for suggesting that they must have been hurt really bad to do what they do. Well the fact is they have been hurt whether they want to admit it or not. A lot of Baise Moi's energy emerges from this crucial point. The only thing that I didn't like about BaiseMoi was that the main characters were women. Although it's widely accepted that it's daring to show women as victimizers I felt that this device was a bit of a smoke screen. If men were put in the exact same position a la I Stand Alone the film would have been fifteen times more disturbing because it would have been utterly utterly senseless almost to the point of indulgence see Pasolini's Salo.. The fact that the characters are women redeem BaiseMoi somewhat because it's bridging cinematic ground and playing with stereotypes. This sensibility allows Baise Moi's audience to forgive the women a little more than they should.Certainly BaiseMoi isn't for everyone but it is a strong reminder that in this world a little bit of compassion or selfworth goes a long long way. Ultimately like Heneke's The Seventh Continent or Gaspar Noe's  Seul Contre Nous it really ends up asking more questions than it's prepared to answer but in the end it's a better film for doing so.".

Alvin doesn't know exactly what the message means and Edgar Clenteen the U.S. Treasury investigator working the case hopes it will lead to the gold or Jaster's partner Bristol but it does neither. Eighteen months later Jaster is dead and both Clenteen and Bristol are still looking for that gold.

A very tense action scene that seemed well done.Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors  or interesting angles.  Also the film is funny is several parts.  I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. I'd give the film an 8 out of 10.";

Of course the idea is pretty much out there...the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an smalltime thief to lure a more dangerous thiefcomputer hacker out of hiding.  But Alvin Sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while.  Alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a goodhumored but passive or onedimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem.

When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my exgirlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story Alvin SandersJamie Foxx is former convict that is used by a nononsense Treasury agent EdgarDavid Morse as a pawn to catch a killer named BristolDoug Hutchinson. Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fasttalker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be overthetop sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way overthetop but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those movies aren't violent right? Weirdo.".

	schema:reviewBody "...that Jamie Foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful Oscarwinning performance. One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxx's performance in Ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like Bait and Booty Call I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar. If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar I would laugh right in their faces. Who knows? Maybe he's better off sticking to drama because if you watch Bait it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. I swear Jamie mugs so much in this movie that I'm surprised his face didn't fall off. And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart and Steven Wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious. If a joke is funny it's funny. If it's not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. In real life normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips. Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in Taxi Driver it's important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian. A prime example of Jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. If a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? And wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was? There are many scenes like that throughout the film. Another awful sequence is one where Jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent. Not funny! Not to mention Jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. Giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether it's the right time for it or not. I'm not even a big Mike Epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamie's. As a matter of fact this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach. One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. However fellow Green Mile star Doug Hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain. A big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in The Green Mile also playing a heavy. Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like The Replacement Killers and Training Day. Even in Bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. His only problem seemed to be in disciplining Jamie Foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another. Unless you're a diehard fan of Foxx please don't take the bait.".

To make his character a supporting 'hero' effectively makes the following arguments to the audience the validity of which I comment on in parenthesesFor the sake of 42 million dollars of stolen gold government agents may ignore the Constitution of the United States and 1. Torture 2. Deny medical care to suspected criminals 3. Threaten informants with summary execution 4. Fail to advise the accused of their rights and deny access to their attorneys Is there any lawyer there representing the Jamie Foxx character anywhere anytime in this film?  nope. 5. Assault a convict in order to engage in experimentation during consequent surgery 6. Engage in close survey of innocent citizens without warrant including implanted communications and tracking devices wiretapping and audiovoyeurism during suspect's sexual activities 7. Commit to a policy of killing innocent citizens in order to kill a suspected criminal 8. Commit to the intention to kill a suspected criminal without arrest trial conviction or judgment 9. Commandeer the municipal police of NYC without respect to the rights of the state or municipality.ALl this in 2000 before the horrid Bush regime?! David Morse's character needs to be hauled before a congressional committed arrested tried convicted and sentenced to several lifeterm in prison running consecutively meaning one life after another just in case he has several without probation. George Bush too.And since the victim of most of these crimes is a Black man do we detect just a little racism here? only mitigated by outright pandering to potential Black audiences?Disgusting. Burn it. Burn every film like it. Restore the Constitution of the United States including its sacred Bill of Rights!".

To make his character a supporting 'hero' effectively makes the following arguments to the audience the validity of which I comment on in parenthesesFor the sake of 42 million dollars of stolen gold government agents may ignore the Constitution of the United States and 1. Torture 2. Deny medical care to suspected criminals 3. Threaten informants with summary execution 4. Fail to advise the accused of their rights and deny access to their attorneys Is there any lawyer there representing the Jamie Foxx character anywhere anytime in this film?  nope. 5. Assault a convict in order to engage in experimentation during consequent surgery 6. Engage in close survey of innocent citizens without warrant including implanted communications and tracking devices wiretapping and audiovoyeurism during suspect's sexual activities 7. Commit to a policy of killing innocent citizens in order to kill a suspected criminal 8. Commit to the intention to kill a suspected criminal without arrest trial conviction or judgment 9. Commandeer the municipal police of NYC without respect to the rights of the state or municipality.ALl this in 2000 before the horrid Bush regime?! David Morse's character needs to be hauled before a congressional committed arrested tried convicted and sentenced to several lifeterm in prison running consecutively meaning one life after another just in case he has several without probation. George Bush too.And since the victim of most of these crimes is a Black man do we detect just a little racism here? only mitigated by outright pandering to potential Black audiences?Disgusting. Burn it. Burn every film like it. Restore the Constitution of the United States including its sacred Bill of Rights!";

I won't say Jamie Foxx showed the talent for playing Ray Charles but he was okay. He wasn't a complete goofball. If he showed any range at all it came in jail when the other prisoner got sick. If anyone gave a good performance it was the man who was chasing Jamie but I don't remember his name. Quite a disturbing character. Also good the actor playing the government agent who seemed to be in charge.The best thing about the movie was the way it ended. Very exciting with lots of good editing and stunt work. I will say only that this happened at a race track with one rider going against the horses who were in an actual race! It was also exciting the way the FBI was able to keep track of Jamie's character. I don't know how realistic the technology was but it was interesting and the special effects and computer technology were enjoyable to watch.It wasn't the best action film ever but it wasn't complete garbage.".

He's then used as bait to bring down gold heister Hutchinson.While Bait appears to have been meant as a star vehicle for Foxx it makes little use of the actor's comedic charm and instead chooses to spend too much time on its dumb meandering plot.  None of the characters feel genuine cliches abound including an alltoofamiliar digital readout from a time bomb a team of government officials wearing headsets and clicking away at computers who end up look more like Time Life Book operators than agents and a hardassed humorless cop bent on just capturing the criminal. Then there's Hutchinson's cool deadpan delivery as the computer mastermind who resembles John Malkovich not only in appearance but in menace feeling like he was lifted right out of In The Line Of Fire.  None of these things offer innovation and make the movie pretty stale.Jamie Foxx's character is the only worthwhile reason to sit through this pedestrian actioncomedy effort.  He's fun sexy has a likeable air around him and generally gives good comedic delivery.  If you don't like his character at the beginning give it time.  Once gets over on the cops in one standout scene you will.  Jamie Foxx is a star just waiting to be made if only he could be blessed with a good script.  Bait makes little use of his talent but it would be nothing without him.5 out of 10".

You try to be funny but are corny and unenjoyable every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter. Instead I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like Bill Gates and is about as scary as...well Bill Gates. Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work does it? A lawyer maybe but not a gun. Doesn't fit. As for Jamie Foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be actionpacked but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up the tripod for the camera must have been lost for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project and I find myself nauseated and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie but you failed you FAILED YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water no sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again.".

You try to be funny but are corny and unenjoyable every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter. Instead I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like Bill Gates and is about as scary as...well Bill Gates. Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work does it? A lawyer maybe but not a gun. Doesn't fit. As for Jamie Foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be actionpacked but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up the tripod for the camera must have been lost for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project and I find myself nauseated and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie but you failed you FAILED YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water no sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again.";

	schema:reviewBody "I love a movie in which every moment of it feels authentic and Proof is that kind of movie. Critics have had a fairly mediocre response to the film so I was somewhat surprised that I liked it so much. But it's easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.I didn't see the David Auburn play on which the movie is based and maybe many of the film's detractors have screen adaptations of favorite plays often seem to dilute them to the detriment of the story. But if this movie is worse than its stage counterpart it must have made one damn fine play.The acting in this film is its major attribute and director John Madden is wise enough to realize the talent of his ensemble and stand out of their way. He plays a bit with chronology and lets the pieces of his story click into place much like a math puzzle I don't know whether or not this is original to the film or borrowed from the play but either way it works well. But mostly he lets the actors strut their stuff and the four principals make the most of meaty roles.Most of the acclaim has been falling and rightly so to Gwyneth Paltrow who gives a fullbodied textured and powerful performance as Catherine who has inherited her genius at math from her father and is deathly afraid that she may have inherited his madness as well. I don't know that Paltrow has yet had a role as substantial as this one and she flexes her acting chops in a way I have not seen her do outside of her underrated performance in Sylvia. Hope Davis matches her scene for scene as the astringent older sister it's refreshing to see Davis break away from the mousy mealy persona she so frequently adopts and play this crisp overwhelming character. The male actors have less to do overall but the roles are perfectly cast. Jake Gyllenhaal is ripe for stardom and this may be the year that brings it. Anthony Hopkins has been dismissed as hammy here but I think he does an effective job of portraying mental illness and creates heartbreaking moments that could have been ruined had they been played differently.Proof feels entirely honest about the dynamics of dysfunctional families you just know David Auburn is writing from personal experience. Like Robert Redford's Ordinary People if you have any exposure to similar family dynamics you know the team that put the film together got everything just right. Proof also creates a parallel between mathematics and the messiness of life that makes one reevaluate the rigidity of what always appears to be an exact science. As one must accept a level of ambiguity in life one must also be willing to make leaps of faith in mathematics because nothing can be 100 proved. I highly recommend this film. It's satisfying on both an intellectual and emotional level. And any movie that can make math exciting to me gets an automatic thumbs up.Grade A".

It does tend to jump the expectations a bit! There are facets of this story that we have seen on screen before in such fine films as A Beautiful Mind Shine and Good Will Hunting. The topics of brilliance and insanity often overlap in fact the line is often so blurry as to prevent accurate diagnosis. Gwyneth Paltrow is spectacular in her gutwrenching emotional roller coaster of a role. I feel very cheated having read recently that she is contemplating giving up acting to enjoy her life and family. This would be a shame as she is only scratching the surface of her talents and artistry. Teaming again with director John Madden Shakespeare in Love Paltrow delivers an Oscar worthy performance that is emotionally deep and profound. Thank goodness she was selected over the bitter Mary Louise Parker.The assembled supporting cast is impressive in name however Sir Anthony Hopkins is solid but not great in the relatively small but crucial role as Paltrow's once genius then insane now dead father. His influence on her life is beyond question and how she deals is the heart of the story. Jake Gyllenhaal although a fine actor is totally miscast as Hopkins' former student who tries to secure the legacy. Hope Davis is perfect as the irritating sister of Paltrow who has been working 14 hour days for 5 years while Paltrow cared for dear old nutty dad.What prevents the film from being great is that it never decides what it is about. It is a film about a math genius or two but it shows almost no math. Is it a film about genius? Is it about insanity? Is it about caring for an elderly parent? Is it a film of selfdiscovery? All of these are touched on but none are hit headon. It is a fine film definitely worth seeing but it will probably leave you feeling a bit empty.".

	schema:reviewBody "GWYNETH GWYNETH GWYNETH! Not having been overly impressed with any of her previous performances in Proof Gwyneth Paltrow brings a highly emotional nuanced and so finelytuned performance I must say this movie this movie a standout.She inhabits her character so fully I was pulled in and so completely entranced the entire time. In fact certain words or phrases are reused and have an uncanny allusion to when they were previously said. The effect as that you experience and follow the moments and the thoughts of the characters even though they are so deeply imbedded within. I credit Gwyneth and the director with making this work so well. I've never experienced such an organic link between phrases separated in time in a movie before. Wow!This is a movie about how a daughter her sister and a grad student deal with the passing of a great mathematician. While there may be similarities with 'A Beautiful Mind' and even 'Good Will Hunting' knowing there are any such links didn't help me with this movie and I think actually does a disservice. This movie stands on its own. Ignore any such comparisons.Actingwise there were strong performances all around with Anthony Hopkins giving a topnotch performance. Jake Gyllenhaal's was strong but perhaps not to the level of his rather awesome performance in Brokeback Mountain.Good things aside the one thing that irked me about this film was that given the strong link to mathematics how unbelievable some of the dialogue was regarding the 'math. While Gwyneth's and Hopkins' characters pulled off a sense of mathematical intelligence Jake's character hardly said anything mathematically competent and even came across as flustered in expressing himself mathematically leaving me feeling cheated. In my view this is chiefly the fault of the screenplay but to a lesser extent in the actor's portrayal. Ignore this rather small point and this movie passes with flying colours. Q.E.D.".

Not having been overly impressed with any of her previous performances in Proof Gwyneth Paltrow brings a highly emotional nuanced and so finelytuned performance I must say this movie this movie a standout.She inhabits her character so fully I was pulled in and so completely entranced the entire time. In fact certain words or phrases are reused and have an uncanny allusion to when they were previously said. The effect as that you experience and follow the moments and the thoughts of the characters even though they are so deeply imbedded within. I credit Gwyneth and the director with making this work so well. I've never experienced such an organic link between phrases separated in time in a movie before. Wow!This is a movie about how a daughter her sister and a grad student deal with the passing of a great mathematician. While there may be similarities with 'A Beautiful Mind' and even 'Good Will Hunting' knowing there are any such links didn't help me with this movie and I think actually does a disservice. This movie stands on its own. Ignore any such comparisons.Actingwise there were strong performances all around with Anthony Hopkins giving a topnotch performance. Jake Gyllenhaal's was strong but perhaps not to the level of his rather awesome performance in Brokeback Mountain.Good things aside the one thing that irked me about this film was that given the strong link to mathematics how unbelievable some of the dialogue was regarding the 'math. While Gwyneth's and Hopkins' characters pulled off a sense of mathematical intelligence Jake's character hardly said anything mathematically competent and even came across as flustered in expressing himself mathematically leaving me feeling cheated. In my view this is chiefly the fault of the screenplay but to a lesser extent in the actor's portrayal. Ignore this rather small point and this movie passes with flying colours. Q.E.D.";

The script was brilliant and all four actors do a fine job of bringing the story to life. I too saw Mary Louise Parker in the stage version and though I slightly preferred her to Gwynneth the latter nonetheless was fine as the gifted and disturbed Catherine. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal was very good in his role but too goodlooking and hunky to play a geeky mathematician. Compared to the play his relationship with Catherine developed a little too quickly in the movie considering what a loner Catherine had been up to this time. Hope Davis was great as the more normal but controlling sister Claire her second best performance ever after the underappreciated one she gave in American Splendor be sure to rent THAT movie if you haven't seen it and she manages to be more sympathetic than the actress who played her in the stage version. Hopkins as the brilliant mentally ill mathematicianfather was fine though not particularly special in the role.I only have two quibbles. One there was not enough mathematics in the movie OR the play. Everyone has studied advanced math so why not challenge the audience a little more and let us in on what the proof is actually about. It is kind of like watching a movie about a musician and not letting the audience hear any of the music! Two it is not believable that in a crucial scene towards the end of the movie that neither Catherine and especially the more materialistic Claire would not care what ultimately happens to the proof especially when being told of its possible value.Aside from these flaws if you are looking for intelligent fare and a break from mindless action films and the mostly unfunny comedies of the past summer you owe it to yourself to see this film. The theater I saw it in was almost empty so I fear it is not doing too well. Remember that every ticket you buy is a vote for more of that kind of film being made.

	schema:reviewBody "Proof hones in on the emotional relationships in the play. With Rebecca Miller jointly credited with David Auburn on adapting his play this is less coy about who did what to whom when in reality or delusion than it is about connections between people. The flashbacks cut effectively back and forth and smooth out where each character is coming from.Catherine the daughter of a brilliant mathematician who is somewhat modeled on John Nash's struggles with madness which were portrayed in A Beautiful Mind is still the focal point of attention. But with the other characters fleshed out more Gwyneth Paltrow has more to naturalistically react to than the stage actresses I saw it on Broadway with a mercurial Anne Heche. Paltrow brings unexpected fragility to the role and makes her sarcastic accusations to her sister come out of personal pain and not just spitefulness. You really see that she is emotionally ravaged from putting her life and mind on hold for a father with a very strong personality.Anthony Hopkins is unusually paternal as the father and you understand her attractions and fear of him as well as why the sister had to flee how insecure she felt there as Hope Davis manages to breathe some life into a strident character. We see very clearly the demands of being a caregiver to a legend. Unlike in Iris at the end of careers we do ache at the sacrifices the young caregiver has made and how this claustrophobic existence has led to her own crippling doubts about her work her life and her sanity.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hunkiest most adorable rock 'n' rollin' math graduate student since Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting and could help increase math enrollments around the country. But as irresistible as he is and their relationship is literally more believably fleshed out as young people than in the play we also can share Paltrow's suspicion of him. But we see more of his activities as the film opens up the play so we too clearly know before she that he has regained in our credibility as he seeks his proof. I don't mind that the film adds to the romantic aspects and drawn out coda as I thought the play tempted unfulfillingly in that direction and it is a means to help her regain the multiple meanings of proof  as evidence as trust as confidence. Director John Madden keeps the camera moving actively during long dialog interchanges reflecting Catherines agitated state of mind. The house and academic setting well establish the atmosphere particularly when there's more people around though some of the outdoor shots seemed like filler. The score is occasionally intrusive but the concluding voiceover is even more annoying and unnecessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gwyneth Paltrow is a young woman trying to find out who she is in Proof a 2005 film also starring Anthony Hopkins Jake Gyllenhaal and Hope Davis. As mentioned already there are shades of A Beautiful Mind in this story of a formerly brilliant mathematician Hopkins and his troubled isolated daughter Paltrow. The film goes back and forth in time keeping the audience wondering about the outcome of the story.The basic premise is that after Catherine's father dies a student Gyllenhaal finds a notebook among his papers with a mindbending phenomenal mathematical proof. The story goes from there with a subplot of Catherine's sister Claire who is completely divorced from the life that Catherine and her father led wants to sell the family home and bring Catherine back to New York with her. As a further subplot Catherine finds herself attracted to her father's student.Though this is a wonderful film that does not stray too far from the script and the performances are wonderful Catherine's announcement which changes the entire story comes in the play at the end of Act I and produced an audible gasp from the audience. This is missing here not only that the line was changed and almost thrown away. Also at the end of the play Catherine talks about her father in a short emotional monologue  one of the most touching parts of Proof  that is also missing. Of course if you haven't seen the play you won't miss these omissions.Mary Louise Parker originated this role on Broadway replaced by Anne Heche and finally Jennifer Jason Leigh. Catherine fits Paltrow as if it was written for her though she could never bring the quirkiness to it that Parker could. Paltrow shows us all of Catherine's hangups and fears  that she is too much like her father and will inherit his insanity and that if she opens up to someone she will be hurt. Better to dress like a grunge pull your hair off your face slump and fold your arms across your chest than live. With the world she had with her father gone it's time to go out into a new one  but can she  can she accept her own abilities and allow herself to love? It's a beautiful performance highly emotional and compelling. Hopkins of course is magnificent as Robert Catherine's father who in the film is sometimes dead and sometimes alive. You'll have a hard time gaging his mental state because Hopkins gives Robert's character great conviction and intelligence. Toward the end there is a heartbreaking scene in flashback between Catherine and Robert where the audience finally understands what's been going on.Gyllenhaal is very attractive and energetic but doesn't seem quite geeky enough to be a major in mathematics. Hope Davis does a great job as Claire the detached sister who tries a bit too hard and can never be on Catherine's wavelength in fact she seems to doubt Catherine's mental and emotional stability.Truly a lovely film and powerful in its own way. But I can't forget seeing it in a live theater and hearing the audience gasp at the end of Act I. Wish there were a way to recreate that in a movie.".

I've seen criticism of Jake Gallenhaal but as he reminds me of a mathematician that I was at college with he seemed believable to me. The weakness of the film lies in the script and direction fearing mathematics is too complex it was simply ignored  the conjecture that is the subject of the proof central to the plot is never even named!

One of his Ph.D. advisees Hal goes through her father's notebooks to see if there is any great work that has been undiscovered. When Hal talks to her Catherine comes back to the real world. Unfortunately her father is dead. Her sister Claire is arriving from New York tomorrow to help her have their father's funeral.When Hal sorts out Robert's notebooks once again he finds one notebook. He says a proof shown in the notebook can change the entire course of modern mathematics of course if it's true. Then Catherine says that it is actually she who wrote it. But her sister and Jake doesn't believe her. And both Hal and she know that she can't prove she wrote it. Besides people who know what she's been up to for the past two years are never likely to believe that she is capable of writing such a proof.Playing the role of a daughter of a brilliant mathematician is Gwyneth Paltrow. The characters she often plays in movies are mostly elegant women with some makeup on. But this time she is a fragile lonely woman whose father was once a genius but now suffers from some mental illness. And Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job playing this role with little makeup on. In fact her performance is such that you will be not looking at Gwyneth Paltrow as a famous actress but she makes you feel as if she were someone that you know from your college days.It is not just Gwyneth Paltrow's performance that makes this film memorable. The story itself is somewhat original though some people may be reminded of 'A Beautiful Mind.'Comment made by Machousej.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched the excellent local translated production of Proof by the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre I had no idea that this marvellous play was on its way of becoming an Oscar calibre movie although I was informed that it was being played in London with Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role.The movie has stayed very close to the stage version in substance but has been edited in such a way as to make it look less like a stage play. This is not necessarily a bad thing. However in the case of Proof the over fragmentation does take something away from the smooth flow of the narration even though the play also employs considerable flash back. The story takes place in the few days surrounding Catherine's father's funeral but covers events up to a few years ago through something you can interpret either as flashback or simply what goes through Catherine's mind. The first act gives a lucid account of how Catherine stayed in Chicago to look after her father who turned form mathematical genius to mental patient while sister Claire went to New York to seek her fortune working 14 hours day initially to pay off the mortgage back in Chicago how she went to Northwestern to pursue her own studies in the same field as he showed signs of recovery and what a loss she was at when he eventually died without really recovering. During the day of the funeral Claire Hope Davis who has flown in from New York tries to persuade Catherine to go with her to New York while Catherine discovers love with her father's Ph.D. student Hal Jake Gyllenhaal that neither revealed over the last two years. All this is standard fare nice material for a piece of good drama but nothing groundbreaking. Then comes the three little words that ends the first act like a thunderclap. spoilers warning againLet's back up a little. After a wonderful night together in newly discovered love Catherine gives Hal a key to her father's drawer as Hal has been going over his manuscripts with her permission hoping to find that the old man even in his state of mental disorder might have written something that resembles his work of genius at his youth. Down he come later in uncontrollable excitement to the sisters with a draft of a mathematical proof which if what he thinks is checked out is so earth shaking that it will put Catherine's father into an aura of fame he never achieved during the height of his creativity when he was alive. Where did you find it he asked Catherine. She did not find it replied Catherine with an expression that look almost like bewilderment of the question I wrote it. That ended the first act.This critical turning point does not come across as punchy in the movie as in the play but it serves its purpose. With this new dimension added to the already rich material the movie or play compels the audience to marvel at how much it can be aboutIt's about the love between father and daughter. It's about sibling strife that is portrayed realistically and never cheapened. It's about genius and how they are sometimes just ordinary people. It's about mental disorder real and imagined. It's about children's responsibility in caring for their parents in old age and sickness. It's about intellectual property. It's about the world of academics and campus life. It's about romantic love. It's about trust  believing in a person you love. Then there is one key theme which has not been particularly highlighted or may not even intend to be. Years ago a friend lend me a book A mathematician's apology which allowed even a layman like myself to have a glimpse into the wonderful world of elegant mathematical proofs that only a mathematician can truly appreciate. The affecting prose showed me flashes of a world of such joy...a world unfortunately I'll never be able to enter into. In Proof I see glimpses of that world again.Gwyneth Paltrow who took a lot of heat from winning Oscar Best Actress for Shakespeare in love should get another nomination and if she wins again this time it will be much better received. Anthony Hopkins is pitchperfect in delivering the pathos of a mathematical genius destroyed by mental disorder and struck by a glimpse of hope for recovery which is not to be. Hope Davis has a thankless role but gracefully brings life and depth into the role of sister Claire who can so easily be turned into a stereotyped villain. But it's Jake Gyllenhaal who deserves special compliment for taking on a role with nothing to hang on to not even a stereotype and turning it into a real person with passion warmth and weakness. Finally the script is just great as the characters talk just the way people talk rather than deliver smartAlex punchlines every five minutes. Maybe for some movies that's alright. But Proof demands and deserves a lot more.".

	schema:headline " Paltrow Davis and Hopkins barely make Proof an above average film";
	schema:reviewBody "Gwyneth Paltrow plays the daughter of a dead mathematician Anthony Hopkins who finds a groundbreaking mathematical proof in his office and claims it as her own.Math is something I really hate. I have never enjoyed doing it and I just see it as a big waste of time. However that didn't keep me from enjoying Proof. Sure it deals with math and it may seem boring on the surface but the film is actually pretty engaging and interesting. To simply view this film as a boring math movie would be inaccurate since the math is just a backdrop for the film's story. The movie is really about the characters and how they're presented. John Madden does a pretty good job at capturing these relationships. He keeps the film at a slow pace but never too slow that it actually becomes dull.The acting is the best part about the movie and most of the cast give good performances. Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly mediocre as Catherine. She goes over the top in a lot of scenes and she seems to be yelling for no apparent reason. Still an average performance from her is a good performance compared to most actresses. Anthony Hopkins gives a very engaging and convincing performance as a crazy mathematician. He doesn't appear in the movie as much as everyone else though. Hope Davis also gives an engaging performance as Catherine's sister. It's weird that she isn't more famous because she is very talented. Jake Gyllenhaal was a bit of a miscast. He just wasn't very convincing as a math geek but he doesn't ruin the film or anything.A problem I had with the movie was with the character Catherine. She was so selfish and cruel sometimes that it was kind of hard to feel sorry for her. I understand that she lost her dad but her actions were kind of mean. Her sister was trying to help her but Catherine kept insulting her for no reason. Her relationship with her father was a lot better and nicer to watch. It was nice to see that she cared so much about him. Her relationship with Hal Jake wasn't nearly as interesting since they didn't have a lot of chemistry together but it didn't ruin the film either. In the end Proof is a very underrated drama that's worth checking out. Rating 810".

Oh that's in addition to the committed acting and generally good idea.This is story about mathematics actually about mathematicians which is much much better. Beautiful Mind was repellent in a few ways one was in the cartoonish way mathematical imagination was shown. Another was the way history was bent away from a truly interesting story to be palatable for film audiences. Math at that level requires the juice of life that he took in large gulps from both sexes. And he was such a glutton for mindbending adventure that he bent his own mind. I do not believe he suffered from some genetic disease nor did he.This movie repairs some of that. Its clear I think that the Nash phenomenon is at work here minds powerful enough to break themselves possibly leaving some mathematical residue possibly not. The focus on primes may be accidental but it is apt. As time goes on they become increasing rarer and infinitely more fascinating all apparently random but with some hint of unseen order. They don't interest me so much...In fact selecting films to build into your life perspectives and stories to live is a lot like choosing the types of problems to work on and how. The proof of being in a way is that the selection is made deliberately based on your weaknesses not your strengths. Only weak mathematicians and souls work on problems they understand. No life comes from the undaunting. No magic ever comes alone or from peace.Hopkins isn't obnoxious here. Its clear that he is acting and that the lines are those of a stage character. But he doesn't grandstand he's gently broken and there are some sweet moments only two but central where he seems to completely have secondguessed where his daughter is going and lucidly makes key suggestions. Hopkins understood those moments and gives then some significance. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Mindnumbingly trite boring and detached from reality";
	schema:reviewBody "In the first totally boring 40 minutes of this movie we learn that Robert was a mad mathematician in the math department at the University of Chicago but he just died a few days ago and is to be buried imminently. His appearance is brought to us courtesy of flashbacks that run throughout the movie which inform us that his daughter Catherine a budding mathematician dropped out of school to care for him. The movie progresses soon to the funeral where one eulogist says This is the man who at the age of 22 invented the mathematical techniques for studying rational behavior. How impressive. The reality is that a great many mathematicians developed a wide range of techniques that social scientists use to study rational behavior. The writers plainly have no idea who developed any of those techniques or even what they are. Instead they probably heard of John Nash who got the Nobel prize in Economics for his work on game theory. Nash also was nuts. That seems to be the model for Robert.The funeral scene is ridiculous beyond belief and the postfuneral scene outside the church is nearly as bad. Then there's the wake. Complete idiocy. The wake scene is followed by the obligatory bed scene with Catherine and Hal Robert's PhD student which takes place during the wake. Catherine has seen Hal once or twice in the past. She shows him her room which is cluttered with math books that she has read in her spare time when she wasn't caring for her father. Catherine tells Hal he's not boring. Hal is so overwhelmed by such appreciation for a dull mathematician that he is overcome by desire to lay Catherine which he does. Catherine who was so upset during the funeral that she interrupted it with a rambling diatribe now she lets this guy whom she barely knows screw her just a few hours after the funeral while a bunch of wild partygoers are downstairs celebratingmourning her father's passing. After consummation with Hal still on top of her and apparently still inside her she breaks down in tears. Only in Hollywood could someone come up with such garbage.Then there is the dialog the next morning. This isn't worth going into in detail any more. Let me just say the dialog is utterly childish. So here we are over 40 or 50 minutes into the movie and nothing interesting or credible has happened.At this point Hal is looking over some of Robert's copious notes that Catherine has shown him. He is thunderstruck at what he sees declaring It's a proof. Er I think it's a proof. If it's what I think it is it's a major breakthrough. A proof of something mathematicians have been working on for centuries...Blah blah. No clue what that something might be undoubtedly because the script writers wouldn't know addition from subtraction much less what to say about an important problem in number theory. Then lo and behold Catherine tells us that she not her father did the proof and wrote the notes that her newfound lover Hal is talking about. She who has not been to grad school yet. But don't forget she reads math on the side. She also worked with her father. So at 27 with no formal training she solves the great prime number puzzle of all time. All this is coming out in the hangover everyone is in the morning after the big party at the wake and the gripping bed scene. Are you getting the idea just how stupid this movie is? By the way it has to add ridiculous political correctness to an already ridiculous plot. In the entire history of mathematics not one major theory not a single one ever has been proved by a woman. Yet here we have an untrained dilettante figuring out a result that has puzzled great mathematicians for centuries. Why didn't they make her a bisexual transgender just to round things out? Unfortunately Catherine's handwriting is nearly identical to her father's so lover boy Hal and Catherine's witchsister Claire doubt that Catherine did the work. Such drama! Incredibly gripping! Catherine cannot understand why lover boy Hal he of the onenight stand just the night before cannot believe that she did it. After all the notes are in her father's handwriting. Catherine replies that her writing just happens to look like her father's. Later after reading over the notes lover boy Hal informs us that he has changed his mind. He adds that the handwriting problem is illusory because sometimes children have similar handwriting as their parents especially if they spend a lot of time together. Every mathematician knows that right? The subsequent banalities and foolishness spew forth in seemingly unlimited supply.One last thing does require comment. This movie indulges itself in the usual and grossly wrong view that all great mathematicians and scientists are crazy. In this movie both Catherine and her father are disturbed to say the least. The reason everyone especially those who don't know anything about mathematics thought A Beautiful Mind was so good is that the main guy does a great mental thing even though he is nuts. Believe it or not that sort of thing is the exception the very rare exception not the rule. Yet in this movie not one but two main characters are nuts and also happen to be brilliant. That's the only way that the shallow ignoramuses who write this drivel THAT's who wrote it can understand people with the intelligence insight knowledge and imagination to do something original they must be crazy because they aren't like Hollywood script writers.This movie is a tedious boring uninsightful routine and warped exercise in Hollywood's perverted indeed depraved view of the world. It is in a word terrible. If you have any brains at all you run the risk of losing them if you watch this silly movie.".

	schema:headline " Better than the first movie? You betcha!";
	schema:reviewBody "First everyone should watch this movie with the mindset that this is a filler episode but one of the best filler episodes you'll ever watch.The storyline is very good. I like how they referred to the past you have to watch bleach seasons 13 especially how the soul society acted toward another potential traitor after Captain Aizen and Captain Gin Ichimaru. Second the first five minutes already intrigue you as you are trying to figure out the value of the Ouin. I love stories that have a mystery aspect to it. Third the character depth is great. It's good to get more of a background story on certain characters especially on Soul Society captains like Tshir Hitsugaya and even more about Ichigo. The animation is crisp clean and very good. In fact it's even better than the first bleach movie.The music is good and on par with the series. It's good to see the musical score is creating new music yet keeping the same feel. The action was amazing especially the final fight. It felt epic and was executed perfectly. Overall it's a great movie and the best filler episode in that sense. All of the reasons why anyone wouldn't like the first movie are corrected in the second one. Would i skip Bleach's first movie? Maybe. I would definitely just watch this one after seasons 13. Then again it is after season 6 so why they released the second movie before the actual release of season 6 box set is beyond meso for a fan keeping up with the time line you might be wondering how did X get this or when did X happen. But it's not as bad as you think. You can still watch it and enjoy it as long as you are up to speed with seasons 13. If you are done with seasons 13 as well as the second movie and really have no other Bleach to watch i suggest watching the first movie afterwards and the bount arc. Otherwise watch this one first and continue on to season 6 or vice versa.".

	schema:headline " Much better than its predecessor and a mustsee for Bleach fans.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of the Bleach manga and a moderate fan of the TV series except the filler sagas. This review assumes that people are familiar with the Bleach manga and or TV series.Today I watched the English dubbed versions of both The Diamond Dust Rebellion TDDR and Memories of Nobody MoN. I have already posted a review of MoN and the reason for that is a lot of reviewers seemed to be letting their Bleach fandom prevent them from actually thinking for themselves and accurately reviewing the movie. People were blindly giving 910 or even 1010 to a film that would be unlikely to score 510 from any critic. When I came to watch TDDR I was desperately hoping they had recognised their previous errors and put a bit more effort in this time around.As luck would have it they did.The biggest improvement over the first film is the screen writing. The plot has far more depth and is actually interesting. Where the first hour of MoN nearly put me to sleep TDDR is actually entertaining outside of the fight scenes. The plot isn't perfect by any means but it's definitely good enough to stop me complaining about it. Sure the dialogue is still pretty cheesy but anyone who watches shows like Bleach will tell you that you have to take it with a pinch of salt. Also TDDR is a lot more polished than MoN in terms of attention to detail. All the little bits and pieces that make a movie seem more realistic were really lacking in MoN. This is difficult to explain without using an example from the movie so for once I'm going to use one but avoid plot information. When Renji needs to speak to Rangiku the chance passing of Shunsui means he and his lieutenant Nanao are then present during their conversation. While the important conversation goes on between Renji and Rangiku the focal point for the viewer Shunsui sits silently on the step beside them with his hat in his lap he rarely removes his hat even when fighting. He has done this out of respect because one of the characters is in a sort of mourning period. When important information is divulged during the conversation Shunsui begins absent mindedly twirling his hat around in his lap his expression unchanging. This shows that he is thinking about what he just heard and formulating a plan however he still looks like Captain Cool  Shunsui in a nut shell. My point here is that although Shunsui is not the focal point of the scene details have been added to make him seem more natural even though most people won't notice although this particular example is more obvious than most hence why I can remember it lol. This is important because the more natural a scene is the easier it is for you to place yourself in that scene and become absorbed by the story.Another thing that sets TDDR apart from its predecessor is the way they have integrated the popular minor characters into the story. In MoN it was obvious that it was very high priority to make sure all the most popular characters were featured in the movie to make sure the fans were happy however because the script was so halfbaked they ended up throwing them on screen with almost no explanation and it all seemed a bit silly. In TDDR they've still managed to feature all of the popular characters they've made their appearances seem like a natural progression of the story and yet they have done this without actually having to weave them into the main plot in any great detail look at Kenpachi's entrance in MoN then look at his entrance in TDDR for example.The voice acting in the English dub of TDDR is top notch.Right. Now to the bad points.There are two major problems with this movie as far as I'm concerned the first and most important of which being the animation. Maybe I'm just imagining things but slightly more care seems to have been taken with the animation and drawing just for the fight scenes but even so they are still well below par for animated films. This shows that the people behind TDDR were still not prepared to expand their market beyond existing Bleach fans which is a pity because this movie was good enough to do it.The second problem is the music. At times the music in Bleach is so cheesy it makes me cringe. I can't believe no one has walked into the board room and said Hey guys has anyone realised how stupid it is to use a song with penetrating high pitched vocals as a background track for fight scenes? Not only does it detract from the action and fail in its role as background music but the song we're using sounds like a bad '80s electropop track that never made it out of the garage. Maybe we should hire a sound guy or something?Regardless The Diamond Dust Rebellion is worth watching even if you're not an existing fan of the series although I would recommend watching the first one or two episodes as the movies take a lot for granted. I've given it 710 but you can add an extra 2 points to that if you're a fan of the series.".

They assist the captain Hitsugaya who is in charge of the transportation. Yet somewhere in the background comes an ambush. Losing the seal Hitsugaya takes it upon himself to track down the enemy and get back the Kings Seal even while injured. In the middle are his Vice Captain and various other friends who are trying to look for him because of an order of his execution by the high commander of soul society. Within the struggles a substitute Shinigami Kurosaki Ichigo looks for him as well. Finds him injured and tries to understand why Hitsugaya is taking the burden on himself. The twist in the film is moving because of the thief of the seal was also a ex classmate of Hitsugaya in his academy days. But because both harnessed the same power his superiors demanded they fight to the death to see who attains this power only. Hitsugaya won by proxy yet felt his fight was not over. This being included was a good finish to having both fight once more without the orders of his superiors to see who was the ultimate warrior. And after the thief harnessed the full power of the seal became more crazy and nearly obliterated soul society but Ichigo and his friends prevail saving soul society once more.

A zanpakuto is the shinigami's soul how you get a soul of a soul is beyond me.... Third I thought that Isshin said that Arrancars were really weak before Aizen started using the Hogyoku so why were two normal Arrancars able to wreak so much havoc? So overall this was a pretty good movie just with some huge flaws. I'd recommend this movie to any Bleach fan diehard or not.

Everything about the movie is really well done. The story keeps you gripped the entire time and you will wish to see more when the credits start to roll.Definitely check this out whether you are a big Bleach fan or haven't dabbled in the series yet. It's a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first feature length animated project based on the popular Shonen Jump manga proves to be a forgettable and redundant entry into the Bleach anime franchise. Instead of weaving an epic tale that would be a crucial turning point for the beloved Bleach characters and do justice to a heightened moviestyled animation budget the production team decides to churn out what is in essence an extended TV series episode in which rather conveniently thanks to a plot twist nothing that happens in this movie has any place or effect in the main anime storyline. One could easily find a better way to spend 90 minutes and not miss a thing.The story begins during a routine Hollow hunting when Ichigo and Ruika encounter strange spirits know as Blanks. Initially confused by their sudden appearance the plot thickens with the appearance of a mysterious new Soul Reaper named Senna who quickly befriends Ichigo. Slowly the nature of Senna and the strange appearances of the spirits are revealed culminating with Ichigo and gang having to stop a age old feud by a group of Soul Reaper exiles who intend on destroying the world and the Soul society.Face it Bleach Memories of Nobody is just an extended filler episode of the popular Bleach anime series. None of the characters get any further development and the cast of new characters do not add much to the soup. Senna especially was no doubt written to be a spunky yet likable girl with a carefree outlook on life but thanks to either the script or the seiyuu Japanese voice actress she comes across as quite an irritant with her sad back story feeling forced into place to milk a few tears from the audience. Thankfully the returning cast from the TV series all deliver some adequate performances that fit their character personalities.note i have only watched the Japanese version thus far but i hear that the English dub has had much positive receptionDespite having a movie sized budget the animation still suffers from the same flaws that plague the TV series. Stiff character motion flat backgrounds and frequent use of lazy looking animation shortcuts make this movie look even more like a glorified episode of the TV series. There are even a couple of scenes with very obvious offmodel or disproportionate character art. Along with the overly bright cheery color scheme and minimally detailed artwork the only improvement there is seems to be a greater usage of CGI for some backgrounds and special power effects.Unless you are an existing fan of Bleach this movie would fail to satisfy. As if the story were not confusing enough No introductions or exposition is given hence newcomers would find it really difficult to watch this show and understand the various terms and Bleach lingo. As an anime movie the production standards are subpar and the story is plagued by some pacing issues. Top it off with one major copout endingno it was not all a dream but it is something close to that and what you get is one major disappointment.Basically if you thought the TV series was good Bleach Memories of Nobody would not change your mind but neither would it be increasing your impression about Bleach as a whole. If you thought the TV series was not up to expectations this movie would only prove you right once more as you will find the same flaws here. A real treat for hardcore Bleach fanatics and a real let down for fans of good anime movies.".

	schema:headline " Good Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The bleach movie is basically a long filler episode but nonetheless a good filler episode.First off the animation is superb. I disagree with what critics and others are saying that the animation backgrounds are stagnant and characters look stiff. The animation backgrounds are the best i've seen so far in the bleach series and characters look fluent and move even more realistic. Second the soundtrack and voice actors were also great. It's great to hear the familiar voices and music that make Bleach so good.The only two problems i really have are the characters used and the storyline. Basically it's almost the same problems i had with the bount storyline.The storyline seemed intriguing in the beginning because you really are trying to figure out this mystery of what blank souls are. Then we find out it's some evil clan that was banished who wants revenge on the Soul society. It's disappointing that there was no plot twist. That's bad for either a bleach fan or a non fan because it just looks too simplistic. Evil clan wants to destroy good clan because they were banished. That's it? Yup that's it. Other parts were a bit confusing and some parts could have been cut out.Second i still don't see the point of throwing in certain characters. Granted obviously Ichigo and Rukia are a must for the whole movie but was Izuru Kira or any of the other soul society Lt's needed? What about Chad or Orihime? Nope not necessary since they really didn't do anything. Again as a fan i appreciate that they tried to throw in familiar faces but again i would not throw in a face if they don't even matter.Lastly of course the big problem with filler episodesmovies is character attachment. Granted i did like Senna but ultimately we all knew she wasn't going to be around. Neither were any of the Evil ones.So basically we knew they would no longer be seen in any form in the main bleach storyline. Overall though i still give it a 7 because as much as the storyline and characters could be flawed from a pure entertainment value it did it's job. I liked that the Evil ones would be killed quickly instead of being long and drawn out like the bount storyline. I like that Senna had enough backstory for you to care about her but not too much that you wouldn't get attached and be completely bummed out that she was never in any other Bleach story. Finally i like that the storyline was simplistic to follow and not a convoluted dragged out mess like the bount storyline. Strait and to the point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just quickly I think it's relevant to say that I'm a huge fan of the Bleach manga and a moderate fan of the TV series except the filler sagas. This review assumes that people are familiar with the Bleach manga and or TV series. I would advise against watching this movie if you're not.You know the great thing about making a movie follow up to a TV series or movie that is already popular? You can put in a fairly minimal amount of effort and still be guaranteed to make at least a decent amount of money so long as you've conducted enough market research to give the fans of the original what they want. I watched the TV series until half way through the bount saga then stopped and started reading the manga because the series had become slow moving and unimaginative. I subsequently found out that the bount saga wasn't part of the manga a filler saga and was made to make money rather than for the sake of art. Memories of Nobody is basically the same thing a 90 minute filler episode. Memories of Nobody is not a complete waste of space though. The voice acting in the English dubbed version which I'm reviewing is quite frankly excellent. The plot  while inferior to Tite Kubo's masterpiece  is better than what you'd get from a lot of action movies and fits with the tone of the TV series without clashing with it.And what about the characters? Joining Ichigo and Rukia is a third main character  a mysterious young girl named Senna. Mysterious young girls in anime?!? No way!! Senna is a hyperactive demiloli who runs around giggling and annoying Ichigo. She is given a sob story background to try to force an emotional attachment from the viewers but unfortunately that's about as far as the character development goes and so she's very one dimensional. This means the character really isn't believable which means we don't get the emotional attachment which means we fail to care. Ouch.All the most popular characters from the series make appearances which should make the fans happy but they haven't gone to the effort of properly integrating them into the main story and so they just end up feeling like cameo appearances you're guaranteed to make money so long as you give the fans what they want remember?The movie could have should have built upon the series by riding it's strengths while providing better quality animation and getting rid of the supercheesy music but the animation quality hasn't noticeably improved and they've kept the same cheesy music from the series. It has its good points and bad points but all the bad points easily outweigh the good ones. For example It's a Bleach movie! YAY! The animation is TV series quality! BOO! It's got Kenpachi in it! YAY! The main character is about as deep as a puddle! BOO! Etc.Basically Memories of Nobody only ever aspired to provide a pleasant experience for the existing Bleach fans and because of this it was never going to be a great movie in it's own right. Even for fans of the show this is definitely rent before you buy material.".

	schema:reviewBody "There seem to be a huge important place for Japanese animation in today's world market. By now they have built a very solid interlinked set of creative industries and successfully spread them to a global scale. That industry has 3 vortexes comic books TV animation series and films. The safety net for such an industry is that as with Hollywood's bad films there seems to be a hard core vast group of fans who will turn to these products and hysterically support them no matter what the product is. Well the thing is they would be careful if they want to stay in business for more than a few years that strategy ask Hollywood wears out unless quality is taken care of.I saw this in a kind of discreet student's moved session where some of the hardcore blind fans were present.Knowing the comics and the series seems to en richen the experience of this. I didn't know any of them. But that allowed me to understand how poor minds of dire fans work as they weaved and clapped at things only because they knew it from the series while the scene in itself was completely uninteresting.The thing here had some legs to walk. The idea that memory creates time and fills space and having none is wandering with no objectives in an uncertain land with an uncertain fate. In other words the idea that having a past can create your future.But they were only interested in exploring the movements the fights and the cool side of having handsome characters with big weapons and big powers.this probably has the same visual aspect of the TV series unless the series production is rather poor.My opinion 15 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

By now they have built a very solid interlinked set of creative industries and successfully spread them to a global scale. That industry has 3 vortexes comic books TV animation series and films. The safety net for such an industry is that as with Hollywood's bad films there seems to be a hard core vast group of fans who will turn to these products and hysterically support them no matter what the product is. Well the thing is they would be careful if they want to stay in business for more than a few years that strategy ask Hollywood wears out unless quality is taken care of.I saw this in a kind of discreet student's moved session where some of the hardcore blind fans were present.Knowing the comics and the series seems to en richen the experience of this.

Therefore they are to be congratulated and supported for showing minor gems such as 'Honey' Bal.A small number of films have been applauded for stripping down both pace and cinematic frills to convey a way of life. Literally any slower and we'd be in real time! Italy's 'A Tree of Wooden Clogs' is a famous example which understandably divides opinion quite severely.It is almost incidental as to whom what and where 'Bal' is set and about. It will obviously appeal to those who prefer the organic side to things in life whether in nature lifestyle or in the cinematic process. Bal covers all these to a generous degree.Yes it features throughout a six year old stammering Turkish schoolboy  Yusuf  not particularly photogenic or cute or naughty or anything. Just an everyday kid who has a beekeeping father who doesn't actually keep bees. Well not in any one place  he places the hides in remote and beautiful areas and then extracts the honey. His quite young looking dutiful mother picks tea.I feel quite privileged to have been given a beautifully often exquisitely photographed study of this life and taking up just two hours of my own life. I learned much and there is a quiet story in there somewhere  you can make of it what you will it's almost unimportant. Or is it?I turned my hifi amplifier up quite high when playing the film's sound through it and would strongly suggest you do similar. The all encompassing natural sounds are so well recorded every nuance and snippet of sound help paint a very vivid sonic picture. You could almost close one's eyes and listen to this on its own. Almost uniquely and thankfully you won't have to suffer a sudden booming beat or great crescendo of added noise to make you jump out of your skin. It would sound great with headphones too I'm sure as long as you have a stereo source of course.Personally I always find it comforting when a film involving a child features a good teacher. We all know and recognise one from our own childhoods  Yusuf's teacher is measured and fair calm and patient rewarding good work dissuading bad. These scenes were an absolute pleasure.Apparently this is the final part in a trio of films by Turkish writerdirector Semih Kaplanoglu though chronologically it is the first part. Naturally now I want to see the other two parts 'Egg' and 'Milk'. I'm hoping that Film 4 will be showing these too at some point.".

	schema:reviewBody " THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS  I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about this movie. It won the Golden Bear in Berlin but first it's a German coproduction so who knows... and second festival winners are not always the movies that bowl me over.After having seen it I must say that I am very touched. The reviews about the movie always focus on the beautiful and calm storytelling and the awesome Anatolian landscapes. But in my view it's primarily a chamber play with a quite depressing story. The young boy Yussuf suffers from strong stuttering. The only person he opens to is his father a beekeeper. Only with his father the boy can communicate he whispers complete sentences and expresses his feelings. At the end of the movie the son will realize that his father died in the woods the last screen showing the child sleeping under a giant dark tree.The acting from the boy is superb. There are many heartwarming scenes especially when the boy sees his mother crying and drinks a cup of milk what he normally hates to do looking hopefully at her afterward as if his selfconquest could change anything about the cruel situation. In this scenes the movie really manages to take us into the child's world.What makes the movie a little irritating is not only the slow rhythm that helps to create those reallife magic moments and the very few dialogue but also the lack of emotional gestures especially between Yussuf and his mom. If the director of the film would have been let's say Michael Haneke it would surely not be interpreted as a hymn to natural life but as a sober analysis of failed communications.Finally if you generally do not like slow and minimalistic movies don't watch this one. It's breathtaking slowly and very many and very long scenes will only show the boy looking around an empty room with big eyes. All in all Honey is a naturalistic child drama offering enough space and time for free associations and deep feelings. It's surely recommendable to watch it in a cinema. Although it's overall great done you might not stay awake until the end when lying on a soft couch at home.".

He is at odds with his school life never fitting in amongst his peers constantly watching them from a distance along with struggling in parts of his studies. When Yusuf stutters through a reading in class minimal techniques are used only the camera slowly tracking towards Yusuf and multiple POV shots of school peers focusing on Yusuf in awkward silence contain the scenes vibe yet it strikes such an impact emotionally feeling Yusuf's embarrassment. Whereas watching Yusuf with his Father in a simple static shot as they work and explore in the local woodlands shows his deep connection with nature by knowing the names and mannerisms of various plants it is wonderful to witness the bond the pair have and to feel Yusuf's tranquillity. The techniques used to capture these moments are simple yet effective showing the brilliance of Bal.Bal contains strong visual elements not only in the minimal techniques used to capture Yusuf's story but in the compositions which are styled with outstanding detail. Yusuf sat alone in a barn facing the camera in mostly dark lighting to inhabit his depressing mood before the head of his Father's donkey appears from behind Yusuf to provide comic relief convey his mood in the same manner a later dream sequence. After his Father goes missing Yusuf begins to have haunting dreams one of which is himself stood alone in the forest with the visuals being one of a greyish palette before dead bees drop into his hand as a foreboding of his Father's death.In a way it is hard to describe Bal as a film because its much more. Bal is a piece of visual art that transcends from its quiet storyline to present the atmosphere and emotions embedded in Yusuf's life as well as those around him with striking use of compositions and ingenuity. Bal is not a viewing experience for everyone only those who appreciate the visual sophistication celluloid can offer will be moved by this film.".

	schema:headline " Memorable Depiction of a Way of Life Under Threat";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in the Black Sea area of Turkey BAL is a vivid depiction of village life under threat. Yakup Erdal Besikcioglu tries to make a living collecting honey but finds that there is no money in it. He travels to another part of the region in search of better prospects but meets a sticky end. His fellowvillagers eke out an existence through traditional pursuits such as ropemaking but they cannot really survive. The main focus of the action is on Yusuf Bora Altas a young boy who feels unable to communicate with the outside world possessed of a stammer he is frequently laughed at by his classmates. The only was he can survive is through dreams of a better life  whether it be in the Black Sea region or as symbolized by the elements such as the moon. The cinematic style is slow with plenty of long shots allowing viewers to contemplate the characters' reactions within the frame. However director Semih Kaplanoglu uses this style to make an acute commentary on a declining way of life as well as showing the ways in which children are often forced to do things they don't want to both at home and at school. A complex film that befits repeated viewings.".

Maybe the whole 'boy who never speaks but whispers occasionally' thing should have added some feeling of intrigue on the part of the viewer. That did not really work for me as it was just annoying to watch the little brat stare in the distance 50 of the movie and never respond to any questions whatsoever  never interact with anybody. The pacing of the movie was painfully slow. I have nothing against movies where not a lot happens but this was just across the line of where entertainment ends and torture begins. Also the supposed 'symbolism' wasn't able to catch my interest disappearing honey oh how witty never ever heard about the whole men vs. nature bs before. However if you liked the movie 'Stellet Licht' which I found to be nearly equally bad as this one then you may also like Bal but why anybody would do so is beyond my comprehension....".

You are convinced that making such a movie has lots of difficulty involved and this mere fact evokes feelings of respect for it within you. Nevertheless respect does not automatically bring the status of being good to it. Especially if the movie attempts to give almost all its messages through symbols looks and constantly rotating camera scenes another difficulty is brought up which in turn gives rise to evoking feelings of respect for it within you again. This time the source is the fact that you feel ignorant to decode those messages. In addition watching Bal is like viewing a Discovery Channel documentary in that the movies presents lots of scenes of both natural and manmade surroundings. However there is a clear difference between the Discovery Channel documentary and Bal as the events made up of messages in the movie are not coherent and form a congruent story. At the end of the movie I wanted very much to have conversations with the Jury in Berlin to have a glimpse of what they had thought in honeying Bal with a prestigious award.".

The film attracts my attention because it is simply real life and all you see might be happening at the same time somewhere in north of Turkey. i am glad to see that this kind of films are still being made i wouldn't like that all directors go for Avatar2012inception or such films which have 80 computer technology. This film is a real escape for everyone who is bored of watching what is more popular nowadays in cinema. The film is very slow like the nature itself in the film for me there is no point in settling down the cameras and microphones in the middle of nature and record it for documentary of course the remote controller is set to national geographic but not for a film. but this film is made of 80 nature and its quite awaiting for the eternity. some of you even could easily fall asleep when watching which is i think not the aim of the director Kaplanolu. There are no any hit quotes in mutual dialogs very simple and unfortunately without the accent of this region it may seem nothing for a foreign watcher but its very bad for a Turkish one. Also personally the festival in a large valley towards the end of the film destroys the quiet and dreamy atmosphere of the film. There are some symbols in honey dead bees etc but these are a little bit meaningless without some very powerful quotes. The father erdal Beikiolu is a right choice but i cant say the same thing for the mother. The acting of Yusuf the boy worths watching. And there are very nice scenes showing Yusuf is waiting for his father. But please let's be realistic anyone who goes to the same district with a handcamera could have some nice shots whether or not he is professional. For me the main actor in this film is Nature.But i would like to thank to Kaplanolu who give it a chance. Watch it but never watch it because it won the Golden Bear.".

We realize the difference very clearly when the mother takes Yusuf to an older neighbor to take care of him before she goes to search his husband. The neighbor is a native of Black Sea region and speaks Turkish with a flawless Black Sea accent. Another problem in the film was that Yusuf can sometimes read and sometimes not. He can sometimes speak and sometimes not. I have not heard any illness as 'sometimes speaking and sometimes not'. What is the point in it? It was very annoying to me and the whole plot was about that. There was no particular subject. The scenes are very long and dark as if it were an horror movie but it was not. Maybe they tried to create another Haley Joel Osment but without any acting and concrete plot you can not do that. In my opinion it is a very boring film.

Maybe they tried to create another Haley Joel Osment but without any acting and concrete plot you can not do that. In my opinion it is a very boring film. I really wonder how it received the Golden Bear.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about the daily routine of a simple rural Turkish family a father who collects honey for a living a mother who works around the home and a child who goes to school. The story is told from the perspective of the child a young boy. Daily routine is the key phrase here because this is exactly what you see. Nothing particularly eventful happens until towards the end of the movie. So basically you watch the kid going to school and at school the father going to work and at work the mother working around the home harvesting or cooking. Interspersed among this is the occasional meal at table with modest conversation and interaction and some brief father and son time around the home. That's it.The only drama or suspense for most of the movie concerns the difficulty the boy is having learning to read which threads throughout the film to the very end. What I've described would be completely uninteresting told from an adult perspective. So it's the boy who is carrying this movie cute kid. It's his perspective which is very serious and thoughtful that holds your attention any length of time. But we are to be honest not only interested in the boy's character in the film but also the boy playing the character himself. He is impressively disciplined for someone that young. But even the greatest actor needs something to work with besides daily routine which I can see anytime I want to by looking out my window. So I did zone out after awhile No I don't do drugs! near the middle of the film somewhere.One of the noteworthy and curious things about the movie is how subdued this family is disciplined even. There are no great expressions of happiness or sadness for most of the film. There was the brief smile once in awhile but that's as far as it went a serious expression on all faces dominated throughout. So I didn't get the impression that this was a particularly happy family. But at the same time I didn't feel that it was out of the norm either. So maybe they were happy or at least content in their own way. Finally I did not like the way the movie ended for principally 2 reasons 1 This is a simple hardworking family that did not have that much and did not seem all that happy to begin with. 2 The movie again was pretty uneventful as described and so the only way it could possibly sustain your interest from beginning to end is if you like this family. I did. And so for these 2 reasons Boloxxxi felt like he was kicked in the nuts by the writer. A plague on the bastard! Love Ironic aren't I? Boloxxxi.".

This is definitively not your regular entertaining popcorn  flick that you can go and watch with your buddies on a Saturday evening  before you start your tour through the bars.  It's even not the right movie to drag your new girlfriend to in my  opinion. There IS a chance that she will like this kind of arty stuff  but there's a bigger chance that she won't.  OK let's unfold this a little bit. What I liked about this movie is  that it's painting quite an interesting portrait of the pristine  Karadeniz people in north Turkey. But then again This could have  been done in a much more original way. The few introduced characters  are too simple for my taste and they don't feel real. I'm a Turk myself  and I have travelled many places in Turkey ... and for me it just  doesn't add up to a realistic picture.  Some of the shown landscapes and locations are really gorgeous and  fantastic  that's for sure. But most of the time I couldn't shake off  this feeling that I'm watching a terribly slow slideshow of somebodies  last summer vacation.  The story is thin and fuzzy ... I really wanted to like this film. And  I also don't think that I'm an idiot who just didn't see the point.  If you have read other positive reviews about Bal before let me  tell you Yes it is a moving story of a child and his father. But it's  also a VERY VERY slowly moving story. In fact sometimes it's hard to  tell if anything on the screen is moving at all. For minutes. And  minutes.  That's not my understanding of entertainment or how movies should be  done. This could have been a great short movie. 15 or 20 minutes. Maybe  30. Enough time to tell everything that was important in this movie in  my eyes.  I went to a theatre here in Germany to see Bal  together with my  parents my father is 73 my mother is 62  And I'm 35. We were all  more than willing to give this film a chance. My father was even a  little bit angry when some woman left the movie after half an hour or  so. But when the credits finally rolled in we made our jokes about how  clever that woman was  leaving in time.  OK so why did I give it 5 stars? Here's my explanation 1 Star goes  for the nice locations and some of the impressive pictures. The second  star would be for making a movie about a slowly vanishing lifestyle and  habitat. And the last two stars are for the two tears I secretly shed  during the film one during the scene where Yusuf finally get's his  award for reading and the other one when he's drinking his milk to  cheer up his mother. The fifth star is there because I'm a Turk and I  don't want to feel like traitor.   No honestly. Many people really seemed to enjoy and love this movie.  I'm just stating that it's not quite my cup of tea. BUT... If you also  tend to be bored easily prefer entertaining movies over arty dramas  and if you think that a movie is called like that because it has  constant movement in it ... then this movie is probably not for you.  On the other hand It has won an important award in Germany and it's  definitively something different. If you're unsure you should wait  until it's out on DVD or Bluray so you can skip the long scenes if  needed.".

It is what I call a film with many flaws that ultimately manages to make such an impression that one can't help but feel compelled to praise the film enthuiastically even though one might sympathize with its' detractors. I call it The Last Tango in Paris effect. Much like that film's director Bernardo Bertolucci Ali Ozgenturk is a realist director whose films often feel like documentaries. He gained notoriety with At The Horse almost two decades ago. Other than BekciThe Watchman few of his films have reminded viewers of his initial artistic success. Balalayka is that reminder though. It is a story which is at the very heart of today's Turkey a country and culture which has always been affected by the geopolitical changes around its' borders. The fall of the Soviet Union and the impending economic struggles of the Russian people has actually lead to many Russian immigrating to Turkey a country where more people tend to leave the country as my father did for work outside. And alas many Russian women have fallen into prostitution rings which manipulate their need for economic gain. The film also shows the role of family in Turkish life and how that infastructure so absent in the West especially in America has allowed for people to go on with their lives in spite of adversity and tragedy. Kemal Sunal the great Turkish comic actor who died suddenly as he was set to go to Trabzon the Black Sea region to star in this movie is a figure who will be a hero of Turkish cinema for many years to come. It is hard to say that anyone can replace him but in this film Ugur Yucel does a tremendous job in his place and in the process he manages to equal Sunal's last film appearance in the great Turkish comedy Propaganda. I hope with the arrival of UzakDistance in U.S. theaters next year there will be a renewed interest in Turkish cinema. It could allow more people to view films like Balayka and applaud them for the fact that their artisitc merit empahtically surpasses whatever technical deficiencies one may see in such films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is about three Turkish brothers fulfilling their father's dying wish  to bring back the remains of his old buddy from Russia back to Turkey. This is just the premise to get the Turkish characters to take the bus home with the coffin. On that bus they will meet and fall in love with a bunch of Russian women who are making their way to Turkey to work in prostitution. All THIS is contained in a flashback which starts the movie of one of these woman who ended up staying in Turkey.The group of women is very diverse and yet  a few of them seem to know Turkish rather well which makes the situation seem contrived. In this respect the movie is quite silly to begin with and the transitions between the languages for the nonRussian and nonTurkish speaker may seem seamless but they are one of the things that hurt the film's credibility. It's as if the whole setup was meant to create the situation  get 3 Turkish guys with a bunch of beautiful Russian women and get the story going from there without taking into account at all almost any language barriers they do exist in one couple's case though.The gallery of characters is rather interesting but it is never explained why the women are forced to work as prostitute in Turkey. The mafia people who handle their transport are mean people sometimes depicted in a ridiculous way especially when they demand that a woman who works for them and is helping her cousin to get to Turkey to get a new prosthesis will hand the poor girl to them as one of the prostitute. It's not even clear if theact of bringing these women to Turkey is illegal or not.Once the bus crosses the border and the band gets stuck is some hole in the mountains the story starts to fall apart with numerous mistakes of continuity and plot. It just goes downhill from there till the silly and unconvincing ending. Individual characters are sketched rather well but any character interactions after that tends to be simply dull if not really stupid. I'll point this one as an example All the women are intrigued by the oldest brother  a guy of 55 or so  instead of his rather handsome little brother of about 27. The character is a real bore and lacks any charisma that might have been included in the script.As a whole the movie is not a good one and does not get above 410. It's not a real bore though so if you want to get some folklore you may get that in the bus scenes.".

How to steal a million is not as well known as her early works Roman Holiday for example or as well regarded as Breakfast at Tiffany's Considered her Signature role but it is far and away her best comedic work.The casting for the movie was very good. from the principals down to the supporting cast. Notice especially the casting of Hugh Griffith as Charles Bonnet in the role of Audrey's Nicole's errant but very endearing Papa The interplay of those two Characters together with her scenes with Peter O'Toole as Simon Dermott Society Burglar  Private Investigator  Love Interest secured to my mind at any rate the movie's success. In addition notice also the performances of Jacques Marin and Moustache as the museum security guards. Both of these turned in terrific work in supporting roles as did Charles Boyer in his all too brief appearance as the art Dealer DeSolnay. The sole weak point was I believe the casting of Eli Walach for the character of Davis Leland. Though his performance was adequate he was not the best choice for this character a role that was originally intended for George C. Scott. In Summary The casting was wonderful The characters were believable Principals were excellent together and the dialog was brightsophisticated and did I mention? FUNNY! Conclusion This is one my favorite movies. I have watched it repeatedly over the years and it never fails to makes me laugh. So If you like to laugh and especially if you're a fan of either Audrey or Peter then this movie is a musthave. I rate it 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trio of William Wyler directing Audrey Hepburn as a charming French woman in need of help and Peter O'Toole as the dashing fellow who agrees to commit a crime for her seemed at first glance to many film aficionados to be potentially a fine partnership for making a winning comedy. How to Steal a Million in fact turned out to be atmospheric very French very sophisticated and a great deal of fun. The clever story and screenplay by George Bradshaw and Harry Kurnitz worked almost everywhere I suggest. Some of the film's humor seems obvious to methe use of rotund Gallic comedian Moustache borders upon parody at times but this is a fundamentally lighthearted romp of a film from its flimsy but serviceable premise to its satisfying romantic conclusion. It is a comedy and it turns upon O'Toole's ability to devise a means of stealing a wellguarded art object from a major French Museum a physical feat which he proves to be quite capable of achieving. The reason he is asked by Hepburn to plan that robbery is that the lovely statue now on display is about to be examined and authenticated by expertsand her father created the work as he has created so many others his charming and adroit forgeries. There are several other currents at work in the plot as well there is a U.S. buyer after the piece Hepburn 's belief that her champion is a crook turns out to be an unfounded assumption and he is falling in love with her as she is with him throughout the unfolding of actions and events. The production is expensivelooking but never heavy in feel to my way of thinking. Givenchy did Miss Hepburn's gowns Charles Lang was the cinematographer and the production design by Alexander Trauner and the bubbly music by John Williams both served the story very strongly. In the cast O'Toole and Hepburn seem perfectly mismatched she is a bit inconsistent I believe not knowing how old to play her part O'Toole is intelligent and plays both a crook with a sense of humor and a romantic admirer of Miss Hepburn's very successfully. Her father who proudly but inadvertently loans the piece to the Museum and misses the clause relative to its being examined by experts is Hugh Griffith who suggests as much as he blusters. His likability is the key to the plot because if he were not talented and likable and worth saving the viewers would not accept the storyline'e basic premisemuch ado to save him. Eli Wallach is bright as usual as the obsessed wouldbe buyer others in the cast include Charles Boyer Fernand Gravey Marcel Dallio Jacques Mann the aforementioned Moustache and Roger Treville. The film is often discussed as if it were a trifle a cinematic glass of champagne and a delightful and only a bitoverlong comedy. the attitudes expressed miss the three points of the film...It is noir since the police cannot be brought into the case it is comedy which means its tone of lightheartedness and clever dialogue is very often exactly right and its subplot is adventure a very daring and ingenious combination of psychology physical paraphernalia and enjoyable suspense. It is wellliked by many and as a writer I am certainly one of its admirers..".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are searching for a movie with wit charm and delightful comedy in it you've found it. How to Steal a Million is perhaps one of the finest Audrey Hepburn's films around. It's the story of a reclusive though slightly devious painter and forger Hugh Griffith Charles Bonnet who aside from his practice of recreating masterpieces and selling them to eccentric private collectors decides to donate a priceless but fake sculpture from his private collection to the La Fayette museum to be viewed by the general public. Not wanting to lose it to theft without compensation the museum insures it for 1000.000 dollars. However the insurance company wants it appraised to see if it's genuine and calls in an expert who will use modern techniques to ascertain it's authenticity. If it's discovered to be a fake the painter his reputation and his family will be ruined. Thus his beautiful daughter Nicole Audrey Hepburn must hire master bugler Simon Dermott Peter O'Toole to steal it from the heavily guarded museum. At the same time she is being pursued by Davis Leland Eli Wallach an American millionaire who wants to marry her. What neither Nicole nor her father suspect is that Mr. Dermott is more than a shy bugler he too is interested in the painter's secret hobby and his daughter. Excellent film for the family. ".

It's the story of a reclusive though slightly devious painter and forger Hugh Griffith Charles Bonnet who aside from his practice of recreating masterpieces and selling them to eccentric private collectors decides to donate a priceless but fake sculpture from his private collection to the La Fayette museum to be viewed by the general public. Not wanting to lose it to theft without compensation the museum insures it for 1000.000 dollars. However the insurance company wants it appraised to see if it's genuine and calls in an expert who will use modern techniques to ascertain it's authenticity. If it's discovered to be a fake the painter his reputation and his family will be ruined. Thus his beautiful daughter Nicole Audrey Hepburn must hire master bugler Simon Dermott Peter O'Toole to steal it from the heavily guarded museum. At the same time she is being pursued by Davis Leland Eli Wallach an American millionaire who wants to marry her. What neither Nicole nor her father suspect is that Mr. Dermott is more than a shy bugler he too is interested in the painter's secret hobby and his daughter. Excellent film for the family. ";

	schema:reviewBody "As a comedy caper film How to Steal a Million is just about perfect. The premise sets it up An art forger Hugh Griffin allows the prize of his collection  a Cellini sculpture by the forger's father with his mother as the model  to be exhibited in a major Paris museum. His daughter Audrey Hepburn who resembles the grandmother who modeled the Cellini nude engages an apparent cat burglar Peter O'Toole whom she caught in their house trying to steal a newly painted fake Van Gogh to steal the Cellini before it can be examined by experts for insurance purposes and exposed as a fake. The burglar actually a detective specializing in exposing forged paintings agrees to undertake the theft having fallen in love with Ms. Hepburn's character. That part is easy to understand because Ms. Hepburn is at her peak in this film gorgeous and sparkling. The theft is executed ingeniously using a boomerang to set off the alarm system that protects the sculpture bringing the museum guards and police from all over Paris to the Museum and disturbing important people who live close to the Museum. The alarm goes off twice resulting in chaotic but fruitless searches of the Museum and  having heard twice from the important personages the chief of the guards eventually shuts down the alarm at which point O'Toole's character also at his handsome peak purloins the statue which is then smuggled out of the building by Ms. Hepburn in the bucket she is using as a disguised scrub woman. In between Hepburn and O'Toole are hidden in a tiny closet rubbing up against one another and Hepburn realizes that O'Toole is stealing the statue only because he has fallen in love with her. There's an important subplot A wealthy and unscrupulous American collector Eli Wallach who already owns several of the forged paintings covets the Cellini and romances Ms. Hepburn in order to get close to her father eventually forcing an engagement ring on her which she accepts only because she is in a hurry to get to a crucial meeting with O'Toole at the Paris Ritz. Eventually O'Toole gives the statue to Wallach just as he is leaving France attaching the engagement ring to a ribbon around the statue's neck. Charles Boyer also appears briefly in the film as an art dealer with whom Wallach had previously worked. This plot with some changes in detail might have served as a serious caper film along the lines of Topkapi but it is a pure comedy from beginning to end. And Hepburn O'Toole and Griffin play their roles as if born for this purpose. Wallach and Boyer are good and two of the guards are splendid. William Wyler's direction is impeccable. If you admired Ms. Hepburn and O'Toole at the peak of their physical attractiveness and their acting prowess this film is a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "HOW TO STEAL A MILLION is a romantic crime drama film which through an illusion of fiction merges art and fraud. A clumsy fraud mixed with a pleasant romance can quickly enter in our hearts.Charles Bonnet is wellknown as an art collector but actually he copies famous works of art. His daughter Nicole disapproves his work and is also afraid that he may get caught. His replica of a famed Cellini sculpture is inadvertently displayed in an art museum and he begins to worry that he'll lose his reputation once the experts evaluate the statuette. Nicole decides to steal sculpture from the museum with the help of a mysterious burglar. However her assistant is actually a wellknown private detective who investigates frauds of her father...A simple story with lot flaws is enriched with a very thrilling twist.

In other words you can watch it and enjoy this simple and wellmade film just for the shear pleasure of watching fine acting and extremely wellcrafted dialog. Of course the acting of Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole was topnotchthis didn't come as any surprise to me. However the supporting actors really helped this film to be an even better film. Eli Wallach was cute as a rich and eccentric American but even better was Hugh Griffith. He played the most delightful and watchable crook I can remember seeing in quite a number of years. He actually made being an art forger cute he was that funny! My wife and daughter I noticed laughed whenever he appeared in the film and my daughter said she loved Griffith's insane eyes.Apparently the old rogue Griffith was so brazen with his forging that he loaned a local museum a forged statue to be the centerpiece of a major exhibition! And when insurance appraisers announce that they want to take the statue off display to appraise it for insurance purposesand Audrey is afraid they'll discover her father's fraud. So she uses her ample charms to convince O'Toole to help her steal with fake. That's really all there is to the basic plot but HOW the plot unfolds is simply marvelous!".

The film has a nice bubbly feel to it that really helps cover how slight it is.  The plot really sort of drags along at one point but for most of it it does have a slight energy.  The romance between the two leads is a little unconvincing but is helped by the charm of the two of them.  The actual robbery is light but amusing  nothing like the usual hitech robbery in these caper movies but it is enjoyable nonetheless.O'Toole is on good form in a witty role that he seems to enjoy doing. Hepburn is not as good as in other films and she suffers from the lack of material.  The two together are good and have a nice chemistry that really saves the film.Overall this is an enjoyable film.  It may be very slight but it has a nice energy that makes it a quite fun movie to watch.  Only the sudden rush of plot towards the end make it feel a little heavier.".

What we end up with is William Wyler's film drearily playing out in that way bad American genre films set abroad usually Europe often do in that wearisome highly romanticised languid way  How to Steal a Million essentially a film about crime and stealing but crime and stealing done so through a filter of glitz as a funny sexy glamorous and somewhat raucous activity in which both pretty and handsome people such as O'Toole and his costar Audrey Hepburn may play characters whom plan and pull off a perfect heist whilst fall in love in the process.Here Hepburn plays a Frenchgirl named Nicole Bonet the daughter of an equally French forgery artist named Charles who's played by Hugh Griffith  a Welshman doing one of those often unfunny mockFrench accents Brits usually come up with when trying to pass off as French. Together they are a family unit of two living in their nation's capital Charles a man whose work is dedicated to that of making likeforlike copies of long since lost but not forgotten painting masterworks of centuries old  forged works of which then go on sale and fetch a hefty price for their sudden reappearance. Nicole's thoughts on his line of work are best captured in a reaction of illsorts as she drives to their home in a quaint little automobile and hears a radio broadcast announcing the latest of Charles' sales. She speaks once at their illgotten mansion of a home and once inside his secret workshop hidden away through a wardrobe compartment of her disdain at such activities later to be placed in an agonising scenario we do not fully feel the frayed dynamic of when she is forced into confronting these ethic prejudices if it means loosing contact with her father through his imprisonment.Trouble rears up when Charles tries his hand at stepping away from paintings and forging statues instead specifically a certain piece known as the Cellini Venus and of great value  something that is executed sought after boxed up and then shipped off for an auction. All is well until it's revealed a hardnosed expert in statues is being called into authenticate the Venus  a man of such immense stature that he will run several tests we're guaranteed will see through the fake because he was the guy whom invented them. The statue faces examination in its locked up position in a nearby museum Charles faces prison and Nicole faces loosing him. Enter O'Toole's lightfooted British burglar Simon Dermott a man whose interplay with Nicole begins when he breaks into their home when he is consequently matched by Nicole and her willingness to provide him with a gunshot wound if needs be. Given Dermott's expertise and given the Bonet's situation we're hardly gasping in either disbelief nor surprise when Nicole hits upon the idea to employ him to steal the thing from the museum so that no authentication may take place.The leads don't' have long what with the expert arriving in mere days the raceagainsttime element to proceedings barely registering in what is an often lethargic excursion of a film depicting people in bright Parisian parks and frothy exchanges between those destined to connect. In truth the central partnership between O'Toole and Hepburn doesn't really register their exchanges are a tad annoying and he is the one driving proceedings with Nicole's presence essentially seeing her tag along for a bit and bleat now and again  bleating which begins early on in the film with exasperated cries of Papa! and carries through with various instances of moaning and such as they conspire the big theft which drives the final act.Inexplicably plopped into proceedings is Eli Wallach's superfluous American art collector character a certain Davis Leland. We often observe Wallach play his roles with a smirk and smile a cheeky grin running in perfect tow with the boyish enthusiasm he always seems to bring to a character  even if it's someone we're not necessarily supposed to like. Here he is just grating and his scenes with Hepburn are not so much banal as they are excruciating in their backandforths. Disapointingly Wyler paints an image of Wallach as a representation of the epitome of American Capitalist wealth and greed what with his affluent dress sense and unhinged excitement at the prospects of being near or indeed getting his hands on the statue itself. It is a crass enactment matched by that of Dermott who's the suave British male and then later on by that of several French security guards at the museum itself of whom are clumsy and whose general buffoonery on their night shifts sees them drink red wine and eat baguettes in between pausing to make us laugh. The film is a mostly nullified experience tame and unremarkable we find it difficulty to entirely get behind the characters feel moved by either of their arcs nor indeed get excited about a final act driven by an ongoing heist sequence with a great deal at stake.".

Disapointingly Wyler paints an image of Wallach as a representation of the epitome of American Capitalist wealth and greed what with his affluent dress sense and unhinged excitement at the prospects of being near or indeed getting his hands on the statue itself. It is a crass enactment matched by that of Dermott who's the suave British male and then later on by that of several French security guards at the museum itself of whom are clumsy and whose general buffoonery on their night shifts sees them drink red wine and eat baguettes in between pausing to make us laugh. The film is a mostly nullified experience tame and unremarkable we find it difficulty to entirely get behind the characters feel moved by either of their arcs nor indeed get excited about a final act driven by an ongoing heist sequence with a great deal at stake.";

I find myself remembering scenes and images and in the days and weeks that follow I enjoy revisiting my memories of it and pondering the quirks of characters the mind of the characters and the intent of the director. There aren't any big emotional payoffs or any neat plot twists. Dialogue that seems nonsensical trivial or awkward turns out to be easily related to overarching themes as the movie unfolds and rewinds in my mind's eye. Or maybe it's all just a big steaming pile of pretentious nonsense too twee and too precious for its own good. I can't decide. I can never decide. I remain baffled and frustrated but something about them keeps me coming back.I have GOT to get off this train said the stewardess Rita. The train is the biggest metaphor bigger even than the pile of Louis Vuitton luggage the three brothers played by Adrien Brody Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman drag all over India in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and a return to being brothers they way they used to be. One suspects that they never were the way they used to be.Peter cannot let go of his father who died in an accident he witnessed and who he was not able to save. He carries around certain personal objects that do not fit him or are outdated like talismans. Meanwhile he is terrified of becoming a father himself. Francis survivor of a motorcycle accident that has left him wrapped in bandages wants the brothers to become close but constantly annoys both of them with his fussy overbearing controlfreak ways. Jack pines for a girlfriend he can't leave or who won't leave him and of whom his two brothers disapprove. Meanwhile he has casual sex with Rita with no more real forethought than he applies to slugging down narcotic cough syrup and pills of unknown provenance just to make his surroundings more interesting and to take his mind off his exgirlfriend.But the brothers' most profound source of unhappiness is that their own family has failed to live up to their image of what a family should be. This longing for an idealized family and parents is a major theme in Anderson's movies. They resent their runaway mother who did not show up for their father's funeral they squabble over who should have possession of their father's belongings.It is a bereaved Indian father who gives Peter the absolution he craves not his brothers or his mother. Francis finally removes his bandages and lets his younger brothers see his wounds both emotional and physical. Jack is the only one who seems largely unchangedis this because the actor was a cowriter? It must be very hard to write for yourself.All this makes it seem a serious movie which it is not. There are two good hearty laughs to be found in it and many wry smiles. The brothers are exasperating and shallow at times even petty and yet you find yourself liking them all the same. I found these characters to be intriguing. Peter seems the most outwardly normal but he has the strangest quirks. Francis is oddly sexless almost monastic. One suspects he may very well end up living much as his mother does. I kept waiting for him to make some comment about his scarring and how it might affect his romantic life but he never did. Jack is highly sexed yet seems uncomfortable in his body hiding behind his little porn star moustache. He yearns to be mysterious and exotic or a romantic expatriate artiste but when he attempts to act as such it just comes off awkward and forced.Owen Wilson is an actor I've never had a whole lot of use for but I must admit that he was very good in this movie. He brought a sweetness to a character who could have been simply annoying. Adrien Brody was fine as Peter. His character had to display the most emotional range and was also the most physical with some episodes of good slapstick. Anderson clearly understood Brody's strengths and made them work. He and Wilson were effective in scenes together and had the chemistry of real brothers. I was less impressed with Jason Schwartzman. I have liked him a lot better in other movies. I felt he was overshadowed in this film whenever he had to go up against Brody and Wilson despite being given the funniest lines. He did well in his scenes with Rita.Wes Anderson's movies have been criticized for being too white too rich his main characters usually don't have money worries Max Fischer aside and for having a void in the center. I think setting this movie in India with all its beauty and diversity and having some of the strong supporting characters be Indian helped with the whiteness factor. But to criticize movies like this for having a void in the center kind of misses the point. His movies are about the voidthe one that exists between people who yearn for that sense of connection. And the best way to bridge it is to stop taking yourself so damn seriously.".

	schema:headline " Anderson hits it big with offbeat quietly affecting effort";
	schema:reviewBody "Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson it should come as no surprise that his latest film The Darjeeling Limited demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction arguably Anderson's strongest work to date. The typically disjointed plot details three brothers Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman who in an attempt to bridge the gap between them embark on a spiritual journey across India by train. Of course considering Anderson's tendency towards offbeat comedic situations and a series of problems involving Indian cough syrup a poisonous cobra and pepper spray the journey does not of course go as planned and the brothers are forced to cope with their increasingly difficult situation and each other in turn. Do not mistake the film for the conventional road trip buddy comedy it may appear to be  Anderson is far too eclectic and clever to subscribe to such traditional fare and his film is instead a far more emotional effort. With a particular knack for intricate character and storyline development Anderson's script carefully doles out tidbits of character history throughout painting a gradual and remarkably detailed portrait of the central characters as the film progresses. Though the film may drag or feel as if it falls slightly short of its true potential at times on the whole it is far to easy to be swept up by the film to dwell on such minor concerns. The gorgeous Indian scenery is captured with particular affection by Anderson's jarring cinematography and sharp eye for intriguing colour schemes. The film's wonderfully fitting soundtrack perfectly compliments the sublime visuals making for one of the most aesthetically pleasing films in recent memory. The central three actors are the real draw of the film and all three boast excellent chemistry throughout. Owen Wilson as usual is effortlessly funny as spiritually obsessive control freak Francis but also brings a tragic undercurrent to his character made more poignant due to recent real life events out of character. A superb Adrien Brody steals the show as the emotionally unstable soon to be father Pete demonstrating both previously unseen comedic abilities and genuinely affecting emotional clout. As bitter writer Jack Jason Schwartzman proves proficient at raising many a laugh but despite his strong performance is easily overshone by his two costars during the film's dramatic moments. Watch also for amusing cameos from Bill Murray and Natalie Portman featured more significantly in the film's 13 minute prequel found online at www.hotelchevalier.com and a somewhat forced supporting role from Angelica Huston near the end. Like the rest of Anderson's other work audiences will likely either love it or hate it. This is not a typical belly laugh evoking comedy laSuperbad  the humour present is more sly and chuckle worthy and prides itself more on precisely crafted characters and situations than sight gags and one liners. Those willing to appreciate the film for what it is will enjoy an intelligent and touching spiritual meditation on family and life in general. The joy is in the journey and a journey as quirky and sentimental as this is one easily worth taking  for those willing to put forth the effort to overcome mainstream expectations the film will not disappoint. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson it should come as no surprise that his latest film The Darjeeling Limited demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction arguably Anderson's strongest work to date. The typically disjointed plot details three brothers Owen Wilson Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman who in an attempt to bridge the gap between them embark on a spiritual journey across India by train. Of course considering Anderson's tendency towards offbeat comedic situations and a series of problems involving Indian cough syrup a poisonous cobra and pepper spray the journey does not of course go as planned and the brothers are forced to cope with their increasingly difficult situation and each other in turn. Do not mistake the film for the conventional road trip buddy comedy it may appear to be  Anderson is far too eclectic and clever to subscribe to such traditional fare and his film is instead a far more emotional effort. With a particular knack for intricate character and storyline development Anderson's script carefully doles out tidbits of character history throughout painting a gradual and remarkably detailed portrait of the central characters as the film progresses. Though the film may drag or feel as if it falls slightly short of its true potential at times on the whole it is far to easy to be swept up by the film to dwell on such minor concerns. The gorgeous Indian scenery is captured with particular affection by Anderson's jarring cinematography and sharp eye for intriguing colour schemes. The film's wonderfully fitting soundtrack perfectly compliments the sublime visuals making for one of the most aesthetically pleasing films in recent memory. The central three actors are the real draw of the film and all three boast excellent chemistry throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "When deciding whether or not to see this film the question is very simple Do you like Wes Anderson's previous work? If you answered yes to this question you will adore The Darjeeling Limited. If you answered no you'd better spend your money elsewhere. I personally fall very deeply into the former category. I've always been a huge Anderson fan and adore all four of his previous efforts and this certainly ranks among his best top three easily. This is a much more guided inspirational and personal work from the man. While his other features have been more minimalistic and set between a certain group of characters Darjeeling takes on a much larger world.The story is about three estranged brothers Francis Owen Wilson Peter Adrien Brody and Jack Jason Schwartzman. About one year ago their father died and they went their different ways. Of course nothing can start off too happy in a Wes Anderson world. Francis attempted suicide the irony is painful Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice who he always thought he would divorce and Jack is trying to get over a rough break up some inside jokes for those who have seen Hotel Chevalier are included. Francis decides to reunite these brothers on a spiritual journey across India via train and everything happens to go horribly wrong.The chaos that ensues is quirky hilarious and utterly perfect for fans of Anderson like myself. The performances from the three leads are brilliant particularly Adrien Brody whom I thought was going to be out of his Oscarwinning element but actually fit in so well that I preferred him to the rest of the cast. There is a huge turn into a more somber mood about halfway through that brings up memories of Luke Wilson's big scene in The Royal Tenenbaums nobody tries to commit suicide mind you and the film picks up on the dramatic sentiment before jolting right back into the uniquely brilliant world that always keeps my sides in stitches. The man's genius is as strong as ever. This may be his best film and it's certainly his most poignant.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Darjeeling Limited is unlike the average comedy. While not being truly laugh out loud funny the film is clever well written with memorable characters and one liners that grow wittier over time. The only type of movie it can be compared to are other films by Wes Anderson the director of Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums and the love it or hate film The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. All of his movies are extremely stylized with slow motion sequences wide lenses that slightly distort the frame and privileged depressed characters with family issues all thrown together in a slightly artificial timeless carefully detailed environment. While with The Life Aquatic he may have tried to do too much The Darjeeling Limited shows Anderson finally perfected his style. He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans while keeping his stories fresh and personal without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.The film is absolutely engaging from the very start with a hilarious memorable cameo by Bill Murray trying to catch the Darjeeling Limited train in slow motion yet is outrun by Adrien Brody's Peter to the tune of The Kinks' This Time Tomorrow one of the three Kinks songs in the film all are accompanied by slow motion sequences. Brody Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson play the three Whitman brothers Peter Jack and Francis. Wilson's character has organized a spiritual journey through India with his brothers who have not spoken to one other since their father's funeral a year ago. Performancewise the standout is Wilson in what might be his best role yet. Owen Wilson seems to play himself in all of his other movies with Wes Anderson being the only writerdirector to truly know how to use his talents. The characters begin to realize that one cannot force a spiritual journey no matter how many temples visited and organized rituals performed for brotherly bonding as printed on a laminated itinerary. The bender that results is a ridiculously entertaining blend of comedy and drama successfully aided by Anderson's great choice of music and colorful dynamic cinematography.Extremely recommended viewing other than Anderson's previous efforts before watching this amazing film is Hotel Chevalier a 13 minute short film directed by Anderson and starring Jason Schwartzman available for free download online through Itunes. In the film Schwartzman plays the same character that he plays in The Darjeeling Limited. Also starring is Natalie Portman as Jack's exgirlfriend who makes a brief cameo in the feature film as well. The short film helps establish Schwartzman's character and provides clues on certain details of The Darjeeling Limited. Also a couple of funny moments in the feature wouldn't make much sense without seeing the short. The emotional yet blissful experience that is The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's best film thus far defeating Rushmore for that top spot.".

The three main character's adventures seamed apart from their stupidity straight out of a puberty driven boy's daydreams including conquering princesslike Indian girl servants  rescuing kids of a village from a bridge destroyed by the power of nature encounters with poisonous snakes and tigers romantic dates on a Paris rooftop etc.All boring I hardly laughed once. A film which deepens stereotypes and which is a loss to everybody who is expecting a somehow intelligent or funny film!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is really a stinker. Everything is good about it except the characters and the writing. It has high production values the acting is very good but the characters are shallow narcissistic and nothing more than sum of their hangups. It's like some teenage film school freshman was given unlimited resources to try to create the most quirky characters ever without a story to hang it on. Perhaps it's how a spoiled rich teenager would imagine adults to be selfish whiny demanding and spiritually hollow. The three brothers are riding a train in India in hopes of finding and visiting their mother who failed to show up at their father's funeral. We are treated to a relentless display of the brothers' bizarre and exhibitionistic behavior as the train trundles through the Indian countryside. They behave like chronically depressed 4 year olds. Maybe the filmmaker thought he was getting at contemporary angst maybe he just thought he was creating amusing madcap clowns in the spirit of A Hard Day's Night. But these clowns aren't young their antics don't amuse they grate. We come to hate them as much as they hate each other. We don't care whether they find their mother or not. The older brother's head is always swathed in bandages the result of a motorcycle crash which may have been an attempted suicide. He orders the other brothers around and they seem unable to stand up to him. One brother reads a couple of paragraphs from a story he's writing. The story is as shallow and pretentious as this movie and these characters. Here's the spoiler they do meet up with the mother Angelica Houston who's the biggest narcissist of all. Dressed in white robes and made up with black eyeliner she holds forth in some sort of Christian mission in the foothills of the Himalayas. Well you might have known it...these losers were nurtured by this pompous and vain woman. No wonder. In the end the brothers are running to catch the train to go home as they run they drop their baggage. That's symbolism get it? They're shedding their baggage right? But these characters are so light you can't imagine them having any hardly weight at all even with their baggage. Without the theatrically contrived baggage they wouldn't have any material existence whatsoever. For the last hour of this film every scene looked like it was going to be the last. The camera focuses on the bewildered faces of the brothers the music swells the camera pulls away. At last! you think. It's finally over. But no there's another scene and another and another. At one point they witness a young boy drowning in a canal. They try to rescue him but can't. They take his body home to his village. There is a funeral. The scene is empty it's like it happens in dream. The brothers appear unaffected. It is impossible to care about them. I've almost forgotten about this movie and I only saw it 2 days ago. Please save yourself the boredom.".

India itself is only used as a colourful backdrop and there are only so many slow mo soundtrack scenes one person can bear.The film is a mish mash of some of the worst metaphors that I have seen in any film EVER. When the three brothers finally discover themselves they literally throw their 'baggage' away as they run for the leaving train in slow mo whilst some music is playing i might add aarrrrgh!. I can't remember the last time I've seen something as laboured as this trying to pass itself of as something interesting and multi layered.If i had a De Lorean i'd hit 88mph go back to the point when i first decided that i wanted to watch this atrocity and say to myself don't do it trust me i'm you from the future and i've seen it.A complete waste of time.

However I find that these little flaws add to the charm of the film because of the way it is constructed and written. It almost feels like one is part of the journey and since no journey of this sort is perfect or fully enjoyable it's almost fitting that this film isn'tI laughed out loud more during The Darjeeling Limited than during any other Wes Anderson movie although Rushmore is probably more of an outright comedy. This screenplay wasn't written with Owen Wilson as Anderson instead chose to team up with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman for this project presumably due to Wilson being too busy to do it. The result is a slightly inconsistent and as mentioned before heavyhanded screenplay but one with loads of delicious irony wit and dry humor. It's great stuff really. There is a lot of depth to be found here as well especially with Anderson's use of recurrent imagery in the film. There is perhaps more maturity and understanding of human nature here than in any previous Wes Anderson films.The acting is once again topnotch here from Brody Wilson and Schwartzman and Anderson's use of music is again incredibly fitting and beautiful while also being perhaps less frequent and distracting than his other films allowing less room for accusations detractors frequently make that Anderson is nothing more than a glorified music video director. Also of note while discussing music is the use of various Satyajit Ray compositions in an acknowledgment of one of his cinematic idols and main inspirations not only for this film but in general.The Darjeeling Limited demands multiple viewings. It is a rich complex detailed and gorgeous film which is a unique and fascinating look at some familiar thematic material recurrent in Anderson's work.

On this journey through India these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman played by Jason Schwartzman staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman.

Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.This very cheap selfindulgent film was a further extravagant means of introducing another member of the Coppola family into the film business in the Family Nepotism tradition.This film was written and produced by Roman Coppola and his cousin Jason Schwartzman along with Wes Anderson who directs the film he directed the Royal Tenenbaums. Owen Wilson and Adrian Brody play the other two brothers. The film is stupid and tells us nothing about the human condition other than extremely rich trendy men can make short films at the drop of a feather.".

It's the kind of film that Americans who have never been to India might enjoy but for anyone who loves and knows the country it's quite another matter.It's hard to warm to any of the characters  they are a series of quirks rather than real people eg Jason Schwartzman doesn't wear shoes for some unfathomable reason. In particular it's not so great to watch bland unlikeable Americans going to India to 'find' themselves when the film is so uninterested itself in India. Here it is nothing more than a colourful backdrop. Anderson clearly cares for it so little that a scene supposedly taking place in the foothills of the Himalayas was clearly shot in Rajasthan. For those of you who haven't been the foothills are about as dissimilar from Rajasthan as Montana is from New York. They are a world apart.The film is laden down with some of the worst metaphors that I have seen in a supposedly 'intelligent' film. When the three brothers finally discover the real meaning of life they literally abandon their baggage  they dump it on the station platform! It's a long time since I've seen something as laboured as this.This film is cultural appropriation of the worst sort.".

While I love both of them I occasionally wish that Tim Burton would make a film that wasn't some kind of Gothic fairy tale or that Paul Thomas Anderson would make a film that didn't star his own ego. With Wes I want him to just continue what he's been doing keep using his same awesome style while taking baby steps of progress.

	schema:headline " Saying yes to everything or trying to anyway";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing to note about Wes Anderson's new film featuring Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody as the Whitman brothers Francis Jack and Peter respectively is that it was shot in India mostly on a colorful old train traveling across Rajasthan. The train perhaps replaces the elaborate constructed set of the ship Anderson used in 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.' That ship was a bit of an albatross. The movie cost 60 million to make and is Anderson's least admired work. The train is part of a faster and cheaper production and it's crucially different it's a real train in motion during the shoot. It's still perhaps an arbitrary and whimsical setand has the kind of bright pastel colors Anderson likesbut this time as Brody has said about the shoot they were learning to live in the moment just letting things happen and using whatever they observed of Indian life as elements in the film. Every time they turned around there was something unfamiliar remarkable and new to see if they could they worked it in. This isn't navelgazing though there's that but also discovery and wonderment. It's partly a homage to Anderson's fascination with India and admiration for Jean Renoir's 'The River' and the films of Satyajit Ray. The soundtrack isn't just sweet Seventies rock but music from Ray's classics.Every Anderson film is about families and his crew and casts are like family this one is mostly of course about sibling relationships. Wes wrote the screenplay together with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman who're both cousins and old friends of hisand hence like brothers paralleling the film's three. They also went to India and took a trip before the writing living the experience before they made it into a screenplay.'Darjeeling's' trio of obviously privileged sons have been estranged for a year since their father's deathwhich their mother Patricia Angelica Houston now in a convent near the Himalayas chose not even to attend. There's a flashback of the brothers en route to the funeral with Barbet Schroeder as a German mechanic. Francis the eldest has summoned Jack and Peter to this Indian train voyage as a way of bonding and at the same time seeking spiritual enlightenment.But before we get to that there's a kind of pendant called 'Hotel Chevalier' which sometimes will be shown with 'Darjeeling' sometimes not. It's a tenminute film with Jason Schwartzman and Nathalie Portman. And it's a perfect little film in its way. Schwartzman is already Jack though the film was completed a year earlier. He's enjoying solitary luxury in a nice Paris hotel when his girlfriend Portman also estranged turns up. Jack who likes to go barefoot and wear expensive suits is a writer and this sequence comes up in 'Darjeeling' as a short story he's working on. 'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the fulllength film and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'Everyone is damaged. We know how actually damaged Owen Wilson is from the news of his recent suicide attempt and Anderson's comedies are perennially tinged with melancholy and dysfunction. Francis Wilson arrives with his head all bandaged up from a terrible motorcycle accident. Peter Brodythe only Anderson newcomer among the principals is running away from the pregnancy of a wife he regrets marrying. Jack is pining for the girlfriend of Hotel Chevalier who has apparently slept around. She can't commit to him and he can't give her up. The brothers stop at temples and see sights and shopfor Indian medicines to get high on poisonous snakes pepper spray. The men are bossed around by the train's chief steward Waris Ahluwalia and Jack has a quick affair with a stewardess Rita Amara Karan whom the others know as the sweet lime girl. Francis who bosses his other brothers around also has a secretary and planner Brendan Wally Worodarsky who prints up and laminates little copies of their itinerary which changes from day to day and has such tasks as keeping track of the brother's extensive array of custom Marc Jacobs Vuitton luggage which belonged to their father and finding adapter plugs. Brendan eventually defects but Francis hopes to lure him back.The brothers effect a rescue of some boys in a capsized raft near a waterfall but the boy Peter tries to rescue doesn't survive and they all go to the funeral. They weren't going to go and see their mother but they do Huston gives an especially strong performance. A ceremony to celebrate their bond and spiritual union goes wrong but later they do it again. And this time it works. The movie begins with Bill Murray Steve Zissou in Anderson's last outing who runs after the train and misses it. The throwing away of the baggage is perhaps a little too obvious a symbol.. Maybe the rescue episode feels contrived and emotionally detached.Either you like Wes Anderson or you don't no doubt. But if you share my impression that he's one of the most important American filmmakers of his generation his new film is obviously essential viewing. It looks like this time has gone better than the last even if Nathan Lee is right in saying it's more a companion piece to 'Tenenbaums' than a step in new directions. It will be nice if a lot of people get to see it proceeded by 'Hotel Chevalier' which anyway will be on the DVD. The New York Film Festival 2007 has chosen 'The Darjeeling Limited' for their opening night film. This is a new direction for Anderson which is to just let things be or as Francis says in dictating the course of their journey to say yes to everything. To try to anyway.".

Jack who likes to go barefoot and wear expensive suits is a writer and this sequence comes up in 'Darjeeling' as a short story he's working on. 'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the fulllength film and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'Everyone is damaged. We know how actually damaged Owen Wilson is from the news of his recent suicide attempt and Anderson's comedies are perennially tinged with melancholy and dysfunction. Francis Wilson arrives with his head all bandaged up from a terrible motorcycle accident. Peter Brodythe only Anderson newcomer among the principals is running away from the pregnancy of a wife he regrets marrying. Jack is pining for the girlfriend of Hotel Chevalier who has apparently slept around. She can't commit to him and he can't give her up. The brothers stop at temples and see sights and shopfor Indian medicines to get high on poisonous snakes pepper spray. The men are bossed around by the train's chief steward Waris Ahluwalia and Jack has a quick affair with a stewardess Rita Amara Karan whom the others know as the sweet lime girl. Francis who bosses his other brothers around also has a secretary and planner Brendan Wally Worodarsky who prints up and laminates little copies of their itinerary which changes from day to day and has such tasks as keeping track of the brother's extensive array of custom Marc Jacobs Vuitton luggage which belonged to their father and finding adapter plugs. Brendan eventually defects but Francis hopes to lure him back.The brothers effect a rescue of some boys in a capsized raft near a waterfall but the boy Peter tries to rescue doesn't survive and they all go to the funeral. They weren't going to go and see their mother but they do Huston gives an especially strong performance. A ceremony to celebrate their bond and spiritual union goes wrong but later they do it again. And this time it works. The movie begins with Bill Murray Steve Zissou in Anderson's last outing who runs after the train and misses it. The throwing away of the baggage is perhaps a little too obvious a symbol.. Maybe the rescue episode feels contrived and emotionally detached.Either you like Wes Anderson or you don't no doubt. But if you share my impression that he's one of the most important American filmmakers of his generation his new film is obviously essential viewing. It looks like this time has gone better than the last even if Nathan Lee is right in saying it's more a companion piece to 'Tenenbaums' than a step in new directions. It will be nice if a lot of people get to see it proceeded by 'Hotel Chevalier' which anyway will be on the DVD. The New York Film Festival 2007 has chosen 'The Darjeeling Limited' for their opening night film. This is a new direction for Anderson which is to just let things be or as Francis says in dictating the course of their journey to say yes to everything. To try to anyway.";

People who question the plot are in some serious need of a check up because this was such a wonderful movie. I used to watch it all the time with my grandfather I grew up in a baseball oriented family and my grandfather and I just adored this movie. I avoided the film for a few years though after he passed away because it would bring up sad memories but wanting to think of him I bought the movie and I still love it. I love everything this film has to offer. It makes me feel good it's funny it's charming has wonderful characters and makes you believe that anything could happen.Young foster children Roger and his friend J.P. love to sneak into baseball games of the hopelessly dreadful California Angels. Still in limited contact with his widower father Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies  I'd say when the Angels win the pennant. Taking his father's words literally Roger prays for God to help the Angels win. After he prays a star unseen by Roger twinkles in the sky. His wish comes true as real angels help the Angels win and the down on his luck coach George Knox uses him thinking he's a good luck charm. But then he discovers that there may be a little something more to Roger then opening up his heart to something bigger. He becomes a better coach the team becomes better naturally and Roger starts to believe not only in angels but love as well.Joseph GordonLevitt as Roger was so wonderful he had such heart and put passion into the role. Most child actors are very annoying and play up to the cute factor too much but if you're telling me that you did not tear up when his father just abandons him in court and he breaks down in Maggie's arm you need to have your heart checked to see if it's beating. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd was wonderful and they really played off each other well. Danny Glover how could you not love his character? George Knox is a hasbeen who has lost any faith that anything could happen the boys that entered his life just changed it forever. I love everything about this movie I don't know how anyone couldn't. It's a wonderful movie and if given the fair chance it deserves the rating should be much higher. After all the angels are always watching.910".

I avoided the film for a few years though after he passed away because it would bring up sad memories but wanting to think of him I bought the movie and I still love it. I love everything this film has to offer. It makes me feel good it's funny it's charming has wonderful characters and makes you believe that anything could happen.Young foster children Roger and his friend J.P. love to sneak into baseball games of the hopelessly dreadful California Angels. Still in limited contact with his widower father Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies  I'd say when the Angels win the pennant. Taking his father's words literally Roger prays for God to help the Angels win. After he prays a star unseen by Roger twinkles in the sky. His wish comes true as real angels help the Angels win and the down on his luck coach George Knox uses him thinking he's a good luck charm. But then he discovers that there may be a little something more to Roger then opening up his heart to something bigger. He becomes a better coach the team becomes better naturally and Roger starts to believe not only in angels but love as well.Joseph GordonLevitt as Roger was so wonderful he had such heart and put passion into the role. Most child actors are very annoying and play up to the cute factor too much but if you're telling me that you did not tear up when his father just abandons him in court and he breaks down in Maggie's arm you need to have your heart checked to see if it's beating. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd was wonderful and they really played off each other well. Danny Glover how could you not love his character? George Knox is a hasbeen who has lost any faith that anything could happen the boys that entered his life just changed it forever. I love everything about this movie I don't know how anyone couldn't. It's a wonderful movie and if given the fair chance it deserves the rating should be much higher. After all the angels are always watching.910";

	schema:reviewBody "Although I don't usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this I happened to catch the 1994 version of ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD AitO on cable one Saturday morning just as it was starting. Being an Adrien Brody fan I was curious to see what Brody was like as a youth of 21 20 when he filmed it I suppose in this early role as Danny Hemmerling utility infielder for the California Angels in the 1951 original the hardluck baseball team was the Pittsburgh Pirates. The name change is a nice touch since it turns the title into wordplay. I decided to give the flick a chance and it turned out to be a pretty painless even amiable experience with a decent balance of laughs tears sweetness and baseballbased excitement. Also my 7yearold daughter liked the angel effects!  Directed by Mike Nesmith's frequent collaborator William Dear AitO is the story of Roger Joseph GordonLevitt a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'erdowell dad the convincingly sleazy Dermot Mulroney sarcastically says they'll be a family again once the lastplace California Angels win the pennant. Soon Roger starts seeing real angels at the Angels' games led by Christopher Lloyd whose usual zany eccentric irreverence keeps AitO from plummeting irretrievably into The Schmaltz Zone.  Crusty manager George Knox Danny Glover in worldweary exasperated mode is a hard sell but once the team starts winning he believes Roger's angel sightings and soon Knox has Roger and his cute li'l pal and fellow foster kid J.P. the adorable Milton Davis Jr. at every Angels game for good luck.  Knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language as much to appease the angels as for the kids' sake resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along.  Predictable obstacles ensue such as obnoxious sportcaster Ranch Wilder Jay O. Sanders trying to make trouble for Knox because of the angel angle.  Sure it all works out fine for our heroes in the end but they're so darn amiable you don't mind!   Babyfaced Brody has a couple of good lines I especially like his exchange with Glover about the emotional impact of the National Anthem at a ballgame as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat. Brody isn't the only future star in AitO's lineup  his teammates include Matthew McConaughey and Neal McDonough and of course young GordonLevitt went on to costar in TV's 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN as well as such films as 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. The alwaysamusing Taylor Negron and Oscar winners but not for this film  Brenda Fricker and Ben Johnson lend able support. If you're a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars AitO '94 will do nicely.".

Well you knew Disney was going to have some Liberal propaganda. Danny Glover overacts something brutal in this film and the baseball player who is the star played by Tony Danza doesn't have a clue how to throw a baseball much less portray a Major League pitcher.

	schema:reviewBody "Angels in the Outfield was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library Disney remade it in 1994 this time using the California Angels now the Los Angeles Angels as the team Disney used to own this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team also good use of the words huh?????.This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family only if the Angels won the pennant. So he called upon God one night about this. The boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and ONLY that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball!!!!! For much of the postAll Star season of 1994 the Angels were at the top of the AL West of which my home team the Rangers is one and it still is. However they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the White SoxAngels game there was no Central Division in Baseball back then hence Chicago being in the West and no angels were there to help. Thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games. But wait! In the final championship game the Angels won!!!!! It was a miracle indeed!What I liked about this film This is a good movie. I mean I prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now! My work was good!!!!! So for one this shows that if you believe God can send His angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life. And second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie too I've seen this just recently on the New Disney Channel blech!!!!!.Angels in the Outfield will change your life forever once you've seen it!!!!!1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Much much more than just a baseball movie... One of the great films from the great 1994 year of movies this takes a rather big step towards addressing the possibilities of the meaning of life faith belief heart friendship family love fun  entertaining unbearably goofy comedy! And I'm glad to this day it has!I'm a guy from Japan born the 90s and this is one of my top favorite Disney movies! Always has been  will continue to be!! This is just one of those MANY sports film that were plain awesome from the 90s! Though I personally wouldn't count Mighty Ducks  I never was really a fan of hockey  I sort of think it's an overrated sport. I'm actually going by the lines of Cool Runnings The Big Green Rookie of the Year etc. I even hear this movie actually had the BIGGEST film premiere in 1994 with the movie grossing more than DOUBLE than what they started with in their budget!! Isn't that saying something? I'm sure in many ways that not only people who play baseball or believe in God can relate to this film I even believe children who are ORPHANS can relate to it too  I'm sure they want films they can relate to as well! And there may also be people who just KNOW there must be a bigger  deeper meaning to life than just getting glory making money  dying.Before I forget to mention man oh man is Randy Edelman's music so uplifting! I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination for at least SOMETHING! I mean this is the same guy who did the Beethoven movies a Tall Tale The Big Green  Dragonheart! I thin almost 50 of this film owes it's thanks to his GENIUS score! The guy is surely underrated  he deserves more attention from Hollywood than he's getting.I give credit to this movie for INTRODUCING me not only to the sport of baseball but also the California Angels big Hollywood names as Danny Glover with always the loyal  friendly character to support the main characters throughout whatever story there may be JosephGordon Levitt LOVE how he's always kept that same innocent boyish face lol Christopher Lloyd Adrien Brody Matthew Mcconaughey BOTH Oscar winners today! and Tony Danza. I mean I didn't know it was them at the time  but now of course I do with such modernday access to information on the Net these days. I guess they were just really good at playing their characters!But if I had to say if there was downside to this movie I would have to say that people don't become angels when they die as the film suggests  in fact angels are just meant to be ministering spirits for us  Hebrews 114. Either Heaven or Hell or our destination after we die. And I might wanna add the way the ANGELS are depicted themselves in this film is indeed impressive! The effects surely do hold to this day! I mean they are just GORGEOUS to look at! When I was a very young I really thought that's how they looked. But hey actually they're actually more amazing than THAT! Yes I am sure serious. But that's another long story...Again I'm fan of and I still love Joseph GordonLevitt he is RENOWNED for being in this film in my memory! But I''ll be honest when I say I hate or seriously DISLIKE a lot of the recent films he's been in ie. Looper Inception Don Jon etc. As if he almost WANTS to ruin our childhoods of him. I can't believe he would go to great lengths and such deep measures by including himself in this great wholesome family movie that encourages good behavior loving relationships stronger faith in Heaven God angels etc. but then gets into OTHER films that are not only just allround atrocious awful disgusting filthy and encourage BAD behavior but even misuse  take the Lord's name in vain! Unfortunately that happens all the time and I'm sick of it! Rarely are there ever films these days except for Facing the Giants that really praise and upholds the name of Lord. But I guess as always The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Prov. 17 Ugh with Don Jon........... ! that movie!!!But on the bright side I even find that quote that Maggie says near the third part of the film about a football player kneels to thank God after a great game I immediately knew it seemed to foreshadowing Tim Tebow a great sports player of today!And I find it just RUDE  BIGOTED for thee Nostalgia Critic to come across this movie and think it silly  simplistic that boy ask God for a family  helps a baseball game win when there's starving children in Africa or war in the MiddleEast. CUT IT SOME SLACK Critic! God could clearly say the same thing about US we people! Have you forgotten that God is all places at all times??? God CAN send His angels for supernatural interventions God tries even WORKING THROUGH people to feed starving people or bring peace to the MiddleEast  it's just that most of us are too far caught up in our everyday lives or selfindulgence we just don't notice it nor is it reported by the mainstream media.But DITTO to that last quote by AL the Angel  We're always watching! DITTO to that man! Ditto and amen!With this film whether like Beauty  the Beast and The Lion King as I get older  older it only gets better  better! I'll say CHECK IT OUT to those who still haven't! DDDAnd I wrote this review since I'm convinced NO ONE ELSE would  so I'm glad I did.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Angels in the Outfield is a 1994 baseball movie released by Walt Disney Pictures starring Danny Glover Lethal Weapon Series Operation Dumbo Drop Tony Danza T.V.'s Who's the Boss and Christopher Lloyd Back to the Future Trilogy Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This 90's remake of the 1951 classic is the story of a Southern California foster boy named Roger Joseph GordonLevitt from T.V.'s 3rd Rock From the Sun who is in search of a family and longs to be united with his dad. His only hope is to pray that the last place California Angels now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim win the pennant. When he prays for them real angels actually help the team start winning and make an eventual believer out of cynical manager George Knox Danny Glover who becomes a mentor and friend to Roger and his best friend JP Milton Davis Jr.. Back in the summer of '94 around the time this movie was released Major League Baseball went on a players strike cancelling the second half of the season and the World Series which was and still is the only time in baseball history that the World Series was cancelled. In fact this movie was released the same week that the AllStar Game was played! The bad part of the strike is that Ken Griffey Jr. was well on his way to breaking Maris's singleseason home run record he had 40 homers going into the break!!! Too bad that in '98 that McGwire and Sosa had to take performance enhancing drugs to break Maris's record!!! You can definitely tell I'm a diehard baseball fan!!! Anyways this movie captures the spirit of our national pastime almost as good as Field of Dreams The Natural and A League of Their Own. Disney really did a good job of making you feel apart of the action even though certain scenes weren't the most realistic in some cases!! This movie pretty much turned me into the baseball lover I am today!!! The story is good the characters are funny especially Al the music adds to the intensity and it has a great message in it! This is one movie that you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy! If you haven't seen this movie yet go out and buy it or rent it! This is one of many 90's kids movies that defined my childhood and I recommend it to every Disney and baseball fan! Rating 1010!!!".

This movie pretty much turned me into the baseball lover I am today!!! The story is good the characters are funny especially Al the music adds to the intensity and it has a great message in it! This is one movie that you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy! If you haven't seen this movie yet go out and buy it or rent it! This is one of many 90's kids movies that defined my childhood and I recommend it to every Disney and baseball fan! Rating 1010!!!";

In relation all characters in the story seem to have the same mission search within themselves to find out who they really are.Depressed over the fact that Roger JGL is separated from his father he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant. Odds are astronomical but 3time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd Back to the Future My Favorite Martian comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic pun. Before you know it Al Lloyd is sitting with Roger in the stands snacking on cracker jacks and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells' DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear nominated in Directors Guild of America. He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark played by Tony Danza 4time Golden Globe nominee Emmy nominee who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim. Clark has been dubbed a washup a once bigname in Cinci but he has something to prove to Manager Knox.Spoiling this nailbiting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace.

Visconti knew how to bring the best in his actors. Even Maria Callas who under Visconti's guidance went from the greatest Opera singer to the greatest actress singing Opera. There are moments in Bellissima that can only be described as a love letter from Visconti to Magnani and vice versa. She has a few close ups that tells us how much love respect and admiration existed between this two enormous artists. Look at her moments in the mirror combing her hair naturally debating under her breath the proper pronunciation of a word. She not a conventional beauty looks ravishing.

Magnani's warmth wit slyness and sheer volcanic beauty leap from the screen.  I am amazed that Hollywood has not remade this film.  It would be the perfect vehicle for Barbra Streisand or Bette Midler and would assure them of an Oscar nomination. Unlike her English language roles such as The Rose Tattoo or The Secret of Santa Vittoria in BELLISSIMA Magnani acts in her native italian voice.  It makes all the difference in the world.  When she acted in English she was stilted and restrained the language barrier although she made superhuman heroic efforts to master English is nonetheless felt.

	schema:reviewBody "'Bellissima' begins with a radio presentation of Donizetti's opera L'elisir d'amore The Elixir of Love. In it a poor peasant Nemorino falls in love with Adina a beautiful landowner. He relies on a charlatan's magic potion that he believes will help him to gain Adina's love. We're suddenly interrupted by an announcement of a casting competition for reallife director Alessandro Blasetti who is searching for a child age 6 to 8 to star in his latest film. 'Bellissima' is heralded director Luchino Visconti's third film and he wastes no time in introducing us to the crazy world of the Italian film industry where a large gaggle of star struck stage mothers accompanied by their little tots are attempting to get their 'big break' in the movie business.Perhaps the most determined of all the mothers is our protagonist Maddalena Cecconi played by subsequent Oscar winner the superb Anna Magnani. She lives in a workingclass tenement with her equally 'passionate' husband Spartaco who both appear to be good parents to little Maria the unprecocious child who Maddalena is convinced is the next 'Shirley Temple'. Like Nemorino in Donizetti's opera Maddalena needs a magic potion to escape the drab existence which she perceives is her lifeand that magic potion is the film contract which will enable her to live vicariously through her daughter's success. If Spartaco tries to convince his obsessed wife that motion pictures are just a 'fantasy' Maddalena will have none of itevery week there's another Hollywood picture projected on the big screen in the building's courtyard and Maddalena is enraptured whenever a big actor like Montgomery Clift makes his captivating appearance.Back to the initial auditions Maddalena finally finds little Maria with her soiled dress by a poolthe rest of the stage mothers have already been let in to the studio and a seemingly kind director's assistant Alberto Annovazzi manages to get Maddalena and Maria inside the doors despite the late hour.We break into Act II when Maria is chosen for a call back audition. Visconti doesn't only affectionately ridicule the nave Maddalena but Italian society in general obsessed with their own selfinterest. It begins with an older washedup actress who shows up at Maddalena's door insisting that she has the ability to polish the little one's act and ensure she wins the film competition. Later Spartaco kicks the woman out of the house but up until that point Maddalena doesn't question her credentials only hoping that the woman's instruction will give her little one an edge.Due to her naivety about the film business Maddalena is often gullible with those she interacts with but she's also stubborn and aggressive. The obsessed mother butts heads with a photographer referred to her by Annovazzi and a dress maker who hilariously doesn't buy into taking injections for preventative health Maddalena works a nurse and gives injections to diabetics. More funny stuff a hairdresser allows his young son to cut Maria's pigtails and Maddalena expects instant results during initial ballet lessons dig the crazy ballet director's absurd dance across the studio floor!. There's also a great scene where Maddalena accuses Spartaco of beating herthe gossipy neighbors get in on the act and take Maddalena's side in contrast to their constant criticism of her.Visconti throws in a nice twist when Annovazzi hits Maddalena up for the 50000 lire which was going to be used for the purchase of a new house. Annovazzi tells Maddalena he'll use the money to make the necessary connections to ensure Maria gets the screen test. The twist is that Maddalena doesn't seem to mind that he used most of the money to buy a scooter for himself. And when Annovazzi tries to seduce Maddalena during a visit at her motherinlaw's Maddalena also isn't perturbed at allshe dismisses it as men's 'typical behavior'.Before the classic denouement Maddelena meets a woman who she recognizes as a former actress in a couple of director Blasetti's movies. She warns Maddelina that the move business isn't what it's cracked up to be. After acting in two films she didn't get anywhere so she took the more mundane job as a film editor. Still Maddalena is undeterred and believes there's still a chance Maria might be selected. So she finagles her way up the projection room and watches the rushes. To her chagrin Maria breaks out crying during her screen test. Blasseti's colleagues including Annovazzi find this uproarious and burst out laughing. Maddalena confronts the director and chastises him and his colleagues for their bad behavior. Blasseti basically agrees with Maddalena and fires Annovazzi on the spot. But that's not enough to assuage Maddalena's hurt feelings and she storms off.At this point Maddalena's world is shattered. Sitting on park bench she clutches Maria and cries out 'Help'. Back at the studio Blasseti watches the rushes again and improbably sees a different Maria. Before you know it the studio executives are offering Maddalena and Spartico a contract for Maria to star in their next picture. But Maddalena no longer living in the world of illusion does the 'right thing' and tells the executives that the film business is not for her daughter or for the rest of the family.Most of 'Bellissima' I would describe as comic but there are moments particularly the ending which are more touching and poignant. On occasion the constant bickering between some of the characters goes on a little too long but for the most part Visconti's narrative displays brilliant insights into the unfortunate human phenomena known as selfishness. The many layered brilliant performance of Anna Magnani and the supporting players is the type of acting you rarely see anymore. This is a film that I highly recommend for those who enjoy watching classic cinema.".

	schema:headline " The human desire to overcome poverty even if we stimulate exploitation even more.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bellissima is structured in a circular and ephemeral plot. Their conflict which becomes stronger as a situation is mimesis of reality of stories so close and common but diversified. In short the human desire to overcome poverty even if we stimulate exploitation even more.The timeless character of this film made in 1951 by Luchino Visconti is already clear in its synopsis The story of Maddalena a nurse who inscribes his daughter Maria in a contest that aims to elect the most beautiful girl in Italy. The contest represents a ticket to give the daughter a life that oscillates between dignity and luxury being that motherprotagonist ready to everything to guarantee the victory of the daughter.In a large part of this story that sometimes takes situations and absurd moments facing a desire that borders the limitations of vision rationality and absurdity when showing the starting points play and finalize this saga. That is drawn by a mother motivated by the future of her daughter this dramatic dimension that is characteristic to the film if diluted wisely in moments of comedy. Maddalena's attitudes are laughable all the more so as in the lack of artistic talent of her daughter. This laughs at the other the role of a fool that plays this mother not to notice in the daughter who lacks other attributes and the belief that the beauty of the girl added to the interference of this mother as in trying to buy the jurors or get someone inside the Production of the film that highlights the test of Maria that this sum can interfere in the result and consecrate in the victory of Maddalena through the small daughter.With all the merits of a timeless story and without regret the fact that the director had in hand a material very close to the neorealist films that consecrated him that is to have something very close to the style that was customary to do but that is Rejected in Bellissima approaching this story through the realistic bias in which personally I consider that it was desirous to the producers of the film and to the director to present a more comprehensive aspect of the fable considering the common character of this story that happens and repeats itself In life and which is now reflected on canvas but which in abandoning a reflection of this realism pertaining to a certain social reality generates a filmic approach that equates maternal desires however disproportionate and invalid in face of class differences and consequently incapable of generating Changes or results how can you compete with a family that already has a wide advantage? This inequality of classes is mentioned and treated very superficially in the small plots in which they are presented this minimizes the strength and potentiality of Visconti and Bellissima since the approach in which it is presented its form makes it impossible for itself speech. The struggle to overcome class differences through methods that reinforce and contribute to these differences. In truth the mother does not struggle to overcome anything she wants only to belong to something and in the end when she perceives this world of cruel differences that she admired and in which she ended up collaborating it becomes then the moment of rationality and revolt of Maddalena. In portraying cinema as a microcosm of a prosperous world in advantageous possibilities Visconti satirizes the film industry itself and human innocence in the face of its belief in possibility and belonging. This belief that induces the ability to use mechanisms but is already dominated by commercial interests which among others result in the strengthening of class differences and simulate a fantasy world such as the cinema and its benefits.The entire film is anchored by the magnetic and fascinating performance of Anna Magnani who fills the entire screen with a fiery vitality and intensity that is almost impossible to look away. In 1951 she was one of the queens of Italian cinema and was already echoing all over the world. Anna was the favorite actress of Bette Davis and Bette considered Anna's performance in Bellissima as brilliant uninhibited and full of immense power. There is hardly a moment in the movie where it is still or silent. Visconti almost exclusively records Anna in medium and full planes giving her ample room for compositions and promoting seams from one end of the frame to the other.Between several scenes of fadein and fadeout that stitch together the film between jumps of episodic events that collaborate for the construction and the outcome of the plot it calls the photographic proposal of Piero Portalupi and Paul Ronald who basically establish a climate of life Obscure in the apartment of Maddalena in contrast the reflectors and dazzle of lights of the Cinecitt a directing of light that directs not only the convicted desire of Maddalena but with only enlightened path that offers a perspective a way out that life between Shadows Another great moment of mastery of this photograph is in the game between half light that illuminates faces or that highlight one among many others a clear allusion to the pursuit of brilliance and own light that dialogue and much for the construction of Beautiful.Although not the most interesting film of Visconti and leaving aside many of the brands that have consecrated it Bellissima is an interesting work and that dialogues with the contemporary world and possibly dialogues with the future world since between the social differences Which we both struggle to overcome are often unconsciously reinforced through a selfish struggle that seeks only to save some and not realize that it will only result when we understand the need for a whole.

	onyx:emotionText "Bellissima is structured in a circular and ephemeral plot. Their conflict which becomes stronger as a situation is mimesis of reality of stories so close and common but diversified. In short the human desire to overcome poverty even if we stimulate exploitation even more.The timeless character of this film made in 1951 by Luchino Visconti is already clear in its synopsis The story of Maddalena a nurse who inscribes his daughter Maria in a contest that aims to elect the most beautiful girl in Italy. The contest represents a ticket to give the daughter a life that oscillates between dignity and luxury being that motherprotagonist ready to everything to guarantee the victory of the daughter.In a large part of this story that sometimes takes situations and absurd moments facing a desire that borders the limitations of vision rationality and absurdity when showing the starting points play and finalize this saga. That is drawn by a mother motivated by the future of her daughter this dramatic dimension that is characteristic to the film if diluted wisely in moments of comedy. Maddalena's attitudes are laughable all the more so as in the lack of artistic talent of her daughter. This laughs at the other the role of a fool that plays this mother not to notice in the daughter who lacks other attributes and the belief that the beauty of the girl added to the interference of this mother as in trying to buy the jurors or get someone inside the Production of the film that highlights the test of Maria that this sum can interfere in the result and consecrate in the victory of Maddalena through the small daughter.With all the merits of a timeless story and without regret the fact that the director had in hand a material very close to the neorealist films that consecrated him that is to have something very close to the style that was customary to do but that is Rejected in Bellissima approaching this story through the realistic bias in which personally I consider that it was desirous to the producers of the film and to the director to present a more comprehensive aspect of the fable considering the common character of this story that happens and repeats itself In life and which is now reflected on canvas but which in abandoning a reflection of this realism pertaining to a certain social reality generates a filmic approach that equates maternal desires however disproportionate and invalid in face of class differences and consequently incapable of generating Changes or results how can you compete with a family that already has a wide advantage? This inequality of classes is mentioned and treated very superficially in the small plots in which they are presented this minimizes the strength and potentiality of Visconti and Bellissima since the approach in which it is presented its form makes it impossible for itself speech. The struggle to overcome class differences through methods that reinforce and contribute to these differences. In truth the mother does not struggle to overcome anything she wants only to belong to something and in the end when she perceives this world of cruel differences that she admired and in which she ended up collaborating it becomes then the moment of rationality and revolt of Maddalena.

Of course with an actress of Magnani's quality you do not walk away emptyhanded she excels in parts but is ultimately stereotyped by the earthy Italian female character one who remains sexually virtuous in spite of other questionable behavior and puts herself in unnecessary situations that erode her reputation in the eyes of husband and acquaintances. The script is thin in spite of interesting asides involving her relationships with child husband and wouldbe lover. BW photography is standard downright unimaginative but effective. Acting is the film's best asset but as far as I am concerned does not save it  especially because the ending is so obvious and longwinded.It is interesting to compare BELISSIMA with LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE as both focus on beautysinging competitions for young girls.

She was acting so hard it hurt me. I can understand a mother who pursues an acting chance for her child but this mother took it to excess and then threw away the opportunity she had sacrificed so much for. The ending of the movie was ridiculous  she returns from the screen test to find a contract waiting for her and at 2000000 lira to boot and can find nothing to say but that she is hurt that her daughter was used as a fun object and laughed at. With the brazenness and unfeeling attitude she displayed all through the film I could not find her rejection of a contract believable in the least.We were supposed to see her husband as a brutish lout but he just did not appear that way. He seemed the sensible parent not like the mother. She made a show of showing the way she was beaten but there were no signs at all. And when she said to him at the end about slapping her it was not realistic at all. That part was just in the story I suppose to make her a repository of our sympathies. But it just did not work. In my opinion he was a much better parent than she.I am am not sure why people find Magnoni a compelling actress. She is earthy and annoying. She seems onedimensional to me. I could not see much difference in her performances in this film and Mama Roma.".

What's interesting about these 3 films is that although all of them contain the quintessential neorealist backdrop of post war Italian helplessness and melancholy each of them have a distinct and separate tone to them. 'Ossessione' was an erotic thriller and 'La Terra Trema' was a socially conscious family drama. 'Bellissima' on the other hand has a much more lighthearted comedic tone. The central element of a mother desperately wanting her daughter to win a talent contest serves the same thematic purpose as the actual bicycle in De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves'. It represents something deeper about the mother and also the post war Italian working class in general. The film also features a really confident assertive and dynamic performance by the great Anna Magnani. She drives the film forward through sheer personality. However having said all that I don't think 'Bellissima' comes anywhere close to reaching the heights of 'Ossessione' and 'La Terra Trema' which I think are masterpieces. It's worth a watch but I don't think it is a film to desperately seek out.".

Things get better when Feyder begins to film on location in the splendid landscapes of Laponia.But then again Pierre Richard Wilm 's wooden acting and Jacques Terrane's clumsy performance get in the way.Michle Morgan and Charles Vanel easily outclass them.Vanel gives a warm performance and the scene in his house where Jacqueline discovers all his little secrets is probably more convincing than the restprobably because the two others are not present.Morgan's beauty and the scenes in the snow make la Loi du Nord a film to watch but no necessarily to keep...";

	schema:headline " Lovely performances plus historical facts of the Gaiety Girls.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film tells the story of 'Trottie True' a middle class girl who becomes a child star of the Bedford Music Hall graduates to the heights of being a successful Gaiety Girl marries a Lord and eventually leaves the stage. It is not a particularly original or thrilling storyline and it could be a very dull film if it were not for the sumptuous costumes and scenery that are so beautifully selected to display the Technicolor process.The onstage scenes which are few and far between show some colourful costumes as do the various ballroom and restaurant scenes.  This newly restored print enables us to have a good idea of what the film would have originally been like to see the cinema and it must have been a wonderful way to forget the aftermath of the war.Apart from the lavishness and brightness of the film the female performances are a delight especially that of Jean Kent as 'Trottie True'. Miss Kent gives a truthful performance of a rising star who falls in love with a Balloonist becomes a successful stage performer and marries a Lord. The story all sounds rather farfetched but Jean Kent's performance makes it work.  So often characters that are aiming for stardom become untruthful but Miss Kent was totally believable.  She aimed to get to the top of her profession and did so without becoming the usual 'bitch' a trap that these type of roles can easily fall into.  She is also totally believable towards the end of the film when she marries the Lord and becomes a Duchess.  A particularly moving moment happens when she performs her Music Hall songs at the Servants Ball.  We all think that her rather austere motherinlaw will be mortified but instead turns to her husband and says She can stay  perhaps a little sentimental but rather moving. Apart from giving an excellent performance Jean Kent also looks so beautiful in her extravagant dresses and with her gorgeous red hair used to full effect in the Technicolor filming.The other female roles are equally well cast particularly the everwonderful Hattie Jacques as a fellow Gaiety Girl.  She gives a wonderfully rich comic performance that never steps over the mark.  It is good to see her in an earlier stage in her career.  Hattie Jacques is matched brilliantly with the late Bill Owen as 'Trottie's' Music Hall friend.  He gives a performance without any of the ususal stereotypical characteristics of a 'Cockney Music Hall Performer' and although it is obvious that he is in love with 'Trottie' he never becomes too sentimental as if playing 'Buttons' in Cinderella.Unfortunately the male leads let down  the film.  James Donald as 'Lord Digby' is extremely dull.  'Trottie' has far too much vitality to fall in love with him!  Her first love 'Maurice' the Balloonist Hugh Sinclair was an unbelievable character and his rather awkward smile filled the screen too many times.  I rather felt that 'Trottie' may have had more fun if she had gone off with some of the film extras  and why not when they comprise of such names as Roger Moore Patrick Cargill and Ian Carmichael!  In fact the list of small part players is rather amazing with a wonderful ripple of recognition when Gretchen Franklyn appeared as 'Martha' the maid in 'Trottie's' childhood home!  A special mention needs to go to a young teenage Dilys Laye who plays the young 'Trottie'.  She gave a delightful performance and gave a clear indication of the successful career that she was about to embark upon.The most important element of this film is depiction of the differences between the Music Hall and Gaiety Theatre.  There is a wonderful scene between 'Trottie' and Lana Morris as 'Bouncie Barrington' in which 'Bouncie' comments on all the jewellery she has been given from her StageDoor Johnnies.  She says that she is a Gaiety Girl because she is pretty  which is all that is expected from her when she performs on the stage. 'Trottie' of course has other ideas and knows that she is a good performer and that the audiences love her for her talent. This film gives a good indication what these days must have been like  it is just such a shame that a full Musical Number is not seen on stage at the Gaiety.  One number between Bill Owen Hattie Jacques and Jean Kent is seen in part from the wings of a theatre.  It should have been filmed in its entirety but was cut short few to financial constraints at the time of filming.  The other songs were sweet including a Music Hall number written by Carroll Gibbons which commenced with Dilys Laye as the young 'Trottie' and moved forward in time with Jean Kent finishing it as the older 'Trottie'.  Another song White Wings which is supposed to have been one of the Queen Mother's favourite songs seemed rather dull and although was supposed to be sung by Jean Kent looked suspiciously dubbed! The print viewed was a newly restored version of a gorgeous film that gave us some lovely performances plus historical facts of the Gaiety Girls.".

There's no cinematography no screenplay terrible costume design very bad editing cheap production design totally random soundtrack and the plot itself is a no sense. I can't think of one single thing that's positive about it. We are talking about a product that they said needed a budget of 4 million euro a small part of that it's public funds about 30k euro. One wonders where the money went not in the movie apparently. 1 Star because there isn't a 10 stars.".

Sandro Ravagnani and Ivano De Cristofaro does not possess even the basics of filmography. Actors aren't actors they can't even speak their language correctly. There's no cinematography no screenplay terrible costume design very bad editing cheap production design totally random soundtrack and the plot itself is a no sense. I can't think of one single thing that's positive about it. We are talking about a product that they said needed a budget of 4 million euro a small part of that it's public funds about 30k euro. One wonders where the money went not in the movie apparently. 1 Star because there isn't a 10 stars.";

Aloise says she would like the name Lulu for all the U's. I didn't know what it meant at the time but now I can see it meant she wished she were someone else. She was a gentle artistic woman with a mind divided over many things. There are various stresses in her life as she grows up she is happiest when she is singing and when she is taking care of children as a nanny. There is a beautiful scene in the park with the children the last scene before the war breaks out. It starts to rain at the end of the scene and since I was in college I recognized this as an allegory of the coming storm of the war.When the war breaks out it puts tremendous stresses on her psychologically.She is a very gentle and empathetic person. None of us enjoy war I'd guess at least not most of us when we stop to think about what goes on. But it was just awfully hard on her. In a similar vein the American poet Denise Levertov told me in the 1980's she was unable to write for a period because of the horrors America was supporting in El Salvador. War affects Aloise the same way.I found it engrossing. It was stylish and beautiful. It was the first foreign film I saw over and over the pacing and perspective were Western but definitely not American. It was much slower and more delicate than an American film.I was hooked.

I liked this film very much because I watched the film unfold not knowing what's going to happen next. There were no obvious 'surprises' which is why I think this film is clever. Rachael Blake was fantastic in this film. It is really her story. The film had the elements of a fine Hitchcock movie  surprises are really unpredictable not 'puton unpredictable' as some films of the same genre tend to be. One might think because the jacket writeup talked about a woman going out with a stranger purposely knowing it to be a onenight stand that the film would be full of steamy sex scenes. Wrong. The one love scene with the 'ghost' Sam Neill actually was tender. This is the essence of the story  the strangeness of relationships. I don't understand why other reviewers 'didn't get it'. This is not a literal film that expects the audience to think that the story is based on reality. It is not. But it touches on human nature. Before some of you misunderstand me I said 'literal' not 'literate' which is an entirely different word. The film is very well edited not slow as far as I am concerned. 'Lost in Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' are painfully slow films and it's only hype that made them known to the public. 'Cold Mountain' was unbearably slow. I didn't get to Renee Zelwegger's part  I gave up not even halfway through the film. 'Perfect Strangers' intrigued me and it deserves to be seen. It is not about looniness. It is about the narrowness of the line between sanity and insanity. Acting editing direction and photography were topnotch. Go see it. It will make you think. Some may think the ending is macabre but if you view this film as an allegory you will better appreciate the story. Just be sure you understand that the 2 main characters never really had a sexual relationship. It is all in the mind. C'mon people be literate not literal and you'll enjoy this movie. The irony of this movie is that the 'villain' Sam Neill turns out to be of tender heart and the 'tough' Rachael Blake really a vulnerable woman.".

Whatever it's about I kinda liked it.Melanie Rachael Blake is the boss of a small caf in a coastal New Zealand town.

At first Melanie is unnerved but then she finds herself again falling for the stranger's charming sincerity. But when his creepy unexplained obsession with her become unignorable and romantic temper explodes in a moment of violence Melanie can no longer deny to herself that she's trapped on an island with a crazy person and is in serious trouble.From that point the story takes several eccentric turns that aren't at all what you'd expect from this sort of scenario. Whether that's a good thing or not depends on how much you're willing to indulge this movie's peculiarities. It never becomes truly bizarre yet it's off kilter enough to make you wonder if you're not getting the point the film is trying to make.Getting past the story Perfect Strangers is very pretty. The scenery at the island is lovely and put to good use in the film which has a very clear but subdued visual sense. Whether it's a body on the beach a thicket of sticks woven together to cover a broken window or something as ordinary as a full bath tub this movie has several memorable images.Rachael Blake is a handsome woman who manages to take both the strength and weakness in Melanie and make them both equally real and equally vital. This film takes Melanie in a very different direction and Blake has to subtly bring you along to a situation and a woman you weren't expecting. Sam Neill has to walk a tightrope as the charming stranger who becomes a threatening psycho because he's never allowed to be simply a deranged stalker. He has to be both threatening and nonthreatening going beyond the two dimensional stereotype suggested by this sort of character.I liked Perfect Strangers.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this last night with just the description of the movie on the DVD box cover. The casting was done very well and as the story unfolds of a woman Rachel Blake who meets a handsome man Sam Neill in a nightclub and proffers herself for the night the subsequent kidnapping by him to a remote island seemed par for the course for a low budget movie ... but that's where any notion of predictability ends.The kidnapper's story wasn't a part of this movie. His history and character was left cloaked with mystery. For example had he done this kind of thing before? And what was his overall plan? The only thing made clear was that he had stalked her prior to her approaching him for the night and had planned to steal her away. Due to Sam Neill's gentle appearing role in characterization it became clear he had his own demented agenda of what Melanie Blake was supposed to be like which was displayed by the one act of violently striking her. If he had survived this movie would have been predictable.After reaching the island and she fatally wounds him and attempts to keep him alive and to return back to shore dragging his dying body in his boat she snapped. Even during the attempt of nursing him back to health I had mixed feelings about keeping this creep alive and thus the movie succeeded in pulling me in further. As a result this movie is more intriguing and psychological with the focus on the victim and various coping mechanisms. After all when stuck on an island with no phone electricity no boat no radio and no seafaring knowledge and no land in sight along the horizon I ask myself what would I do? After being stranded and alone on the island she identified with her dead kidnapper and fantasized being in love with him. Along comes Bill Joel Tobeck arriving on the island and as mentally insane she had become he takes her to do the vows which is yet more oddity than irony. In the theme of how the movie unfolded it made me wonder if Bill was part of her mental incapacitation andor means of coping... a blend of harsh realities with selfmental death  horror.Focus was on the kidnapped victim for this movie and in such a circumstance and given all the creative juices for this intriguing film I gave it a 7 rating since it really is more than the standard fare of predictability and typical action genre. This was and is a deeper psychological thriller like no other and Blake's performance in carrying out the twists and depths of her changing mind and coping were done superbly. I felt that Sam Neill's performance was harmonious to what the writer was attempting to project and portray. This is a movie that stays with you for some while after watching and if that was the intent then it succeeded. Regarding my dustshelf this would be a movie I may watch again when in one of my psyche modes.".

	onyx:emotionText "I rented this last night with just the description of the movie on the DVD box cover. The casting was done very well and as the story unfolds of a woman Rachel Blake who meets a handsome man Sam Neill in a nightclub and proffers herself for the night the subsequent kidnapping by him to a remote island seemed par for the course for a low budget movie ... but that's where any notion of predictability ends.The kidnapper's story wasn't a part of this movie. His history and character was left cloaked with mystery. For example had he done this kind of thing before? And what was his overall plan? The only thing made clear was that he had stalked her prior to her approaching him for the night and had planned to steal her away. Due to Sam Neill's gentle appearing role in characterization it became clear he had his own demented agenda of what Melanie Blake was supposed to be like which was displayed by the one act of violently striking her. If he had survived this movie would have been predictable.After reaching the island and she fatally wounds him and attempts to keep him alive and to return back to shore dragging his dying body in his boat she snapped. Even during the attempt of nursing him back to health I had mixed feelings about keeping this creep alive and thus the movie succeeded in pulling me in further. As a result this movie is more intriguing and psychological with the focus on the victim and various coping mechanisms. After all when stuck on an island with no phone electricity no boat no radio and no seafaring knowledge and no land in sight along the horizon I ask myself what would I do? After being stranded and alone on the island she identified with her dead kidnapper and fantasized being in love with him. Along comes Bill Joel Tobeck arriving on the island and as mentally insane she had become he takes her to do the vows which is yet more oddity than irony. In the theme of how the movie unfolded it made me wonder if Bill was part of her mental incapacitation andor means of coping... a blend of harsh realities with selfmental death  horror.Focus was on the kidnapped victim for this movie and in such a circumstance and given all the creative juices for this intriguing film I gave it a 7 rating since it really is more than the standard fare of predictability and typical action genre.

Why any bloke would want to marry a mad chick who whacked him over the head with a shovel and tied him up in a tool shed which she then takes pot shots at while talking to said bloke's deadimaginary mate who she has recently murdered and thrown in a freezer is way beyond me. I know he lives alone on an island but even so he can't be that desperate...Although the woman's descent into madness is unaccountably swift the film plods along neither knowing or seeming to care where it is going.

What starts out as a potentially interesting story  a rather hum drum woman who leads a hum drum life meets an unusual perhaps loony man on one of her outings to a local singles bar  ends in the most mundane psychotic break ever depicted on screen. This could have been a fairly engrossing dramedy about the desire to be in love but it went offtopic into a macabre rendition of guilt and mental illness. Though the need to be in love becomes the overriding emotion in this story it is presented in a grotesque yet surprisingly boring way. The story physically isolates the characters from the rest of the world by putting them on an island but the real world is not that far away so it makes the happenings on the island less believable and in fact emphasizes the plot holes. The ending is just plain dumb and I wondered if Melanie was really pregnant or if she was having what I believe is called an hysterical pregnancy wherein a woman experiences all the symptoms but isn't really going to have a baby.This is a good movie for insomniacs who won't be kept awake too long. I actually nodded off in the middle and had to rewind but found I hadn't missed anything important. One star for adequate acting by the principals even though they didn't have much of a script to work with.".

The second half of the film in particular gets more and more bizarre and kooky and even at the end I think many people would say huh?'. Sam Neill was OK too but I can't for the life of me think what possessed him to do this film. As a student film it would be acceptable but not as a general release.".

But simplicity iscan be very brave and rare today. Many times filmmakers try to hide their lack of ideas under a chaos of different ideas and technical complexity.This was not the greatest masterpiece of all time but it was well worth watching. The script was very clever and the directing and the flow of the movie was very well made. Sam Neill and the lead actress were very good castings for these roles. I think it's refreshing to see movies that don't try to be anything else than what they are. I rate this movie not compared to any other movies I've seen but as an independent being and work.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an offbeat wry thriller of the subHitchcock lone female in peril genre from a country whose inhabitants find it difficult to take themselves seriously.Rachel Blake's Melissa is a woman past the first flush of beauty. After a hard day in a Westport fish and chip shop she picks up handsome suave charming Sam Neil in a bar and he sweeps her off in his wellappointed fishing boat to his place a shack on a lonely offshore island. She wakes up next morning with  Sam Neil kidnapper and possible murderer. Being the plucky sort she gets in first and stabs him and finds herself looking after him and falling in love. Unfortunately she can not get him to medical help and he dies. No matter there's this solar powered deep freeze and she puts him among the chickens and hams happy to chat to him. But then another man arrives on the island and Sam's ghost hasn't left.The tale is told largely from Melissa's point of view and being in need of love it's plausible she might fall for a man who might turn out to be her murderer. It's odd that she so readily transfers her affections to someone else. Does she really think Sam is still around? Has she gone nuts? Rachael Blake is perfect as Melissa a bit battered by life but still sexy and with a single minded determination to stay alive. Hitchcock probably would approve of Melissa's assertiveness due to his wife's influence he was a bit of a closet feminist. Sam Neil is always good as a mysterious stranger though he must wake up sometimes and ask who the hell am I this morning? He has never really bettered his 1983 performance as the title character in Reilly Ace of Spies. Here he is not called upon to explain his character which is just as well. Sam isn't in to explanations.The West Coast setting lush and bleak at the same time is terrific and it's a nice film to watch but it is an odd mixture  thriller looping into a capercomedy. Very NZ though. I think Hitchcock would have liked it a bit more than the work of some of his American and French followers.".

The movie asks the question what makes a certain choice the wrong one and points out that every choice could be both right and wrong. The music is well chosen and the combination between Puccini's opera Madam Butterfly and a number of contemporary ballads enhances the atmosphere.

I never knew what was going to happen next. A woman meets a man on a nightclub. I was afraid this would be one night stand kind of movie but luckily I was wrong! And the famous line Your place or mine? Is where the story begin.The woman decide to go to his house which turns out to be a houseboat. She spends the night there as she pass out and the man Sam Neill one of my fave actors takes her to her sea and to an island where it's his real home. She gets scared and demand him to take her home but he doesn't listen.He brings her home to his place on the iceland and treat her like she is someone special and she get sucpicious that he's been like this to many women before her. He knows what he wants her to be and he get mad when all she want to do is to go home and pretend like nothing has ever happened.He promise her to bring her back home tomorrow but she feels trapped. That night she steals hs key to get out and escape but he scares her when he suddenly is awake and she automatically stabs him with the kitchen knife in her hand.She's now forced to stay and take care of him 'cause she doesn't know where to go if she leaves the island cause she isn't well known in the sea. She stays with him and being his nurse. She has to do everything for him as he lays in the bed not able to do anything. He tells her things and she begings to open herself a little for him but she doesn't want to admit she's falling in love with him and doesn't believe everything he's saying about her.One day the man gets worse and she takes him to the boat to try to get him to a hospital to save his life but he dies onboard. She get upset and bring him back on the island. She stays at his place and hide his body in the freezer outside of the house. Even though he's dead she still see him pretendig that he's still alive. That's her way to survive where she is.This is movie with many twists and tuns and different genres kind of like a Hitcock movie sort of way. Mystery and suspense all at once.The performances is great the nature is awesome and this is finally not a Hollywood movie. Good movies can be made without Hollywood too. And this movie proves is.And if you see this movie more than once you always discover something new about it and after just seeing it once it's a movie you won't forget so easily. It stays with you. It's a good sign even though you think it's good or bad. It's a worth watch.".

What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending as much as it pained me at the same time loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language facial expressions and the dialogue ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood your 'romantic comedies' your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for to think to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has singlehandedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......".

How in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random.

	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance' which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people Jesse an American and Celine a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters.In a film like this it is the writing that's the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is is pure cinematic brilliance.".

I have just completed my review number 1000 in IMDb and I choose Before Sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me.

	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course the romantic Vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna. But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being Titanic or something. Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is in my opinion.".

To my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre where there is a conversation but it's not JUST the conversation that matters but let me just say see it.

I never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through.

The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.The dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does however stay on the right side almost all the time although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film 12 years after.This is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love persay so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather. Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' in Vienna until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret Jessie says and then leans in for a kiss hoho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it firsthand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however selfcontained as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend. A".

OK that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie. Reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well. And this is what makes Before Sunrise so good. The dialog is perfect. It's so real so engaging and funny. It's hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend. It's PERFECT. Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.I must say that if you have a choice do watch Before Sunrise before watching Before Sunset. If like me you watched Sunset first it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations. Young love at it's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful Before Sunrise 1995 the third movie of Richard Linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that isshouldwill be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s two college students American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer. High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy who looks like a Botticelli's angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman.".

It's starts well the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two strangers meet by chance is alluring but once they start wandering around Vienna it's when it starts to get boring. The dialogue is just the kind of naive wistful codphilosophical nonsense that young couples on their first date come up with to impress the other partner. Fine if you are trying to get laid but it makes for rather irritating viewing. After a while I was more interested in the scenery than what was going on with the main characters. By the end I just wished they'd shut up and get on the damn train! It's not that I don't have a romantic streak or appreciate dialogue based movies there are many good examples of this type of film it's just that I expect not to almost fall asleep during it.".

The story the plot is simple its a boy meets girl and we have got to see a romance budding like a blossoming flower that is gonna be so very beautiful the next dawn. Now had the conversation be kiddish and childish as they happen in our marriage looks typically Indian marriage looks where the boy and girl as each other their interests their likes and dislikes this could have been a bore the conversation is so very intriguing ranging from what pisses you off to how we dream our own world to be.It's all about Jesse Ethan Hawke and Celine Julie Delpy and what a day of a lifetime it was for them so it shall be for us I promise for us if we care to watch such movies with a ear and a heart. Now there are so many subdued underlying themes in this that can be found if we sit and just explore even a poem on milkshake seems to be saying something about a lifestyle. This movie is more about life than about anything else. It's a must watch for all those who just love the love we want to have or we are already having in our own lives. Just have time for this and get your ears for words seem like music all through.Just love it and will keep loving it. It's 55 for one of the best romances ever.".

Otherwise you'll vomit on yourself and maybe your girlfriend next to you who is forcing you to watch it and after you clean that up you'll break up with her because you realize that she is also longwinded vague and pretentious so the movie actually did some good by opening your eyes to that.

I mean after all even annoying frat boys can fall in love. But no. The two are so incompatibly different that despite what the script says none of the flirtations are believable. I imagine the minute the director yelled cut Julie would spin around and head straight for her trailer. Ethan would go soak his head. The problem is that the director never yells cut. Instead we are subjected to watching the awkward contrived and stiff ramblings of these two people who have nothing in common except for the script.I saw what the director was trying to do. He was trying to capture the poetry of life through long continuous shots and mundane dialogue. He was trying to show us how wonderful the simplicity of everyday life can be. But there is nothing artistic or poetic about the shots the dialogue or the emotion on screen. The whole thing feels like an awkward date you just cant wait to ditch.Before Sunrise is like When Harry Met Sally except without the humour the charm the witty style the plot or the music. In essence there is no reason to watch this movie. If you do watch this movie make sure you're not sitting near anyone or you might get smacked.Before sunrise? Heh I think I'll sleep in.".

To me it was the musings of immature adults and why were their musings any more interesting than yours or mine? Maybe that was the point  maybe the director was parodying the selfimportance of teenagers and those slightly older.  Was there any insight at all in all that talking?  I couldn't find any.  Not one single insight.  Did you happen to notice that the whole time they talked about themselves?  I include their philosophical comments because they are about their own philosophy not anyone else's.  As far as they and those of us who were trapped in their universe were concerned  the world did not exist. They wouldn't notice anything happening outside themselves.  Could you ask for a better example of solipsism?I can't believe people think this is one of the greatest films ever made a great romance etc.  If you want to see a great romance rent Notorious or Live Flesh or I could go on and on.  Just like the movie.  But I won't.I fear that this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes.

It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world.

I've been on plenty of dates to know how they work so I certainly don't need to waste my time watching other people do it. The two characters in the movie have extended conversations broken up about every ten minutes to change the scenery and give you a chance to wake up. The conversations are mundane and often pointless. It's like watching a reality TV show only without all the drama that makes it interesting.The acting is subpar. Ethan Hawke was okay though his character was extremely annoying. Julie Delpy on the other hand delivered her lines devoid of any emotion. Her way of attempting emotion was to simply stare out the window.This movie appeared to be made simply because the writer wanted other people to hear his ideas about life. This is fine as many movies have been made for this purpose. However the flaw here is that this is the only point to the movie. There isn't any connecting plot at all just a series of conversations. The movie Tape also w Ethan Hawke is also just a series of conversations though the only setting is one hotel room and the movie is actually just one really long scene. However Tape actually is entertaining in that the conversations have a point and actually move the characters to some sort of resolution or change  this is where Before Sunrise fails.To sum up if you have insomnia this film is your cure. Or if you're a hermit and you miss having conversations with people then this will provide for a substitute to interacting with others...just don't plan to be entertained.".

I liked the basic idea of two strangers falling in love in a nice Vienna scenery. But even beautiful Vienna couldn't save this movie. Well American guy and French girl meet on a BudapestParis train I'm not sure if there ever was a direct BudapestParis train but whatever there are direct BudapestVienna trains and that's pretty much enough for us. The boy convinces the girl to get off the train with him in Vienna and spend the rest of the day with him. Sounds sweet right? From now on the movie is nothing but talking and talking and talking. Which wouldn't exactly be bad but in 9 scenes out of 10 they are talking so many deepwannabe nonsense that made me have a slight nausea from about the 15th minute. I would have loved this movie much better with some likable notsosmartass characters. Maybe I will give a try to the sequel Before Sunset God save me it's also an 8 I hope it's a much deserved 8. But before that I need some time to recover.".

He drifts farther apart from Zoret and their relationship begins to crumble...Being a gay man and a film addict I was surprised I had never heard of this film! It just popped up unannounced on TCM and I'm glad I taped it. A 1924 film dealing with gay men was way ahead of its time. Their relationship is not made explicitit's mostly communicated by looks gestures dialogue and in one instance hand holding. Still that was groundbreaking for that day. It does have the predictable tragic ending...but that was the way it would have to end. It was refreshing to see that their relationship was portrayed as no big deal and no one makes a fuss over it. Very well done.The acting is just great. It's astonishing to see Slezak so young and handsome and THIN. Christensen was just great too. Gregor isn't that goodbut she's not given much to work with. Also this was beautifully directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The version I saw also had a very good music score given to in by Kino International in 2004.A very good groundbreaking movie. It really deserves a wider audience. I give it an 8 because it IS a little slow at times.".

The lighting is great creating a very clear and crisp picture with many subtle effects. And the interior furnishings are lush.Michael is a moving film and I think that has more to do with the photography and settings than with the drama. The implicit homosexual relationship between the artist and his model Michael is curious though. What I especially like about the narrative however is that it's about arta very apt subject which is heightened by the photography. Benjamin Christensen plays the aging artist which is a significant casting decision given that he was the great Danish filmmaker to precede Dreyer. Christensen had worked as an actor in his own films so he's fully capable in this role. Additionally cinematographer Karl Freund who changed the role of the camera the same year in The Last Laugh has a small role as an art dealer.Overall Dreyer does better here with the actors than he previously had. He achieves a nice pacing as well except for a few mistimed editing cues which are too quick. Even the subplot for mood affect works.

An older man is attracted to a younger and the younger while primarily attracted to women is willing to be the object of adoration provided that it pays well. In this film the older painter is taken at every opportunity by his younger model and ward. And somehow the younger man is not painted as being a complete villain.Also of interest to me was a minor subplot when the famous artist is attempting to paint a princess who has commissioned a portrait the artist struggles more than he has with any other painting The earlier paintings that we see are all of men In this one he simply cannot get the eyes right. His young modelward who first came to him as an aspiring painter makes an attempt and gets it right at his first go. Perhaps what was symbolized here was that the eyes are the windows to the soul and the famous painter who's only attracted to men cannot see into the souls of women while his young ward who has slept with the woman at this point can do so easily.This film was remarkably well made for its day and while it does show some creaky signs of age it is much more modern appearing than many of the films that came out of Hollywood much later. The movie was fascinating even with no sound which made a Swan Lake ballet sequence seem a bit weird and the subtitles in the print I saw were in Danish English translations were handed out before the show but did little good in a darkened theatre.If you want to see fully one half of all gay themed films released in the 20's in one go this may be your ticket. BTW... the other gay themed film made in the 20's Flesh and the Devil 1926 has much less gay oriented theme and is also available on VHS".

Of course this is a German silent film and in those days when movies didn't talk all one had to do was change the subtitles and film was really universal. Such is the case with Michael a romantic triangle the apex of which was Walter Slezak in his salad days. He was beloved by both an aristocratic artist and one carnal princess.In less than a decade when the Nazis took over and made the UFA Studio their personal propaganda reserve such homoerotic work like Michael would not see the light of day for years. I'm really surprised that a print existed and that TCM obtained one. I would have thought Josef Goebbels would have burned all he could find.Without a kiss without an embrace but with a look of love that tells all we know exactly what the relationship Benjamin Christiansen has with Slezak. Slezak plays the title role a callow youth a willing user of the affections of all in the same manner Murray Head was in Sunday Bloody Sunday. Slezak was quite the hunk in his youth to those of us who remember him from Hollywood in the Forties.Nora Gregor plays the princess who eyes Slezak like a side of beef on the meat rack at the Playgirl Club. He's getting tired of Christiansen anyway so he's hot to trot as his she.Christiansen is a sad and lonely old man and his performance really drives the film. His and Slezak's relationship also reminds me a bit of the famous relationship played out in the tabloids of Scott Thorson and Liberace. Another young cutie who was showered with everything but just wanted his own space.It's a good thing this gay themed story did survive and is available now for home viewing on DVD. A great piece of gay cinematic history.".

	schema:headline " An Alist collaboration and in many ways a milestone in adult cinema.";
	schema:reviewBody "Strange as it may seem as a huge horror movie fan I couldn't pass up watching this silent drama even though it has absolutely nothing to do with horror. For starters it was directed by Carl Th. Dreyer who is possibly most famous for THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC 1928 but also made the genre classics VAMPYR 1932 and VREDENS DAG 1943. Even though this was filmed in Germany during a time of heavy government control of film output Dreyer managed to secure full artistic control over this particular production. It stars Benjamin Christensen who directed HAXAN 1921 one of the strangest and most bizarre and most innovative of all horror movies silent era or not. The interiors were shot by Karl Freund who later directed the horror classics THE MUMMY 1932 and MAD LOVE 1935 at Universal and would win two Oscars during his long and distinguished career. Freud also makes his first and only onscreen appearance here playing an art dealer in a single scene. Exteriors were shot by Rudolph Mat a fivetime Oscar nominee who also directed the science fiction classic WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE in 1951. The basis for the film was Herman Bang's novel Mikal which was adapted by the director and Thea von Harbou the latter being well known for her collaborations with thenhusband Fritz Lang. Her writing credits include METROPOLIS 1927 M 1931 and a whole series of Dr. Mabuse films. So from top to bottom a bunch of very talented and influential filmmakers and production people worked on this particular film. The lineup of talent itself should appeal to a wide range of classic film fans and not just horror buffs like myself. The content also secures this film an audience even today as it's one of the first films to ever deal with homosexuality in a mature way. In fact I really can't recall a film made prior to this one to include such content. For 1924 it must have been a very bold and courageous project for these people to take on.The main character in MICHAEL isn't really Michael himself but an established older artist by the name of Claude Zulot played very well by Christensen. Over the years Claude has become a wealthy and acclaimed painter specializing in human portraits. When approached by the youthful almost angeliclooking artist Michael Walter Slezak Claude tells him his own sketches need some work but he'll let him become his muse and model. Five years later the men are still working  and living  together but their relationship crumbles once an attractive destitute countess Nora Gregor stumbles onto the scene. Michael starts seeing more of her and less of Claude at first behind Claude's back but eventually with little regard for his feelings. Before long Michael abandons his mentor for the countess and moves out of the home but continues to pop in from time to time to see Claude. Those visits usually end in Michael needing financial assistance whether it be willingly offered to him or stolen. Though the relationship between the men is played off as an adopted son type thing to the public it's obvious there's much more going on beneath the surface. This is evidenced by scenes of Claude's loneliness and agony over his abandonment the sense of betrayal a scene where the countess discovers a love letter and many other subtle moments. Adding another dimension to the story is the presence of a journalist named Charles Robert Garrison whose unwavering care and support for Claude hints at the kind of unrequited romantic love Claude unwisely tried to find with Michael. The people who truly care for and love you will be willing to put up with your hangups. The people who truly care for and love you will be with you at the end. Interestingly on the sidelines there's a contrasted love triangle between a man his wife and a young duke she's having an affair with almost as if to say Hey we ALL have the same feelings the same relationship problems and go through the same exact things whether we're male or female gay or straight. Seems simple enough but it took a lot of courage to put this message on the screen back in 1924. Unfortunately the whole moral crusade and censorship took hold soon after this was made in much of the world and gay characters weren't tolerated in mainstream cinema unless they were comically exaggerated or hidden behind so much metaphor and subtext you'd need a decoder to spot them. While the content here is subtle by conventional standards the movie does not shy away from it. Homosexuality is portrayed through adoring looks touching the hair the shoulders the arms and holding hands as well as through emotional reactions to the various events going on. The movie is extremely well made for its time both in technical terms and in terms of content. The acting from the principals is very very good and the insight into relationships are relatable to basically anyone who has ever been in one.".

Seems simple enough but it took a lot of courage to put this message on the screen back in 1924. Unfortunately the whole moral crusade and censorship took hold soon after this was made in much of the world and gay characters weren't tolerated in mainstream cinema unless they were comically exaggerated or hidden behind so much metaphor and subtext you'd need a decoder to spot them. While the content here is subtle by conventional standards the movie does not shy away from it. Homosexuality is portrayed through adoring looks touching the hair the shoulders the arms and holding hands as well as through emotional reactions to the various events going on. The movie is extremely well made for its time both in technical terms and in terms of content. The acting from the principals is very very good and the insight into relationships are relatable to basically anyone who has ever been in one.";

Naturally it failed financially and critically although when Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc 1928 and became auteur it has since been revisited and praised but it should be a film that any cinephile should see especially those with an interest in the origins of Queer Cinema and the depiction of homosexuality in film. Benjamin Christensen perhaps best known as director of the silent docuhorror masterpiece Haxan 1922 is masterful as Zoret his face darkened with sadness subtle jealousy and tragic sentiment. Slazek and Gregor fair less well and suffer in comparison to Christensen's depiction. Although the climax is predictable it has a feeling of inevitably which makes it fittingly moving and quite beautiful similar in many ways to the ending of Dreyer's Ordet 1955. But the film is surprisingly rich and luscious with Dreyer's usual blank canvas and bleak settings replaced by detailed sets all captured by cinematographer's Rudolph Mate and Karl Freund who appears here as art dealer Le Blanc and would go on to work on some Universal's finest horror output in the 1930's.

This happens to have been the preferred arrangement in the ancient world as well.I will note at this moment that this aspect of the film did not hold a great deal of personal interest for me my eye was drawn more to the heaving bosom of one of the noblewomen.The theme is handled quite discreetly. Could contemporary audiences have missed it entirely? But the film would have had no point then. This presumed relationship is conveyed mostly through glances and tone plus one more explicit statement at the end.Since the model is also the painter's adopted son much of the drama takes the form of parent vs. petulant ungrateful offspring  more traditional subject matter in other words. The son takes up with a pretty princess disappointing his father.Some of the character definition is unusual. The father smokes a pipe with a very long stem like Bilbo Baggins or some other hobbit. An artist's affectation? The son has a sensitive side he's a big fan of Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Coogan in The Kid 1921. Blatant movie references are very common now but it's really strange to see one in 1924.I referred to the GraecoRoman world earlier. If there are any classical analogies at work here then this is a JupiterGanymede story where Ganymede runs off with one of Io Europa or Callisto. Officially Ganymede was Jupiter's cupbearer and this film has a recurrent leitmotif involving a set of English glasses. Coincidence? But I think I am seeing subtext when there really isn't any. Perhaps there were mythological strands running through the original novel.I personally found this scenario to be fairly overwrought and uninvolving. However there is a very fine performance by Benjamin Christensen as the painter plus simply standout photography and set decoration. These upperclass rooms are even more finely appointed than the ones in Mockery directed by Christensen in 1927 and that was an MGM production. Overall credit is due to director Carl Dreyer for the film's virtues.The print which was shown at Cinematheque Ontario is part of a touring Christensen retrospective which had played in September at MOMA in New York. The booklet produced for the New York screenings is a very good one Benjamin Christensen An International Dane edited by Jytte Jensen.The film itself was actually entitled Michael and had intertitles in German. The original novelist I'm sure was billed as Hermann Bong sic rather than Herman Bang while the young lovers were called Eugene Michael and Princess Zamikow rather than Mikal and Zamikoff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael 1924 is Carl Th Dreyer's first mature romantic drama. It does not deliver on the level that he would reach even a year later with Master of the House or in 1928 with The Passion of Joan of Arc. There are a few things to latch onto stylistically that can be viewed as things to come. A few set pieces a few shots use of shadows reflected on the walls but for the most part the set as the story itself is baroque which Dreyer will quickly abandon for stripped down austerity in the near future. The acting style was still highly theatrical and not what one thinks of when Dreyer comes to mind and is probably one of the leading reasons that the characters never quite really get their emotional impact across. With everything baroque and everything keyed up it only serves to create a barrier between the story and performances and the audience. Yet Michael is still very much ahead of its time with very obvious homosexual and bisexual undertones that at times read more as overtones tones which Dreyer ultimately backs off of slightly by the end of the film. This subtext is by far the most intriguing element of the film. Michael is a love triangle between an older famous painter Claude Benjamin Christensen of Haxan fame his young muse Michael Walter Slezak and a Princess Nora Gregor just for good measure. Michael and the Princess elope and Claude foots the bill mostly either directly or indirectly. It is only in the last ten minutes of the film when the viewer Is fully informed of what Claude has gone through to ensure a good life for Michael which is having his art dealer secretly buy all of the paintings he gives Michael as presents that Michael in turn sells. Claude dying leaves everything to Michael. On his deathbed he request to see Michael one last time yet Michael will not leave Princess Zamikoff's side which we see in an odd cutaway to their apartment where they skulk and act like junkies for some reason. It is in these final moments that the pain of the unrequited gay love between Claude and Michael is truly felt which helps to save some of the more extraneous and uneven subplots and lack of any real depth outside of superficial pontifications on death religion and art.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the Carl Theodor Dreyer motion pictures that I have recently seen the more mature and the one that shows a better knowledge of the film medium is Michael a production financed and shot in Germany after he made Love One Another. The obvious mistakes are more related to editing than to mise en camra and even that is not abundant. Dreyer stylishly uses space light and the depth and height of the decors abstaining from the Expressionist frenzy that characterized a good part of German cinema after The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920. Based on the novel Mikal by Herman Bang this is one of the most impressive studies of narcissism among the films that I have seen and one of the most moving dramas on homosexuality in old age that I know. I find admirable is that a film from 1924 shows an understanding of human nature similar to a drama as Happy Together rather than recent bursts of sweat and semen that have pretended to explain narcissistic delight and homosexual love in epidermic explicit ways. We should also remember that this is a motion picture from 1924 if it may illustrate ideas that today may seem as prejudice or whenever we react negatively to the resources of 1920s cinema in makeup costumes acting style or technical shortcomings yet to be perfected to erase the efforts to convey an impression of reality. Less problematic I believe are the direction and especially the writing. Behind the adaptation there is a key name in the history of cinema Fritz Lang's exwife Thea Von Harbou who remained in Germany when her husband fled from the Nazis. By 1924 Harbou and Lang had already collaborated in The Weary Death and the first two parts of Dr. Mabuse and next would come Spies Die Nibelungen Metropolis Woman in the Moon M The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and the diptych The Tiger of Eschnapur and The Indian Tomb. Harbou excelled in adventures sciencefiction and exotic melodramas genres almost absent in Lang's American filmography but here she is more than adequate describing a homosexual liaison tinted with economic interest loneliness and a narcissistic game of mirrors in the story of a painter and the young male model to whom he gives all his possessions which are then spent by the boy in an affair with a ruined and unscrupulous princess. The theme of Death is present throughout the tale and it is duplicated in the story of an affair between a count and a young woman married to an old man. Besides Von Harbou Michael includes firstrate personnel in other roles the cinematographer is Expressionist maestro Karl Freund director of photography of The Last Man Metropolis Berlin Symphony of a Great City and Tod Browning's Dracula who also plays a art dealer the painter is played by Danish director Benjamin Christensen the maker of The Witch and the Italian operatic diva Nora Gregor leading lady in Renoir's The Rule of the Game plays the princess. For the role of Michael Dreyer used beautiful blond actor Walter Slezak born under the sign of Taurus and as a good son of the bull too much attracted to good food and wine. When he reached 30 he had already lost his slenderness and in spite of his big expressive blue eyes for the industry he was too a chubby fellow to be a leading man. However when he migrated to the United States he became an instant sensation in Broadway winning a Tony award. In films he had a more discrete participation but he also had other unforgettable roles as the Nazi sailor in Alfred Hichcock's propaganda drama Lifeboat and as Rock Hudson's feisty majordomo in Come September turning his boss' Italian villa into a hotel during his absence except every September. A good work of restoration Michael includes a dense 1993 score by Pierre Oser.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of the Carl Theodor Dreyer motion pictures that I have recently seen the more mature and the one that shows a better knowledge of the film medium is Michael a production financed and shot in Germany after he made Love One Another. The obvious mistakes are more related to editing than to mise en camra and even that is not abundant. Dreyer stylishly uses space light and the depth and height of the decors abstaining from the Expressionist frenzy that characterized a good part of German cinema after The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920.

	schema:headline " Excellent Early Gay Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a German silent film. Obviously it would take Hollywood at least half a century longer to get anywhere near this subject in such a natural manner and in many ways still to this day it has not produced anything to compare to this sensitive portrayal about an aging master painter Benjamin Christensen who takes a male modelhustler and aspiring painter Walter Slezak under his protection. Soon however their relationship begins to change when both men encounter the gorgeous Princess Zamikoff Nora Gregor who is supposed to be ruined but happens to be on her way to the opera when she makes a visit to commission her portrait and comes back later dressed to kill with an outfit that must have cost a fortune and that we must assume she did not pay for herself.This clearly indicates that the Princess is a professional golddiggerhustler and though not a courtesan certainly someone in the related business of living by her charms with enough savoirfaire to be part of the trade. This is an important character trait of the woman in the triangle because it makes perfect sense within the context of codependent sex relationships She is hustling Michael as much as Michael hustles the painter and that is the actual mechanism of the relationship.This is an excellent Dreyer film not quite popular or well know here for the subject matter being an early example of a homosexual relationship. Most importantly both of the men involved are portrayed as virile and masculine there is no cross dressing hilarity of character or the usual histrionics that was the sole monolithic identity of gay men in an American cultural context until the arrival of Brokeback Mountain. Some viewers may be in such denial as to the existence of a gay life for straightlooking men that they may debate that the film is not about homosexuality as one of the men gets involved in a heterosexual relationship and I completely disagree with this stance as most gay men are actually like the ones in this movie and not like the more flamboyant part of the group that naturally steal the limelight and distort the statistical truth. The complexities and variety of homosexual experience either in gay men or women have always posed a challenge on the imagination and intelligence of society but we can not deny that there was much more than simple friendship between these two men if only because there had to be a valid reason for Michael to accept money gifts and also steal as much from the painter. However because there were an infinite amount of choices by means of which this could have been clarified and certainly there are earlier movies that showed it was done in Germany Different from the Others for example 1919 I see this important detail as an error in character development and that's why I have given it an 8 ranking.The cinematography by Rudolph Mate and Karl Freund is exquisitely handled. All details of decor furnishing and costume are lavish and within the cultural context of the period. We see the subtle transitioning from Art Nouveau to early Deco in the differences between the older painter's home and the younger hustler's apartment.The character of the suffering selfsacrificing older lover in a relationship is a very 19th Century attitude and romantic posturing that reached a climax with Dumas famous Dame aux Camelias that became the Camille of the stage and movie adaptations as well as Verdi's Traviata in opera. Christensen's devoted love for Michael even when he discovers his thievery and baseness is part of that sociocultural heritage the extreme of which had been Oscar Wilde in the generation before the one in this movie which went one step further in the 'sacrifice' to self destruction. Within this context the painter's plight is totally believable and acceptable but aside from the artistic beauty of the film itself the important message that comes through is the validity and truth of that love.".

I really think that in 1924 this was MEANT to be the point but the film never directly said thisat least this is so with the English language version. Perhaps the European version was more explicit.Why do I say this? Well the film is about a brilliant painter and his musefavorite model. Both are men and late in the film the aging painter referred to the young man as his adopted son and heir but this seemed like a cover for the truth. Instead it seemed like a love triangle as the two men were happy and successful living together until the model met a woman and began taking the old guy for granted AND mistreating him badly. The painter for his part seemed like a dependent lover who never stood up to the young man for his mistreatment. In the end when the old man died he really seemed to have died from a broken heart after it was apparent that the younger man was never returning.I sure wish I had a time machine so I could meet with the director Dreyer to determine if this gay subtext was intended. It sure seemed this way and the way they explained it all away seemed tough to believeit just didn't seem to fit. In addition most everyone reviewing this film also thought it was about homosexuality and I am sure they'd like a clear and unequivocal answer.Now as for the film it was wonderfully madewith some great camera work and a decent plot for a silent. Not a masterpiece but a very good and unjustly forgotten filmone of Dreyer's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult for me to write a negative review for a Dryer film but I found Michael to be extremely confused on every level. I was left with the overall impression that it was little more than a tiresome succession of knowing looks glowering eyes arched eyebrows still portraits and stilted dialog. Starting with the story even allowing for the times the relationship between Michael and the Master is anything but clear. At first we're left with the impression they were lovers but as the film progresses this becomes less and less certain. As a homosexual Michael could not be attracted to the Countess yet he is and ultimately betrays the Master for her. So does he then take up with the Master for the comforts provided by him? That would make him a gigolo of the worst kind but Dryer avoids even that label one that would be easy and natural. It's easy to make allowances for the times but Germany in the twenties was culturally and intellectually an open and experimental society. Yes a film about overt homosexuals might have received negative attention but was not beyond the pale. How much of a superior film this would have been had Michael been more clearly portrayed as a homosexual albeit a confused one who uncertain of his sexuality seeks to define himself through his affair with the Countess. Or as a bisexual either a mercenary one who seeks the easiest path to the comforts of life or a conflicted one torn by his love for the Master and the Countess.As for the technical aspects I'm also baffled by the editing. In the scene between the Master and the art dealer the Master is shown sitting then standing facing the art dealer then again sitting then again standing. In the Master's death scene his valet is shown crying and walking away and then adjusting the Master's pillow. And these are the obvious ones. And the dialog could not have been more convoluted. If anything it contributed to the overwhelming confusion. Could Dryer really intend to release the film like this?In the final analysis is this film worth seeing? Of course and for four reasons given here in no particular order a thin Walter Slezak in his second film Benjamin Christensen as actor instead of director the subject matter and because after all it is a Dryer film. Hence my rating of four out of ten.".

This here was one of the director's lesser seen films but over the past decade or so it has become quite popular for being an early example of a homosexual relationship. Some could debate that the film isn't about homosexuality and I somewhat agree with his stance but I also see why some might think there was more to the two men's relationship. Either way over the years I really haven't been too much of a fan of Dreyer's and I found this film much like the rest of his work. The biggest problem I had with this film as well as others from the director is that I never really get caught up in the stories. The stories always take second billing to the wonderful visual style and cinematography which some might love but I'd also like to have a better story mixed in. Even with that said the movie is still worth watching due to the cinematography by Rudolph Mate and Karl Freund. Freund handled all the interior shots and these are the most impressive of the film. The sets are very beautiful and the film follows that German Expressionist mood perfectly. Christensen director of the masterpiece Haxan delivers a very strong performance and this is easy to spot towards the end of the film. I won't ruin the ending but Christensen's performance perfectly nails every moment. Slezak is also very good but I didn't care too much for Gregor.".

Still the movie is worth seeing as an important part of film history and in particular as part of LGBTthemed cinema.That's how it should be spelled.PS Benjamin Christensen had previously directed and starred in the witchthemed Hxan and Walter Slezak later played the Clock King on the 1960s Batman.";

So that means there was certainly no flaming flamboyancy or any campingitup happening in this decidedly selfconscious production whatsoever.Directed by Danish filmmaker Carl Dreyer  From my perspective  Michael was too much of a lovetriangle soap opera for the most part.And on top of that  This film clearly did not come at all close to matching the cinematically innovative intensity that was soon to follow 4 years later with Dreyer's crowning achievement The Passion of Joan of Arc.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that I rarely watch LGBTrelated films. This silent film deals with the relationship between the famed painter Claude Zoret his model Michael and how this is altered by the arrival of a woman Countess Zamikow.Officially Zoret adopted Michael because he didn't want to die childless. Remember that the film was made in 1924. At that time it was almost impossible to overtly depict a gay love story. There are no kisses tender embraces or handholding.Dreyer has invented a clever plot device to make us learn about the true nature of the two men's relationship. He has added a subplot involving a heterosexual love triangle. The viewers compare the two triangles and recognize the similarities. They are both of the same kind with the exception that in the heterosexual triangle the scorned Count Adelsskjold challenges his rival to a duel  in which the latter is killed. Zoret's love for Michael is unselfish and unconditional. The film can be seen as a support for sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld's statement that homosexuality was part of the plan of nature and creation just like normal love.Benjamin Christensen who directed Witchcraft through the Ages 1922 is excellent as the unfortunate Zoret. The difference between Chistensen and Slezak can be summarized as follows Chistensen is acting Slezak is posing.Although Countess Zamikow is bankrupt she still hires Zoret to paint a picture of her. Zoret has difficulties with painting her eyes satisfactorily. Michael manages it. This can be interpreted that only a man who fancies women can capture the beauty of a woman's eyes. Zoret is gay and has only painted male models while Michael is bisexual or heterosexual. The viewers really don't get to know if Michael really loved Zoret or if he only regarded him as a sugar daddy gay for pay.Michael falls in love with Countess Zamikow. She is constant penniless so Michael sells his Master's sketches to pay her debts. He goes so far that he sells Zoret's greatest painting of him The Victor. Zoret is aware of it buys it back and returns it to Michael.".
