A movie when men still were men and where women are merely playthings or just not to be trusted. But there are some twists most notably when Belmondo to slow down his opponents tells the owner of a filling station that the pursuant truck team is a gay couple ! A very daring thing for such a classic macho action flick from 1964. And there is much more to be discovered in the multilayered fastpaced dialogue courtesy of specialist Michel Audiard. Almost impossible to translate directly into English you have to get the original version and have more then a basic mastery of the French language. It was filmed entirely on location as far as I can deduce the Moroccan desert or could it be former French Tunisia ? and all stuntwork with the big trucks is of course for real. There exists a colorized version but it is in the terrible flat panandscan format and gives it the look of a seventies' TVmovie. The original sharpfocused blackandwhite copy fits much better the story and characters. Recently French public TV also choose to air this version in its scope format. Director Verneuil went on to make another five movies with Belmondo with the final one Les Morfalous in 1984 again set in the desert but now during WW II and the truck being replaced by a German tank !If you like this try another of those French sixties buddymovies as Les Aventuriers also with Ventura but now with that other French superstar Alain Delon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greed In The Sun is a 1964 movie that is a time capsule a view of a world long gone where expatriate French nationals live and work in a heavily Arabic North African country. This movie was filmed in part in Marrakesh Morocco where at one point the camera pans across the primitive tanneries in that city as the characters walk to their destination. In the movie the city is identified as Le Moussorah a name that exists only on the hotel sign and mile markers made as set dressing for this movie. The movie itself deals with the truck drivers who transport goods through the desert and over mountainous terrain . Those drivers include JeanPaul Belmondo and Lino Ventura playing buddies who work for Gert Frobe's trucking company.Gert Frobe's character has the best lines in the movie but he vanishes after arranging for a newly hired driver to take a mysterious shipment of goods to Salem. Rocco Belmondo's character steals the truck and Frobe pays Marec Lino Ventura to recover the truck. Marec is not very good at that job another company truck driver Mitch Mitch helps him out three separate times when Marec has problems. Why Frobe did not hire the more competent MitchMitch for the job is anyone's guess.In Greed In The Sun the female characters are treated as secondclass humans dummies good for sex and not much else. The Arab characters are treated worse lackeys there to serve their European masters. For that matter the drivers don't come out looking very good either. Marec is a thug who demolishes a roadside store and Rocco is a greedy pig.In France there is on sale a Bluray version of Greed In The Sun a new restoration where the black and white photography looks crystal clear. French only though and no optional English subtitles. For one scene at the end there are large old fashioned hard coded French subtitles which indicates to me that the original camera negative is missing. Otherwise we would have new subtitles for this short segment.The American DVD release of Greed In The Sun is a disaster using an older print having large white hard coded English subtitles. The subtitles themselves leave out stuff and have errors. I made subtitles using English subtitles from an Internet site where the subs had exact timing but the translation and grammar were off.The 1960s were the peak decade for director Henri Verneuil a decade he ended with his great crime film The Sicilian Clan a movie that also starred Lino Ventura. Thanks to computer technology I was able to make a DVD of Greed In The Sun that combined the Bluray movie with optional onoff English subtitles in a nicer font subs that I edited.In this movie the scenes that stand out for me are when the trucks drive through the center of the city identified as Le Moussorah. You see swarms of people walking all over the plaza with cars parked in a group on one side. 1964 and the location unit filming here showed how crowded this Southern Algeria city already was. The place looked really depressing a giant flea market look to it baking under the sun. No wonder people who live in crowded places like that look to migrate to nicer locations.".

One would have to be a bit nave not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any freethinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampirewerewolf stories.  This aspect along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.

I unlike a lot of fans will not claim that this is a move masterpiece I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I however will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now at first I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it on DVD and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning Lycans Werewolves vrs. Vampires is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying after falling in love with this film to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history their is a false history their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters as they would be in real life with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending the promise of more characters from the past. MEans that even if you weren't sure about this film the sequel Underworld Evolution looks like it will be amazing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Underworld sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget mainstream movie I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well the more elaborate scenes are disjointed confused and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in The Untouchables you see an illustration of why less is better and Underworld expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a Godzilla film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest headsplitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in Kill Bill Vol.1 i.e. a delay in the actual detachmentI don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate because there are ways to show this i.e. a line that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense although the climax is somewhat surprising. But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie. All this is very true but add intelligence subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range you have to watch Alice Through the Looking Glass for the best evidence of that but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design lighting and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line if you like the genre appreciate stylish production design and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.".

She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie. All this is very true but add intelligence subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range you have to watch Alice Through the Looking Glass for the best evidence of that but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design lighting and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line if you like the genre appreciate stylish production design and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.";

Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark Gothic and brooding which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver.  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel and the sequel should follow Underworld with real impact as well.".

	schema:headline " Underworld. A new legend is born.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start this review by saying that while this work is NOT scary it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of Horror strictly due to the monster factor. There are tense moments to be sure but this is not a boo! kind of movie. There is however plenty of action lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of highdollar effects the almost Riceian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish mansion the gritty tension held throughout the movie and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.The effects were so well done they were believable. They explain that the older Lycan can change at will regardless of the moon's cycle...with that in mind the way the werewolves' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON. Changing at will would BE like that especially in times of anger or great stress. Someone possibly Wiseman? had heard and correctly believed that less is more because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not...simply more Hollywood Matrix flash. These scenes were so well done so well directed filmed and portrayed that we could even if for a short time believe the things we were watching...were possible. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. It reminded me if the horribly campy westernvampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled Sundown where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets.I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director. I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man. He was also one of the writers of the original literary work. If this is his first attempt we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg. Personally I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock. The weaponry Selene Kate Beckinsale utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater. When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles was absolutely excellent. AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of The Matrix. The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies and frankly I just don't see it. Also Blade has been used as a source of comparison. The only similarities between Blade and Underworld are that Viktor the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of Pure Bloods uses a sword. Oh and there are Vampires. Those were the ONLY common points as far as I could tell. This is an original work not a petty ripoff or a jumble of other movies. This is a very creative and unique attempt a successful one if you ask me. While guns were used more than I would have liked the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard actionflick fare. One of the vampire Death Dealers uses a pair of 10' whips quite well. And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned...what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power. The costumes were kept simple yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood. Two words...understated elegance. Absolutely brilliant. Some have said that the story line is hard to follow or that there is no discernible plot. Let me be frank. This is not a movie for the squeamish nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot. Sure there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather. The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael Scott Speedman is well written and pleasantly portrayed in the midst of all that darkness and drama. A bit of candlelight to shine hope into the darkness of despair as it were. The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic with enough additional plot and subplot to keep even the most common moviegoer interested. The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years. The Lycan once the serving class to the Vampire had risen against their masters and won their freedom. But was that the real story? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long? In the center of this war are Selene Vampire and Michael Lycan. Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love? As one of the chosen Death Dealers an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans Selene is faced with a decision most dire sell out and live? or be true to herself and die? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice? And that is where the subplot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say Oh wow! No kidding?! at the darkling twists in the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this work and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection. Superb acting rich depth of character talented creative directing and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies for me. It earns an ambitious 9.710 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "Underworld culls two races from mythology vampires and werewolves and has them coexisting in the same setting. While the two are staples of the horror genre Dracula and The Wolf Man this doesn't play out like a traditional horror movie. This action packed story will please horror fans and convert new ones due to the melding of movie types to create a fresh interpretation to a century old genre.A male human Scott Speedman unwittingly becomes involved in an on going war between vampires and werewolves. When a female vampire Kate Beckinsale notices the werewolves following this human she becomes suspicious and begins to investigate why he is so important even if it changes everything she has ever known about her life and vampire history.This monster movie follows the ageold traditions established in the early novels by Bram Stoker and movies Werewolf Of London featuring vampires and lycanthropes. Of late there's been some wannabe trendy horror movies that have thrown the standards out the window. Those standards are comforting and we the audience expect to see them. Vampires deteriorate in sunlight leading to instant death. Werewolves can only be killed by a silver bullet. Underworld takes these traditions builds on them and makes them their own.While it reads as a horror it plays more like a gangster movie. Both races participate in gunplay with specially modified bullets to instantly kill their opponents. The werewolves are brutish goons wannabe gangsters with more brawn than brains. On the flip side the vampires are like a communal family with hierarchy ancient customs and they're legitimate business owners which funds their criminal endeavours.Due to the aforementioned gunplay this is more violent than gory. It's still bloody but there are no scenes that'll make you queasy or nauseous. The violence is another reason why it has a gangster feel about it.There's a class system subtext that runs through this movie. The lower class werewolves battling the upper class vampires. Working class is possibly a better adjective for the werewolves. They are masculine unkempt and unsophisticated. On the other hand the gothic vampires are immaculately dressed with a expensive sense of style. They lounge around looking glamourous as if they're supermodels at a cocktail party. Opulence and high class is the style the production and costume designer has given these blood suckers.Beckinsale's quite fetching in her erotic PVC full body costume. Her bondage like outfit's more interesting than her intentionally emotionless performance. One wonders why she didn't keep her British accent as the cast is made up of international actors with a potpourri of different brogues? It's good to see her in a lead role above the title credit where she holds her own portraying a strong forceful character. Of late she's played the glorified girlfriend part eg. Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. Here she's independent without a partner to justify her significance. While this is the kind of role a man would normally play she's still feminine and sexy without having to show any flesh.Bill Nighy has a supporting role as an elder vampire who's resurrected before his time in order to help Beckinsale. Nighy's rightfully become popular in the last few years. He's adept in any part he plays even a centuriesold vampire with superhuman strength. His climatic fight scene never draws unintentional laughs which shows what a convincing actor he is.The other name star of this movie is Bacardi. Product placement is rife during the opening sequence in an underground train station. This is quite surprising when you watch the entire movie.Never at any time is there any indication where and when this movie is set. The gothic architecture and vehicle licence plates have you thinking that this could be somewhere in Europe. There are no title cards characters speak with differing accents and there are no recognizable landmarks used as locations. All we do know is is that where ever they are they have Bacardi. If the moviemakers were trying to create a nondescript world alien from our own then why use blatant product placement for Bacardi?The colour film stock has been manipulated intentionally to give a blue hue to it. This reinforces the gothic style of the movie. Blue isn't just a colour it's also an emotion. It's constantly raining which adds to the cold look the cinematographer and production designer have created. These races are unemotional people which also strengthens the blue tone.Computer generated visual effects were used for the movie which is far removed from John Landis' An American Werewolf In London. While the special effects are impressive there is no mystery into how they were achieved. Special effects and make up were a real art form before the days of CGI. These technicians are a dying breed due to computers. It's a shame that moviemakers rely heavily on CGI as it's slowly becoming run of the mill.Overall Underworld's a good actionhorrorgangster movie with a strong female lead. This hybrid is filled with polished set pieces and seamless CGI. There's talk that this is the first of a proposed trilogy and I hope the next two will be as strong as this.".

I just got back from seeing it and I must say that this movie should stand up pretty well in the face of all the ridiculous read pointless useless Matrix Crow Blade comparisons. I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true I don't really care this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.  Underworld really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets highly Victorian as they are also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book I can tell. It certainly has the look feel and story of one yet that still doesn't make it bad.  Speaking of the story though it isn't strong it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.As for the action scenes they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly there isn't that much gore here either.  But what is really surprising is that the movie doesn't offer us pointless action scenes to fill in for lack of story there's actually meaning behind it all.Underworld is a pretty welldone fantasy that deserves to be immortalized in the comics.910".

The plot  Kate Beckinsale is a vampire looking incredibly hot in ridiculously tight leather matrix style clothes whose job it is to eliminate the werewolves as part of the centuries old war between the two species. Her acting is good too. Things change when Beckinsale tries to protect a human Speedman who is targetted by the werewolves for some reasons. The movie has a distinctively Gothic look with great attention given to the backdrop. Every inch of the cinematography is polished. The architecture and costumes are true fashion statements. This world is so dense with aggressiveness it is almost surreal. Borrowing from The Matrix and Blade the director Len Wiseman made Underworld more of a goth action flick n less of a vampirewerewolf. Nonetheless pretty enjoyable action flick. Was happy that none of those hand held shaky cam stuff was added.".

Um...gee...last I checked Vampires REGENERATED!  Blood loss?  Agggghhhh...Werewolves climb on the walls instead of bounding after you?  Why not call them SpiderWolves?

Some pretty cool direction at times...a handful of cool shots.In short if you care nothing about plot dialogue story acting pacing or Vampiric and Lycan mythology this is YOUR movie.  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 on the IMDB scale.  Why?  Because it wouldn't let me rate it any lower than that.  Strike one.  Two.  Three.".

It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped walked shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature why didn't they drink blood and as others have pointed out how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn they are still vulnerable to sunlight but there isn't any during the whole film.Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was that everybody ended up killing each other.I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying that there will be a showdown in the end. Let me just say that they should really really have used a standinstuntman for poor old Viktor.

Mainly cause Viktor feared the creation of a LycanVampire mixed breed.All this comes out in about the last ten to fifteen minutes or so of the movie by the way.Meanwhile we have Selene a 'Death Dealer' a vampire who hunts werewolves who hunts them out of revenge falling in love with Michael Corvin I'm having flashbacks to the hideous Crow 3 here folks even if the guy's last name IS from Crow 2 who's the descendant of some guy named Corvinus or something like that. Supposedly he has the potential to become both vamp and Lycan. Which he does.And yet in the end it's SELENE who kills off Viktor who had killed her family 600 years prior to the events of the film. This is another clichd plot twist. I mean come on. Werewolves killed my family so I kill them to satiate my lust for vengeance against werewolves who may have already been killed anyway. Yeah who the hell DIDN'T see that coming by the time this movie was ended? Seriously show of hands.Any takers? No? Good for you. It's too completely obvious.Here's the kicker. Lucian Lucien? has been trying to turn himself into a crossbreed LycanVamp which would make him more powerful than either race. Well as you might expect Michael gets bitten by a Lycan. Goes through most of the movie having 'hallucinations' which are actually Lucian's memories of what started the war between the two races. Gets shot and nearly dies because of some idiot SOB who is Viktor's second in command of course. gets bitten by Selene and becomes the hybrid Viktor is so afraid of seeing come into existence. Cue the only DECENT fight scene in this movie. Viktor and Michael go at it pretty well. It looks like it's going to become the sole redeeming quality in this movie. Then Viktor gets Michael in a headlock. Hey when did this turn into a wrestling match? Guess what. Selene gets involved and slices Viktor's head in half diagonally.Making the concept that Michael is supposed to be more powerful than both Lycans and Vampires and let me point out here that Lycans in this film are also supposed to be immortal once changed and that all either race has to do is a simple bite. absofrickinglutely POINTLESS! Whoever wrote this movie must have been on crack. I mean it. The story was contrived the 'fight scenes' shallow except for Michael vs. Viktor and they actually managed to RUIN that fight by having Selene get in the killing blow. This type of flagrant sexism in horror movies in which the villainmonsteralien from beyondwhatever almost always dies at the hands of a woman has always dragged down my enjoyment of most horror flicks in general and utterly annoys me throughout Underworld as Selene is like a female Blade in reverse with NONE of the potential that Blade has to be in potential danger even if he's just faking it. I never get the impression that Selene is in any way harmable because she's far too much like Blade mixed with the Punisher mixed with Daredevil. She also is the driving force of this film which means that Michael whom she's supposed to be in love with and who from the apparent standpoint of the movie is supposed to be the character around which all of this utter stinkbomb revolves is little more than a footnote and appears in barely a quarter of the movie. He is more or less just a helpless idiot throughout most of the film. Then they remove any power and presence his transformation is supposed to give him by not only having Viktor in a position to kill him which should have ended with Viktor's hold being broken by Michael's supposedly superior strength speed and power but by having him be rescued by Selene who has basically been the only character who really DOES anything in this entire movie.I put off buying Underworld for almost two years because I was wary of it. Mostly because of the way I disliked the werewolf costumes in the trailers. I will admit I have come to like the werewolf suits but not enough to consider them a saving grace of the film.This film managed to ruin the one thing which could have redeemed it in my eyes. And sadly it hints at a possible sequel at the end with another of the Vampires who is supposedly as old as Marcus and possibly a halfbreed himself taking over as the main villain. Which means this pile of utter waste is likely going to have a baby brother.Avoid it at all costs folks. This movie was a bomb. BIG TIME.As a fan of both werewolves and vampires I feel embarrassed on behalf of both creatures for this disgusting film.".

There were virtually no character building moments at all  we just have no idea who these 2dimensional SM fetishfreaks are at all.There is no plot to speak of  all we need to know is laid out wholesale in the opening monotone monologue.

Had we seen the story through his eyes we would have been shocked at the initial battle and surprised as the extent of the 'underworld' is revealed to us. Quite simply the director is telling the wrong story.Instead the movie treats the audience like bunch of slackjawed morons and spoon feeds us the whole story up front just so we don't have to worry our pretty little heads with such nasty complicated stuff as plot.Okay. I love vampire movies. All of them Nosferatu right through to Blade and I'm pretty sure that in all of these pretty much the whole point is that vampires are like evil and you know drink blood.Wearing a bit of leather bondage tat and moping around a big old house at night does not make you a vampire. Where was the bloodsucking? We barely even saw a set of fangs  these were simply the most boring vampires I've ever seen.The werewolves were a bit better but the CGI was very poor and the mantosort of mutant piggorilla thing transformation is totally eclipsed by twenty year old classics like American Werewolf and The Howling.The less said about the noise which passes for a soundtrack the better. In fact I've said too much already. So I'll stop.I hated this film so much I can't even be bothered to rant about it any more.Go see this film if you want leave feeling like someone hit you over the head and stole your money  or just find a dark street and wait to be mugged for a similar but possibly more entertaining experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am surprised to find that at the time I cast my rating this movie only got a 6.310. I think it is actually much more entertaining than that. First of all this flick has what seem to be novel ideas in it in particular the introduction of a kind of kinship between humans vampires and werewolves referred to as Lycans in the movie. I don't intend to give away spoilers but let me just say that there is a really surprising twist in the second half of the movie. When you go through the first half you think that the plot has been given away too early. But to my delight this was not the case due to the surprise twist I mentioned earlier. The story can be viewed as a metaphor for racial conflicts and prejudices that exist among humans and it pictures how senseless hatred is borne from generation to generation through coverups deceit and misinformation and how heavy sacrifices have to be made to bring end to conflict and reach some peace agreement or truce. The action sequences in the movie were also quite decent although not quite up to the standards of movies in The Matrix trilogy. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely perfect for the role of the female vampire Selene. I must say she looks stunning in her movie hairdo and she is totally hot in the tight black vampiress latex attire. Bill Nighy who recently played Billy Mack in the feel good Xmas movie Love Actually has also been aptly cast as the powerful vampire overlord Viktor. He plays convincingly as the hatemongering bigot of a leader who is willing to do anything to perpetuate the enmity and hatred of the vampires towards the Lycans. The only weakness I found in this movie is the rather anticlimactic ending. But highly recommended nonetheless.I give it 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "With The Perfume it's like with any blockbuster movie if the critics praise it it's horrible  if the critics hate it it's brilliant.I had the chance to watch a preview of The Perfume tonight and I was very surprised this movie is really good! Okay it can't actually make you smell all the scents and odours but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn't have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice mostly quotes from the novel the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It's a very good adaption of Sskind's novel sticking to the original plot concerning the major events leaving away unnecessary subplots although it's a pity that funny lethal gasplot was cut out! and shortening long passages. The result is wellconstructed movie that is worth seeing.The actors especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille have done a very good job. Like in the novel Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw's halfcrazy scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.The only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn't show much violence which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel  in the movie you hardly see what happens.However it's really a thrilling story visualized excellently  go to the movies and watch The Perfume! You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "To my dismay this movie has been accused of dealing with the addressed subjects only on the surface and just trying to shock the audience with extreme imagery. I strongly have to disagree with that. Das Parfum may be a lot of things but shocking sure isn't one of them. Of course it is visually overwhelming and not only with pictures of pretty flowers and sounds of the wind softly shaking the trees on a warm summer night but what is this movie if not a piece about the sensuality of the human being? Yes it is about smells but smelling is just simply not one of the things you can experience while sitting in a movie theatre. This motion picture however comes very close to it. We see closeups on maggots crawling around and fish getting their heads chopped of but also human bodies in all their perfection and people declaring their honest love for one another. It might be impossible to make the audience fully understand the world in which JeanBaptiste Grenouille lives but it does manage to create a similar vibe that brings us close to what Grenouille feels when he smells. Tom Tykwer beautifully achieves to always put the audience in the right mood with the help of an amazing soundtrack and great camera work.One could criticize that Ben Wishaw is too good looking for the part but we have to keep in mind that this story is supposed to be about the character of Grenouille and the way he himself sees his live. Since to him the smell is the soul of every being his appearance does not matter to him. So we might as well thank Tom Tykwer for casting an actor who is pretty decent to look at for two and half hours.Please watch this movie without any prejudices. Open your mind to images and sounds and try to imagine what your feeling could smell like. And even if that does not work you can still just enjoy a beautifully told story. Either way you will be touched.".

So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie but that is always the case with adaptations.I saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments.

	schema:headline " ...but will Americans understand it?";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an art movie with an ending that will puzzle many. As of this writing January 5 this movie has not yet been seen by many Americans. It has however based largely on its European release garnered a user rating of 7.4 already a quite good rating. It was undoubtedly the right decision to have it open in Europe first. Assuming that Americans probably won't be able to appreciate it as much as us Old Worlders the user rating will probably go down once a few thousand Americans have rated it here. But let me try to prevent that from happening by explaining what the movie is about.The ending is really what makes the movie or breaks it for those who don't see the beauty of it. It becomes clear then that what Grenouille was trying to do was create a physical distillate of love. Not sex. Not beauty. Love. And he did it. He created the perfect feeling of love both emotional and physical a love encompassing perfect eroticism not just emotionless sex. And in the end he did what lovers do he joined with other people. Yes they absorbed him entirely meaning that he became part of them just as a person in love wishes to become part of his or her lover. But HE represented the very concept of love and his physical absorption by the common people represents their ultimate adoption and understanding of that concept.Of course this is an art movie and everything in it is symbolical. It amounts to a description of what love is and how it works. The movie is saying that love is something real which can be defined and understood and the ultimate consequence of such understanding is that people join with each other emotionally and sexually. Even if they are strangers. Because everybody is capable of feeling love and one day maybe everybody will.It's a beautiful movie. When I left the theater I hadn't pieced everything together yet and thought I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. But having slept on it I realized it was a perfect movie. Hence I must give it a 10 out of 10.".

Through narration we understand smell to be deeply connected to our emotions but we have no soul in the book to identify with. Therefore everything is left to our imagination.

Film is a completely different art and requires the freedom to develop its own language. Imho Tom Tykwer made such a strong and overwhelming intro the first 30 minutes are so good that the rest of the movie though good too can't top it.Compared to last years big budget movies the film is the most interesting since many years.

	schema:headline " The sweet smell of innocencePerfume The Story of a Murderer";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Tom Tykwer has created a visually lush unique piece of cinema again. From the highly original Lola rennt to the visualization of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's Heaven the first part to a planned trilogy the second of which has been made by another director Tykwer's talents continue to make beautiful films built around emotion and characters. Perfume The Story of a Murderer is adapted from the novel of same name and while I have not read the book I can guess that the film version is pretty spoton. With its narration and long silent pauses to help the audience experience the amazing gift our lead has this story is read on screen through its imagery. As the camera pans lovingly over each object of Jean Baptiste Grenouille's affection one can almost smell the beauty as all other senses help to create a manifestation of the one we can't use. If ever a movie needed SmellOVision it would be this.We are introduced to a young man whose very life was a gift from God. He was born on bad terms and literally steals his breath from the air causing the beginning to his involuntary vacuum of life around him. It seems that everyone who touches or educates him finds an end to life once his work is done. JeanBaptiste with a sense of smell as acute as any could be in fact has no smell of his own. His ability turns him into a leech of sorts desperately needing to bottle the smells of others so as to never lose their essence their soul. All those around him can't appreciate the unique odor they emit like he does. Only he can understand and see into another's soul thus beginning his quest and duty to find a way to preserve that beauty.Expect big things in the future from virtual newcomer Ben Whishaw. The way he envelops the character of Grenouille is total. He goes through the entire film uttering very few words yet his expressions tell the story so well that you could understand it with all sound turned off. In each scene of him approaching his first love a plum girl on the streets the radiant Karoline Herfurth Whishaw is completely entranced by her odor. He approaches her with eyes closed and allows his nose to follow each contour of her body from a distance. The transfixion is powerful to watch as he discovers the most beautiful creature he has ever beheld the consequences of his immursion on the other hand are devastating. Whishaw never plays the role with any malice or insanity. Grenouille is a simple man who has never been told the difference between right and wrong. He is a victim of circumstance as well as an otherworldly ability which comes with an overwhelming sense of superiority and purpose whether true or misguided. His is a tragic character which never sees the error in his ways and Whishaw never loses sight of that one attribute letting viewers pity him at the same time as they revile what he is doing.Perfume is a sprawling tale spanning the years of Grenouille's life and on his journey to learn the craft of perfuming he meets many interesting and integral people. Dustin Hoffman plays Master Baldini the man who first lets JeanBaptiste in on the secrets of scent nicely and with a sense of integrity. An actor who has the tendency of going too big in some roles Hoffman reins himself in and plays the part to perfection. He is a famous perfumer whose days of fame are long behind him. Seeing the gift his protg has reinvigorates his love for the craft and by teaching the boy he revisits his past glory. Also effective in the film are Alan Rickman and Rachel HurdWood. Rickman plays his character with intelligence and compassion. While all those around him see an easy way out for capturing a serial killer only he refuses to be duped. As for HurdWood she is everything needed to make JeanBaptiste's mission believable. This young girl has an angelic beauty that would catch anyone's eye but it is her innocence that truly captures the meaning of the film.Tykwer gives us a tale of finding beauty in the world and wanting to never let it go. There is a power to innocence that will cause adults to smile at the mistakes made by children along the path of their childhood. Humanity can be stopped in its tracks by it uniting everyone into a sense of love for that which has not yet been tainted by the world. It does not matter how Grenouille was able to achieve the creation of his masterpiece of perfume it only matters what that process resulted in. It's odor brought the Garden of Eden back to earth for a fleeting moment. It allowed all in its' path to have a clean slate and love each other if only for a moment. Innocence washed all their sins away and it could not have happened without the determination of this young perfumer. With dark subject matter the film truly succeeds with its underlying meanings. There are many allusions to religion throughout the fantasy and stories of a saviormessiah figure that can be taken many ways. Whether one finishes upon liking Perfume or not it at least makes you ask questions and never manipulates you on the way. It also contains one of the best montage sequences I have ever experienced. As the murders are committed and spliced together with the meetings of the court on what to do there is a gorgeous operatic score driving us through. The passage culminates into one of religion's greatest feats coincidence looked upon as divine intervention. Whether Grenouille went along with God's acceptance or not he truly does succeed on his mission.".

Director's interpretation of the story which is much more sentimental and at the same time more humane than Suskind's oeuvre itself. What Tykwer has described is a character's journey in quest of recognition and love while what Suskind had narrated in a cold distanced manner is the story of an inhuman vanity of a great madman.2. Ben Wishaw's vision of Grenouille as a monster born into a monstrous world who step by step is being transformed into a human with his suicide in the end being the highest point of his spiritual renaissance.

But I trusted Tom Tykwer's directorial talents and went anyway. I am glad I did! Yes there is murder duh... it's in the title but the descent into human depravity was fascinating. It did NOT make me feel like a bath afterwards. It's almost like a metaphor for all kinds of human endeavors on this earth.This movie had a lyrical melodic quality to it superficially like Roman Polanski's 'The Ninth Gate' but without the silly attempt to artificially give it meaning. The historical vibe was incredible as well Obviously I wasn't in France in the 1730s1760s when the movie takes place. But nonetheless for me the evocation of that time was superb. I suspect you could watch this without any sound at all and still be entertained well sort of.I enjoyed the feast for the eyes while my emotions were fully engaged and my sense of wonder as well as my sense of mystery and that kind of excitement were all lit up.

Of course she tried to warn me and the fact that it took her 4 hours to watch it should have been telling. It was in a word atrocious. One of the most visually stunning pieces of garbage I have ever set eyes on literally. While points are clearly scored for originality costume and set design the beginning  ending scenes were nothing short of vomit inducing albeit for different reasons. Born in truly putrid conditions  Female Trouble birth scene easily comes to mind only this time supersized with maggots rotting meat and fish heads  Guillotine or whatever his name was was not meant for this world and the gift that signaled his existence and his mother's douchebaggery would ultimately be his undoing a tragic flaw indeed of Shakespearean proportions no doubt. Everything he touches dies everyone is dirtyfunky looking and Dustin Hoffman has seen better days and scripts. He can smell through glass containers in crowds and over great distances with visuals no less. He also leaves dead naked virginal sinead o'connor lookalikes in his wake. I was not entirely certain if this was a joke until I read some of the reviews on this site and realized there are people out there who dug this mess. Surely nothing this silly should take itself so seriously but alas I was wrong because it did and was somehow able to convince a large portion of the viewing public. Now that was some mighty powerful juice...I have seen much much worse R.O.T.O.R. anyone? that's for sure but nothing quite like this. I was rendered speechless by the orgy scene and wanted to destroy my DVD player and possibly myself when he finally made it home. Simply put avoid like the plague  beware of random dingy homeless looking street urchins with bags of animal fat that only want to capture your scent. They might just brew up a mindnumbingly awful film squirt their essence on you and force you to pronounce it an innocent dirty angel get naked have monkey sex with a nasty stranger and write it a glowing review.".

While points are clearly scored for originality costume and set design the beginning  ending scenes were nothing short of vomit inducing albeit for different reasons. Born in truly putrid conditions  Female Trouble birth scene easily comes to mind only this time supersized with maggots rotting meat and fish heads  Guillotine or whatever his name was was not meant for this world and the gift that signaled his existence and his mother's douchebaggery would ultimately be his undoing a tragic flaw indeed of Shakespearean proportions no doubt. Everything he touches dies everyone is dirtyfunky looking and Dustin Hoffman has seen better days and scripts. He can smell through glass containers in crowds and over great distances with visuals no less. He also leaves dead naked virginal sinead o'connor lookalikes in his wake. I was not entirely certain if this was a joke until I read some of the reviews on this site and realized there are people out there who dug this mess. Surely nothing this silly should take itself so seriously but alas I was wrong because it did and was somehow able to convince a large portion of the viewing public. Now that was some mighty powerful juice...I have seen much much worse R.O.T.O.R. anyone? that's for sure but nothing quite like this. I was rendered speechless by the orgy scene and wanted to destroy my DVD player and possibly myself when he finally made it home. Simply put avoid like the plague  beware of random dingy homeless looking street urchins with bags of animal fat that only want to capture your scent. They might just brew up a mindnumbingly awful film squirt their essence on you and force you to pronounce it an innocent dirty angel get naked have monkey sex with a nasty stranger and write it a glowing review.";

At the time I'd never heard of Suskind's novel let alone the film adaptation and as a result I entered the cinema without any preconceptions of what to expect. I was staggered. I cannot think of a film I've seen that is as cringeworthy nauseating and ultimately as ridiculous or as embarrassing as this awful awful waste of 50 million euros.First the positives and there are precious few. The film is indeed beautifully shot. Medieval Paris is impressively realised and you really do get a sense of the grimy underbelly of the city that Grenouille inhabits. In addition the second half of the film when the murders are taking place is undeniably tense as a cinematic experience.However by this stage all credibility has already been lost as a result of the lumpen and unconvincing script and the appallingly nauseous narration which is representative of the general feel of the film as a whole. Think 'Chocolat' at its most sickly with Juliette Binoche stirring a hot pot in slow motion to a lush orchestral background. However while that film just about saved itself from teetering into the realms of the ridiculous 'Perfume' plummets into the abyss like a suicidal elephant lacking any sense of subtlety finesse or restraint. Hoffman's 'paradise rose garden' scene after smelling Grenouille's first creation should be consigned to the filmmaking skip permanently. Nobody should be forced to see that.Surely it can't get any worse I thought. I was wrong. The executionorgy scene must count as one of the most unbelievable and embarrassing in cinema history so much so that I actually felt sorry for Alan Rickman as though his career was disappearing before my very eyes. Stumbling on from there we reach the ending with Grenouille being crushed to death by a mob of filthy peasants acting for the first time out of love. No decrease in the cringe factor no less embarrassing.Independent film makers struggling for funds for their projects will only look on in despair. A woeful mistake of a film it has to be seen to be believed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The novel PERFUME came out about twenty years ago and was one of those international sensations blending a mystery with the feel and texture of an historical novel and adding either theological tones THE NAME OF THE ROSE or philosophy PERFUME. Despite some differences with the novel the screenplay here does a fine job keeping the story of olfactory triumph and it's empty results to the front holding the audiences' attention to the interesting conclusion.Basically the story is the odd career of the 18th Century Serial Killer Jean Baptiste Grenouille Ben Wishaw. Grenouille is born in the lowest level of 18th Century Society  his mother who has had four children before is a fish dealer. Too poor to have proper treatment with a midwife or doctor she gives birth beneath her fish table cutting the umbilical cord with the same knife as used on her fish heads. Her probable intention is to dump the child in the garbage of the food market but the appearance of the mother and a customer's noting a sound lead to the child's discovery. The mother is hanged and the young Jean Baptiste sent to an orphanage. From the start the society of the 18th Century is disheartening. It is not the world of the philosophes but the French equivalent of WIlliam Hogarth's Gin Lane. Drunkeness whores thieves violent death filth is everywhere to the point that the viewer can nearly smell everything. Everybody who gets the early Jean Baptiste are not likable people. The woman running the orphanage is greedy and quick to whip the kids they sense something wrong with Jean Baptiste and try to smother him  smart kids!. She sells him as an apprentice at age 15 but she is murdered by street thieves for her money. The tanner who apprentices Jean Baptiste is brutal looking. Jean Baptiste by just smelling him realizes he must do everything this man wants. As a result he survives the five year life average other apprentices of the man have  and eventually is sold to Bandini Dustin Hoffman in a nice supporting role a perfumer. Shortly afterward the tanner is knocked down in a road when drunk hits his head on a heavy stone and drowns. Bandini eventually dies when his ancient home collapses after Jean Baptiste leaves him.Since his birth beneath the fish table in the market Jean Baptiste has had an exceptional nose which he trains to identify all items by their odors. But this includes people we tend to forget that people being of a family of mammals have body odors. Taken to Paris on a business trip by the Tanner Jean Baptiste wanders off fascinated by an odor. He gets to a perfume shop and smells the world's loveliest artificial odors. But he notices the women are the customers and concentrates on them after awhile. He takes a walk following a young woman selling fruit apricots and even is able to trace her by her scent to go to her hovel. He really does not know what precisely he is to do with her but when they are interrupted he grabs her against the shadow of a wall watching a man walking away with a prostitute. Jean Baptiste ends up finding he accidentally killed her. He then takes the time to smell her body to understand the scent of virginal innocence that he had found so enticing.Later Jean Baptiste delivers some skins from the tannery to Bandini to be made to smell good with his scents. Jean Baptiste demonstrates his remarkable sense of smell and how it can enrich Bandini. So he purchases Jean Baptiste from the tanner and soon is teaching him how to capture scent. Eventually Jean Baptiste goes to Southern France and starts a career of killing women while capturing their body scent. After about seven murders he sets off a panic and the town he is in tries to find him going crazy in the process. Since nobody can understand the reason for the murders none of the victims were ravaged they can't figure out what he wants although one townsman  Alan Rickman in a good performance  suspects it is something shared by all these women. Rickman is worried and with reason  his daughter Rachel HurdWood may be targeted. Rickman should be worried  his daughter has been targeted.In the end the story completes in an execution that goes awry and that everyone tries to forget and Jean Baptiste seemingly victorious. Yes and no. He has escaped his last real peril by use of his discovery but in doing this he has suddenly gotten a revelation that while he has control over the human race he has nothing. Having never been loved in an age of great cruelty he is incapable of love. He keeps thinking of his first victim and what he probably should have offered to her...but he's too confused to notice it. So his triumph is worthless. In the end he welcomes...well the end.What is the scent of a love? PERFUME suggests that it is too costly to gain that secret unless you have an appreciation of love first.".

	schema:reviewBody "The notion of fragrance being combined with mystery and romance intrigued me but I was quickly disappointed with this film. It begins with a heavyhanded conveyance of the message that the main character JeanBaptiste Grenouille is strangely gifted when it comes to scent. The opening monologue has already told as much so it is purely a waste of cinematic energy demonstrating this repeatedly in images for the first 15 minutes of the film. JeanBaptist's obsession with capturing fragrance is like an infatuation or a conquest there is no end to it. Once the scent he is looking for is obtained it becomes a piece in a larger but fantastically pointless appetite that I frankly didn't develop an interest in at any point. The actual plot of the story finally gets going somewhere in the second act but I fell asleep so I can't be 100 sure. The point is supposed to be that he is working on his masterpiece fragrance. But there's no art to his craft merely a process that is shown repeatedly that the audience cannot enjoy. The shortcomings of the film mostly have to do with the story and it's tedious repetitive motif. I thought Dustin Hoffman a poor casting choice and did not find his performance convincing. Alan Richman brought to the table everything his thinly conceived character was ever going to provide plotwise. His skills are used mostly in the resolution to the film which is is downright silly and abandons a quasi horrorscifi vibe and flops right over into surreal fantasy. The movie does not serve to teach or entertain the audience. If you like dark films with ambiguous morality and no sympathetic characters then this film might work for you. I require a more relatable plot line and thus found nothing redeeming in the film. It is sort of a Grimm's Fairytale meets Jack the Ripper with a pinch of Like Water for Chocolate.".

A massive orgy that takes place in an open square during the light of day? Pure love causing spontaneous cannibalism? Well PERFUME is the movie for you.Even with all its grotesque imagery and ideas I giggled nonstop while watching this overdone film. It's so bent on putting off people with a series of grim images and storyline that it created the opposite effect. It ended up looking like a Disney ride through misery. The idea is hopelessly silly a guy with a super olfactory sense receptor is driven to murder because he wants to bottle women's scent because no one likes him. The director actually shows us just in case we missed the point massive close ups of Grenouille's nostrils or him walking around sniffing things. Because of the unusual plot this story desperately needed subtlety and instead it got something from the Paul subtle as a sledgehammer Verhoeven school of filmmaking. It hits you on the head repeatedly that Grenouille is like the 6 million dollar man with a bionic nose. It doesn't help that the story follows this sad character from his birth to his eventual death subsequently empathizing with this serial killer of sorts as it painfully shows us in grand details why he's such a tormented soul.The direction was all wrong. Because the story was hmm unusual the director thought that it needed some narration to tell us stupid viewers what was going on. The narration by John Hurt was grating sounding like a kindergarten teacher reading a gross Brothers Grimm story to his pupils.The children sensed there was something about him... the narration went on slavishly over every little detail about Grenouille's life. I laughed out loud anytime I heard these groaners.If hearing the pedantic voice of John Hurt wasn't bad enough the film also stars Dustin Hoffman in full makeup and overacting mode. Honestly the film never had a chance with these two annoying elements but the infantile direction and the exceptionally misogynistic tone of this nonstory are what really sank this thing into miasma of rotten films.".

This could have been a great SW movie I give it 610 only because I like Garko and Kinski and the Silver character could have been much better if they just stuck to him trying to find out about the young Mexican girl that was killed in the opening scene. This opening was great with a Horror film touch to it and never seeing the culprit who murders the young woman for pleasure. The family going to the playboy Hacienda of legendary Silver trying to buy his gun for hire. Then we have local misfit and criminal ChesterKinski who plays a very small role but still a brilliant performance on his part. The middle with a secondary subplot nothing to do with the murder of the young girl but other unrelated murders and corruption and idiotic fight scenes and humorous tones by Silver really ruined this little flick to me personally. The ending was awesome going to back to the main beginning scene of the girl Chester is let go and being his arrogant nasty way walking away from the Sheriffs office Silver notices the missing eagle head medallion located on his gun belt pulls out the missing piece the family gave to Silver earlier throws it at him and tells him he knows he killed the girl etc. Chester backing up grabs a little girl as a human shield and we get to see Silver use that little hidden gun.. Lights out!!! Just amazing beginning and ending the rest was a rambling snooze fest subplot.".

All the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream. But maybe that's the fun of it all. If you know the KinskiBiography it's obvious that Kinski didn't care about those movies at all.

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike a few of her female contemporary film stars from the Thirties Rosalind Russell managed to avoid the perils of being cast in horror films because it was the only roles she was offered. I think only Katharine Hepburn exercised better discretion in her parts even if for Russell they weren't always completely successful with audiences and critics.Case in point is A Majority Of One. The play by Leonard Spiegelgass ran for 559 performances in the 19591960 season it was a popular hit as well with Jewish audiences. Mainly because the play was done by THE Jewish American mother from radio and television Gertrude Berg. As a small kid I do recall the lives and loves of Molly Goldberg and her family were almost a rite on the nights it was broadcast for my Jewish relatives. Berg was a natural for the part of the Jewish widow from 776 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.Anyway this tall prominent lay Catholic from Connecticut does give it a good try and she succeeds in many ways. Today's audiences in seeing this film don't have the memory of Gertrude Berg as Molly Goldberg to fall back on so Russell's performance is more likely to be judged on its own merits. It's not a bad one.The other casting however was and remains more controversial. Alec Guinness is one of those actors who can play just about any racial or ethnic type and has. He succeeded his fellow countryman Cedric Hardwicke who played the role of the Japanese industrialist on Broadway. Doesn't mean he should have though. If A Majority of One were made even 20 years later and if players were frozen in time Jack Warner might have given serious consideration to casting a real Japanese in Sessue Hayakawa as the Japanese widower industrialist. That would have really been something but at that time the film would have bombed at the box office.Interesting too because the subject of the film is overcoming our prejudices. Rosalind Russell's son was killed in the Pacific Theater in World War II. She's a widow and when her soninlaw Ray Danton who is a career foreign service officer her daughter Madelyn Rhue and Danton think she ought to go to Japan where he's been assigned his next post.They fly to the Pacific and take a sea voyage to Japan where Russell meets Alec Guinness a widower who's daughter was killed at Hiroshima. Despite his strict Buddhist faith and her Orthodox Jewish background love can bloom in the strangest places and is good the second time around.Russell admired Guinness's cerebral technique and total concentration on character when she worked with him. In a recent biography of Alec Guinness nothing was mentioned about him and Russell but he felt he was not given any kind of direction from Mervyn LeRoy. Both Russell and Guinness were heavy into Catholicism so I'm betting they got along.Two members of the original Broadway cast made it to Hollywood Mae Questal as Russell's neighbor and Marc Marno as their Japanese servant when they set up home in Japan. Questal has an interesting scene with Ray Danton when she announces she just doesn't like her new Puerto Rican neighbors. Danton rather selfrighteously upbraids her for her prejudice but then comes face to face with his own after making a fool of himself with Guinness during business and then facing the prospect he might have an oriental stepfatherinlaw.A Majority of One is a good film in many ways better enjoyed now than when it first came out. But it misses greatness due to the timidity of the times in Hollywood.".

Everything from the way he managed to sit in seiza position of kneeling in a relaxed manner to the way he spoke Japanese was convincing. He spoke Japanese with a better Japanese accent than he spoke English with a Japanese accent. The man was a freak. I was expecting something like the gibberish dialog of Kill Bill but this movie got it right. Nice job done by Rosalind Russell too.

Too bad at the time James Shigeta was too young for the part I kept visualizing him as an older man.  That quibble aside it is truly a heartwarming tale and wellperformed by the wonderful Rosalind Russell and Mr. Guiness.  Nice to see a regularguy performance by Ran Danton too as the soninlaw.  I'd always associated him with Legs Diamond and other unsavory characters he usually seemed to play.  All in all entertaining and drives home some important points about tolerance and family relations.".

Guinness does a good job and brings dry humor to the portrayal. Russell's Jewish Mommele is a bit overdone and laid on with a trowel but still not bad. The personal stories and exchanges between the two are very touching and I like the rebuke to the younger folks who haven't the life experience to make the judgements about race and religion. The final scene is priceless and moving. I give the picture a 9 instead of a 10 only because the Eddie character was a bit annoying.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen another love story like A Majority of One. A story of two elderly individuals who are worlds apart having to overcome their racial prejudice as well as being one of the few films in existence about love at old age. These imperfect and flawed characters feel so real and human and while two and a half hours may seem overlong I believe this time is justified. I wish more films could have the level of honest storytelling on display here.The casting as Alec Guinness as a Japanese businessman has been widely criticised but I have disagree I thought he was perfectly convincing in the role. His character is flawed he's not the stereotypical wise old Asian man who is full of otherworldly knowledge which he easily could have been he makes mistakes and doesn't have the answers to everything. Unlike many Asian characters in Hollywood films he doesn't talk in broken English or exhibit any other commonly seen Asian stereotypes. Compared to Japanese stereotypes seen in World War II propaganda films 20 years earlier A Majority of One was certainly a sign of progress. Why should an actor's race limit the roles they can portray? If they play a character of a different race convincingly and in a non offence manner I don't see any reason to be up in arms. Should the roles an actor may want to attempt be limited to only characters of their race? I feel there is a double standard at play here for a non white actor to be cast in a role or as a character originally conceived as white it will be viewed as forward thinking and progressive for a white actor to be cast in a non white role then it is considered racist? Film is a business and you need big stars for a movie to be box office hit how many Asian actors where big stars to American audiences in the early 60's. A movie like A Majority of One was an initial stepping stone to more equal representation in film perhaps it not succeed as the film was not a box office success but the intent was there.Rosalind Russell plays a potentially unlikable bigoted character but she manages to make the role endearing with her lovable nature and witty comebacks. I didn't see her character as an exaggerated stereotype. I've seen far more exaggerated representations of Jews in other films do I even need to list examples?. Her character has lead an ingrown life in Brooklyn however the movie shows the younger generation of her daughter and son in law holding more progressive views and are less conservative than their elders. Russell won't enter a bedroom wither son in law inhabiting without permission in case he isn't decent her daughter on the other hand will just walk on in. Likewise the film highlights westernised trends in Japan such as Alec Guinness wearing a western flat cap tot the popularity of American music and Hollywood movies in Japan while still acknowledging the anti American sentiment which exists in Japan. Also this movie has Eddie a whiny little brat but in a funny way I love this guy.".

	schema:headline " Despite horrid casting this was an incredibly sweet film";
	schema:reviewBody "At the onset anyone seeing this film today will be shocked at the terrible casting decisions for this film. The most obvious one is the idea of British actor Alec Guinness playing a Japanese businessman. Sure he was an amazing actor but unfortunately for many decades Hollywood thought it was perfectly acceptable to have Caucasian actors play Asians. The other casting problem though not as egregious was having a good Catholic lady like Rosalind Russell playing a very Jewish lady. In both cases there must have been more appropriate actors to play the parts but I must admit both did a very good job despite this.Russell plays a middleaged widow whose daughter is moving to Japan with her husband who is working for the State Department. They ask her to go with them but she is apprehensive since her son was killed in the war against Japan and she isn't thrilled by the prospect of going to that country. On the boat she meets a very nice Japanese man Guinness and at first she is put off because of her son. However in time they work through this and form a friendship. However it turns out that Guinness will be negotiating with Russell's soninlaw and the soninlaw ASSUMES Guinness is just using her to gain an advantage in negotiations. So at the soninlaw's request she keeps her distance from Guinness. Once in Japan though Russell is eventually drawn back to Guinness. Although the two are very happy together Russell can detect that their trepidation now is due to their own prejudicesthey can't stand the idea of Mother dating or perhaps marrying a Japanese man! This film abounds with class. It's an amazingly charming story and I liked how the film drew out the tale without hurrying it through. You really came to like the characters played by Russell and Guinness and the film was a lovely international romance. In addition it was sure nice to actually see a romance between people heading towards old ageas usually such films are about young and pretty people. I admire the film's courage in all these areas. A sweet and memorable film. Had the casting been a bit more sensitive undoubtedly the film would have earned a 9.PSKeep your Kleenex nearbyyou might just need themI sure did.".

He had the mannerisms and body language down quite well but OMG that accent. And the makeup. And the director's insistence on shooting Guinness in profile  there's just no way that nose could ever appear on a Japanese face! It's a testament to Guinness' skill that there were times when I could almost suspend my disbelief. Almost. But ultimately this has to go down as one of the worst casting decisions since Brando portrayed an Okinawan in Teahouse of the August Moon. Although to be fair neither was as flatout jawdroppingly bizarre as John Wayne's epically awful Genghis Khan in The Conqueror.Which is too bad really. The movie had a lot of good things going for it including a fairly touching chemistry between the leads as an American widow and Japanese widower who each lost a son in the war. There are solid supporting performances too and some nice comedic touches. Plus it's hard to actively dislike a film which includes a rare cameo by Mae Questel  the voice of Betty Boop.Besides Sir Alec's miscasting there's also the sets especially that horrific attempt at a Zen garden at Asano's residence. Maybe the producers thought the audience wanted that blatantly artificial look so they could pretend they too were watching this hit play on Broadway. Then again making the sets more believable might have only drawn more attention to Guinness' absurd makeup.".

	schema:reviewBody "Today the negative criticism of this movie centers around the choice of Alec Guiness to play the older Japanese man. I suspect that fiftysome years ago when this movie was made an era in which Marlon Brando also played a Japanese man on screen Teahouse of the August Moon more eyebrows were raised by the casting of Catholic Rosalind Russell as the very Jewish Ms. Jacoby. On Broadway that role had been played by Molly Picon who had been an important figure in the New York Yiddish theater before moving to roles in English. If there are some Japanese stereotypes in this movie there are even more New York Jewish stereotypes. Given that the play on which it was based and the script for this movie were written by Leonard Spigelgass who was himself a Jewish man born in Brooklyn like Ms. Jacoby the apparent stereotypes become very complex. How different is Ms. Jacoby from say the Goldbergs in the famous radio series of that name written by another Jewish writer Gertude Berg? So what if we get off our pc horses for a moment accept that the casting is strange for our time but not so strange for 50 years ago and consider what else there is to the movie? Not much frankly. Ms. Jacoby is quickly charmed by Mr. Asano despite the fact that her son had been killed by the Japanese during the war only 15 years before. Thereafter the only problems she has with the Japanese businessman are those caused by her daughter and soninlaw. Mr. Asano appears to have no problems with being interested in a Caucasian woman. There isn't really a lot to the material.Yes of course the two leads do a wonderful job with it because they were firstrate actors. But there really isn't much to the material.It's a pleasant movie certainly but if you stop getting upset about the casting there really isn't a lot left to take an interest in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the few votes this movie must not be seen very often by the modern viewing audiences. It was on the TCM channel last night and comes across very well for a vintage movie.Rosalind Russell is the lead character as Mrs. Jacoby on a cruise to Japan. Her son in law is to do business with the Japanese and one of their key businessmen is on the same ship. Mrs Jacoby is relatively recently widowed and her daughter has been encouraging her to mix more socially to try to bring some joy back into her life. When I first saw Alec Guinness I didn't quite recognize him but he looked familiar and I was surprised when I learned his character was the Japanese businessman. But after a while it didn't look strange any more his light Asian makeup helped him look the part and of course the fabulous actor that he is he made it seem very real. His character was Koichi Asano.When Mrs Jacoby first met Asano she gave him a very cool reception she had lost a loved one just a few years earlier in the war at the hands of the Japanese. But after Asano explained that he too had lost loved ones at the hands of the Americans she understood that there was no reason to remain bitter. Eventually they became quite friendly and when the daughter caught a glimpse of them dancing on deck one night she became concerned that Asano was just using her mother to get an advantage in the upcoming business dealings. Not a great highly significant or memorable movie but a nice one worth the time to watch it. Plus we get to see two of the best actors of that era.It was also nice to see famous TV actress Madlyn Rhue in her younger days. Here she plays the married daughter Alice Black.".

Every single element of it is so right so how does it end up being so completely uninvolving that I ended up nearly falling asleep halfway through? The problem isn't the casting Colin Farrell makes a hell of a gangster all smouldering machismo stomping through the streets of London. And with a supporting cast that includes Eddie Marsan sleazy David Thewlis sleazier and Ben Chaplin sleaziest and very very good Farrell has some excellent support. Ray Winstone has never been scarier but of all people it's Anna Friel who takes the acting honours as Farrell's sister a woman who outsleazes Marsan Thewlis and Chaplin combined.The problem isn't the locations or how true to life they are. I lived in London for a long time and I've rarely seen the city depicted better all back streets and alleyways with nasty bastards lurking around every grubby corner. Considering the film's writer and director William Monahan is from Boston I was worried that this might be the tourist's eye view of London but that really isn't the case. The film positively drips with atmosphere and the expletiveheavy dialogue rings true.And yet it all sits there lifeless on the screen a collection of images and characters that seem only vaguely related to one another. It doesn't help that the main plot  will Farrell become a proper gangster or will he end up with Keira Knightley's waytoogoodforhim actress  is hardly new. But that doesn't have to be a deal breaker and there are plenty of interesting minor characters to pass the time.The problem is really that the film feels rushed. Those minor characters aren't given nearly enough time  Marsan gets three scenes none of them remotely important to the plot and even Anna Friel doesn't get a lot to do. She's still better off than Stephen Graham and Sanjeev Bhaskar great actors who are cast in completely pointless roles that could have been played by anyone. And so much of this movie feels tacked on from the dozen or so subplots to Winstone's pointless murder of the wrong man halfway through to the stalker obviously based on Mark David Chapman who makes several ominous appearances and is then dismissed in a single line of dialogue.If some subplots and characters are pointless though the ending made me feel that way about the whole damn film. Without giving too much away it's a horrible limp lettuce of an ending with none of the resonance that the filmmakers clearly thought it had achieved. That's the film in a nutshell  it wanted to be profound but ended up as a giant 'so what?'".

Because I could not stop if I started.I mainly wanted to see London Boulevard because of the pairing of Keira Knightley and Colin Farrell and that part of the movie certainly didn't disappoint me. This is definitely Farrel's film and he carries it well. Knightley is much more a side character despite her prominent place in the posters and advertisements. And while she's good in her part Farrell is what makes this interesting. The guy is absolutely ferocious in this movie and any fans of his will be pleased.The story of a man fresh off of time in the prison struggling not to be drawn into the violent criminal world that everyone around him seems to think he belongs in is an average one. It feels a bit haphazard at times which seems due to the way the plot continued to change as the film was being made. It progresses in leaps and fits and starts without ever really establishing a steady flow. The scenes with Knightley and Farrell together seem from a completely different flick than the scenes with Farrell in his violent criminal element due to the drastic differences in tone between the two. That's not a flaw in itself but it highlights how piecemeal the whole film can feel at times.What makes London Boulevard a memorable movie despite its issues is the characters. Beyond Farrell and Knightley's hounded actress Anna Friel David Thewlis and Ray Winstone each help carry the story along with interesting roles that they play just perfectly.I recommend London Boulevard if you're a fan of anyone involved but don't expect a traditional English gangster flick.

It's just that those two words 'fck off' and 'you ct' are said with such conviction but in a cool and effortless manner by both Gant and Mitchell. The film has a calm linear flow for a crime thriller but several twists and turns toward the conclusion remind you that within this genreclever can often be more stimulating than too much blood and violence. Although there are a few quite gruesome scenes. However the nasty bits are not dragged out and enough is seen for you to get the picture of what's going on!Winstone Farrel Thewlis Friel give good performances and present interesting roles. Knightly however gives a rather wooden performance in a boring role. Humour is weaved within this relatively serious film and classic 60's music from bands such as the Yardbirds add to the recipe which make this rather tasty.

	schema:headline " From the writer of 'The Departed' a British gangster movie with a twist";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember when this came out it didn't make any big ripples in the pool of critical acclaim. Just another British gangster movie was the vibe I got from various sources. Even so when it recently aired on TV I decided to give it a look. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised to find a very understated but at the same time quite violent film that I quite enjoyed. It does have its faults though I'll get to them after this very brief summary.When Mitchel is released from prison having done a three year stretch for an assault he finds it all too easy to slip into his old ways. An old friend Billy Norton sets him up with somewhere to live and takes him out collecting protection money in the high rise flats. It's not what Mitchel wants though and he is tempted with an offer of a job looking after reclusive actress Charlotte. Her assistant for want of a better word Jordan shows him the ropes but he is always being dragged back into the world he is trying to escape. A big crime boss Gant wants him to steal from Charlotte but he has become very attached to her. Can Mitchel get away from the life that sent him to jail or will he be sucked back into that life to protect what he holds dear? There is much more to it than that but the Spoiler Police have threatened to take away my PC if I say any more.A very well made film with some interesting performances. I thought Colin Farrell did a decent job as Mitchel although I did find his English accent a bit odd. Keira Knightley also put in a decent turn as the slightly paranoid Charlotte. David Thewlis as Jordan and Anna Friel as Briony Mitchel's sister were excellent. Finally Ben Chaplin as Billy Norton and of course Ray Winstone as Gant both did excellent work also.I found the film quite confusing at first there were many threads that started and didn't really seem to go anywhere. Once the MitchelCharlotte storyline gets established though it does become more coherent. As I said at the beginning it's quite violent and so maybe not one for the more squeamish. Rather a lot of time is spent on establishing Mitchel as a gangster and not enough on his blossoming romance with Charlotte. This meant that I ended up not really convinced by their relationship in the end and so it didn't quite work for me. It is still worth a watch though and I'd still deem it Recommended just.My score 7.110 IMDb Score 6.310 based on 13450 votes at the time of going to press.".

Monahan manages to assemble a pretty interesting cast for the job matching big name attractions notably Colin Farrell for the lead of Mitchell an excon trying to place his life on the straight and narrow who finds complications aplenty but centrally in the shape of Keira Knightley playing Charlotte a reclusive actress in need of Mitchell's muscle in order to fend off pesky paparazzi perform some odd jobs around her abode whilst also seeking comfort in his softer side when making use of Mitchell as a confidante.The strength of the piece is in the supporting cast who mainly transpire as conduits for Mitchells struggle with the temptations of a potential return to his old ways. Leading the second tier is Ray Winstone as crime lord Gant who genuinely creates an atmosphere of dread when on screen as he attempts to lure Farrell back to the darkside. David Thewlis is equally adept as he plays Jordan a drug induced failed thespian who is Charlotte's business manager. There are also roles for Ben Chaplin as a blundering hood whilst Stephen Graham and Eddie Marsan are shamefully under used in their minor roles.As you might be thinking there is a lot a going on here and that's sort of where Monahan gets into trouble the narrative is littered with plotholes and semi developed ideas and characters such as Anna Friel who pops in and out the story as a Mitchell's troubled sister this is largely a product of the derivative nature of the project. Monahan seems to be tipping his hat at the types of movie he himself has indulged for example there is clear a sense of early Guy Ritchie in style of the visuals soundtrack and occasional attempts at humour. The mood and tone owes more to Scorcese traits such as an angry gratuitous racism and overly proud glorification of the gangster life style. It's a rarity when a film could be said to be too short but one way London Boulevard could have been improved is an extra 45 minutes or so to pay attention to its many details.The major task London Boulevard will have is proving it has any substance it will be interesting to see if William Monahan will be encouraged to take this debut any further and perfect or enhance his directorial style with future work if so this could be remembered more fondly as part of a bigger picture.

	schema:headline " Going Straight is never as simple as it seems...";
	schema:reviewBody "You can guarantee if there's one area of the current employment sector which continually flouts the rules of a recession it's the underworld London East End gangster. William Monahan's screenplays for 'The Departed' and 'Body of Lies' directorial debut is an adaptation of Ken Bruen's 2001 novel 'London Boulevard' about a criminal who after being released from prison attempts to go 'straight' but despite his attempts he can never truly escape his violent past. It's not a perfect film by any means but capable direction and solid performances from a primarily solid British and Irish cast create a competent directorial debut for Monahan.Mitchell Colin Farrell has just been released from Pentonville after a three year sentence for assault when he exits the prison he is picked up by longtime partner in crime and local enforcer Billy Ben Chaplin who takes Mitchell to a party in his honour. Every East End drug dealing gangster is there to shake the hand of one of the most feared men in London but all Mitchell wants is to get a job and avoid being restricted to a sixteen by eight cell again. He manages to convince a beautiful reclusive actress Keira Knightly and her potsmokinghippyesquirefatherfigure Jordan David Thewlis to hire him as a handyman around their paparazzi infested estate. But when the leading figure in the London underworld Mr Gant Ray Winstone comes looking to place Mitchell high up in his crime organization he must find a way to refuse the advances of such a dangerous man while also protecting those closest to him.For the first tentofifteen minutes of the film Colin Farrell's forced middleclass cockney accent takes centre stage but once he settles into the role his performance takes limelight as a sociopathic criminal with somewhat of a heart. His brash use of violence and utter respect and protection of friends family and confidants provides a conflict within Mitchell that he constantly battles throughout the film. The only thing he knows what to do is enforce and if he was a true gangster he would kill everyone and take everything they had but at the same time the last thing he wants in his life is to return to that desolate hole known as prison. Aside from Farrell both David Thewlis and Ben Chaplin give great performances as the hippy wannabe actor and scared lowlevel gangster respectively. While Anne Friel also plays the thieving stubborn childish sister of Mitchell's very well. Yet while Ray Winstone never puts a foot wrong his role as the Underworld Godfather has become rather predictable and uninteresting especially since every other word out of his Landan mouth is either fk or ct or a combination of both. Monahan really missed a trick by failing to provide Winstone's character with any further depth.Also beside the main story as Mitchell battles his growing love for the reclusive actress and the life of a straight man alongside that of his violent past and potential gangster future is the subplot of Mitchell's old homeless friend Joe Alan Williams who is killed ruthlessly by a couple of youths and Mitchell's subsequent attempts to find out who is responsible. While it is an adequate underlying story to accompany the main narrative neither Monahan's direction nor his screenplay seem to follow it to any decisive conclusion. It seems if anything if this subplot is simply included to allow the subversion of the ending and provide a twist or surprise ending which the film itself certainly does not need. 'London Boulevard' is a proficient first effort for Monahan and while the film contains flaws which you expect from a firsttime director plying his trade it is also an engaging gangster drama which is smartly written and incredibly wellacted by many of the great British and Irish actors at the moment.".

	onyx:emotionText "You can guarantee if there's one area of the current employment sector which continually flouts the rules of a recession it's the underworld London East End gangster. William Monahan's screenplays for 'The Departed' and 'Body of Lies' directorial debut is an adaptation of Ken Bruen's 2001 novel 'London Boulevard' about a criminal who after being released from prison attempts to go 'straight' but despite his attempts he can never truly escape his violent past. It's not a perfect film by any means but capable direction and solid performances from a primarily solid British and Irish cast create a competent directorial debut for Monahan.Mitchell Colin Farrell has just been released from Pentonville after a three year sentence for assault when he exits the prison he is picked up by longtime partner in crime and local enforcer Billy Ben Chaplin who takes Mitchell to a party in his honour. Every East End drug dealing gangster is there to shake the hand of one of the most feared men in London but all Mitchell wants is to get a job and avoid being restricted to a sixteen by eight cell again. He manages to convince a beautiful reclusive actress Keira Knightly and her potsmokinghippyesquirefatherfigure Jordan David Thewlis to hire him as a handyman around their paparazzi infested estate. But when the leading figure in the London underworld Mr Gant Ray Winstone comes looking to place Mitchell high up in his crime organization he must find a way to refuse the advances of such a dangerous man while also protecting those closest to him.For the first tentofifteen minutes of the film Colin Farrell's forced middleclass cockney accent takes centre stage but once he settles into the role his performance takes limelight as a sociopathic criminal with somewhat of a heart. His brash use of violence and utter respect and protection of friends family and confidants provides a conflict within Mitchell that he constantly battles throughout the film. The only thing he knows what to do is enforce and if he was a true gangster he would kill everyone and take everything they had but at the same time the last thing he wants in his life is to return to that desolate hole known as prison. Aside from Farrell both David Thewlis and Ben Chaplin give great performances as the hippy wannabe actor and scared lowlevel gangster respectively. While Anne Friel also plays the thieving stubborn childish sister of Mitchell's very well. Yet while Ray Winstone never puts a foot wrong his role as the Underworld Godfather has become rather predictable and uninteresting especially since every other word out of his Landan mouth is either fk or ct or a combination of both.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was quite entertaining and well worth a watch by fans of the gangster movie genre. Colin Farrel is convincing as an excon trying to shake the criminal lifestyle  but like many characters in movies of this sort he is ultimately drawn back to the violent unpredictable and dangerous lifestyle due to a matter of honor or vengeance. Despite not having a lot of time to develop on screen there are several interesting performances by the secondary characters that contribute to the drama and overall atmosphere of this movie. Ray Winstone's character Gant is especially detestable as a midlevel crime boss who seems to enjoy inflicting pain whether it be emotional or physical upon others and has a reserved but sinister presence. Briony played by Anna Friel is intriguing as Mitchel's spoiled chemicallydependent sister whom Mitch tries to protect and shield from the ugliness of the underworld he is part of. Briony for her part seems to be interested in having fun and is somewhat oblivious to the powder keg of violence and sin that is boiling under the surface of her lifestyle. And Danny the washedup tired looking employeefriend of Charlotte Keira Knightley is a nice addition to the dynamics as well. The romance that is supposed to develop between Mitch and Charlotte is not really convincing on screen.They don't spend enough time to together and its difficult to believe anything substantial has developed between them based on what we see on screen. This is probably the one major failing of the movie. HoweverFarrel's intensity as the hoodlum Mitch in his hunt for the killers of an old friendas well as dealing with the antics of his idiot friend Billy and trying to avoid being forced into servitude by a viscous criminal group keeps the movie plugging along. Its far from perfectbut to North American audiences these smallscale crime dramas set in London offer us a refreshingly different perspective on the criminal underworld. There's no machineguns and explosions there's no car chases the violence is not as inyourface as we see in a lot of US produced gangster films. The ferocity and cruelty of underworld life is definitely there howeverin many scenarios it is much more implied  which almost gives it a more sinister feel because it leaves a good deal up to the audience's imagination. I'm not 100 sure why I liked this movie as much as I did. And as stated it is far from perfect but I do think that it has a place alongside other UKbased crime movies like Blitz Harry Brown The Krays and Gangster No.1. Check it out if you get the chance.".

Otherwise I could not find any mistake I really liked how cut played around with some scenes and it made felt like I feel everything what director wanted to show and I was inside every single scene. Actors have done perfect job. The director is showing the very bottom of London's society to the very top and switching between these pictures very precisely as it is showing power of some people and how influenced it can be. I know it does not make much sense now but really cannot tell you much more.

The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat who was the only reason to watch 2001's Julietta and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.A family moves from Italy to Germany seeking the German dream this is my own invention and ironic... of cheap labor in steel and coal industries. However they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point onward the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family Giancarlo Bleibtreu and Gigi Metschurat. Gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great  and totally neutral  look at what life can become formed by the choices you make.In the end this movie doesn't say which life Gigi's or Giancarlo's was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin's moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially Metschurat and  this I really need to stress  the little boy who plays young Gigi. That kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone! Great movie go see it.".

To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children.

Solino is about a Italian immigrant who arrives in the Ruhr region of Germany during the 60s.  The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi the main actor. You live every second every feeling he does. His brother played by Moritz Bleibtreu isnt that good. Well you just dont believe him the role. But the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of The Godfather. Many people will probably hate this movie say its boring. Not much tension?  yes but an outrageous movie.  9 out of 10.".

Both run through his later films but even here are approached with energy and humanity. The story of an Italian family that moves to Germany to in the hopes of getting better work the film spans 20 years. The first act takes place in 1964 as the family makes the move and the 2 brothers who are the children try to adjust. Jump forward 10 years to 1974 and the film moves from sweet light sentiment to something a little darker and more complex as the brothers are now young adults pulling away from the family and grappling with what they want out of life and the tensions caused by their naturally different temperaments. While not at the level of his later amazing works like HeadOn and The Edge of Heaven this is an entertaining and very human movie that manages to be a portrait of a struggling family that's neither horribly depressing or sticky sweet and cute.It's very frustrating but there seems to be no officially released DVD with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Solino is a 2002 2hour movie by GermanTurkish director Faith Akin and it's the unusual scenario that he did not write the script for his own film here. This film also shows how long he and Bleibtreu go back. Bleibtreu plays the colead next to Barnaby Metschurat in this one and I must say I certainly found Bleibtreu's character more interesting even if he is the less likable of the two. The biggest problem I had with Metschurat was that he never seemed really Italian to me in contrast to Bleibtreu's character who certainly gives of a Dolce Vita vibe in here. And judging from the 2 performances here I can see why Metschurat even if he is a likable guy did not manage Bleibtreu's career in the last decade.The movie chronicles several decades of an Italian family who movies to Germany and opens a pizza restaurant. The focus is mostly on the two sons initially still when they were children but for the most part when they were adults. We watch their love stories their relationships with their parents and their professional careers. It is not a terrible film by any means but I must say I found it fairly uninteresting and it also dragged on some occasions. No doubt Akin is a really good filmmaker when it comes to multicultural works but somehow this one here did not work out for me. Luckily he made another film with Bleibtreu playing the main character's brother again about life and work at a restaurant Soul Kitchen and I definitely preferred this Greek take on the story. One thing that stayed unclear with Solino for me was the Nazi reference no idea why they included that one if the film is supposed to play in the 1960s and 1980s. All in all one of Akin's weaker works but it is fine as he was not even 30 when he made this one and definitely improved afterward. Apart from that it also had to do with Matschurat simply being not right for the role. Not recommended.".

The Two Towers shows us that he is not a onehit wonder like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum he looks so creepy and realistic that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard the destruction and the battle is so immense in size that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word epic and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.1010".

Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive every award every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense forget your prejudices about the books they are another way of looking at this beautiful story I know this is slightly against the rules but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment  a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats  was entirely accurate.Gollum was an excellent amalgam so easily could he have been an annoying JarJarBinksAlike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis and doubtless many many others chose to portray the CGI incarnation of Smeagol was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing amusing almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skincrawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris Became Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. The casting for The Two Towers makes one shake ones head and wonder in retrospect whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate a performance which contributed greatly to The Battle of Helms Deep scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced at least for me was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity he is sensitive seemingly empathic warmer and more fundamentally human and yet superhuman in presence and charisma. Definitive is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth don't pass it up  The books are the ultimate fantasy epic  the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine but The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go Laugh Cry and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.".

	schema:headline " The final hour of The Two Towers is grand terrifying and epic on a biblical level.";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding yet very brief taste of action cinematography and special effects only to be matched and far surpassed in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film and while the first two hours serve finely as story development they primarily build anticipation for the final hour which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments the first two thirds of the film are well shot well paced and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline but when compared to the spectacular final hour the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However to be fair I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours so far of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained and regained popularity.As assumed The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines Frodo and Sam Aragorn and Legolas Merry and Pippin and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man a soldier and a hero. More than once did the audience filled mostly with academy voters applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a muchwelcomed large role due to extremely realistic computer animation and a fine performance from Andy Serkis upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However here he is more of a leading character and a 'star' and his convincing dualpersonality stabbing voice and wellchoreographed body movements make him consistently eyegrabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is again one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this postMatrix era. The shots of the ascending enemyladen ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely aweinspiring and seamless integration of acting stunts and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes opening in the Shire Gandalf's passing properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best dark continuous and unrelenting as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship low brass six notes repeated with a rest in between is much more present in The Two Towers appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled the theme for Rohan a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'Alist' composer and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York he could get propelled to the very top of the 'Alist' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle the visual effects the pacing acting cinematography and music all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason no one whether a fan of Fellowship or not should miss The Two Towers.".

	schema:headline " There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo and it's worth fighting for.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Lord of the Rings continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam Sean Astin to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in The Two Towers his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though there was almost a comic element to it whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The olyphants were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film and repeated viewings are helpful along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually the books and the film complement each other nicely even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that The Lord of the Rings has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor loyalty friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.".

This facet of his character allows Sam Sean Astin to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in The Two Towers his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though there was almost a comic element to it whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The olyphants were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film and repeated viewings are helpful along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually the books and the film complement each other nicely even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that The Lord of the Rings has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor loyalty friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.";

My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut however I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR this movie will in no way let you down.

	schema:headline " Absolutely totally fantastic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me he probably is best know for his role as the captain in Titanic in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of The Lord of the Rings movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of The Lord of the Rings movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as GollumSmagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of The Lord of the Rings movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Beautiful Perfection";
	schema:reviewBody "The Two Towers can only be explained in one word beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum.  Gollum gave an astonishing performance.  The poor misunderstood beast or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.  The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor.  Gollum's voice is still haunting even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor.  For these reasons and more Gollum has become my favorite character in the film replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.On the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn Legolas and Gimli.  I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing and saddening.  There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli and Legolas while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times.  Aragorn's performance is outstanding.  He has proven that he can be put on an AList of actors and deserves appraise for his performance.Gandalf the White in this film was a twist.  We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard.  Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire and smoking leaf as explained in the novel.  There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard.  No fireworks or pipes.  Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.Very dark are the times for Frodo and Samwise.  Gollum seams to give Frodo hope as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well.  It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo and our hero is slipping.  But the surprise was aimed at Samwise.  Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend.  Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment.  This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary is the hope that is there even when all odds point to despair.Merry and Pippin's story is very odd initially.  The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth and gives us a feeling of hope in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others.  The Ents were very well done CGI wise but it was there personality that moved the audience.  They are curiously wise and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor.  Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity and for those of us who know the story know that greatness is upon them.This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.  I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent.  This story has captivated my heart and the film has taken my breath away.  There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where The Fellowship of the Ring left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary charactergeneration. Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen Orlando Bloom and John RhysDavies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece Mirando Otto. As all this occurs Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest fame. In the end not one but two key battles will create the suretobe electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment The Return of the King. Many view The Two Towers as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of The Fellowship of the Ring but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first which will likely always be my favorite. This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship love and personal sacrifice. In short The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.".

The film picks up immediately where The Fellowship of the Ring left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary charactergeneration. Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen Orlando Bloom and John RhysDavies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece Mirando Otto. As all this occurs Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest fame. In the end not one but two key battles will create the suretobe electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment The Return of the King. Many view The Two Towers as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of The Fellowship of the Ring but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first which will likely always be my favorite. This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship love and personal sacrifice. In short The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.";

	schema:reviewBody "Long before it came out I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here the beautiful photography set designs costumes scenery special effects. All amazing all brilliant all Oscarworthy.The performances are terrific too. Bernard Hill Viggo Mortensen Elijah Wood Miranda Otto all did great jobs. The supporting actors too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film I think he only says two or three lines on camera the rest is brooding. Such a waste he is one of the great actors of our time a real joy to watch and a scene stealer to boot.But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long but impressive nonetheless and will probably be the model for epic battle sequences for years to come. And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI and like all great works of art it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10 the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the shortshrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel not the fault of the filmmakers.".

This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism the nazgls are now the fearinspiring creatures they should be. Gollum excellently implemented even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the darkside creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt while the UrukHai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 910 my highest so far.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read with care and delight the books four times in the last 34 years including the recent reversion to Tolkein's original manuscript edited by his son. I'm a fan. There I said it and I'm glad I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very literary Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages 1000 to 1400 pages depending on the edition your are holding. And that time weeks and weeks of pouring over pages rereading certain passages pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs and histories Tolkein concocted allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you in 212 hours that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore the movie's focus on action and FYI it is deadon accurate and faithful to the books is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it how could a movie ANY movie capture all of the sylvan reverie including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash etc. in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy bookworld stuff would be great to see on the screen but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screentime. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many festive people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV miniseries. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously I'd have enjoyed it. But then the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts else the drama and peril etc. would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing then I'm wishing for them to have made two projects the 3 theaterrelease movies AND a 30hour TV miniseries for all the literary vibe. But then instead of a 300 million triology we'd have had a 1 BILLION dollar but memorable! TV miniseries.  Oh well if wishing were having...Overall LOTR Two Towers is an excellent movie! A 10 out of 10!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dont you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If were after a running commentary well buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this Im a chainsmoker and cinema chains dont allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I dont visit cinemas . But its a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January  popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained SPOILERS I was entertained and more  but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesnt automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done  but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson  How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he cant ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep  Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema  cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat   except they did so mainly off screen . Its as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .Of course you dont notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and thats a lack of an emotional impact . Yes youll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you wont burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between  though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor  Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain  and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldnt help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obviousBut despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits  gasped at the technical achievements  but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10".

Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement but history will in fact adjudge The Two Towers as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on Zulu and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains with barely disguised contemporary resonance what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are some things worth fighting for when Merry tells Pippin that there won't be a Shire unless they do something about it when King Theoden laments that the sun has gone down in the West this film could be entitled not the Two Towers but the Twin Towers. It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes one may quibble about certain Entish details and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem and that Faramir is a little undeveloped but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for".

Through the first movie we already had the whole story setup so in The Two Towers in really pick's up.There is not one thing about this movie that I would change. Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out but they only are there to lead into the sequel.This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect. And isn't afraid to use them. The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGIcomputer generated imagery which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding. The scene's with Aragorn being lost were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river. The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help and protect Frodo. The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time. All in all this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King.".

	schema:reviewBody "We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director Peter Jackson did not include a recap of the last movie so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.   When we last left our fellowship it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins Elijah Wood and Sam Gamgee Sean Astin continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum Andy Serkis as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting his precious' back. Aragorn Viggo Mortensen Legolas Orlando Bloom and Gimli John RhysDavies begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry Dominic Monaghan and Pippin Billy Boyd but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman Christopher Lee controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Urukhai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf Ian McKellen also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.     This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film and it was very intense.      The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above done by helicopter with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing.  The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.      The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie and the computergenerated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.      To conclude we had to wait a year for this film and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though the third and final film is due out next Christmas.".

	schema:reviewBody "So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson at the helm of this massive production assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.When we left the fellowship they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces Aragorn Legolas and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir who has also died this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom the one ring still in their grasp.'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth too many I believe. 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard a large talking tree herder who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters Sauron and Saruman burn everything in their path.Legolas Aragorn and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn the king's niece develops a special liking for Aragorn. However as we understand from the first film there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn though mortal and she is not for distant lands and never see him again.Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions though are never clear to the hobbits  neither are they to Gollum.These three strands of story form a massive thoroughly effective epic tale of nature vs. machine creature vs. creature and through Frodo man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.The pacing which was an issue with 'Fellowship' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father Theoden is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.Still 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score by Howard Shore is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and urukhai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story but in other realms of filmmaking Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. .5 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll keep this as short as I can. Basically 100 Days With Mr. Arrogant is a Korean movie about your average high school senior Kang Hayeong Ha Jiwon who just had her heart broken and meeting a gorgeous yet totally conceited guy Lee Hyeongjun Kim JaeWon thanks to fate. A kicked soda can that missed and hit Hyeongjun instead who was driving and hit a wall leaving a dent in his Lexus 430 if I'm not mistaken. Hyeongjun confronts Hayeong about the matter and asks for 3 grand to pay for the damages. Obviously not having that kind of money Hyeongjun instead forces the poor schoolgirl into an agreement wherein she will be his slave for 100 days. Of course over the duration of the agreement they soon start having feelings for one another.It's cute fluffy and the gross parts are forgivable. I can also understand why people most especially those who aren't too familiar with Asian culture would compare this to the Korean success My Sassy Girl and therefore dismiss this film as trying too hard. However this movie was meant to entertain and not stir minds and does a pretty justifiable job in doing so. Ha Jiwon may not be at par with Jun JiHyun actingwise but her theatric skills are nowhere near cringeworthy yet and her good looks assuage for the loss. Jaewon Kim is very handsome and convincing as the bum Hyeongjun and together they make a goodlooking couple on screen. Also their chemistry works that despite the occasional overthetop antics hopeless romantics will not be disappointed.Sure it's a little predictable. And sure MSG fans will inevitably find references to My Sassy Girl. It's cheesy and overthetop and that's why it's such a guilty pleasure. I'll say this though....I enjoyed this much more than Sex Is Zero which Ha Jiwon also stars in.".

	schema:reviewBody "100 Days with Mr. Arrogantalso known as My Love Ssagajiis a South Korean romantic comedy.It stars Kim JaeWon Ha JiWon and Kim Tae Hyeon.It is about high school girl Ha Young. After being dumped by her boyfriend just before their 100 day anniversary she meets a college guy named HyungJoon when she kicks a can that accidentally hits him in the face and causes him to scratch his Lexus. He demands she pay him 3 million won 3000 on the spot. She escapes from him leaving her wallet behind.HyungJoon stalks her demanding money to pay for his car. Since she is a poor high school student HyungJoon writes up a Enslavement Agreement for HaYoung in order to pay for the damage to his car. Ha Young is thrown into a nightmarish slave life for 100 dayssuch as running his errands cleaning his house carrying his shopping and cleaning his car.By accident she finds out that the damage to HyungJoon's car that's only 10000 won 10. She then takes her revenge. However before she knows it.HyungJoon shows up at her house as her new tutor! He once again takes advantage of her but soon HaYoung finds herself falling head over heels for HyungJoon. A lot of people have considered this as one of the best Korean romantic comedies ever made in recent years.But in realityit is simply a generic one that involves formulaic plot and clichs.Aside from thatthe chemistry between the lead stars  Ha JiWon and Kim JaeWon  is what defines the movie.Aside from thatthe story somewhat mocks the Asian culture of male superiority especially when HyungJoon writes up a Enslavement Agreement for HaYoung for a certain number of days.Overallthis is one film that provides fun and entertainment that would certainly won't be place in the same category like other Korean romantic comedy masterpiece such as My Sassy Girl.".

	onyx:emotionText "100 Days with Mr. Arrogantalso known as My Love Ssagajiis a South Korean romantic comedy.It stars Kim JaeWon Ha JiWon and Kim Tae Hyeon.It is about high school girl Ha Young. After being dumped by her boyfriend just before their 100 day anniversary she meets a college guy named HyungJoon when she kicks a can that accidentally hits him in the face and causes him to scratch his Lexus. He demands she pay him 3 million won 3000 on the spot. She escapes from him leaving her wallet behind.HyungJoon stalks her demanding money to pay for his car. Since she is a poor high school student HyungJoon writes up a Enslavement Agreement for HaYoung in order to pay for the damage to his car. Ha Young is thrown into a nightmarish slave life for 100 dayssuch as running his errands cleaning his house carrying his shopping and cleaning his car.By accident she finds out that the damage to HyungJoon's car that's only 10000 won 10. She then takes her revenge. However before she knows it.HyungJoon shows up at her house as her new tutor! He once again takes advantage of her but soon HaYoung finds herself falling head over heels for HyungJoon. A lot of people have considered this as one of the best Korean romantic comedies ever made in recent years.But in realityit is simply a generic one that involves formulaic plot and clichs.Aside from thatthe chemistry between the lead stars  Ha JiWon and Kim JaeWon  is what defines the movie.Aside from thatthe story somewhat mocks the Asian culture of male superiority especially when HyungJoon writes up a Enslavement Agreement for HaYoung for a certain number of days.Overallthis is one film that provides fun and entertainment that would certainly won't be place in the same category like other Korean romantic comedy masterpiece such as My Sassy Girl.";

No effort from the director editor or production to give us something interesting out of the box.A mediocre acting from Jiwon Ha. I'm really into Korean actresses but the work made by this girl is very superficial annoying in some parts and provides poorly face expression. For this types of films is obvious that we need a girl next door type but with what we have seen in Korean cinema we could have had a Jihyun Jun or a Hyekyo Song type didn't like her face too. A decent performance from JaeWon Kim keeping in mind that the film wasn't something challenging for any actor.Pretty bad photography. Cheesy ending. There is no way in life this movie is going to have the effect and impression of My Sassy Girl if the direction tried to do it they ended 100000000 miles away.Conclusion if you are looking for another My Sassy Girl stay away from this film if you are looking for another cheesy Korean chick flick... please please please look somewhere else!".

He has quite a reputation with numerous classic genre films throughout the 80s and 90s that he has to live up to. And live up to it this movie does. Famke Janssen carries the film with ease. It doesn't take much time till you root for her because the character is as real a person as it gets in these movies. The supporting cast are all great too. Bobby Cannavale who plays the cop on a stakeout outside her house does a young Chazz Palminteri just what the role asks for. And Michael Pare who plays the ghost actually acts and acts well under the coat of blurry special effects and not a word of dialog save for a couple of grunts not to mention he is scary. I enjoyed the hell out of it and I hope Eric Red continues to make movies this good.".

There is no explanation to all the events that occur in this film. Shanks seems to take a very strange interest in Marnie. Even to the point of parking outside her house and watching her day and night. But there is no real reason for this he has a hunch that perhaps Marnie didn't kill Mike. The acting overall was fine I quite like Janssen and she played this part well. Although I thought she was very calm considering the circumstances.Directed by Eric Red who I knew little about. When I checked it appears he has done other films things like Cohen and Tate and has quite a few writing credits. There are some nice well done scenes in this film a few jump type moments but nothing really scary. There is one quite horrific scene in the bedroom when the ghost of Mike takes a dislike to Marnie's new beau. The effects were done well though a little bit over dramatic at the end.This is a HorrorThriller but I would say leans more to the Horror genre than Thriller. It could have gone more down the Thriller route and there were enough plot lines running through to create a decent Thriller.All in all it was an enjoyable film that held my interest but left me asking more questions than it answered.".

Eric Red is really good director as well I'll be looking for more of his work from here on out. Great effects great story I can only take off points just to be unbiased. I'm impressed.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this was a decent movie. The story line particularly made this title more appeasing to me. A lady kills her husband in self defense after being beaten for years? I like this only because this a real scenario that happens all to often and the women in punished for it. Even though eventually the husband would probably kill her anyways. I like the fact that she is on house arrest which gives the story a certain twist. The scenes are suspenseful and make you clench your teeth and jump at certain times. The characters are done well and the story moves at a decent pace. There was some really good gore and some particularly scary parts which were also done well. As for the end what can I say after all the horror movies that have been made endings are harder and harder to do. This movie was great up until the end and even the end was not that horrible it was still kind of bad enough to make me reduce my rating on this movie. All in all worth the watch but probably wont be a favorite.".

	schema:reviewBody "100 Feet is the wrong movie to be watching at night time trust me on this one. It is well written has great acting and great dialogue. Despite the tiresome amount of films that have gone in this direction this one stands out from them all. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who dares to be frightened because the probability of this scary flick freaking you to pieces is pretty high! A woman is let out early from prison but at a high cost She must reside in the same house that she murdered her husband in who happened to be a violent cop. His partner happens to be the man who is more then anxious to put her back in prison so he waits patiently in his car parked across the street waiting for her to violate her probation. She has an ankle bracelet attached to her ankle hence the name and is instructed not to go past 100 feet of the house or the alarm will go off. Goes off for longer then three minutes and she's automatically going back to jail. Not too hard to do right? HEH the plot thickens. The house she's living in is possessed by a poltergeist and it just happens to be the husband she killed in self defense. And he is powerful and angry as ever!!! Her survival skills must be put to play however what defense do you have against something that is not in human form? Can it even be stopped? Even if her probation officer believes her story that she is being violently stalked by her dead husband how can he protect her from this savage entity? There are long boring sequences but bare with it and trust me the rewards come later. By the first half hour she knows what is going on. The last half hour is when the really good stuff happens and I'm talking...jump out of your skin Oh my God! freaky  weird  crazy messed up stuff. I'm not revealing too much because it will spoil the story and I sure do not want to spoil the ending. If you like your movies scary you're in for a treat....which is long overdue these days. Fantastic film!".

	schema:headline " Famke Janssen carries this pretty good movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie begins with Marnie Wilson Famke Janssen arriving home after being released from an unknown prison sentence for one year of house arrest. She stabbed her abusive Cop husband to death after he came at her with a knife and she managed to get it away from him to defend herself. She had filed many complaints about the abuse but his cop friends didn't take her seriously. She obviously was found guilty since she went to prison and has now been released to house arrest. The title of the movie  100 Feet  refers to the distance she can travel. Marnie must always be within 100 feet of the ankle monitor box that hangs in her home. If she goes outside 100 feet the ankle monitor beeps and she has 3 minutes to get back inside or the police are called.The movie doesn't waste much time introducing the audience and the lead character Marnie to the ghost of her late husband who apparently haunts the house and wants her to pay for what she did. He is violent and takes pleasure in scaring her and physically hurting her  for example he throws her down the flight of stairs and also hits her in the face. The ghost is NOT invisible.. it's not some force that can't be seen and the fear is supposed to come from the unknown. The movie creates the ghost and we can see his shapefacebody and at times it IS scary. The movie plays with this by having his image pop up with quick camera shots in the dark.Ed Westwick plays Joey a young man from the neighborhood who befriends Marnie and is someone who she can talk to and who runs errands for her such as getting books from the library and groceries from the supermarket. Bobby Cannavale plays a cop who was the partner of Marnie's husband. He can't let what happened go and he obsessively camps outside the house to keep an eye on Marnie inside.Famke Janssen's performance in this movie was fantastic. The actual movie was average in execution and it had an ending that lessoned the film especially with the over the top CGI effects which IMO were just too much in the final scenes it wasn't a problem for 95 of the movie though but Famke really stepped it up making the movie almost mesmerizing at times. Her fear and grief and determination were palpable and she really sold the character she was playing. Just a great job from her overall.I saw this movie last night when it was on SyFy. I happened to flip the channel and quickly decided to watch. I am glad I did. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 bc it was enjoyable and well acted but it wasn't brilliant by any means and the over the top ending ruined it a bit for me. I still recommend seeing this movie and there is a really crazy in a good way fight scene that is worth checking out.".

This time he attacks her with a knife. She kills him by grabbing the knife from him and stabbing him three times. on early release from jail she gets put under housearrest for one year at the start of the film six months later on in it. Mikey then starts to exact his revenge'. The storyline was virtually nonexistent. The acting was so minimal it almost was not there. Famke Janssen did her best in the lead role actually she didn't but then there was not a lot for her to do. I have seen other films she has been in where she has been better. The person playing Shanks didn't have a lot to do either in fact noone did really.In one scene her dead ex pulls her hand into the wastedisposal unit and turns it on cutting her hand so badly that in the next scene she needs to wrap it in a towel only for her hand to be perfectly alright for the rest of the film. In another set of scenes the ghost of the ex pulls her down the stairs her head hitting every wooden step as she went and yet she got up at the bottom with no effect whatsoever. These are not the only cases of inconsistencies.So after having a 'solid' ghost what are we going to be subjected to next? Dracula sunbathing in the midday sun? A person changing into a werewolf when there is no full moon in the sky? This really is not one to see in a hurry!".

Plus the ending seemed rush and is poorly edited and the CG ghost is horrible pathetic... just not believable how do you make a ghost believable though? Most viewers would say there needs to be more blood a higher body count but the one brutal murder in this film is one of the most disturbing I have seen in years.. I think about it on a frequent basis.I think the reason the film stuck with me is because beyond it just being a horror film it dealt a lot with the characters different issues and emotions.If you go into watching this movie with little to no expectations you will enjoy it. It is clearly lowbudget and what you see is definitely what you get with 10 mil. Also... why do viewers have to over analyze everything in a film and feel every thing needs justification? Just relax and roll with the punches. The first time I watched this film I had no expectations and didn't even catch most of the plot holes until I came to the IMDb boards.I give it a 710.

	schema:reviewBody "100 Feet had been on my radar for some time mainly because of director Eric Red being at the helm of this project. Perhaps his comeback film one could say. The man already wrote great scripts for 80's genre hits like Robert Harmon's The Hitcher and Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark. During the 90's he directed two notable genre films the psychologically tinted thrillerhorror hybrid Body Parts and that one little werewolf film that sort of stood out during the 90's Bad Moon. Very likely no masterpieces but they left a pleasant aftertaste and above all they are well made and showed promise for future work as a director. And then... it got a little quiet surrounding Eric Red. So in a way 100 Feet might be considered to be his comeback movie. It sure got me interested especially after glimpsing at the trailer. And the fact that Famke Janssen was taking on the leading role didn't hurt at all either.So yes I really wanted to like 100 Feet and well... I really liked it! It's a bit of a sober film really with a onehouse setting and not much characters running around in it. But every character does bring his weight to it. Also it's a unique angle for a ghost story with Famke's character not being able to leave her haunted house you know that from the start of the film. Ms. Janssen gives a fine performance funny thing I think I actually spotted a Dutch accent for the first time ever the film has the right tone  atmosphere at least for me it worked fine and looks really good. There's a bit of ghostly CGI that perhaps could have been better or maybe I should say could've been handled differently as it's more of a choice of how they wanted it to look not really a case of ineptness. It's not a fastpaced film but it works for the better this way and believe me... there's one scene that will take you by surprise. Unexpected and so bloody and so brutal it'll have you hit that rewind button on your remote. Maybe the film will play out in the end just like you'd expect it to. Or maybe not. I just hope it won't disappoint you at any rate. Just go rent it. It's much better than most of the directtoDVD stuff coming out these days. I'm always sad when a film like this doesn't make it to theaters in our country but it's also obvious that it doesn't stand a chance over here. This just got me thinking of David Fincher's Panic Room actually because of its similar setting. Panic Room did get a theatrical release over here naturally and I hold 100 Feet about on par with it well maybe not exactly on par as a film but as a horror equivalent yes. So you just decide for yourself whether you think you're going to like this film or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seven years and fiftytwo days in prison Marnie Watson Famke Janssen returns to her old house in Brooklyn New York under the house arrest condition for the next six months. Marnie was sentenced for killing her abusive and brutal husband the policeman Mike Watson Michael Par in selfdefense and she must wear an electronic brace around her ankle that allows her to move in a 100foot radius in the house during her probation. Mike's former partner Shanks Bobby Cannavale takes Marnie under his custody stalking her from his car expecting her to violate the limits of the electronic device and send her back to prison. Sooner Marnie discovers that she is trapped in the house with the fiend of Mike that has not moved on and is still in the house seeking revenge against her.I am a big fan of horror movies and Famke Janssen and 100 Feet was a great surprise for me. This ghost story has an original theatrical screenplay supported by the acting of this gorgeous Dutch actress and some decent special effects. I believe that fans of this genre will not be disappointed with the plot. My only negative remark is with the bad conclusion with the explosion of the ghost and Marnie able to leave her place without any money documentation or friends and her picture on the front page of the news but traveling somewhere by bus. She had only six months sentence to be a free woman Shanks could help her during the rest of her probation and her house might have an insurance policy. This good movie deserved an alternative ending. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Refm do Esprito Hostage of the Spirit".

Marnie was sentenced for killing her abusive and brutal husband the policeman Mike Watson Michael Par in selfdefense and she must wear an electronic brace around her ankle that allows her to move in a 100foot radius in the house during her probation. Mike's former partner Shanks Bobby Cannavale takes Marnie under his custody stalking her from his car expecting her to violate the limits of the electronic device and send her back to prison. Sooner Marnie discovers that she is trapped in the house with the fiend of Mike that has not moved on and is still in the house seeking revenge against her.I am a big fan of horror movies and Famke Janssen and 100 Feet was a great surprise for me.

Maybe they got enough complaints from you the consumer and decided to actually watch a movie before committing to sticking it in their little vending machines.This movie was good not great but provided some punchy scares that had me leaping off of the couch. It takes a lot for me to get off the couch too. Some very well done scenes combining horror and the paranormal went a long way on the scare 'o' meter. Good competent acting and directing plus fairly polished dialog made this movie pretty scary and somewhat believable. It had its moments when it dragged or skipped some detail but overall it gets 2 rotting thumbs up!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has more than enough scares and surprises to please the average viewer. Only it could have been so much more. The whole house arrest premise in combination with the minimal background story showed promise for a chilling setup. And the movie starts out good in building up suspense. But out of the blue the movie went from subtle to outright ridiculous where it almost changed this serious movie into a slapstick comedy. And then it switched back to subtle again. There are only a few moments where the electronic ankle bracelet is truly a handicap.Personally I think it was an advantage because she could alert the police much more faster than normally possible. Disturbia did a much better job in demonstrating how annoying it was to have such a bracelet. The second thing that I missed in this movie was a decent back story on Famke's character. Almost everybody thought that she was a bad person even when it comes to light that she was being abused by her husband. It would have made more sense to show some flashbacks on his behavior in order to make her more likable. But this credit has to go to Famke Janssen only because she manages to invoke sympathy even when she is supposed to portray this stone cold tough chick. To me the climax was very disappointing. Since I was hoping for some wonderful twist that could have explained the subtle buildup of tension and suspense that was buried in the usual over the top special effects extravaganza used in American horror movies nowadays. This twist never comes. Overall this movie is quite enjoyableonly don't expect to be really surprised in the end.".

Art that cannot provoke a reaction is not worth witnessing for ones self and I think we can safely say that this Italian made socalled comedyWestern hybrid isn't for all tastes. Mine is still at the Old Corral waiting to be re shooed.I sought it out due to my obsession with the recurring Spaghetti Western character Sartana played by actors Gianni Garko and George Hilton amongst others. Like the DJANGO films that aren't really about Franco Nero's DJANGO this one has zilch to do with Garko's SARTANA and was doubtlessly titled HALLELUJAH AND SARTANA STRIKE IT RICH after the distributors realized there wasn't much they could do with it as just a zany slapstick horse comedy with Ron Ely and Richard Widmark. One plays a horse thief referred to by the translated script as 'Sartana' the other a phony Preacher whom I guess would be 'Hallelujah'. The two of them are con men who try to swindle a sweet young widow Uschi Glass sadly encased in rather opaque clothing during the whole production and end up helping a small community save their money for a new church from a band of crooks.At least I think that's what happened. You'll notice I engaged the Spoiler Disgronification Switch the IMDb provides to protect readers from having their viewing experiences ruined by clueless contributors who give away the ending to a film. I do not think the Spoiler Button was made with films like this in mind though and rest assured my use of it was arbitrary  based on the outside chance that I managed to touch on some sensitive plot point without realizing it. But since I am not even sure how the movie ended let alone what events led up to it's conclusion it was more of a safety measure employed to protect my own best interests.This is a Spaghetti Western no doubt and further evidence that the primary inspiration for the Spaghetti Western approach was cartoons. The motivation for it's making was most likely the TRINITY films with Terence Hill and Bud Bulldozer Spencer. Those movies are engaging meaningful escapist gems that just happened to be about Cowboys  Pistoleros. HALLELUJAH AND SARTANA has an extended custard pie fight slapstick Keystone Cops like physical comedy a recurring character from an insane asylum who thinks he is Napoleon goofy doofus musical themes with tubas and BOING!! sounds surrealist characters in bizarre costumes who burst into snippets of song and a naked guy wandering around wearing a wooden barrel ... All of it amounting to an endless ball of energy that doesn't know which way to bounce. The one film it did actually remind me of is Juan Lopez Moctezuma's likewise annoying DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON only with horses and no naked boobs. Even the horses look confused at times and I wonder they thought about it all  Probably used to being run all over creation with Lee Van Cleef  John Phillip Law shooting at Luigi Pistilli and here they found themselves standing around watching a bunch of guys in Union Suits throwing pies at each other.So I dunno. This isn't a film to recommend nor warn against but to sort of note the existence of. Yes Virginia there is a movie called HALLELUJAH AND SARTANA STRIKE IT RICH with Ron Ely and Richard Widmark. And yes Uschi Glass is in it too. What it is about I haven't the foggiest idea nor do I care and for some that might be the spoiler right there. If so my apologies but you knew it was coming.".

Although quite racy in its day for its interracial sex sizzle of Brown and Welch  it's overblown and tame by today's standards .

	schema:reviewBody "This was well directed by Tom Gries a veteran TV director Route 66 Combat Rat Patrol Man From Uncle who's previous Western was Will Penny.This is a nopata Western sort of like a Zapata Western with no politics much like The Wild Bunch which fits this category.The cast has Jim Brown Burt Reynolds Raquel Welch Frenando Lamas Eric Braeden Aldo Sambrel and a lot of SW extras that you will recognize. Shot in beautiful Almeria the release is in uncut widescreen.SpoilersThe story opens with the hanging of Sarita's Welches father by the Federales. Officer Verdugo Lamas is a bloodthirsty bastard and he purposely pulls the horse out from Sarita's father so slowly so he's strangled rather than has his neck broke. Sarita runs up and jumps upon her father using her weight to kill him quickly its a powerful scene.Sarita now becomes a Soldada a Yaqui leader.Jim Brown ex NFL football star isn't all that bad in this and he is believable as Arizona policeman Lyedecker on the trail of Yaqui Joe a Half Breed cross of a Yaqui IndianAlabama Goodoldboy father Burt Reynolds who has robbed 6000 dollars from an Arizona bank. With which he purchased the 100 rifles of the title for Sarita and The Yaquis.This film does have some great action set pieces the escape of Yaqui Joe  Lyedecker out of the train and through the town shows off Reynolds stuntman abilities and Brown's athleticism.There is a great bout of horsemanship as the group of Yaquis descend down an unbelievably steep canyon its really pretty exciting seeing the horses negotiate that decent.All the action sequences are good no complaints especially Raquel's shower sequence more like a wet T shirt shower where she stops a troop train by a water tower watch the spider holes.The train wreck at the end is also done well.I'm thinking now that these American or British financed Euro shot Zapatas  nopatas are some of the best clones of the general SW trends in Westerns that influenced the genre after Leone's successes. They never reached the heights that Leone did with gunfight based Westerns like FAFDM or GBU but with Villa Rides a Zapata and this film they very good jobs of cloning the Italian directors the only missing elements are the innovative camera angles and the picaresque characters. I also thought Chato's Land was very good in its chasemanhunt sub genre while The Hunting Party was good but had a few minor flaws.On the other hand Welches Hannie Caulder is lame in comparison.100 Rifles even has a decent score its not at Morricone's level but its good enough.Another couple of interesting angles is the emergence of Welch as a strong believable protagonist in this film and also the interracial sexual affair between Brown  Welch. Cinematically speaking I don't quite know if after The Great Silence breaking this particular taboo if this was the next instance of interracial love or not.This is one of Jim Browns best performances in a Western that I've seen so far though I've not seen them all  and haven't seen El Condor since seeing it in a theater years ago so that claim may change.Its worth finding and buying for your collection".

	schema:reviewBody "Some filmgoers may be surprised to know that there was a time when Brown could command topbilling over Welch and Reynolds. Here he plays a deputy sheriff traveling across the Mexican border to retrieve Reynolds who has robbed an American bank of 6000. Just as Brown is about to nab Reynolds all hell breaks loose due to Mexican general Lamas persecution of freedomfighting peasants led by curvaceous Welch. With commitment purpose and loyalty questioned occasionally Brown Reynolds and Welch all wind up working together against Lamas who is allied with O'Herlihy a railroad representative and Braeden a German officer on hand to advise Lamas. The title weapons become a bargaining chip as both sides work hard to defeat the other. Before it's all over a lot of bullets have been fired a lot of things have been burned or blown up and plenty of blood has been spilled. Brown who possessed a laidback almost gentle screen presence is not as comfortable before the camera as he would later become though his amiability and chemistry with Reynolds helps. Welch is of course quite stunning physically but her acting which includes a theek Mehican accent! isn't exactly stellar. Also not only did she not get along with Reynolds at all but she also reneged on a nude scene she was supposed to film it was done with a wet shirt instead. She also according to Brown refused to do their love scene unless she had fabric in between their chests. Their highly publicized love scene is tame now though it was surely arresting at the time. Stella Stevens would go further when she and Brown made Slaughter a few years later. Reynolds conveniently plays a halfYaqui Indian and half Alabaman. His innate charisma allows him to walk away with most of his scenes while his sense of amused abandon foreshadows his later career. Lamas has a good time as the relentless villain of the film while O'Herlihy is appropriately shifty in his part. The towering Forest best known for playing Apollo on an episode of Star Trek plays Welch's silent helpmate. Miranda has a spicy bit role as one of Reynolds' bedmates. The score for the film by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent containing some unusual soundsinstruments no doubt left over from The Planet of the Apes. There's a lot of action perhaps even too much since the personal story gets a bit eclipsed along the way and characters long to be fleshed out a little bit more. Still it's an attractive interesting cast going through the motions of a sometimesrousing film. There are a few images of drunken Indians that seem blatantly stereotypical and derogatory these days. At least there is a certain degree of scope in the number of extras used and the spectacle of the train careening into town in the finale. It's a moderately effective time filler.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some filmgoers may be surprised to know that there was a time when Brown could command topbilling over Welch and Reynolds. Here he plays a deputy sheriff traveling across the Mexican border to retrieve Reynolds who has robbed an American bank of 6000. Just as Brown is about to nab Reynolds all hell breaks loose due to Mexican general Lamas persecution of freedomfighting peasants led by curvaceous Welch. With commitment purpose and loyalty questioned occasionally Brown Reynolds and Welch all wind up working together against Lamas who is allied with O'Herlihy a railroad representative and Braeden a German officer on hand to advise Lamas. The title weapons become a bargaining chip as both sides work hard to defeat the other. Before it's all over a lot of bullets have been fired a lot of things have been burned or blown up and plenty of blood has been spilled. Brown who possessed a laidback almost gentle screen presence is not as comfortable before the camera as he would later become though his amiability and chemistry with Reynolds helps. Welch is of course quite stunning physically but her acting which includes a theek Mehican accent! isn't exactly stellar. Also not only did she not get along with Reynolds at all but she also reneged on a nude scene she was supposed to film it was done with a wet shirt instead. She also according to Brown refused to do their love scene unless she had fabric in between their chests. Their highly publicized love scene is tame now though it was surely arresting at the time. Stella Stevens would go further when she and Brown made Slaughter a few years later. Reynolds conveniently plays a halfYaqui Indian and half Alabaman. His innate charisma allows him to walk away with most of his scenes while his sense of amused abandon foreshadows his later career. Lamas has a good time as the relentless villain of the film while O'Herlihy is appropriately shifty in his part. The towering Forest best known for playing Apollo on an episode of Star Trek plays Welch's silent helpmate. Miranda has a spicy bit role as one of Reynolds' bedmates. The score for the film by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent containing some unusual soundsinstruments no doubt left over from The Planet of the Apes. There's a lot of action perhaps even too much since the personal story gets a bit eclipsed along the way and characters long to be fleshed out a little bit more. Still it's an attractive interesting cast going through the motions of a sometimesrousing film. There are a few images of drunken Indians that seem blatantly stereotypical and derogatory these days. At least there is a certain degree of scope in the number of extras used and the spectacle of the train careening into town in the finale. It's a moderately effective time filler.";

Mostly it seems to ride somewhere between 'The Professionals' and 'The Wild Bunch' for its mood and action. A strong link through the story can also be made to Damiano Damiani's 'A Bullet for the General' an excellent spaghetti western with some political overtones. In '100 Rifles' one can forget the politics and concentrate on action. This is a very violent western but still surprisingly low on gore. A bit like in those older westerns a lot of shooting and stabbing and whatever without gushing copious amounts of fake blood. Maybe that suits better here. We have seen enough Peckinpah imitations already.The film takes full advantage of Raquel Welch's well working sex appeal. The hot love scene between her and Jim Brown was considered controversial at the time the movie came out. Now it's just two people making love and Welch really enjoying her work or being corny judge yourself. Brown makes a highly likable hero and Reynolds in his before superstardom state of career is also good as a halfbreed bandit with the familiar glint in the eye. At times I got the feeling he was lightly making fun of Marlon Brando's Zapata. That may be because I recently saw on DVD an old episode of Sonny and Cher Show in which he was successfully aping Brando's Kowalski from 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and was so funny. So an okay action western but nothing revolutionary in spite of the story subject.".

Unfortunately that didn't translate into meaningful movie roles perhaps because her physical assets outshone her acting ability.

Here she seems effective as the strong willed Yaqui woman who comes to the aid of her people following the hanging death of her father in an opening scene. Fellow Yaqui Joe Herrera Burt Reynolds is being pursued by exfootballer Jim Brown who's character Lyedecker is after a two hundred dollar reward and a permanent job for capturing the Indian bandit.I couldn't help feeling that the almost two hour film could have been done in half the time like a 'B' programmer from the 1950's. Then of course you wouldn't have needed the three principal stars to tell the story or the strong supporting cast headed by Fernando Lamas as the bloodthirsty Mexican General Verdugo. Not knowing him by his real name Eric Braeden I would have sworn Hans Gudegast turned up for his role straight off the set of Rat Patrol  I'll have to go back to some of those episodes to see if there's a uniform change. He's a very similar character here but certainly second string to Lamas.I'll have to admit I was a little impatient for things to get going here once they do there are a few interesting moments. There's a real tough looking descent down a cliff side on horseback by both the Indians and the Mexican rurales. The love scene between Brown and Welch had me wondering if this might have been the first time an interracial match up was attempted in film if so it was a ground breaking move even if tame by today's standards. Still it was a moment to be noted for the late 1960's. For Raquel Welch the show stopper was the train stopper if you know what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you can't beat 'em join 'em. That would seem to be part of the thinking behind 100 Rifles. By the late 60s the traditional American Western had been replaced by the Euro or Spaghetti Western with more emphasis on violence and blurred lines between bad and good. 100 Rifles was filmed in Spain and has that same raw dirty look to it that most of the Westerns coming out of Europe had at the time. The biggest difference is that 100 Rifles is an American production. The film features an interesting storyline and several good action sequences with a couple of train shootouts being the highlight of the film for me. A lot of the action may seem overthetop but that's the way I like my Spaghetti Westerns.100 Rifles actually has four main characters played by Jim Brown Burt Reynolds Raquel Welch and Fernando Lamas. Brown is by far the weakest of the four. To describe his acting as wooden would be an insult to trees everywhere. He's simply out of his league with the rest of the cast. Reynolds is surprisingly good as the halfbreed Yaqui Joe Herrera. At first he may seem to be little more than a mischievous drunken outlaw but there's a definite intelligence behind the hyena like laugh. Besides being one of the most beautiful women who ever walked the planet Welch throws herself into her role and is reasonably convincing. But Lamas is the real standout. His General Verdugo is a marvelous character more obsessed with personal revenge than in doing what is necessary to beat his enemies. Other than Brown it's a solid cast.While the story is good if not predictable for this kind of movie it runs on a little too long. Cutting about 20 minutes out of the film's 110 minute runtime and making it tighter would have gone a long way to making 100 Rifles a much better movie. One of the biggest draws of this film upon its initial release was the scandalous love scene between Welch and Brown. It has so little bearing on the plot that cutting it out would have been a good place to start with the editing scissors.".

	schema:reviewBody "100 Rifles was release in Australia at the beginning of March and wasn't release in New York City until March 26 1969. 100 Rifles is a 1969 western directed by Tom Gries. The film stars Jim Brown Burt Reynolds Raquel Welch and Fernando Lamas. Jerry Goldsmith composed the original music.Summary In the early 1900's Yaqui Joe a halfbreed Indian robs an Arizona bank and flees across the border into the Mexican town of Nogales where the governor General Verdugo aided by a German military adviser Von Klemme is waging a war of annihilation against the Yaqui Indians. Verdugo captures Joe and orders him shot whereupon Lyedecker a black American deputy assigned to bring the halfbreed back to the States intervenes and is himself arrested. The two men escape to the hills where Sarita a beautiful Indian revolutionary joins them. After Joe has revealed that he used the bank loot to purchase 100 rifles for the Indians General Verdugo once more captures the two men and orders them shot. Determined to see that the rifles reach her people Sarita leads an attack on the General's hacienda and frees the two men as well as the rifles. Enraged Lyedecker finally on over to both Sarita and the Indian cause rescues the children and vows to destroy Verdugo.Question What did Verdugo storm Yaqui village. Who finally won over both Sarita and the Indians? Who took over the leadership of the Yaquis? Why did Lyedecker ambushes Verdugo's train? Who distracted the attention of the soldiers? Why was the railroad manager Grimes captured by the Indians? Who outwitted the General? Now a few thoughts about this picture. I thought Jim brown was excellent in his role as Lyle Decker. Not only were Brown and excellent football player he was a good actor. What can you say about Burt Reynolds that hasn't already been said. He was usually his funny self with ways of getting out of trouble like any actor I know. Finally Raquel Welch! Her role as Sarita was fantastic the way she handle herself in the entire picture. The part where she's changing he clothes in the tent and the shower part under the watering tank was the best part of the movie. I give this picture 10 star for two reasons. The first and the most important was Raquel Welch as the leading woman with her beautiful body and her fantastic mine. The second reason because if you like action this movie had it and plenty of it.Some Trivia about this movie Though this movie has often been called a spaghetti western it actually isn't. That term is applied to westerns that were filmed by European companies usually Italian with a European usually Italian cast and crew and shot in Spain because its terrain closely resembles the northeast Mexicosouthwest US area. Although this film was shot in Spain an American studio 20th CenturyFox filmed it with an American director producer writers and mostly American crew. Star Burt Reynolds' previous film Navajo Joe would be properly regarded as a spaghetti western but not this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "So American westerns sucked after The Magnificent Seven and Italian westerns took over and they were the best. Many American directors started trying to rip off the Italians and they failed big time here is an absolutely perfect example.It's about a man who is a wanted bank robber who flees to Mexico and buys guns for his Native American people and then he makes the Mexican officials mad and has to run from them as well as a sheriff sent to catch him for the bank robbery. The sheriff gets involved with helping him and it becomes a war of Indians vs. Mexicans.That sounds like it had potential but they didn't pull it off. Director Tom Gries did a really good job a year before on Will Penny but he lost it here. This movie tries way too hard to be Italian it's filmed in Spain and has so many clichs it's not even funny. But wait it was funny...it tried humor as an additive but it didn't help. Where was the blood until the final fight at the end there is no blood and very little then. There was nothing special about the sets or direction or cinematography. The music was really bad too It was way over the top clich and so much that it hurt the flow of this film. One shot made me laugh hard with a little pistol shooting through 3 Indians ummm no thats not gonna even make it half way through the first guy.Burt Reynolds is a good actor but not for this type of role I wish they had cast someone better for this role I mean half of the Indians and Mexicans were Italian it has been a standard though in these films but Italians and American Italians are two different things appearance wise.Raquel Welsh was laugh out loud funny as an Indian wow and did she look out of place..and that accent wow  perhaps the worst casting I have ever seen. Jim Brown now...no problems at all from him he's a truly magnificent actor and did well in blaxploitation and westerns. He and Raquel had a big make out scene which was aimed to draw in fans of Welsh's beauty but it really sucked and brought this movie down.Very little on action here the last 15 minutes was decent but I can't recommend it.. 2 out of 10 stars.".

Jim Brown who has been good in other movies i.e. The Dirty Dozen really wasn't convincing as a sheriff were there any AfricanAmerican sheriffs in the Southern USA at this point in time? and his acting is quite wooden throughout. Raquel Welch although quite stunning to look at really was never a great actress and isn't all that believable as a Mexican guerrilla fighter. And seeing Burt Reynolds in a role as a half Mexican half American thief is quite unusual and not very authentic either.

This is her movie from start to finish. The plot line of this movie is not original if you are familiar with the Pasternak musicals. He always opted for classical music over current pop and standard pop songs of their time were always done opera style to suit the sopranos he liked to cast in his movies. Durbin a not very pretty teen who makes up for it with an avalanche of charisma sings the song. It's the depression. 100 musicians are out of work and need a job. Therft leads to reward which leads to deceit which leads to the fate of circumstances which leads to harmony in this hopeful picture. And a scene in the conductor's house when the 100 men come to play is one of the better constructed and filmed shots in cinema history. Old pro henry Koster nails every shot and makes you want to throw away all those auteur theory books. And the final scenes leave you warm as apple pie inside and happy and cheerful.

I love classical music and I never realized there was a popular musical like this using only classical music. Boy how times have changed...hehe. I just can't get over Deanna's voice. And yet you just never here about her like Judy Garland. Well Judy is great but Deanna Durbin was just as great in my opinion. Too bad she didn't make more movies or record more records. I could listen to that voice all day. The director Henry Koster did a masterful job. The scene of the orchestra playing in the conductors house is shot in a style way ahead of it's time and not a low budget 30's movie style. Koster went on to direct some very good movies. You can see why in this movie. This movie would be great for film students to study... a 1930's formula film that rises above formula to Art.".

Then why is she all but forgotten today? Because she simply announced that enough is enough and walked away from the socalled glamorous life of a Hollywood star to live in France as a nobody. But we can be thankful that before she made such a fateful decision she starred in a few classic movies that showcased her magnificent voice.One Hundred Men and a Girl is a wonderful familytype film to share with others. Made during the Great Depression it gave the audience an optimistic view that those out of work would find jobs or as the New Deal spindoctors put it Prosperity is just around the corner. Patsy Deanna Durbin attempts to put her unemployed father John Cardwell played to perfection by the marvelous actor Adolphe Menjou back to work as a trombone player. She tries to convince classical director Leopold Stokowski to put her father in his orchestra but to no avail. While returning a pocketbook her father found to a wealthy society matron Alice Brady she misunderstands a joke as a serious proposal to offer a radio contract to her father if he can get an orchestra together composed of his out of work musician friends. The rich lady's husband John Frost is brought into the deal when his wife suddenly leaves for an extended vacation in Europe. The rest of the film revolves around Patsy getting it all together by persistence and unknowingly giving the story to the media. For viewers it's fun all the way.There is also an assortment of gifted character actors to add mirth and merriment to the proceedings to name a few Eugene Palette Mischa Auer and one of the funniest men in the movies Billy Gilbert. Of particular note is a hilarious performance given by Frank Jenks as a singing cab driver with a penchant for opera who appreciates Deanna's talent.A bonus is all the fantastic classical music played by Stokowski and his orchestra. Stokowski was everyone's ideal of what a conductor should look like and sound like. Disney recognized this and put him in Fantasia. Stokowski was largely responsible for bringing classical music from its long hair ivory tower status to make it accessible to the average American. All this plus the enchanted singing of Deanna Durbin. Who could ask for anything more? A postscript Keep your eye on the feather in Deanna's hat.".

I can't help thinking that Judy Garland screened it and based her performance in Oz largely on Deanna Durbin's acting here just as I suspect Victor Fleming studied Henry Koster's direction of this film to figure out ways to make Oz believable on screen. Aside from the Wizard of Oz parallels One Hundred Men and a Girl is a firstrate film a masterpiece within the limits of its genre with a class consciousness we're more likely to see from Warners than Universal  one of its most moving aspects is the way the jokes and polite tossedoff remarks of the rich characters become heartbreaking when the poor characters take them all too seriously. Incidentally apropos of some of the trivia entries on this film the orchestra actually heard in the film was the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded in the Philadelphia Academy of Music on a multichannel sound system the first time one was used in a film contemporary reports differ on whether 12 14 or 28 microphones were used by then Leopold Stokowski was no longer the Philadelphia's main conductor but he was still the orchestra's principal guest conductor and he used them in other movie projects including Fantasia 1940.".

Durbin is at her most effervescent but somehow manages to avoid being cutesy. In fact the setbacks her character Patsy encounters as she tries to get the orchestra going are sometimes genuinely moving. The movie juxtaposes scenes of the superwealthy and the downontheirluck in this postDepression movie to very good effect. Much of the comedy came from wonderful character acting by the alwaysexcellent Eugene Palette among others. All in all a buoyantfastmoving vehicle with the bonus of a few lovely orchestral numbers conducted by Stokowski.

	onyx:emotionText "I didn't expect much from this movie as I'd never heard of it before though I'd seen other Deanna Durbin movies. I was surprised to find that it was really charming. Durbin is at her most effervescent but somehow manages to avoid being cutesy. In fact the setbacks her character Patsy encounters as she tries to get the orchestra going are sometimes genuinely moving. The movie juxtaposes scenes of the superwealthy and the downontheirluck in this postDepression movie to very good effect. Much of the comedy came from wonderful character acting by the alwaysexcellent Eugene Palette among others. All in all a buoyantfastmoving vehicle with the bonus of a few lovely orchestral numbers conducted by Stokowski. Definitely worth seeing for fans of Durbin and classic blackandwhite films of the 30's.";

With Universal best known for his horror thrillers Dracula and Frankenstein or best selling based love stories Back Street and Imitation of Life the Durbin products brought forth a new cycle of screen entertainment venturing into the world of classical music with the celebrated musical conductor Leopold Stokowski appearing as himself. Durbin who shared screen time with other Universal starlets Nan Grey and Barbara Read in THREE SMART GIRLS becomes the sole focus here sharing screen time with one hundred men being her father and his group of unemployed musicians.Set in New York City John Caldwell Adolphe Menjou is seen as an unemployed musician who makes a desperate attempt confronting conductor Leopold Stokowski at Carnegie Hall for a job but is consistently chased about by stage doorman Marshall J. Scott Smart with pleas ignored by Stokowski's manager Mr. Russell Jameson Thomas. After being shown out the door Caldwell acquires a lost purse on the crowded street with cash inside. Unable to locate its owner he returns home where he uses the found money to pay off his back room rent giving his teenage daughter Patricia Deanna Durbin a indication that he's now working under Stokowski with advance in salary. In due time however Patricia learning the truth locates the identification inside the purse and does the right thing by returning it to Mrs. Frost Alice Brady at her luxurious home. Telling her and society guests about her father's orchestra Mrs. Frost agrees to have her husband John R. Frost Eugene Palette sponsor them on his radio program. As Caldwell organizes his orchestra in the garage Patricia comes to the Frost home to follow up on her promise only to find that the absentminded Mrs. Frost has gone to Europe. After locating Mr. Frost's whereabouts she asks him for financial support but dismisses the girl and her story as one of many practical jokes by his friend Tommy Bitters'Jed Prouty. With unexpected results news reaches the media of Stokowski conducting for Caldwell's unemployed musicians causing complications for all concerned considering Stokowski is going on a six month concert tour in Europe.A delightful Depression era fairy tale type story helped by the presence of Deanna Durbin's self confidence and energetic personality. It's hard to believe how virtually new she is to the movie business and natural she is as a performer. It's not so easy to forget Durbin's blink of her eyes that bring a happy smile to her sadfaced father Menjou. Aside from its original screenplay by Bruce Manning Charles Kenyon and James Mallhauser the film is highlighted by a mix of contemporary and classic music including Symphony  5 4th Movement by Peter Ilyich Tchiakowsky conducted by Leopold Stokowski It's Raining Sunbeams by Frederick Hollander and Sam Coslow sung by Deanna Durbin The Rakoczy March by Bezloiz A Heart That's Free by Alfred G. Robyn and Thoms T. Railey Prelude to Act II from Richard Wagner's Loitengrin Mozart's Allelua in 'F' Major Second Hungarian Rhapsody by Franz Liszt and Libiamo Ne Liete Lauci from Guiseppi Verdi's La Traviata sung by Durbin. With these classical pieces good production values and high notes 100 MEN AND A GIRL gives the distinction of looking more like an MGM product than Universal's.The supporting cast includes such Hollywood reliables as Mischa Auer Michael Borodoff a musician and close friend of the Caldwells Billy Gilbert The Garage Owner Frank Jenks The Taxi Driver Edwin Maxwell Ira Westling with John Hamilton Jack Mulhall and Charles Coleman in smaller roles. The performance given by Leopold Stokowski may provoke laughter to contemporary viewers for his wavy combed back hairstyle and mechanical way of conducting his orchestra with the use of his hands instead of a baton. ONE HUNDRED MEN AND A GIRL earned an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture of 1937. After frequent public television revivals that took place in the 1980s this now Durbin classic got further recognition on home video around 1994. In 1996 it had occasional revivals on American Movie Classics and later on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered February 20 2006. If movie does not prove satisfactory with its story then it should for classical music lovers. ".

	schema:reviewBody "About a month and a half ago I got this movie on video and let me tell you if you're a fan of classic oldschool films which I am you'll find it irresistible! It is unique in many ways just like FANTASIA is. Had it not been for perhaps the black and white and the fewer number of compositions which are a bit briefer this would certainly live up to Walt Disney's outstanding revolutionary classic. Not for one minute though am I taking back my previous words of praise for 100 MEN  A GIRL and besides as far as quality and production is concerned FANTASIA is probably only about 15 better than this 1937hit out of 100. The two films are so much alike in many ways and yet they are both immediately thrilling so much so that they will take you by sudden excitement or awe even if you have seen one them before. The similarities between the two films are the fact that classical music is very much involved with how they are set up we see and hear Leopold Stokowski who will be celebrated the 30th anniversary of his death next Thursday and the main characters Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice for FANTASIA were troublemaking ones who always got up to no good. Here the beautiful actress Deanna Durbin plays a very mischievous young lady who is determined to restore her family to their former wealth after her father loses his job as a musician and so she singlehandedly takes charge of a big orchestra which could mean that she and her family will earn more money but there's still something wrong. Deanna realises that to make up a brilliant orchestra she'll need a proper conductor and I expect you know just who she exactly has in mind  that's right! Conductor Leopold Stokowski. But he is in this classic movie a busy man and I think I ought to just leave the rest of the storytelling to a video or DVD you must must MUST have of it. Like any old film which would originate around this early part of the 20th century I wouldn't recommend this for spunky teenagers or other people who are moreorless made up of 21st Century fashion for obvious reasons. My sister would definitely say right now oh god! You're like SO 20th century!. Yes I certainly am! And although this is in black and white it isn't at all dated but a memorable masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like musicals they can be wonderful escapes to an earlier time a chance to see and hear what was popular at an earlier time in our history. I've found a musical though in which the music is timeless. The film opens with legendary composer Leopold Stokowski conducting his orchestra in a performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. I'm led to believe that the recording itself was made by Stokowski's Philadelphia Orchestra. The story itself is somewhat tied to the Great Depression when I assumed unemployed classical musicians were wont to board together by the dozens. It is from these unemployed musicians that Patsy Cardwell Deanna Durbin forms an orchestra manages to find an unwitting sponsor Eugene Palette and lets the orchestra convince Stokowski to conduct them by having the entire orchestra perform Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 in the conductor's palatial home.The story is appealing an innocents convinces and tricks the wealthy and powerful into helping the penniless and powerless. The acting is good Eugene Palette is as good as ever as the sponsor Alice Brady is hilarious as his mindless wife Adolphe Menjou is empathetic as the father and Durbin is a splendid actress and vocalist. Comparing her to Judy Garland is not at all fair to Miss Garland a fine pop vocalist for her time. Durbin's voice is trained and she performs well in two standard numbers as well as Mozart's Alleluia from Exultate Jubilate and Verdi's Libiamo aria from La Traviata. The latter suffices as her remarks given at Stokowski's prompting at the end as her personal tax driver Frank Jenks looks on.I was pleasantly surprised when as Durbin's character tried to sneak into the concert hall during rehearsals to speak to Stokowski the orchestra played the Scherzo from Beethoven's underappreciated D Symphony Symphony no 2. They then broke into Wagner's Lohengrin Prelude which left Durbin's character overwhelmed.You do not have to be a lover of classical music to enjoy this film. Anyone who pulls for the underdog and smiles when they see a character with whom they might relate ought to like this one. Henry Koster's direction is excellent.".

To say that Durbin is an energetic actress is an understatement. She's completely hyper and that high speaking voice only adds to the anxiety level. As Patsy she is very pretty and sings well. Like all sopranos of that era she backs off of her high notes but the middle voice is quite beautiful and as she grows into a young woman it will become even more so. She does a credible job on Mozart's Alleluia and Libiamo from La Traviata despite some pitch problems. Given her age these are minor criticisms. She has a great deal of poise too for someone so young.The rest of the cast is very good and Stokowski makes a nice contrast against Durbin as his calm deliberate and very professional self.100 Men and a Girl is about a determined young woman with an outlandish dream who makes it come true. This isn't a fantasy like Wizard of Oz nor is it very realistic I suppose but the way it's presented  well you just believe it could happen.".

She has a great deal of poise too for someone so young.The rest of the cast is very good and Stokowski makes a nice contrast against Durbin as his calm deliberate and very professional self.100 Men and a Girl is about a determined young woman with an outlandish dream who makes it come true. This isn't a fantasy like Wizard of Oz nor is it very realistic I suppose but the way it's presented  well you just believe it could happen.";

Deanna plays the daughter of an impoverished musician Adolphe Menjou who previously worked with another famous child star Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. Most of the plot revolves around how Deanna manages to hook up 100 unemployed musicians with a famous orchestra conductor. It may have dated by today's standards but it is worth catching for the music and Deanna's singing talents.".

Here we have DEANNA DURBIN in her teen years trying to get her father ADOLPHE MENJOU and some unemployed musicians noticed and employed by Leopold Stokowski and successfully too in time for a happy ending. Deanna spends the entire film breathlessly scheming her way to gain attention for her father's out of work plight. After the smashing success of this film Deanna was destined to spend the remainder of her career at Universal pretty much in the Little Miss Fixit role she established here with so much pep and sincerity. JANE POWELL was to do the same thing at MGM except that her films were in Technicolor and given bigger budgets.It's all a bit dated now taking place at a dreary time in Americathe Great Depressionwhen almost everyone had problems finding let alone holding a job. But once DEANNA DURBIN lifts her voice in song the film can do no wrong. This girl was magic in front of the camera and her voice was pure gold for Universal.ADOLPHE MENJOU does a nice job as her musician father and ALICE BRADY and EUGENE Palette play a rich married couple who have the good sense to help Deanna. Stokowski plays himself agreeably enough without hurting the story.Summing up Threadbare story only works because Durbin has the energy and charm to carry it along with her beautiful soprano voice. Should be of major interest to Durbin fans.".

The story unbelievably nominated for an Academy Awardas was the film for Best Picture is an absurd extension of those put on a show in a barn yarns this time not involving a couple of performers but a fullscale hundred piece orchestra! Durbin and Menjou spend most of the film dodging the same security guard and being driven around by the same cabbie all to get help from conductor Leopold Stokowski. It's all very frantic with endless misperceptions that could be explained in seconds but if so would stop the story cold. There's no wit to the proceedings yet the film is loaded with witty actors such as Menjou Mischa Auer and Alice Brady. Such a waste. And Durbin is very charming yet she speaks in a yipping highpitched squeak for most of the film as if trying to make herself sound younger. And Billy Gilbert is always a comic actor to be taken in small doses but in here his demandforpayment shtick goes on and on and on. At least for those not inclined to accept the idea of people spontaneously breaking into song in musicals this film avoids that Durbin only sings when asked or as a full orchestra plays on camera. But hey it's all harmless fun so why nitpick? Because it could have been better and the lack of eratranscending quality in her movies is the main reason the talented Durbin is mostly forgotten today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two tabloid reporters Jennifer Stevenson Georgia Chris and Mark Webb writerproducer Joe Davison are wanting to be taken seriously as journalists and begin investigating a serial murderer known as The Teardrop Killer who has been hacking up people over a 20 year period but has somehow managed to elude the police all that time by hiding out in an abandoned building's cellar. Jennifer and Mark piece the clues together which lead them to a fleabag circus which seems to be right in the middle of some junkyard and revelation that the psycho is actually an obese jilted clown named Gurdy Jack Amos who murdered a few people decades earlier before disappearing. Also disappearing around the same time was Gurdy's lover Tracey Leslie Crytzer who has successfully managed to change her name and live in the same small town along with her and Gurdy's whorish cutter daughter Christine Raine Brown for two decades without being detected. Other characters include a dwarf and bartender who know the clown's whereabouts and a pair of ineffectual police detectives Kibwe Dorsey and Rod Grant as well as various victims a real estate agent partying teens etc. who show up just long enough to get killed.This very lowbudget film shot on digital excels at one thing and one thing only  gore. Heck during the first fifteen alone the body count has already reached double digits as the clown killer goes around a halfway house hacking up anyone he can get his hands on with a huge meat cleaver. There are cut off limbs slashings decapitations guts spilling out all over the floor a head getting stomped in and blood literally gushing out all over the place. These scenes are actually pretty entertaining and well done. Unfortunately after the first fifteen minutes of almost nonstop carnage the film then tries to add the plot and deal more with characters and this is where it starts to come apart. In fact 100 TEARS seems to falter any time it isn't being gory. The entire midsection of the film is slowmoving tedious and badly written with uneven performances and a sense of humor primarily centered around farts and bowel movements. The ending is also rather sloppy and the overdone gore scenes themselves start growing tiresome and monotonous after awhile.A good point of comparison might be with Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE aka BRAINDEAD which has even more gore than this one but also managed to be entertaining and fun when it wasn't being disgusting. Jackson's film is also much more clever and inventive when it comes to creating new and original gore scenes while the kills in this one  bloody as they may be  aren't particularly clever. Though in this film's defense it only had a 75K budget while DEAD ALIVE's was 3 million so I guess they did a good job cramming as much blood and gore in as possible. It's just too bad the other areas of the film aren't quite as strong. From a technical standpoint cinematography score sound editing etc. it's pretty uneven though again not bad for the budget.So if you're looking simply for gore and a high body count then this will satiate your blood lust. However if you're looking for a scary or otherwise good horror film you'll probably find less to like here.".

The film never tries to take itself too seriously and that's what makes it stand out in a sea of indie crap being peddled on the unknowing public. It is hard to produce a Realistic story when you are working with next to no money so why not make a film that uses that fact to it's advantage? The acting is stiff but watchable minus the wonderful comic timing of Joe Davison and the cinematography  lighting scheme are weak but tolerable. These down sides are over looked because the film simply entertains and you become a part of this twisted world thanks in part to a wacky soundtrack by The Voodoo Organist.

	schema:reviewBody "Like another reviewer pointed out this style of splatter probably has its roots in Germany with directors like Andreas Schnaas Olaf Ittenbach and Timo Rose. Both when it comes to the style of the gore and the way of making a script I would say. The gore is great and they have really tried making a serious plot but ended up with a plot that is very unrealistic and to say it plainly stupid.Let me explain by giving you the basics of the story. It is about two tabloid journalists writing an article about serial killers and trying to track down a serial killer wearing clown make up. So far it sounds OK right? But the thing is the clown has killed over 160 people over a period of over 20 years he has done nothing to cover his tracks and it takes the journalists a couple of days to figure out that the killings has always occurred in the vicinity of a circus. By some really lousy detective work they manage to track down the killer in a week or so which the FBI has tried for 20 years! I would compare this movie to Brian Paulins films which also are Germanstyle American splatter. They suffer from the same faults of bad story and bad acting but makes up for it when it comes to the gore. And really that is what is important here right? I mean sure I can enjoy deep relational dramas or clever social commentary but when I watch a movie like 100 tears I expect decapitation torture blood and guts. Watching a movie like this one for the story would make as much sense as watching a porno for the story. And the gore is great. Loads of blood and intestines throughout the whole movie. And the fx are good too for a low budget movie. But it becomes a little monotonous as the killer almost always uses the huge meat cleaver or whatever the weapon is supposed to be. Also the soundtrack is most of the times pretty good. The soundtrack includes weird but good music by The voodoo organist and Voltaire which I would not be able to define the genre of and a dark hardcore song which also is good. One complaint here is that the movie could have used some more songs instead of reusing the same over and over again. So monotony is sadly something that spoils the good parts of this movie a little on several levels. But not that much. When it comes to the soundtrack it's really a very minor complaint.Well that's my take on it. Turn off your brain for a while and enjoy the gore. And if that isn't your cup of blood stay away from this one.".

When you watch this film you'll understand why I say Raine Brown and others  Raine's performance of Christine Gleason is so incredibly overthetop that it pretty well overshadows all actor performance except for that of Jack Amos as Gurdy the Clown.This film features 9 kills in the first 12 minutes of the movie as Gurdy the Clown wreaks havoc and commits mass murder in a random halfway house. And from that point on there are more than enough bloody gory violent kills to keep even the most demanding of slasher horror fans from becoming bored.Joe Davison wrote a fantastic story with a really cool twist that I will not get into here because the film releases on DVD on the 8th of December here in the United States so I really do not want to ruin this film for you.Marcus as the director and creator of special fx is genius. The technical aspects of this film from lighting to camerawork to the directing of characters and development to every single kill stand heads and tails above most slasher films to include those put out by mainstream big budget studios.Buy this film. You'll not be disappointed in Raine or Jack's performance. Another fanstastic performance is found in Jeff Dylan Graham's short appearance as one of Gurd'ys victims. If ultraviolent gore and blood and incredibly terrifying clowns are your thing  then you'll absolutely be into 100 TEARS.".

	schema:reviewBody "This horror film surprised me because I'm not big on clowns so I wasn't sure how enjoyable it would be for me. But after just watching the beginning with all the killings Gurdy the Clown Jack Amos did I knew it was going to be a great film. Which it was! Jack Amos portrayed the character of Gurdy the Clown very well. Raine Brown plays Christine Greaston. Raine did a great job in playing her character who at times gets a little crazy. Both of them are a lot of fun to watch and follow as they create tons of carnage throughout the movie! I think the beautiful Georgia Chris was cast well for her role too.I would not say this film is slow paced like some have mentioned. In fact I would say it is perfectly paced and with a lot of action. They really pack a lot of killings through out the film. That's where FX expert and director Marcus Koch comes into play. Marcus is an FX specialist and does a great job with the killings they look very realistic. I think this is what helps separate this film from other Independent horror films. I enjoyed the story which was written by Joe Davison. Overall a very well put together film.".

	schema:reviewBody "100 Tears is a suitably dingy and sickening slasher flick which at an estimated budget of about 75k is at least a wonder of frugality.Yes 75000 can pay for gallons of blood viscera and artificial limbs.What money cannot buy however is a decent story something you either have or you don't. Or characters. Or perhaps even cohesive direction which may be an innate gift some have and some don't.The story  not that anyone cares about story in a movie like this  is about a serial killer clown and two obnoxious reporters one of whom looks like Alex Jones who track him down where the police have failed because they know how to use a computer and the police don't.The introduction of the clown shockingly violent though it may be is handled so witlessly by the filmmaker that it is hopelessly undercut. We see one of the reporters looking at a computer screen and talking about a serial killer on the loose and then the movie cuts straight to a series of brutal killings by our Bozo. The way this is shot makes it look like the reporter is watching the killings unfold on the computer monitor. They aren't. Some fairly cursory editing could have achieved the effect of having us realise we are witnessing the murders the reporter is describing. This would have provided a sense of mounting dread as we are let into information the reporter doesn't know and we know they probably wouldn't try to chase up the story if they know what we now know. Get it?Instead of quick cutting from the description of the acts to the violent crimes as the filmmakers obviously should have done we get a lengthy scene introducing 'characters' who exist only so that they can be killed and their introduction grinding the film to a halt  a halt it finally comes to at around one hour into the proceedings where I was so bored I mostly stopped paying attention.I have put more effort into writing this review than the screenwriters did in writing the movie. But yes they really went to town on the gore. One early scene shows a person's head split multiple times by Bozo's big meat cleaver until the head looks like a pinecone. If you're after sickening overthetop gore produced on a microbudget I guess you already know where to look. Just don't expect anything else.I would like to add however that the badguy Gurdy the Clown is actually scary. Much more so than almost any other slasher villain in any movie made for over one hundred times the budget that this one was made for.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a personal standpoint I've personally heard about this film multiple multiple times  Hearing mixed reviews mostly either saying this film is just flat out awful or that this movie is actually decent. The film overall just follows two journalists who're after a story that'll succeed heavily for them. They end up following the story of the alleged Teardrop killer or in this case the antagonized clown killer we also follow. From there on out both Mark and Jen find out more and more of this clown. Firstly this film took the interesting approach of a story This film however prevailed that to be a bit pointless. This story isn't the worst possible one out there but for the most part it's showcasing clich aspects. There's been countless films about detectives following cases leading to more than they bargained for this time now we have a gorehound film following such. The journalist characters we follow aren't the worst pair it could be much much worse. I found Mark to be a likable goofy guy  though at times he turns a performance of being funny at either the most ineffective times if not it's just ineffective in general. Admittedly however there are times he lightens the mood or simply prevails. Jen is a typical badass independent  like chick who's so involved in her work to where she leads some of the stupidest decisions  Once again seen plentiful times. The acting in this film for a considerable micro budget horror flick? It is what it is there are some really low points throughout I feel especially through the detectives However that's what's to be expected through these fun little films know what you're getting into. The gore in this movie is the absolute lead however. It's a decent display of absolute carnage through random characters Literally. This film throws the most random unnecessary display of people who're there just for the sake of dying. There'll be parts of the film you see quite literally a minute to two of a random person getting slaughtered said random person literally has no point of being there was never mentioned and shall never be seen again. For what's displayed the kills weren't the most creative Though that wouldn't be fair at all judging by the fact we have a clown with a noveltysized cleaver. As the body count rises the deaths grow less and less intriguing I feel. However the film takes that and flips it completely around through the closing runtime delivering the concluding intriguing back to uniquelike kills. The pacing of the film is another displayed topic that gets flipped  The beginning of the film paced decently around the middle to closing thirty minutes it grows slower and slower focusing more upon the story of which as said feels overlydone and clichd. However around the end we get a more quicker perhaps even rushed feel The ending feels rushed compared to the rest of the movie. There are a few ordeals that happen that just happened for the sake of the viewer to be pulled back in for a split second it felt. In conclusion the hype. Is it all there? Is this the goriest most disgusting NC17 film? No. I've seen another film by the title Sweatshop 2011 that to me proved more effective. This film follows like it  Clichd pointless plot that is there just for the excuse of killing masses. 100 Tears follows closely however took the unique  like approach of delivering a story As said many times said story is clichd and really does nothing for me personally. Fumbled dialog acting flaws to a minor degree all masked by a clown with a story .. and a massive cleaver. Would I recommend watching this film? Despite this review sounding as if I'm hating on it  I don't. I WOULD however watching this film. On an overall spectrum view of this film the hype is a letdown. On a spectrum view upon a gorehound this film delivered. If you're looking for carnage 100 tears delivers. If you're looking for minor  slight comedy? 100 tears delivers. However if you're looking for something totally new? You won't find it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to understand something and get this straight in your noggin...just because a movie was made doesn't mean that the crew knew what they were doing when they made it. Period! This is the case with 100 Tears which is so horribly bad and awful that you have to love or laugh at the fact that at least they tried to make a slasher movie with twice the body count as your average slasher flick. Body count? Over 30 check! The rest of the movie? Overlook the bad lighting cruddy story line bad casting horrible choreography and endless line of errors with the film and you're in for a lot of fun! We got a demented clown on the loose and he likes to go around swinging his giant meat cleaver at various parts of the body. Heads are cut vertically and horizontally in half guts are spilled and gallons of blood is shed. Now you don't have to watch this. Personally I would question the sanity of any one who would want to sit through this shart of a movie. It should satisfy gorehounds but that's about it. What doesn't work however is the nutty azz investigation with the detectives and for three reasons. Reason 1 No detective would go after a bloodthirsty clown with a weapon like that. Let the FBI deal with this matter you just stick with the crime lab. Reason 2 No detective would investigate a crazed clown without a weapon of their choice which is the case with these goons. So if your expecting a shoot out at the end you will be disappointed.  You'll be disappointed by the ending anyway trust me. Reason 3 It's barely even an investigation! There's no forensics nothing! Detectives are so useless I'd lay them off at least that way they would be safe from this lunatic clown that makes IT look like a Disney Jr character. So if you want to be branded for life have at it with this goofy horror flick. But I will say again don't say you weren't warned about the ending.  As far as the beginning you won't have to wait long for the blood to spill.".

Some of the actorsactresses didn't really put a lot of gusto into their lines and some of the conversations seemed unrealistic and forced. For a lower budget horror flick the camera quality was great. There wasn't the annoying shaking or anything and the lighting was pretty consistent for each area and really added to the atmosphere. I love the fact that the clown just walked around with a giant cleaver. Out of all the weapons they could have chose I am glad they chose the abnormally large cleaver. And the special effects at the first massacre were hilarious! But still bravo! Nice gruesome deaths!I also loved how the janitor hears people screaming and just keeps on mopping and then when he comes back and sees a bloody clown he gets angry that the floor is getting dirty after he just mopped. The clown was creepy so they get points for that. At first I thought is was a ghost clown that was seeking revenge but then its like Nope he's alive. BONUS POINTS The giant cleaver versus a pitchfork battleWhen they introduced the girl as his daughter closer to the end it felt as if they were trying to create an alternate Harley Quinn back story. I mean 1. She's blonde 2. He gives her a sledgehammer close enough to her giant hammer 3. This would explain her obsession with clowns. I hate the reporters. Like who goes into a large abandoned building where you know a crazy serial killer is going to be without back up? Even the cops couldn't handle it. MORE BONUS POINTS Voltaire song during the credits and during the fatherdaughter killing spree.".

BONUS POINTS The giant cleaver versus a pitchfork battleWhen they introduced the girl as his daughter closer to the end it felt as if they were trying to create an alternate Harley Quinn back story. I mean 1. She's blonde 2. He gives her a sledgehammer close enough to her giant hammer 3. This would explain her obsession with clowns. I hate the reporters. Like who goes into a large abandoned building where you know a crazy serial killer is going to be without back up? Even the cops couldn't handle it. MORE BONUS POINTS Voltaire song during the credits and during the fatherdaughter killing spree.";

After being falsely accused of a crime when he was working as a part of a circus act and then turns into a psychopathic killer with no remorse.At the beginning of the movie we meet two reporters Jennifer and Mark who are investigating the deaths of people who have been murdered by Gurdy for many years at the same time they are at trying to get their big storytrack the killer down and usually do the detectives work as the two of them are incompetent.There are dozens of kills and mostly on screenviolent and gory. Several graphic murders happen near the beginning of a film in scenes taking place with teenagers in a half way house. If you can get past the first fifteen minutes then you are likely to find the film watchable. The plot is average for this type of film although at times it becomes slow and drags on.In the final thirty minutes or so Gurdy the clown meets up with his teenage daughter Christine who has shown some questionable behavior earlier in the film and after a brief reunion they go on a killing spree in his house after a group of party goers break in.I enjoyed watching the main characters Gurdy and Christine and the reporters Jennifer and Mark as they were the only ones who really added to the storyline. The reporters also showed chemistry and had a sense of humor too. There are a couple of fairly brutal fight scenes between the main characters towards the end of the film as well. Most of the effects in the film were good for the budget although at times they were not taken too seriously!I would give this film 6 out of 10.".

Raine Brown appeared in Barricade a German splatter. Most of those German splatters are only released in the US. Whatever the circumstances may be concerning the relation between the two countries. This one sure delivers the gory stuff. It's splatter from start until the end. The only let down are the parts with the midget to much blah blah but it is necessary to tell the story about the clown. Not all acting is convincing luckily they are brutally killed. Some say the ending is a bit weak but for me it wasn't. The relation between father and daughter you will figure it out is maybe weak and what is happening between them too but the last minute is pure fun. If you haven't got enough the German release also has a part of deleted scene's were there is more gore to watch. And there is an alternative ending too given the opportunity for 100 Tears 2.

The movie is the story of Peppino Impastato a young leftwing activist who in the late seventies when almost nobody dared to speak about the Mafia and several politicians maintained that the Mafia did not even exist repeatedly denounced Badalamenti's criminal activities and the whole Mafia system by using a small local radio station to broadcast his political pronouncements in the form of ironic humour. In 1978 Peppino 30 years old was killed by an explosion. The police archived the case as an accident or a suicide but his friends never accepted this conclusion. Note This is a true story. More than wenty years after Peppino's death the case has been reopened. Tano Badalamenti meanwhile has been convicted in the USA for drug trafficking.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film deserves many reflections not all of them positive about both its formal features and content. On the first category I can say that this is a good film. On the second one I'll have to make a selection and invite you to watch the film and think about it. This film doesn't tell the true story of the facts which involved the true person Peppino Impastato. It isn't his biography. It's just the narration of his life life understood as the net of relationships of a single person with his environment territory family friends politics current contemporary ideas. So we don't watch a documentary film but a tale whose main character is Peppino Impastato actually we see photos of the real Peppino only at the end oft the film. Nevertheless what Peppino makes through in the film is the representation of true facts. It's very difficult to tell a tale which bases on historical facts. Giordana has already attempted that in La meglio giovent when he tried to show that history concerns the life of everybody creating an imaginary family whose life builds the plot of the film portrayed against the real background of Italian history. In I cento passi the task was more difficult because the narrated historical facts concerned the life of a real single person which were actually the plot of the film obviously the director could not take many narrative liberties such as the romantic family saga plots in La meglio giovent. So Giordana takes his liberties in trying to show the interior life of Peppino Impastato and his family. We receive a very impressive account of the possible thoughts and emotions of Peppino's father sometimes a violent monster sometimes a sad and lonely looser conscious that the life of Peppino depends entirely on his own capacity to observe the mafia code and at least in this way caring father and a more sober representation of his mother and his brother who are still alive. This tale of the relationships between the people who lived these true facts 3040 years ago is in the end a reflection about the cruelty of the inhumane situation which everybody had to pull through when living in a mafia world for example Peppino has to make radical and sad decisions and his father has to humiliate himself all his life long. That's why I say that this is not a mafia film but a film about mafia or an antimafia film. Mafia doesn't mean the Godfathers universe the mafia organization itself but the systematical repression of liberty which involves the progressive destruction of beauty as Peppino says sure not literally in a very touching and peaceful scene of the film and the following disorientation not to say impossibility of the self evolution. One of the first consequences of the contact with the mafia for the life of someone in whatever form this may take place is a lack of communication. So tries Peppino who cannot speak with his father as we see in their last very poor conversation to reach so many people as possible with a broadcasting Radio Aut the cinema club or the itinerant theater. At a certain point in his fight he has to break with with Stefano Venuti whose politics were too far from the people and with the superficial hippies whose ideas were irrelevant for the territory. His efforts to liberate himself show the awareness of the impossibility of doing it in a merely private sphere which is separated from a meaningfull beautyfull humane environment. This at least makes his life and we must thank Giordana for making a film about it universally relevant.".

At the banquet that follows one can see an assortment of characters that will be pivotal to the story later on.

Also in the cast Luigi Maria Burruano who makes a good job as Peppino's father.Although the theme is about Peppino's turn into leftist politics in his own land the film is enjoyable because it is never in one's face.

While there is no shortage of either the movie has a strong underlying theme and a decent plot.At the thematic level the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions controlling your emotions and making good choices. It's as much about motivations as macho.Yes it is a teentargeted movie. You've got rich kids running around in massive mansions driving expensive cars but that's just the setting. You've got people beating the crap out of each other but that's just a plot device. The heart of the movie is about personal growth and making choices. It's not an empty action flick or a taped brawl.It's not the best film of the year and it may well wind up as a late night cable movie in a few months but it's nowhere near as bad as people expect. It's definitely worth the price of a rental and worth the 10 to see it in theaters if you've got no other plans. I blame the negativity largely on the advertising which tries to sell it as just another fight movie.".

It gets a bit mediocre as I have said and some stuff just falls flat but they handle everything they lack so well with other interesting and appealing scenes and substance excluding the featherweight dialogue haha. Overall I was so happy with the outcome of this movie because while being clich and certainly not worthy of winning an Oscar or anything like that it was really enjoyable and I had a great time watching it. If you lower your expectations and free your mind I bet you will too. I suggest you see it if you can appreciate it for what it is. If anything else there is Cam Gigandet and Sean Faris shirtless.".

If on the other hand you were old enough then you will see this movie for what it is an updated version of Karate Kid a much better film. Before seeing this I looked up the movie and read the plot and that was the first thought that ran through my head seeing it only proved it. By the time the movie was over I counted over 15 similarities between the two films and yet nowhere did I see any credit given to the original writers. Shouldn't they be suing for plagiarism?1 Poor kid is star2 Moves out to a coastal city3 Meets pretty girl4 Pretty girl has jerk boyfriend5 Jerk boyfriend is local fighting champ 2 years running no less6 Poor kid knows a little about fighting7 Gets into fight with jerk boyfriend and gets beat8 Meets up with a teacher in the same style as jerk boyfriend9 Teacher is foreign born10 Teacher has experienced great personal loss11 Poor kid and girl have tiff12 They get back together after he apologizes for being a jerk13 While jerk boyfriend is good fighter has bad focus14 Poor kid and jerk boyfriend face off in tournament he is champion of15 In the tournament poor kid suffers a serious injury16 Poor kid wins anyway and earns jerk boyfriend's respectThere are some other plot holes which stretch the credibility of this movie even further. The main villain is in good shape as he walks around half the movie with no shirt on revealing some welldefined abs. I find it awfully hard to believe that a high school kid could achieve something like that.The other plot hole which also made me scratch my head was the death of the lead character's father. He got drunk at a bar got behind the wheel and wrapped his car around the tree. The lead was with him and I was wondering What is a high school kid doing at a bar? Do they check IDs any more?And another thing what are high school kids doing participating in fullcontact fighting tournaments? Isn't there some kind of law against that?The one good thing I did like about the movie was the villain. He had a whole smug attitude which came off as highly believable. But still that isn't nearly enough to make up for this ripoff. I'm just glad this was a sneak preview so I didn't have to pay to see this.".

Kid gets the living crap beaten out of him by the town bad boy. Kid starts some heavy duty Karate training so he can get revenge by kicking the bad boys ass while simultaneously winning the heart of the hottest girl in town.Now if I had to write a summary for this film in 3 sentences it would be as follows Kid moves to a new town. Kid gets the living crap beaten out of him by the town bad boy. Kid starts some heavy duty Mixed Martial Arts training so he can get revenge by kicking the bad boys ass while simultaneously winning the heart of the hottest girl in town.The plot is literally exactly the same. The only difference is that when it came to the soundtrack they replaced Peter Cetera with nu metal in the vein of Linkin Park and the most pivotal characters in this film were cell phones.People have commented that the fight scenes were pretty good. I tend to disagree. They were pretty weak. Instead of watching this film just watch the Karate Kid and have a computer handy. When the fight scenes are on in the Karate Kid just turn away and watch some UFC fights on youtube. You'll have practically the same film as Never Back Down just much much better.I was surprised at the lack of tits in this film. Usually a film with a script of this caliber has a heap of tits. This was obviously an oversight from the producers and I'm sure that will be fixed if they make a sequel.I do respect the fact that they were able to jam every 80's film clich ever into the little over 90 minutes. When writing a film review on this site you have the option of checking the contains spoilers box. This feature could easily be disabled for Never Back Down. It is impossible to spoil the content of this film as everybody has already seen it at least 1000 times just with a different title.Will the good kid defeat the bad kid in a no holes barred fight? Who knows? Well actually everybody.".

The only difference is that when it came to the soundtrack they replaced Peter Cetera with nu metal in the vein of Linkin Park and the most pivotal characters in this film were cell phones.People have commented that the fight scenes were pretty good. I tend to disagree. They were pretty weak. Instead of watching this film just watch the Karate Kid and have a computer handy. When the fight scenes are on in the Karate Kid just turn away and watch some UFC fights on youtube. You'll have practically the same film as Never Back Down just much much better.I was surprised at the lack of tits in this film. Usually a film with a script of this caliber has a heap of tits. This was obviously an oversight from the producers and I'm sure that will be fixed if they make a sequel.I do respect the fact that they were able to jam every 80's film clich ever into the little over 90 minutes. When writing a film review on this site you have the option of checking the contains spoilers box. This feature could easily be disabled for Never Back Down. It is impossible to spoil the content of this film as everybody has already seen it at least 1000 times just with a different title.Will the good kid defeat the bad kid in a no holes barred fight? Who knows? Well actually everybody.";

The claims of this being a remake of The Karate Kid plus Fight Club and mixed martial arts is not undeserved or inappropriate. What it does aim to be is a Karate Kid for the MTV generation and a generation of kids who may think that MMA is the future of the martial arts.As a casual fan of mixed martial arts the gladiatorstyle spectacle of this sport goes all the way back to the Greeks with their sport Pankration which pretty much resembles today's MMA. The idea of crosstraining and mixing techniques of different fighting styles gained popularity in the 20th century with Bruce Lee and his theories on Jeet Kune Do which when translated from Cantonese means the way of the intercepting fist. However mixed martial arts as we know it today in the Ultimate Fighting Championships UFC PRIDE and other MMA organizations gained widespread recognition when Brazilian JiuJitsu grappler Royce Gracie won UFC 1 in 1993. Since then a revolution has been sparked in the world of fullcontact fighting. On a side UFC president Dana White considers Bruce Lee the father of modern mixed martial arts.In Never Back Down which seeks to promote MMA for the mainstream Jake Tyler Sean Faris who looks remarkably like a young Tom Cruise is a promising football player who is relocated with his widowed mother and younger brother from their home in Iowa to the posh surroundings of upperclass Orlando Florida they opt for a cramped apartment in suburbia away from the surf and bikiniclad babes. Right away it's established that Jake's a born brawler and has a chip on his shoulder so right away the filmmakers are attempting to remove themselves from the Karate Kid legacy.Right away he locks eyes on the pretty blonde Baja Miller Amber Heard uhhuh and she invites newkid Jake to a party later that night. At this same party he locks heads with richboy Ryan McCarthy Cam Gigandet a champion MMA fighter who gets the upper hand on Jake and beats him to a pulp in a noholdsbarred brawl.All hope is not lost. On his first day of school Jake had witnessed a fight happening under the bleachers where an outcast kid named Max Evan Peters was getting his butt kicked by Ryan and his goons. It just so happens that Max is being trained by the legendary MMA champ Jean Roqua Djimon Hounsou and takes him under his wing. So cue the MTV soundtrack and training montage.In terms of being a simple martial arts movie Never Back Down is nothing new. Plenty of martial arts movies have been made about the bullied good guy who gets his butt kicked learns to fight from a master and tests out his newfound skills by getting revenge on his tormentors in the ring. The bythenumbers script by Chris Hauty pays attention to a few of the details of modern mixed martial arts training but doesn't really go into any real depth about it even if some of the harsher stuff is only glossed over for the sake of trying to mainstream it. But I also guess that this Jeff Wadlowdirected vehicle has seen way too many better movies and it's inherently selfreferential toward them.Never Back Down I guess is a fun way to spend 7.75 what I spent at the very least even if the plot is formulaic it's still entertaining. The acting writing and plot are decent but still the performances acting and writing like everything else are bythenumbers. Although we don't really wade grimly through worthless dialogue scenes we do perk up for the fighting and training sequences. The best thing about these scenes is that they're authentic what the actors are doing is so real you believe it. As brutal as they are even for a PG13rated movie they're fairly exciting and there isn't a whole bunch of flashy camera cutting that takes away from the intensity of the fullcontact punching and kicking. The camera stays put for the most part and isn't moving all over the place. It looks like the actors are really going at it and it looks like it hurts. So you believe it in a way you don't really do for a lot of martial arts movies made in America these days.And that's what noholdsbarred is all about right?610".

At the root of this I think is the film's willingness to observe and comment on the 'problem' emotion of anger. Rather than leave it festering or simply transform it 'as if by magic' the audience can almost see the transformation in the main character through his physical exertion which eventually leaves him free of its destructive role in his life.

It even employed a little finesse in some of the onscreen relationships and in ways that seemed to hold a little verisimilitude even. If the filmmakers had made Jake Tyler a gay youth fighting for free speech in the school newspapers the critics would have loved it. All they saw was scary teen violence so theywell less than loved it.Truth is that the movie isn't really glorifying violence it's glorifying the quotidian although it does seem to consider violence an acceptable means to an end.

In ancient societies it was important to cultivate a thug beatdown mentality in a large contingent of the population so the wimp elite could send them off to die in wars of conquest. Problem is these days war is conducted by computer geeks not street thugs. So this movie comes off as outmoded and quaint. Kinda like Aristotle recommending homosexuality to keep the ancient Greek armies marching with a smile. No these days the elite use movies like 300 to incite hatred make genocide look like fun and glorify dying all so a bunch of politicians priests and wealthy landowners can profit from our blood. That takes care of the mental training whereas the kids can use video games to achieve the motor coordination skills needed to be the most effective mass murderers in history. So I guess this movie is fine to fire up the infantry cannon fodder. I would like to think our society operates at a slightly higher level. The invention of edged flint tools 50000 years ago makes the premise of this movie a tad obsolete. When I was in high school the afterschool fights were a social event but the bully pecking order was established with bats knives and guns. I guess as a sissy whitetrash substitute for real violence this fight club BS must be what passes for street tough these days.The movie was OK technically casting and acting were great. I don't like the herkyjerky fastcut shaky camera but to show the fights from further back would reveal them to be fake or amateurish. I guess one problem was that all these kids came off as airheads and I could not feel too sympathetic towards them. Maybe that was the objective so we don't mind seeing them beating each other senseless. I liked the black guy especially when I read he was the Amistad guy.

The editing and the stunts worked well. The story is clich but so what as it never gets old. A coming of age fight movie has to have something going on between the fights and Djimon Hounsou did an amazing job. The movie is definitely worth a look and Djimon is always clutch. The movie works for what it is a fun actionpacked and full of hot girls flick! I'd see it again.".

Is that suppose to make me buy it please find me someone who loves all three of those ya no one. OK so the film is not all bad Djimon Hounsou is good as always the look of the film is unique and the fight scenes are pretty darn good. Unfortunately the plot is predictable the characters are one dimensional there is a girl cause there has to be right and it attempts to send a message and fails horribly. I think the directors theory is fill the film with fight scenes and loud music montages and then you don't have to have character development or to much of their crappy dialogue. So I guess that helps the film instead of hurting it.".

You can't get any cooler than that. If my parents named me Jake Tyler I would have gotten more muff than a 70's porn star. The fact that people actually went to see this film and took it seriously perplexes me. This is why the industry keeps making films such as Never Back Down because every TAPOUT apparel wearing barbarian thinks that plots acting and originality are things of the past. Two words to describe this film...LAUGH RIOT! I was merely going for the sake of humor and heckling but I believe I gave the American movie going public more credit by thinking they would watch something a little more credible and leave the theater empty for others such as myself going for the exact same reasons. Once again...I was mistaken. Fearing the repercussions of heckling and laughing out loud every time they mentioned the title of the movie in their dialogue would leave me pulverized by the 3 TAPOUT wearing tools in front of me I kept my laughter at a reasonable volume. Calling this movie a modern day Rocky or Karate Kid is an insult to those writers who took the time to create something original for the public in the 80's. Pat Morita must be rolling in his grave....of laughter. HAHAHAHAH!".

Solid acting good story and nice fighting scenes.The thing i don't understand are the bad review about this movie. Sure it isn't something new it's basically a Karate Kid clone but made in the 21th century. It gives you a nice story and is a solid flick not a prizewinner or something but considering that it gives you what it promises then it's a great movie. Don't expect Fightclub or anything like that this is something more simple.The story is about Jake Tyler a kid who just has moved to Florida. He start school but before he knows it he gets beaten silly by another kid in school who is a really skilled MMA fighter. Now Jake takes up training to fight back but realizes that revenge isn't everything and also makes new friends and a girlfriend. It's a classical story nothing new but it still works. The plot is engaging and you really want to see Jake succeed with his training and his emotional travel. The acting is good sometimes it can get a bit over the line but otherwise it's good. The fight in this movie are well executed. One thing that is really bad in this movie is when they show Jakes younger brother a tennis star. He is so annoying with his sweetness and the fact that all the kid does is act smart by mumbling up numbers and facts about tennis.I recommend you to see this move it will be much better then you think!".

Now we are shoveled crap like Meet The Spartans and other seriously stupid parody movies and then movies where senseless violence reigns dominant and there is no point to the movie anymore. But the beatemup genre has returned with Never Back Down.Most of you know the cheesy story line which is the only reason that I have to give it a 9 instead of 10 a rebellious teen who gets caught up in some trouble which leads to the whole development of the movie. If you can set that aside and see what is being shown to you it is easy to see why NBD is such a good movie. There is just enough action to keep the fans excited enough drama to keep them drawn in good plot development to keep you interested a good mix of hot girls and for the ladies there are buff dudes and the sense of morality and character.Being a martial artist for 10 years myself I was pleased with the fight scenes although they cannot compare to The Protector but since this movie wasn't starring people like Jet Li who dedicate every performance to fighting the actors did very well and proved themselves.The cheesy storyline and mediocre character development are the only things keeping me from giving this movie a 10 star rating. The critics gave this movie too harsh of a rating because they just didn't understand that this movie wasn't meant to win an Oscar or be hailed as the movie of the year it was meant to give us a break from most of the crap movies now and do what movies are supposed to do entertain us.

There are some uncomfortable elements in the film for sure. The way the film takes advantage of class politics poor white boy from Iowa without a father gets taught to fight by poorer Brazilian man to fight super rich white boy is cheap completely subverted by MTV Cribslike glorification of wealth Jake doesn't have a car but it never becomes more than an a badge of authenticity since new friend Max seems fine with lending him his hot little convertible for the entire story.Violence is glorified and the warnings from Hounsou's character never to fight outside the gym play the clichd moralistic role you'd expect until the final fight scene demands something else.None of this should be any surprise to audiences and in a way it seems hard to critique the film for them. If the genre is fight film you've got to play by the genre's conventions and Never Back Down definitely does.The more intelligent parts of the film occur with Wadlow's original take on the rumor mill again showing his ability to capture super modern technology on film remember Cry Wolf's AIM sequences? this time utilizing viral video and DV camcorders. The fight scenes are well choreographed and shot like a morethancompetent music video.

I was blown away  and exhausted!  by the end of the movie.The story wasn't all that bad  maybe a little predictable but it didn't matter. It never dragged on or got boring. Djimon Hounsou was awesome as always.The camera work along with the intense stunts and stylistic editing make this a great fun time.

I have contemplated suicide only once in my life and it was while watching this movie. This is basically You Got Served if it was kickboxing instead of dancing. Why did I see this. 10000 BC and this in two consecutive days. What is the world coming too? Somebody please throw me a good film to watch. I am still vomiting blood from watching this trash. I would pay somebody not to see it. Please let me give it less than a 1. Why can't I give it a negative 1000000? Wow this was a horrible film. 1 is way too high of a rating. The best part of this movie was when it ended and the torture was over but then I had to accept the fact that I had just watched it. Don't see it. Watch some intelligent films if you can find any.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Never Back Down";
	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Yen's recent Flash Point provided action movie fans a glimpse of MixedMartial Arts or MMA where the best of breed techniques in taking down an opponent get gelled together to provide unpredictability in offensive and defensive response coupled with the transformation of almost every part of the body into a welloiled mechanism to dish out some serious punishment. But with Hollywood well you can bet your last dollar that the philosophy behind this brand of martial arts get dumbed down to 3 words  Mix it up.Like many movies starring teens and targeting the same demographics Never Back Down follows a standard formula that most of such movies adopt especially with taking things to the streets like Fast and Furious 3 and the Step Up movies which dealt with different subject matter like street racing and street dance. Throw a misunderstood teen into a new environment where he learns that his current skills if you can call them that pales in comparison to the boys in the big league. Add a beautiful lass to beguile the protagonist and she'll either serve as motivation or fodder to get his butt kicked because she just so happens to the antagonist's main squeeze. So in a fight for respect  pride  to get the girl he goes into training mode and comes back in time for the finale with chick around arms. That's about it.So don't go into this movie expecting a lot more. Touting itself as a new fight club it is anything but especially with everything cerebral removed from the plot. I also don't see how it won this year's MTV Movie Awards for best fight sequence as most of it dwelled on grown men hugging tightly on the ground engaged in complex body grinding and twists. Action fans will be a tad disappointed with the quality of fights shown here as this is not really MMA. I believe if you throw Donnie Yen into the mix he would pawn everyone in the movie even those who choreographed the supposedly deadlier moves which boiled down to a series of boxing hooks and punches.With the formula in place everything else will just fall into its rightful position. Sean Faris stars as Jake Tyler a teen with anger management and guilt issues who can't control his temper and flares up easily when his dad gets insulted. In his new school he chances upon 2 things an underground fight club and hot blonde Baja Miller who turns out to be the girl of his wouldbe nemesis Ryan McCarthy Cam Gigandet who turns out to be the biggest baddest fighter in school. Losing both the girl and his pride in one fell disgraceful swoop he undergoes training with MMA exponent Jean Roqua Djimon Hounsou whose rule is simple  you do not fight outside his gym. Expect rules to be broken expect the two mentormentee to bond expect some rationale to be provided to head to the fight we've been waiting for and while the peer movies gave us a finale to remember this one fizzled out with cheap moves.But I've got to say something about the movie. Fans of Tom Cruise will definitely see shades of Cruiselike characters in Sean Faris. He's like a walking talking Cruise clone only that he's younger taller and more muscular. In fact if you take Cruise back to his teens Never Back Down would probably be one of the movies that would fit into his budding filmography. Not that I'm gay here but seriously if you happen for any reason choose to watch this movie tell me if you agree with me. They shouldn't have billed the movie as the new fight club they should have billed the movie as starring the next Tom Cruise. Though of course it remains to be seen if Faris can steer clear of crazy couchjumping antics.".

	schema:reviewBody "While those who say that 'Never Back Down' is somewhat a rip off 'Karate Kid' are right on the money I chose to see it in a different way. I remembered a movie that was fresher in my memory. From what the trailer showed me and from what watching the film actually confirmed 'Never Back Down' is actually is in a few ways similar to 'The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift' albeit substituting fast cars and races with mixed martial arts.Yes you heard that right. 1 OK so you have this young stud who always seems to get himself into trouble. 2 He moves into a completely different environment. OrlandoTokyo 3 He meets and flirts with a hottie who turns out to be the dissatisfied girlfriend of the local bigshotchampion. 4 The young stud knows a little about the sport Tyler knows a little about fighting and Sean knows cars and is challenged by the bigshot. 5 He loses this first confrontation badly but afterwards trains to be the best. 6 Eventually he gets the girl and he earns respect by defeating the champion.Now despite the obviously rehashed formula I still give this 7 stars. Why? Because it is still a pretty entertaining film. Never mind the stereotypes cheesy lines and the predictable turn of events. Never Back Down still manages to keep you watching. The action is good and although clich the substance of the plot is actually quite palatable. It certainly delivers what it is supposed to deliver nothing more and nothing less.So is it worth spending a few dollars to see it in the theatres? I'd say why not? I believe the reason why this film gets such harsh reviews is because people might have been expecting a little too much. It will definitely not get any critical acclaim or anything remotely close to such recognition but it never aspired to do so to begin with. It was never groomed in that fashion anyway. Just like The Fast and the Furious it's probably not everyone's cup of tea. Depends on your taste both these movies dig deep into their particular genre. Some people will enjoy seeing and talking about cars more than others. In the same way big fans of fight movies and Mixed Martial Arts alikesuch as myself will enjoy this film a bit more than others. However the same rule applies here. I say just take it as it is and you'll find that Never Back Down is actually an enjoyable movie. It's nothing half as bad as it is said to be.".

In the hotel they fantasize and have a threesome with the delicious model Risa Zita Grg as part of his bachelor party. When they return to their normal life they are blackmailed with a porn video of their sexual encounter with Risa. David and Tish go to the pornographic underworld of Budapest trying to retrieve the tapes and avoid a scandal and damage in Tish's father and David's career.I was surprised with 8 mm2 since I was expecting a garbage but I found it very erotic amoral partially predictable but also attractive thriller. The beginning does not develop the character of David and Tish as it should but later the viewer begins to understand their motives. David's is clear since he is ambitious aiming to climb to a higher social position at any cost therefore making the plot point in the conclusion of the story partially predictable. But Tish is the great character of his movie since she is a much sexualized woman who fantasizes her sexual life playing games with David and entwined between her fear and curiosity and desire about the underworld of sex and pornography. Due to the strong sexual content and nudity this movie is recommended for specific audiences. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 8 mm 2".

The plot is not hugely elaborate it's a blackmailing story which takes a slight twist at the end.Actors? Acting should have been with more heart and more convincing.Other than that it's a highly enjoyable movie. It's full of masterfully photographed erotic filmnoir atmosphere very nice onlocation footage from Hungary and an excellent soundtrack.Although the story has its deficits it serves well for generating a big deal of suspense. Much of the suspense originates from the psychological interplay between the different opponents in the movie. It's not about dull action scenes or car hunts. Altogether still worth a 7. Good time watching.".

It's full of masterfully photographed erotic filmnoir atmosphere very nice onlocation footage from Hungary and an excellent soundtrack.Although the story has its deficits it serves well for generating a big deal of suspense. Much of the suspense originates from the psychological interplay between the different opponents in the movie. It's not about dull action scenes or car hunts. Altogether still worth a 7. Good time watching.";

It just seemed like a publicity act to title it that so that didn't sit well with me. Other than the trick to get you to rent it its not a waist. The acting in this movie is solid the characters are believable. The story line is a little sketchy and jumps without really understanding the point. Be prepared for a lot of random nudity. Over all its not so bad. I would recommend it as a date movie for a younger couple. Its a sexy thrillerwho did it type story similar to Basic Instinct".

Does she enjoy being watched and does he enjoy watching? that could have been interesting if someone had taken making this film seriously but instead it's just poorly done and seems to make the plot drag all the way up until the twist yawn endingthough I will say it at least ties up a few questionable loose ends. Most films of this type don't always feel the need to do that. As for the actual sexual parts of the film well it doesn't star Jenna Jamesonbut for something that can be found at Blockbuster it has more than its fair share of oohlala moments walking onto a real porn shoot in the middle of filming being one of them. Do the sex scenes make up for the lacking plot? Not really unless you're that desperate for a sex scene without being caught browsing at the local 24 Hour store. But this is no worse a sequel than Ocean's 12 and then there's that moment of realization in both when it becomes apparent you've been had and someone is laughing all the way to the bank. At that point you can alaugh at yourself for being as dumb as the movie and finish it with a few more beers or bdo a little investigating to find out who's behind itand realize that you should have known better when you saw that Jonathon Shaech's next role is in Roadhouse 2...which I'll also probably watch because I'm a glutton for punishment.

The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that I will not spoil it just didn't make any sense.A diplomat and his fiance are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area she's very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the diplomat freaks out and kills the guy leading into a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into.What could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad. Like I said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but it's good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core.410".

As every similar movie filmed in the Eastern Europe it creates a dark and mysterious scenery. It also contains many nude and sex scenes which may look excessive but in my opinion they contribute to the whole atmosphere.As you probably read in the storyline the couple gets secretly filmed and then blackmailed by some people which appear to belong in the Hungarian Mafia. The plot evolves beautifully and as far as the actors.. i know Johnathon Schaech's acting is not that gifted but you have to admit that guy looks really cool lolPersonally I don't care if it has nothing to do with 8mm I neither if it should be called differently. Whichever the title is it is a nice film especially for those who are into mysterycrimethrillers.I definitely suggest you to watch it and even if you don't get that excited I guarantee you ll have a fun couple of hours ".

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 292008 4 out of 10DirJ.S. Cardone Sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting softcore scenes. The movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy. The couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a threesome and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fianc is part of a welltodo political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed who sent the package what they want and how to clear their names before any of this gets out. This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time to the point where their friends  family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time. This movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride. This mistake of course keeps the movie going. The performances are fine despite the noname cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become hohum about  the way through. And of course they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prioras is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie. This doesn't help this movie one bit though.".

It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.Basically from the plot outline verbatim an American diplomat David Huxley and his fiance Tish Harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when in the end Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiance which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.David was no heroic person throughout the film. You could guess he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect. There were plot holes How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute? There were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS too because it wasn't even about a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 34 long movie.Go rent and maybe buy the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It has everything better about it from this film. I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know it's a couple years late but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman Uma Thurman who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill David Caradine. Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital without child and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses through this film and the sequel you find out who she really why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's overdramatized KungFu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes this movie is violent but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of KoolAid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord ORen Ishii Lucy Lui. Once again Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And if you just don't like Tarantino himself and find him annoying like everybody else I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing.".

The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Leeera action pictures. In those movies the stories were very similar epics of revenge and they never had much of a budget for good gore effects. It was more or less throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed type of effects which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies something despicable happens to the weak hero whole village razed family slaughtered etc.. and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the secret move which the master normally does not teach except of course in this rare instance. That move as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2 is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's it replicated admirably the incredibly onesided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.All in all a great and original film!

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw Kill Bill Vol. 1 and was surprised to be honest at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman or artist if you prefer at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible the score is for the most part vintage Tarantino selections and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks Uma Thurman is a great female lead for sheer presence and decent acting chops. Even Lucy Liu who I expected was going to rehash her Charlie's Angel character burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions the intercutting between dialogue the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS indeed having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic Pulp Fiction style but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents as some have claimed and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is poor or that there are no memorable lines Empire. The kungfu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine. He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill of course is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen it's his eye.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors Quentin Tarantino but the wait for me has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense hateful movie containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class precision and close intense attention to every detail. But what else should we expect from a movie freak like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel the pregnant woman in the bloodsplattered wedding dress is Black Mamba better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin Bill and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead however she was merely comatose. Four years later 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma ferociously focused on one mission to seek revenge on her former master. One by one she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence the action and the result of that violence with it being a bit overpowering in the end. But without the violence KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie when it came to writing its script more he wanted to show what the characters he had created and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie my samurai movie my spaghetti western movie' and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction the movie that made him successful via KB. If this is true I do not feel it is gloating rather I give Tarantino great praise because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride' aka Black Mamba Uma Thurman is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well as she not only looks attractive but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo Sonny Chiba. This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill David Carradine is their leader a person we only hear and see in hand gestures which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like ORen Ishii aka Cottonmouth Lucy Liu whose introduction via the Japanese Animation was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant lawyer and translator Sofie Fatale Julie Dreyfus who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB' is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl Go Go Yubari Chiaki Kuriyama who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse Elle Driver aka Californian Mountain Snake Daryl Hannah who shows very little emotion towards 'TB' other than hate. Vernita Green Vivica A Fox is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me especially the sword fighting as they are so fun and intense with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth  co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1 which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise and you can see what he is making a stand against film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB but at certain times the violence was 'laughable' as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point setting up the conclusion Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill Volume 2 get here A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill Volume 1' 4.5 Very Good  Brilliant Film".

I don't mean to imply this is a shallow film far from it i simply found it easier on the mind than Tarantino's other movies.Uma Thurman left for dead by her exboyfriend Bill doesn't die and begins her quest for vengeance by hunting down Bill's gang members in a search for Bill. Armed with a Samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills Uma delivers action violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precision.Need i say this is excellently directed brilliantly scripted and cast and should be in everyone's Tarantino collection.1010 Second only to Pulp Fiction. Although it has wider appeal I think".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF though had interesting subplots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.Unfortunately Kill Bill was not interesting nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hitlist of people from which to extract revenge.The way she extracts revenge is to engage in handtohand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.I think Luci Liu sp? is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists  and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20 30 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.Then she battles the board leader and after sufficient scenery changes she wins again.Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood as you'd expect from the director I won't try to spell his name. But you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait my mistake you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.After the Liu's character is killed 3 is checked off and the movie ends.There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art but do not make a movie.I have no interest in Part 2 because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.Two thumbs down. Don't believe the if any hype.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do I think this movie is absolutely brilliant? Yes. Do I think this is the all time greatest movie ever or even a top 50? Nope. I find the dichotomy between people who hate this movie and those that think it's the greatest film ever made is interesting. Even more interesting is the apparent split between fans of Volumes 1 and 2. Like the thread says I think most of it's a matter of those who prefer style to substance. For my past Volume 1 destroys Volume 2 but I concede that everyone has their own tastes and experiences and that no one pinion has any more weight than the other. Two scenes in particular really make this movie brilliant in my opinion and both are fairly subtle in their portrayal but fascinating by their tone and the cinematic elements that come together to carry them off1. The scene where Oren and the Crazy 88 enter the House of the Blue Leaves. Absolutely magical. The score the pacing the atmosphere....simply magnificent. The slow motion pull away and the obvious hierarchy of characters Lucy Liu was absolutely made for that part and that part was made for that scene. The beautiful and menacing Gogo Yubari and the goofy 88s trailing behind. You can also feel the tension the owners feel at having such esteemed guests but one's who admittedly exude as much fear as they do respect. Add to this the nameless faceless people dancing who are oblivious to the regality and lethality of Oren's entourage. 2. Oren is called out by Kiddo who subsequently whacks off Sophie's arm in a highly symbolic gesture. Words can't describe how moving that scene is. The score is superb and the timing is nothing short of perfect. I especially love the way the crowd pauses after the arm slicing...like they're all stunned or still convincing themselves it rally happened...then all rush out screaming. Kiddo makes a slow deliberate plod through the panicked crowd a march to destiny filmed from several perspectives that combine holistically to give the segment a life of it's own.One aspect of this movie that puzzles me is the emphasis it's critics make of the gore. For my part the gore was so outlandish it's hard for me to see how anyone could take it seriously and that was part of the appeal. Buckets of blood spraying 15 feet in the air is so beyond the realm of reality how could you possibly take it seriously? For my part it was borderline comical and really brought out the flavor of the scenes rather than being their focus. And regardless of what you think of Tarrentino as a director the man is bar none the best at matching musical scores to a scene in the business. A few other noteworthy scenes...The endfight between Oren and Kiddo....marvelous stuff. The backdrop of the snow and the water the smooth silence interrupted by the fountain again a great accompanying score. Fine piece of film craftsmanship.Kiddo's overhead film shot while walking to the bathroom of the House of the Blue Leaves. Simply amazing. 5678s performing live is just quirky yet proper enough to really add some depth and the unique filming make this a scene to behold.".

Opening scene in black and white bloodied Uma then fade to black melancholy music fading out to perfection suburbia toys in yard nice pretty house then we have a funny as hell chick fight which is made all the better by a little kid that just stays there.. and says nothing. Basically the imagery is great and sets a mood. Then we have a flashback to the wedding followed by a hospital scene giving some background of what just happened. And it ends. The moment you see black mamba telling her big toe to move while the camera repeats this a few times you have a problem. The first thing you realize in the frames after we finally stop zooming on the toes is that well this is nothing more than a Charlie's Angels rip. Concept and idea. Ok there is still time for salvation right? Not really. Because then comes an anime scene that has no purpose at all and unless you are an anime fan it will simply suck. Lots of animated blood still motion drawings and all other things we have seen in countless anime toons on cartoon network come to life. You can safely skip it not like something valuable will occur. Which is the problem with this whole movie. It has no coherence. You can watch it at any point and not miss a thing. But it gets worse. Next on the murder list is the same girl we saw in the anime scene and she is in Japan. So Black Mamba goes to Japan and what follows for the other half of the movie is mindless kung fu that is bad a lot of stupid time wasting moments of Japanese people speaking Japanese wise words which are translated in annoying captions. Actually that would have been a nice touch but they literally NEVER end. Japanese. Subtititles. More useless preaching. Wise men advice. Captions. Japanese. Captions. Repeat.Although it is basically badly executed kung fu even it suffers from some pretty obvious faults. Booze drinking schoolgirl uniform wearing underage female guard? Come on. And just to mention the tie wearing sword swinging guards samurai? that just keep on coming. Please its a parody. A pathetic attempt to mix the infamous Japanese gangs of the 80s and 90s with ancient kung fu and traditions. At least that's the best I could make of it.I am not going to guess what that movie was trying to be because it clearly had no point. It started great it fell apart in about 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and that is even sadder. Save your time watch the first thirty minutes then go rent a real kung fu flick to fill in the rest.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSFirst of all let me warn you. I've always detested Tarantino so I didnt'go see this film free of prejudice.That said I can't think of a worse film I've seen lately except The Matrix Reloaded. The reason is that Tarantino shows too much violence and that he doesn't show anything else. But that's the point! some will say. The point of what? Ok lets' make a film and let's show a rape and say that that's the point. Does that mean that the film is good?Tarantino has always been overrated I disliked Pulp Fiction as well. The reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy so many will feel smart by saying that he's a genius that his films are masterpieces and all that crap. The plain truth is that he's either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man who's found a way to make pots of money by exploiting people's naivety. Or both.Although I don't like gore or black humour I sometimes appreciate it eg some films with Vincent Price. The point is trivial but worth making black humour has to be well humorous. The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about you just won't get it that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow uninspired unoriginal uninventive films who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life you may find such a film creative or inspired instead of just the trick it is.Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.If you watch a gory bmovie or any bmovie for that matter you may like it even love it but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of art. Tarantino is hip for the time being so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.But time will tell.Remember David Lynch.".

The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about you just won't get it that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow uninspired unoriginal uninventive films who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life you may find such a film creative or inspired instead of just the trick it is.Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.If you watch a gory bmovie or any bmovie for that matter you may like it even love it but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of art. Tarantino is hip for the time being so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.But time will tell.Remember David Lynch.";

But now he is back after a six year hiatus with Kill Billa thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles BronsonTelly SavalasBurt ReynoldsClint EastwoodFred WilliamsonSteve McQueenJim Brown and James Coburn. Kill Bill is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like Master Of The Flying GuillotineThe Wuand the television shows like Hattori Hanzo. This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.You have the wicked witthe funky scorethe hipretro cultural artifacts and lots of nonstopbrace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once againhe has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to bootplus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with herand Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassinattached to a criminal group of bodacious martial artstrained killersVivica A. FoxDaryl Hannahand Lucy Liuwho are lead by the unseenshadowy Billunseen in the first installment played by David Carradine. Among the crew she was called Black Mambabut otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her nearterm child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. Howevera lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a heada leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slasheda eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good KungFu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chibaaka The Street Fighterand so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the waywhat Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jacksonhowever was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in Pulp Fictionwhich also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in Jackie Brown.Howeverthe film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004.

	schema:headline " Calling it Styleoversubstance would be a HUGE overstatement for it's pretentious and horrid in many ways";
	schema:reviewBody "I hate this movie a lot. I have been going on about it for a while so I think it's time to take my anger out by making a review. I think I may have offended some people and I apologize. So here it goes Kill Bill is a very bad movie. I assume that Quentin Tarintino immediately drew in fans with Pulp Fiction because of its wit and it was high on the cool factor. I saw some of it and I will say that it was impressive. But it looks like Tartintino became lazy by making this and codirecting the crappy Sin City.The storyline of Kill Bill is about its name. Bill attacked a woman who we know as The Bride. Her name is censored when mentioned. Now The Bride wants revenge on Bill and members of a gang called The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad. So she goes out and finds them and attacks them. The story ends there and it does well sort of.The story is something that was thought up in a few minutes. The Bride wants to kill people and she does. As simple as that. Kill Bill Volume One really is just shallow characters killing each other. First she battles some woman. I have no clue what her name is though. Then we find some history of The Bride. After we find that The Bride was somehow knocked out. I forgot why. When she wakes up we experience more brutal torture of people. Then she gets a sword and kills lots of other people. The End.I find this very similar to Sin City. It's a gory shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes. The only real difference is that Sin City had something close to a storyline. This one didn't.Supposedly this is Tarintino's homage to martialarts films. So that makes it a masterpiece? That makes it get onto the Top 250 Movies? Is that why it's rated so highly? It has plenty of references to other martialarts films. For example Uma Thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by Bruce Lee in one of his previous films.Well The Ring has loads of homages to horror films including Rosemary's Baby Silence of the Lambs and Poltergeist. Where's that on the Top 250 movies? Well the homages seem as a coverup for the story's' weakness. Why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt? I know people get attacked in a number of outfits but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit? The anime scene is near pointless and doesn't even look like anime! It looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically and ends up looking pretty ugly.Maybe it's because of the action. Well there are only about two or three fight scenes and they are only a bit exciting. There are plenty of other movies which have better action. For example Ultraviolet Another bad movie had more action than Kill Bill and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair. If that had homages to other films would that be on the Top 250? I must say even the action in The Karate Kid seemed to have a certain wit to it.All the action in Kill Bill is meaningless. It is meant to entertain. But with loads of blood what fun could it be? Its fun to watch The Bride slash her way through people but after severed limbs appear it loses it's fun. The violence in Saving Private Ryan and I think the violence in The Wild Bunch had purpose. But this like Sin City is just sick cruel violence.With that there are PLENTY of movies with good action such as Terminator 2 Judgment Day Princess Monoke House of Flying Daggers and The Quick and the Dead. All of these had better storyline that Kill Bill even if The Quick and the Dead seemed a little weak in that department.Backing up to horror films I see that this film plays out like a mix of Scream and Hellraiser Bloodline. One person repeatedly tortures victims like Pinhead with a blade. Like Scream Sadly it's not as thrilling as Scream. It's as thrilling as Hellraiser Bloodline. The characters are thin. I'm not talking about thin as in skinny but lacking detail. Sure The Bride gives a bit of inside info on them The inside info is showing the character killing somebody else. but the characters usually die after that.The action seems too unrealistic. Our main character kills plenty of people but how? She jumps in the air and lands on her sword It's stuck into the stairs. but how does she do that? There are some movies with unrealistic action sequences House of Flying Daggers Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but those take place in ancient China. This takes place in a modern day setting and doesn't feel like either one of those films.That's why I hate the film. I can go on and on but why should I have to? I suppose I hate it for all these reasons. Maybe the hype killed it. Or it could be because Dan Grant's review influenced me to hate it. Either way I don't like it.Yet there are some good points to this movie. The action can be fun for some. I don't think torture is necessary though. The music was excellent. I liked the Bang Bang and Twisted Nerve song. I suppose it does seem interesting at parts like when it turns into anime even if the scene seemed pointless or blackandwhite. But this was already used in MANY other movies.But it still stinks. To me this is about as bad as Ultraviolet it's shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness.210".

But this on its own Kill Bill 1 is rated so highly on IMDb that it makes the Top 250 above films such as Butch Cassidy Life of Brian Annie Hall to name just three. That is because there are a lot of complete idiots out there. Hopefully this will go towards redressing the balance";

	schema:headline " A movie of visual splendor and a mixture of styles.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a visual experience of different styles all combined with also some trademark Tarantino elements.The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This however is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is simple straightforward completely overthetop but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed. The movie its story comes totally secondary as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several mostly Asian cinema styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual overthetop looking sequences. His aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappoint.Always when looking at a Tarantino movie it becomes obviously that he's a big movie buff and movie lover. Tarantino really shows his love for and pays homage to Asian cinema and especially anime. Most notably of course in the animated segment that is great by the way but also in almost every actionfight sequence in the movie and its violence. It gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of 'coolness'.The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie. But all of the violence is done in such a deliberately overthetop and fake looking way that it becomes entertaining rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black  white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions.The power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing. The movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity. The movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling though it all widely differs from each other at times. I think that this is mainly thanks to Tarantino's directing who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line. Visually the movie is also definitely helped by Robert Richardson fantastic cinematography who should at least had been rewarded with an Oscar nomination for it.The movie is filled with some big name actors though not all play a significant part in the movie yet see Kill Bill Vol. 2 for that. Uma Thurman is truly superb as the Bride and I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. She also was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for it. Also really superb in her role was Lucy Liu. Again also her best role yet.Not of all the trademark Tarantino elements work out well in the movie I definitely missed the typical trademark Tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark nonlinear storytelling felled pointless and didn't really served a purpose for the story. It therefor really isn't Tarantino's best but it's definitely his most experimental and most visually orientated stylefull splendid movie.Unusual overthetop but strangely intriguing entertaining and overall brilliant. Yet another Tarantino mustsee!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are 1. The animated sequence because it was a different story from the film's which made a suitable mood for the perspective. Overall it is the best idea ever the other two films I've seen with animated sequences are Lola Rennt a German movie  Karam an Indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as Kill Bill.2. The sword fight with the Crazy 88s just before her revenge with ORenIshi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight. I thought it was going to be simple because Bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficult.The main reason why it is one of my favourite is because I'm a huge fan of revenge movies and Kill Bill gives a very deep insight of the topic e.g. Like the Old Klingon Proverb on the screen before the film which is Revenge is a dish best served cold  when Hattori Hanzo said that Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest and like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost...to forget where you came in. It definitely deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and Vol 2 was also good but not better than Vol 1.".

I even had TiVoed Vol. 2 of the series but if its anything like the first volume I don't want anything to do with it. Sure there are plenty of violent movies but this is just plain gross. So if you ask me I wouldn't ever ever ever recommend it. I doubt there will be a cleaner version of it too because it appears that the whole movie is going to be grossly violent. Who likes to look at Uma Therman anyway? She freaks me out without portraying a white trash assassin in a movie.Of course I can see how this is very much a homage to the oldschool 70's era martial arts movies but I just cannot get past the blatant violence. I'm all for realism but do I really need to know exactly what it is like to see hundreds of people killed all in different ways? The answer is no thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Robert Altman makes a new film it's always a noteworthy event that gets the attention of critics and audiences alike large productions with huge ensemble casts of major Hollywood movie stars playing real people with full fleshed out characters each with their own subplots that intertwine only subtly until the end when it all finally makes sense. In Gosford Park Altman makes only two changes to this formula Hollywood stars are replaced by Top British talent that may be unfamiliar to most American audiences and a straightforward murder mystery supplants his traditionally complicated plot line. It is in these changes however where Altman charms his audiences in a new way. The story takes place in 1932 at a gathering of aristocrats and their servants for a hunting country weekend at the estate of Sir William McCordle. Some time after all the guests are settled in and whose affairs begin to intertwine one of them is bumped off. While all the characters are well fleshed out it's Mary played by Kelly Macdonald who is the focus of the drama. She's the maid of Maggie Smith's Countess Constance of Trentham and is being groomed to follow a path to become head servant. After the murder takes place emotions unfold and secrets from the past are revealed that help the characters  and the audience  solve the mystery. The drama is even more punctuated when Mary's innocence and naivet is lost as she pieces together the deeper scandal involving servantmaster sexual relations and bastard children.One of the best aspects of film is how it illustrates that fine line dividing the masterservant social structures and how often that line is crossed reminding us that life is just a game of costumes and masks and we're all the same underneath. While the story was reminiscent of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians where it's the mystery that captivates the audience Altman goes beyond the mystery with Gosford Park by using the murder as a vehicle to draw attention to the human condition and class hierarchy.On the downside but to no surprise to fans of Altman's work the movie is often hard to follow. His style of filmmaking involves entanglements of characters and subplots that don't appear to have much to do with one another at first blush and Gosford Park takes this to the next level. Here the murder takes place at the climax of this confusion leaving you rather disoriented in the middle of the 2hourplus drama. Fortunately the tone loosens up when a comedydim police inspector basically gets nowhere in his investigation but the pieces start coming together through the other characters. The good news is that it all seems to come together in the end in a way that didn't require grasping every detail of every scene.Despite its intricacies and confusing moments there is so much more to Gosford Park that makes it interesting and enchanting. While it is clearly a sophisticated piece of film work with impeccable acting directing and design don't stress about not keeping up with it all the time. Sit back and take it in and you'll feel satisfied in the end.".

Sit back and take it in and you'll feel satisfied in the end.";

	schema:headline " A review of a great film";
	schema:reviewBody "Violence mystery sex and murder Gosford Park has it all.  Director Robert Altman once again takes the Hollywood formula and gives a unique twist.  The story begins when aristocrats during 1932 gather at Sir William McCordle's Michael Gambon estate for a shooting party.  The guests are wealthy people with their trusty servants.  People arrive at the McCordle estate two by two and the traditions begin.  The servants set up dinner for their masters and the aristocrats begin their personal routines. The story moves on as the characters begin to establish their names and the audience learns their varying social status.  The intertwining stories among the guests begin to surface and the audience begins to realize there is much more in this house than what meets the eye.During the night one member of the elite group is killed.  None of the guests seemed to be fazed by this event and are only upset by the inconvenience it sets up for their lives.The only one troubled is Constance Countess of Trentham's maid Mary Kelly McDonald.  The story begins to focus on Mary who discovers secrets among the visitors and leads the audience to solve the mystery.The great aspect about this film is Robert Altman's abilities to bring the past to life.  He pays excellent attention to detail and is able to recreate the feelings and morals during the time period.  He emerges the audience into a film world filled with history and story.  Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots lighting techniques and camera filters.  His fluid camera movements visually portray foreshadowing and relationship among characters. These elements give the audience a complete understanding of the mood and atmosphere in the film.I recommend this movie to anybody who has the patience to sit and focus on this excellent film.  Although the beginning is appropriately slow moving and the characters names are difficult to remember the payoff is worth the efforts.  This movie is made for active film viewers and all Robert Altman fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are directors who can direct huge massive Cecil B. deMille epics like Peter Jackson. There are directors who have done nailbiting suspense usually drenched in subtext like the Director Alfred Hitchcock. There are others who can do whatever they want and create beautiful detached yet powerful films like Stanley Kubrick. Then there are ones who are brilliant with ensembles telling stories which converge and often overlap within a main plot. One of them is the great Woody Allen. The other one is Robert Altman.GOSFORD PARK is an update of Jean Renoir's 1939 film LE REGLE DU JEU in which wealthy relatives of an aristocrat come to a shooting party at a country home. Here because of the obviously strained relationships between the host and his family has been less than amicable it serves as a springboard where everyone's worst behavior and heretofore concealed feelings towards each other really come forth with an undertone of meanspirited cruelty just brimming below the surface while the servants act as nonentities when in their employers' presence but occasionally break into.Boasting one of the best introduction sequences ever itself lengthy but necessary GOSFORD PARK is a tourdeforce of narration that recalls Jane Austen's work. We first see Mary Maceachran Kelly MacDonald playing innocence that becomes a keen observer maid to Lady Constance Trentham Dame Maggie Smith having a splendid time in her role and Lady Trentham's flighty demands and annoyed conversation as they make their way to Gosford Park. They cross paths with movie actor Ivor Novello Jeremy Northam his agent Morris Weissman Bob Balaban and Weissman's protg Henry Denton Ryan Phillippe who is the only one who doesn't introduce himself proper for reasons made clear later on also heading towards the manor. The hellos are strained  Lady Trentham is clearly not the friendly type  but Mary is starstruck like the young girl she is. Once they and the other guests reach the house activity is buzzing almost factorylike factory being an important term here as the housekeeper Mrs. Wilson Helen Mirren taking selfcontrol and omniscient stillness to a whole different level in a performance that has to be analyzed frame by frame calmly gives out her orders. However Altman Fellowes and Patrick Doyle bring a little extra dose to the scene the moment Robert Parks Clive Owen enters the picture and introduces himself to Mrs. Wilson while Mrs. Croft Eileen Atkins passes them by and turns to hear. Not soon after the camera makes a zoom into a bottle of poison itself symbolic since immediately after that the rest of the characters begin to show hints of their own shared poison. Isobel McCordle Camila Rutherford William Michael Gambon and Sylvia McCordle's Kristin Scott Thomas daughter is carrying on with Freddie Nesbitt James Wilby who is tied to a marriage of convenience to Mabel Claudie Blakely whom he feels ashamed of. The Stockbridges are also on the outs Lord Raymond Charles Dance preferring the safety of his own kind according to Louisa Stockbridge Geraldine Sommerville who is one of William McCordle's many women. Mary learns of the McCordle's familial relation to Ivor Novello from fellow maid Elsie Emily Watson who while staunchly expresses her nearhatred for Lady Sylvia suggests eversoslightly she whom she prefers working for. A later scene reveals little love between the McCordles William McCordle's repudiation of Lady Constance and his threat of withdrawing her pension and even less love between the Nesbitts and even more tension between the Merediths Tom Hollander and Natasha Wightman as they try to con McCordle into some odd business. Greed lust and secrets permeating every pore of Gosford Park and its inhabitants.As a script and a story written by Julian Fellowes GOSFORD PARK is one of the most tightly and detailed ever committed to film because it forces the viewer to pay close attention to what characters are saying or suggesting to each other through their body language because everything has its own meaning nothing is said or done to fulfill a plot requirement or for the sake of making conversation and even the most trivial hints are steps leading towards bigger and bigger denouements primarily because the characters reveal in snippets pieces of information that tell us they know more about themselves than we do  and this is its greatest asset. It is the equivalent of an abstract painting that upon scrutiny reveals layers and layers of what people dare not express up front and direct. This makes it in fact a delicious mystery and an open secret at the same time. Death and its causeeffect an element ever present in an Altman film never looked more elegantly funny. In this movie with death coming as a murder or doublemurder if you will to a widely disliked character only Louisa Stockbridge expresses concern and even then it's somewhat insincere. Altman has great fun exposing the crime scene but even more fun introducing Stephen Fry as the largely inept investigator because while the truth is brandished right in front of his face under the form of the aforementioned blink and miss pieces of information we've been getting he doesn't see it before we do.GOSFORD PARK is also a meditation about an era where people who represent the exploited part of British society  Robert Parks Mrs. Wilson Elsie  and outsiders such as Mabel Nesbitt or Morris Weissman react against this caste system that seemed unmindful of the changes happening in the outside world. This doesn't necessarily solve anything or everything that occurs in GOSFORD PARK  some plots are hinted at and that is fine  but it does present an intricate comedy of manners of a time gone by just before WWII when Upstairs people mingled and shared their lives with the Downstairs people.Edited 11.17.2006".

	schema:reviewBody "In this exhilarating chambre piece set in a mansion during the 1930s Robert Altman meticulously explores the social interaction between the English aristocracy and their servants. Class distinction is demonstrated funnily between the people who live above the stairs and those who live below. It is especially the interaction between the characters who clearly dislike one another but are forced by circumstance due to various obligations to practice social rituals that provides some of the most amusing cinematic moments. It is all done with clever subtlety.Bob Balaban and Robert Altmann story idea combined with Fellowes's eloquent writing is first rate. The dialogues are filled with wit humour and subtle depth. The mansion itself plays a key character in the story but it is the spellbinding cinematography that functions as the mansion's eyes. The camera is constantly on the move and the viewer feels like an ignored but curious member of the crowd. Many themes are tackled in the movie but it is done quietly. The film also slowly demonstrates the disintegration of the English class system that started around the war.Altman has assembled a mountain of talented actors that include a bitchy Maggie Smith a pompous Michael Gambon an obnoxious Kristin Scott Thomas a vulnerable Camilla Rutherford a desperate Tom Hollander a devilmaycare Geraldine Somerville a knowswherehestands Jeremy Northam a douchebag Bob Balaban a horny Ryan Phillipe a stupid Stephen Fry a loyal Sophie Thompson a principled Helen Mirren an enigmatic Clive Owen a nononsense Emily Watson a nottobemessedwith Richard E. Grant a pullingittogether Derek Jacobi a frightened Alan Bates a grumpy Eileen Atkins and an adorable Kelly Macdonald. 'Gosford Park' has one of the best ensemble cast.I also loved the soundtrack. It is never overdone. The jazzy tracks contribute well in setting the atmosphere and there are some wonderful songs performed by Jeremy Northam's character.In the beginning it is a little difficult to keep up with the names of the characters which leads to a bit of confusion but with a little bit of patience once you're over that it becomes easy to follow. Like a beautiful painting once it captivates the viewers attention it immediately involves them in an alternate world. From the start you feel like an ignored guest and at the end it's as though the host has just seen you out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a lovingly crafted beautifully acted ensemble piece set in an English Country House which is superficially a murder mystery.  In reality it is damning indictment of the class system and the level of servitude expected from those at the top of the tree from those that wait upon them.What was surprising was the level of humour that Altman brings to what is as it unfolds a very sad story of transgression and loss.  Maggie Smith has all the funniest lines as a viscious but impoverished woman who comes to her family with begging cap in hand.  Those playing characters above stairs all look and sound the part and effortlessly give the impression of wealth and privelege and the callousness that breeds.Many of the downstairs characters drive the story and there are some wonderfully wry performances from the likes of Richard E Grant and  Alan Bates.  As the moral centre of the film Kelly McDonald is excellent and is well matched by Emily Watson as Emily and Clive Owen as Parkes.  Ruling the downstairs troop is Helen Mirren whose cool visage hides a seething mass of emotion.  A well deserved nomination here.Only Robert Altman could assemble a cast of this magnitude and distinction and have many of them speak no more than a few lines !  Greats of English theatre like Derek Jacobi have small but memorable roles and there is not a bad note struck from any of the predominantly English cast.I was slightly puzzled by the character played by Ryan Phillipe although his perforamce was fine but felt that the intrusion of two Americans into this  English mix worked well to highlight the entrenched class roles played by everyone in the house.Whilst perhaps not his best work this is a very good Altman film  we move in and out of conversations whilst never losing their import and the cimematography has a fluidity that few other film makers can match.A classy piece of filmmaking that rewards careful attention from the viewer.".

Greats of English theatre like Derek Jacobi have small but memorable roles and there is not a bad note struck from any of the predominantly English cast.I was slightly puzzled by the character played by Ryan Phillipe although his perforamce was fine but felt that the intrusion of two Americans into this  English mix worked well to highlight the entrenched class roles played by everyone in the house.Whilst perhaps not his best work this is a very good Altman film  we move in and out of conversations whilst never losing their import and the cimematography has a fluidity that few other film makers can match.A classy piece of filmmaking that rewards careful attention from the viewer.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1932 a group of socialites landowners Americans and their servants arrive at a country house for a shooting party over the weekend. As the relationships and tensions twist and weave upstairs so too do the dynamics and relationships between the various house staff and valets below the stairs. Stories and characters play out but whenever a murder takes place the police move in and everyone is a suspect.My plot summary suggests that this is a sort of murder mystery and that this will act as the driving force behind the narrative however this is not the case and in reality the film is much more about the characters and relationships than it is about the murder. To this end the film will annoy some people who are perhaps not used to the sort of film that Altman produces and will be looking for the mystery aspect to be the all. However I found the rather freewheeling ensemble approach to be very enjoyable and the first hour moved quickly by thanks to the natural interactions and relationships and it was actually the mystery aspect that didn't work as well because it required too sudden a change in pace  a change that the material seemed to resist and hamper. Despite this it does still work mainly because the Oscar winning writing brings out such convincing relationships and social politics making it enjoyable and interesting throughout. The direction is great the use of two cameras in group scenes means that the actors seem to flow around as naturally as their dialogue would suggest  few seem forced to act to a fixed point and seem more realistic.Considering the talent on board it is not surprising that nobody really upstages anyone in particular and the ensemble feel is strong. Smith Gambon Thomas Dance Northam Balaban and others make the upstairs fizzle with snobbery and unspoken resentments. Meanwhile the downstairs staff are just as well drawn and delivered by Mirren Owen Jacobi Watson Bates Grant Atkins and others. Stephen Fry is fairly minor within the plot but he is delightfully comic even if he doesn't quite fit into the film that well.Overall this is a classy film very much in the Altman style  an ensemble piece of characters and relationships that we are left to drift within. Some viewers will find it frustrating that it takes so long to get to the point where the mystery kicks in but I actually found this to be the weaker aspect of the film and the most enjoyable parts were the well written characters and dialogue which deservedly won Fellowes his Oscar.".

	schema:headline " AWESOME ALTMAN!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film opened the London Film festival and I was lucky enough to see get tickets. Robert Altman was there and so were most of the cast.I've seen over half of the Altman cannon of work and this has to rank up with his best. Set in the 1920's a group of people get together for a shooting weekend at the estate of Lord and Lady Mcardle. There are two sets of characters the Toffs upstairs and the servants downstairs.  With his customary multistreaming overlapping narrative cross cutting dialogue and interwoven storylines Altman sets up dynamics within and between the two classes. There are up to 32 speaking parts and each of them is invested with a clear identity. Just from a few lines a gesture raising of an eyebrow we have an idea of a character's feelings and motivations.At times the narrative moves at such a fast pace but we never lose track of whats going on. Scenes such as the Toffs in the Drawing room having tea  many conversations happening dynamics being set up  and another where the servants are rushing around downstairs as the camera weeves its way through the corridors are exhilirating cinema!!  Altman has a tight grip on the proceedings and this only wavers slightly towards the end.There is a fantastic scene where Ivor Novello  a guest is invited to sing for the other guests and all the servants listen covertly from whatever vanatge point they can find. Novello oustays his welcome amongst the gentry but the servants cant get enough.What Altman has done here helped enormously by the wonderfully humourous script by Julian Fellows is invested these period characters with a modern sensibility. These are not the boring stuffed dummy museum pieces of your typical period picture these people are real. Rich or poor their fallibilities desires disaffections and frustrations are evidently clear. This movie is so good I wanted to get up and cheer at certain points. Altman is well served by the 'creme de la creme' of British Actors. All are excellent Maggie Smith Emily Watson Helen Mirren Kristin ScottThomas and Jeremy Northam to name a few. This film may not be everyones cup of tea and i am someone who can go watch anything from Scream 3 to the latest hot film from Asia but those that invest the time on this film will be much rewarded.  Altman deserves the Oscar that has eluded him for far too long.".

It's a film that works on many layers and needs to be seen more than once for one to fully appreciate its resonance.The film admittedly stinks as a murder mysteryit's almost funny how little Altman himself seems interested in the whodunnit.  But typically for Altman it's the deconstruction of the genre that he's interested in not the genre itself.  This movie isn't about a murder in a country house it's a movie about class differences and people connecting or not connecting with one another.It seems futile to mention stand out performances in a film filled to the rafters with standout performances but I did especially like Emily Watson as a cheeky maid Helen Mirren as the perfect servant and Kelly MacDonald as the novice lady's attendant who grows more than anyone else over the course of the film.The film is at its best when it's probing the emotional depths of the storyit comes across as a bit too glib when the satire gets especially acidic mostly with the Kristin Scott Thomas character but like the best of his movies Nashville MASH Short Cuts Altman knows how to control his own cynicism and doesn't let sarcasm rule.With his on againoff again track record we can expect the next Altman film to tank so let's enjoy this one while we can.".

People think that this film sucks because they don't like multistory plot and they find it difficult to follow the stories. Some may expect a spinechilling murder and want to be scared and wet the seat. However those who really appreciate and understand the movie know more than clear that the film itself focuses on the life of the upperclass people and the life of the time rather than a bloody crime. The movie defines the word originality no better. In fact Julian Fellowes deserves all the awards he received since the screenplay is challenging to write and it's difficult to pack all the stories in a 150minute movie. He explains the complicated relationship between the visitors so well and he virtually creates a motive for murdering Sir William for everyone so that the crime itself becomes very mystifying. Of course I must admit that there are really too many characters and it's simply impossible to keep track of everyone's movement in the first half of the movie but Julian leaves the necessary hints for our understanding that our feeling intensifies more and more as the story unfolds. Even better is the dialogue  sharp sarcastic amusing clever. It confers life to the film and fully delineates the character of the many visitors however short the time is when they appear on the screen. Before I saw it I had always asked why Memento did not win an Oscar. But the time when the film ended I was left stunned on my seat. I mean both stories are great and original but when comparing the relative difficulty in writing the screenplay Gosford Park apparently wins.Gosford Park is to me perhaps the second best movie I've seen this year after A Beautiful Mind. If you like films like Magnolia and Traffic which require much patience to enjoy it's perhaps the greatest movie of your lifetime.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Gosford Park in theaters way back in April 2002 after it was nominated for a slew of Academy Awards a month earlier. Naturally I was looking forward for some good social satire in the shape of the always reliable clash of the classes theme. Robert Altman had the right pedigree as a director and I actually liked some of his previous works such as The Player and Dr. T and the Women so there was some cause for interest there. Also this was promoted as a story of a classic old Hollywood murder mystery another motivation to go see it. Boy was I wrong. I can't even start to explain how many things went wrong for me upon watching this trainwreck of a film. For starters the film was way too talky  not that its bad but in this case the endless discussions never actually reached a point. Also it was very hard to relate to the belated ensemble cast given the fact they were mostly made up of actors portraying pretentious and extremely dull English snobs who lead a decadent and obsolete way of life. The movie didn't make me care for any of the characters want to learn more about them and what motivates them or give any further attention to their boring tea parties hunting trips or twisted relations with their butlers and maids.At one point of the film I just began looking at my wrist watch trying as hard as I can not to fall asleep waiting for the promised murder mystery to occur so there would be some sort of force of interest to push the plot forward. After all there is a certain degree of patience one can bare when staring helplessly at yawninducing characters talking about ever so boring issues. I felt as though the film was just going on and on with no real plot or point to look forward to at the end of the tunnel. When the foul felony finally took place I was apathetic towards whatever was happening that I couldn't care less. It was THAT bad.Thankfully I gave Altman another chance and really enjoyed A Prairie Home Companion his final work before passing away. However that still doesn't erase the fact that Gosford Park is one of the slowest pointless dullest unsatisfying experiences I've had at the cinema. I'm usually into dramas and I have an incredibly low bar of entertainment  even the most overused clichs in films tend to amuse me the slightest bit. Alas Gosford park was just a step too far even for my relatively low standards as this now sits as one of the worst films I've seen of this decade to date.I gave it a 110.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Another Altman film about filmmaking. I wonder why so many people miss this.Balaban is from an old film family and is among the more intellectual men in the business. Altman spends an inordinate amount of time thinking about the art and how he differs from others. And he does. Now you don't have to imagine what they talk about.The conventional approach to high quality visual directing is for it all to emanate as a vision in the author andor director's mind. The actors are expected to recreate that vision. So when a particularly strong image results it is because the actor filled in the space in front of the camera. Think of this as actors in service to the director the employer.Altman is different in a fundamental way. He comes up with a vague sketch of a script descriptions of characters and a situation. He allows the actors to find their own way. The result is often  as here  remarkably dense taught real. So much finer than can be filtered through several minds. Think of this as the director is service to the actors.Here's where the upstairsdownstairs metaphor comes in.Now think how Altman works with his camera. He has astonishing movement. His legendary reputation as a filmmaker rests primarily on his skill in adding to the effect of the scene by making our eye an active part of what is going on by placing lights and moving the camera. Hitchcock invented this notion but then he is in that large group of directors who simply boss the actors about. Easy to place the camera right when you know where everything is going to be. But what if you don't? Then you have to be the perfect servant understanding your masters so thoroughly that you can anticipate what they are going to do.There you have the idea that Balaban and Altman first sketched. Now to make it highly selfreferential what do you do? You set a conventional murder mystery and actually place the filmmaker in the middle of the action continuously commenting on how this is to be shaped. But he's completely ignorant hence the references to formulaic Charlie Chan. The real solution would only be known by someone who understands this notion of anticipative service. Enhance the metaphor with notions of children' from the upstairs through the wombs of the downstairs.More make it obvious that we are talking about the moving camera eye so actually insert Ivor Novello in the action as entertainment.' Ivor was in The Lodger' Hitchcock's first film where he used this moving eye' style. His attunement to Ivor's movements it is a silent film was what was so remarkable at the time. Notice that Balaban doesn't shoot.'Altman is not a man of half measures so make it even more selfreferential make one only one of the privileged guests disguise himself as a servant to cross the line. You can't play on both teams.This is not a film about manners not a costume drama not a whodunit. The story is about what it is a film about the fluid anticipative eye in service to some of the most talented theatrical actors alive. The enjoyment in this film is not in watching the actors pleasant though that is it is in watching how we watch the actors and marveling at how our eye becomes part of the team.'Every actor here every footman and scullery maid is a better actor than Julia Roberts who incidentally shot Balaban in the throat in Mexico. Every actor except Ryan Phillippe. He's the white space the reference point of bland American fare intended to show us what bad acting is all about. Notice how staid the camera is when following him.It is all heavy symbolism and would be the first thing commented on in a P T Andersen film. But not here. Now that's art.".

I did somewhat enjoy Nashville BUT his particular style does not leave sufficient time or space on film to develop the characters in any depth nor do we see any real growth.I had a similar reaction to this film but found Gosford Park even less satisfying thanks to the very high hopes I had based on the writing of Julian Fellowes which has been so magnificent in Downton Abbey and on the sheer number of extremely talented actorsactresses in the cast. Sadly all of this talent is wasted in this film. Mr. Altman seems not to have sufficient regard for his audience to feel that it is necessary to actually tell a story.The result for me is a film which doesn't know what it wants to accomplish  will this be a rich rewarding drama of lives affording us the opportunity to care about intriguing characters or will this be a brainteasing British mystery? Sadly as a mystery it is an epic failure since the murder in the story and its solution seem not to interest the filmmaker at all and none of it is really resolved. As a British drama it also fails miserably in that we don't really get much of the interactions of the characters to learn enough about them to be interested or to care what they do.In fact I will be forced to muddle through this film a second time should I even waste my time? merely to see which character goes with which name. There is no excuse for this sort of sloppiness regardless of whether that is Robert Altman's personal style or not. Perhaps he just is an incompetent director? I would love to see this film remade with the same cast including an extra 30 minutes of screenplay written by good old J. Fellowes. As it now stands it doesn't quite add up to a whole story.".

But what in those films was inspired chaos is in Gosford Park just chaos. And all the King's horses and all the King's men to say nothing of the knights ladies and other Alist British actors who mostly comprise the sterling cast couldn't put Gosford together again.The idea of creating one movie from several familiar English story lines no doubt seemed tasty to Altman and his collaborators Bob Balaban and Julian Fellowes. They set out to present a scathing examination of the upper class in that timehonored settinga shooting partyusing an UpstairsDownstairsstyle format and encase it all in an Agatha Christieesquire drawing room murder plot with a John Cleesey bumbling inspector thrown in for good measure. If this sounds like too much it is. The movie is pulled in so many directions it never gets anywhere. While some of the class satire is wickedly well done the murder story is given perfunctory treatment. The subplots explaining why several nonetoosuspicious suspects want the victim dead are so forgettable and carelessly presented you get the idea that Altman himself doesn't really care. The revelation of the real killer seems more an afterthought than a climax. And Stephen Fry's incongruous idiotic investigator seems mistakenly edited in from another movie.Trying to tell too many stories at once isn't the only problem afflicting Gosford Park. It also suffers from too many characters. While the many roles in Nashville were as deftly and distinctly drawn as Hirschfeld caricatures Gosford is confusing in its superfluity of indistinguishable minor parts.The frustrations noted are lightened by the many fine performances. Clive Owen Eileen Atkins Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren earn top honors with honorable mentions to Kristen Scott Thomas Jeremy Northram Michael Gambon Ryan Phillippe Emily Watkins and Richard E.

Alan Bates and Derek Jacobi are also on hand to ensure that Gosford Park offers the most spectacular cast assembled since Murder on the Orient Express.All in all not unenjoyable but a very mixed bag.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeremy Northam's voice instantly hypnotizes the cooks maids and footmen at Gosford Park. He lifts their spirits they forget themselves and for a moment all work ceases. The irony here is that because they're so entranced they fail to grasp the song's meaning which is about hopeless longing and dreams unfulfilled. It puts smiles on their faces anyway but has no effect at all on the upstairs guests who spend so much energy posturing that they can't seem to recognize the value of any of the many graces offered to them. The downstairs staff certainly appreciates the entertainment since they toil day and night over details like the distance between the knife and the fork and whether strawberry marmalade will suffice when the raspberry jam runs out. 'The perfect servant has no life' declares Mrs. Wilson and while her pride is admirable her sacrifice is tragic. What a shame giving all of your time away to dote on people who don't themselves seem to know how to live either.The super wealthy can't be entirely blamed for their plight which I think stems from loneliness. People tend to behave oddly around the rich and famousthey get nervous begin putting on an act or trying so hard not to that they clam up. Like a highway patrol cop in traffic the presence of esteem inspires everyone close by to alter their behavior. It makes sense then that the rich prefer to surround themselves with hired help who are paid to behave respectfully rather than go out into the world and live their lives in public. Their wealth affords them the illusion of a public life in a private and controlled setting. The danger is that after spending years dealing primarily with one's own servants one might become incapable of dealing with anyone else even say an inspector who needs help solving a murder.Consider the inspector's interactions with the guests. They treat him like the pizza delivery guy. They talk at him flippantly begrudge him a moment for questioning and fail to summon a shred of helpful information. This apparent insubordination is more out of apathy than defiance and the inspector isn't blameless either. He treats witnesses with kid gloves allows himself to be interrupted but never himself interrupts. I imagine that he would have more vigorously interrogated potential witnesses had the murder occurred in a poor or middle class district but he behaves submissively when dealing with the guests at Gosford Park.Attending a shooting party like this one is an exercise in straddling that line between intent and image. Image obscures intent so it must be hard being a wealthy host to trust whether guests are attending out of true friendship. We the audience can certainly be sure that they are not because of the film's fly on the wall point of view. We quickly become aware of their disparate natures that they only harmonize in their collective effort to remain in the good graces of Sir William. To open up to each other is to risk exposure or embarrassment so distance is crucial to maintain a safe proximity. These aren't friends these are satellites in tow. I makes sense then that when Sir William is killed and an inspector starts asking questions no investigative headway is made. This is because as far as the guests are concerned with Sir William gone there is no longer any need to engage. It's time to float away like debris in outer space.The idea of behavior obscuring motive is relatively foreign to Americans. I recently hosted an English traveler who needed a couch to crash on and he told me that in English culture protocol of behavior is of the utmost importance. We can enslave entire cultures but we'll do it with a stiff upper lip while we have our afternoon tea he said. I believe Americans tend to flaunt our motives more overtly embody them. It's seen as a sign of virtue when a salesman embodies salesmanship an athlete competition a computer whiz nerddom. I feel and this is pure conjecture that to embody 'good manners' is valued but not to the degree that it is in Europe particularly England. In America we are almost suspicious of those whose intentions aren't clear. Consider the way characters in reality shows interact. Their behavior is motivated by primordial urgeschiefly the urge to impose their personality. The line 'I'm not here to make friends' seems to be a reoccurring catchphrase. Gosford Park operates by almost opposing values America's brand of 'reality' is best concealed so that the surface always appears squeaky clean. I would guess that even a nonEnglish speaker having spent a weekend with the casts of any of the new 'real world' shows would walk away with a pretty good understanding of who those people are simply because the personalities are so unabashed. Yet I feel as though a fellow English speaker even a thoughtful and aware individual could spend a weekend at Gosford Park and walk away thinking only of how charming the affair was but having no clue as to what was really going on.Despite all of this I can't agree with the film's outlook an outlook I would call altogether cynical. The alternative to the lifestyle of affluence is a lifestyle of needsbased living. For years I lived minimally considering excess a burden and ambition a form of avarice and you know maybe I wasn't wrong. But if we must rise with each new day I don't see the harm in striving for some form of highness even if illusory as long as an attempt is made towards balance. This film is about the imbalance the extremity of Postbellum English aristocracy. It emphasizes the evils and the folly that wealth and servitude cause without acknowledging that wealth is simply the end result of something inherently good. It doesn't express the reality that if we didn't posture whatsoever we would be left crawling.".

It's time to float away like debris in outer space.The idea of behavior obscuring motive is relatively foreign to Americans. I recently hosted an English traveler who needed a couch to crash on and he told me that in English culture protocol of behavior is of the utmost importance. We can enslave entire cultures but we'll do it with a stiff upper lip while we have our afternoon tea he said. I believe Americans tend to flaunt our motives more overtly embody them. It's seen as a sign of virtue when a salesman embodies salesmanship an athlete competition a computer whiz nerddom. I feel and this is pure conjecture that to embody 'good manners' is valued but not to the degree that it is in Europe particularly England. In America we are almost suspicious of those whose intentions aren't clear. Consider the way characters in reality shows interact. Their behavior is motivated by primordial urgeschiefly the urge to impose their personality. The line 'I'm not here to make friends' seems to be a reoccurring catchphrase. Gosford Park operates by almost opposing values America's brand of 'reality' is best concealed so that the surface always appears squeaky clean. I would guess that even a nonEnglish speaker having spent a weekend with the casts of any of the new 'real world' shows would walk away with a pretty good understanding of who those people are simply because the personalities are so unabashed. Yet I feel as though a fellow English speaker even a thoughtful and aware individual could spend a weekend at Gosford Park and walk away thinking only of how charming the affair was but having no clue as to what was really going on.Despite all of this I can't agree with the film's outlook an outlook I would call altogether cynical. The alternative to the lifestyle of affluence is a lifestyle of needsbased living. For years I lived minimally considering excess a burden and ambition a form of avarice and you know maybe I wasn't wrong. But if we must rise with each new day I don't see the harm in striving for some form of highness even if illusory as long as an attempt is made towards balance. This film is about the imbalance the extremity of Postbellum English aristocracy. It emphasizes the evils and the folly that wealth and servitude cause without acknowledging that wealth is simply the end result of something inherently good. It doesn't express the reality that if we didn't posture whatsoever we would be left crawling.";

However Emily Watson should have received an Oscar nomination for setting the screen on fire once again with a performance that proves what a truly gifted actor she is.

	schema:headline " A slow thoroughly British look at class and country life with a bit of murder thrown in  86";
	schema:reviewBody "While it's never floated my boat Downton Abbey nevertheless has plenty of fans as over nine million UK viewers caught the premiere of its third season on TV. It might well be a wellproduced drama of the sort the UK excels at but personally I find such costumed outings rather dour plodding affairs. However this movie  with its Agatha Christiestyle country house and a castlist for the ages  offers something a little different. It still feels a little slow but it offers an authentic look at class privilege and gender politics. It's also brilliantly written directed and performed and is probably Roger Altman's best film after MASH.In 1932 Sir William McCordle Michael Gambon and his trophy wife Sylvia Kristen Scott Thomas invite a number of guests over for a shooting weekend. Among their guests are matine idol Ivor Novello Jeremy Northam and his Hollywood producer friend Morris Weissman coproducer Bob Balaban as well as the Countess of Trentham Maggie Smith and her maidservant Mary Kelly MacDonald. As the weekend goes on Sir William has to fend off constant attempts to secure his fortune from his guests while the gossiping housestaff led by his butler Jennings Alan Bates and housekeeper Mrs Wilson Helen Mirren ensure that the weekend goes as smoothly as possible. Before long a murder is committed but who is the guilty party? Is it head housemaid Elsie Emily Watson who has something to hide? Could it be enigmatic valet Mr Denton Ryan Phillippe or charismatic loner Parks Clive Owen the valet of Lord Stockbridge Charles Dance? Hopefully Inspector Thomson Stephen Fry and his constable companion Dexter Ron Webster can crack the case before all the guests have to return home...Like most murder mysteries Gosford Park spends a lot of time filling the screen with details both relevant and irrelevant. In fact the murder is arguably the most surprisingly thing about the film as so much time is spent with both upstairs with the partygoers and downstairs with the staff that it almost feels like a documentary at times. To prevent boredom from completely taking over the film injects a good deal of humour into proceedings  Smith's cantankerous countess is witty and loaded with barbed asides while Fry's detective is as gloriously aloof as those he interviews maintaining an almost Clouseaulike ignorance of the facts presented to him. But all the cast are superb  I've never seen this many British stars at once outside of a Harry Potter film  but this is a true ensemble piece as dialogue blends together to further enhance the authentic feel of the film. The script penned by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes leaves just enough to keep you guessing but because it spends so long setting the crime up you sort of feel as though he's more concerned about writing a period piece as opposed to a mystery.Although it won't be to everyone's taste Gosford Park feels like a bigscreen outing for Mrs Marple but without the silverhaired sleuth in attendance. Yes it's brilliantly made and at times very funny but I wanted a bit more pace to proceedings. I honestly felt that once every red herring imaginable had been planted in the first hourandabit Fellowes simply worked out yet another possibility and wrote that as the ending. And to be frank the climax felt a little rushed and the least believable bit of the picture as nobody actually seems that bothered that they've spent the weekend with a murderer in their midst. Still credit must go towards the look of the film which is spoton and the actors who are all magnificent. In truth the film is less a murdermystery and more a realistic portrayal of life in a country house in the early 1930's. Fellowes almost feels nostalgic for such a time when ladies knew their place their men could be utter cads without them batting an eyelid and both were wholly reliant on their staff who held them in mockrespect as though their livelihoods depended on it  which they did of course. It is as British as Earl Grey tea cucumber sandwiches and strawberries and cream at Wimbledon  something which appeals more to foreign markets more than the UK where I'm from. After all if the TV series Midsomer Murders can be a global hit...".

With his signature sense of angry humor activist filmmaker Michael Moore sets out to explore the roots of this bloodshed. In doing so he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns violent national history violent entertainment and even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage. In order to arrive at a possible explanation Michael Moore takes on a deeper examination of America's culture of fear bigotry and violence in a nation with widespread gun ownership. Furthermore he seeks to investigate and confront the powerful elite political and corporate interests fanning this culture for their own unscrupulous gain.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bowling for Columbine' is a very thought provoking film.Perhaps the first thought it provokes in any US resident is that the most sensible thing he or she could possibly do is move forthwith to Canada. It's nearby they speak English almost indistinguishable from standard American it feels lighter over there' you get government health care there are plenty of guns but very little killing and you don't even have to lock your doors.The fundamental question Bowling for Columbine' asks is  What's responsible for the exceptionally high level of killing in America?  Not a lot of guns Moore points out because other countries have that.  Not a violent history because other countries have that.  Not a love of violent movies video games and so forth because other countries love all that too. Not poverty unemployment and ethnic diversity because lots of countries have more poverty and Canada has as much ethnic diversity and more unemployment. Two things according to Moore are primary causes  the US media which as he shows fans up fear constantly among the American populace and the government in Washington which solves everything by bombing people somewhere. There's a third thing that emerges more subtly a gun culture which leads to the absurd notion of selfdefense perpetuating the violence and the fear and the racism. In this the leading force is that powerful lobby the National Rifle Association. The result of this lethal combination delineated by Moore particularly since 911 is that Americans aren't very happy people they live in a constant state of rage perturbation and fear when they're not disolved in tears for the dead who're falling in the houses and streets and schools of the country on a daily basis.Bowling for Columbine' isn't ultimately very cheery or uplifting stuff. True it has lots of laughs but most of them are ironic  a little sickmaking when you think about it  and at American expense.  Those of us who live in the USA and don't actually regard moving to Canada or somewhere else as a real option aren't walking out of this polemical documentary feeling any too cheerful.  One may quarrel with Moore's style though it seems questionable that so many reviewers have expressed disapproval of his personal appearance what's sloppy dressing got to do with it?. One can hardly quarrel with most of Moore's basic facts or the urgency of his subject or his commitment to it.  Because of its significance to Americans on both personal and national levels Bowling for Columbine has to be considered the most important and it's becoming the most watched US documentary film in many a year.  This is being recognized in all sorts of ways first of all with the special jury prize at Cannes. We shall see what the Academy has to say.It's impressive that Moore and two young men seriously injured at Columbine were able by their confrontations to shame WalMart into taking handguns and ammunition out of their stores  and Moore appears to have been surprised and impressed by this result himself.Moore has seemed crude and simplistic and confrontational in the past. His methods have not radically changed but they've modulated into something subtler and less selfserving such that he has an ability to talk more easily with potential adversaries   bank employees giving out rifles with new accounts Michigan militiamen even Charlton Heston the haughty President of the National Rifle Association who invites Moore into his house to film a conversation.  True Heston ends up walking out of the room after a while but he doesn't have Moore thrown out.  Nor does WalMart. This is significant.  One is tempted to call Moore's methods as he wields them today not crude and simplistic and confrontational but direct simple and honest.  There's something unimposing and Middle American about his overweight slouch and scruffy baseball cap crowned head.  If he lives in a house worth close to 2 million in New York now you can't tell it from looking at him and that consciously maintained persona if we choose to see it thus aids him in moving through Littleton Colorado and Windsor Ontario and the other places where he got the footage for this devastating yet simple film. For credibility among US guntoters like Heston Moore has an ace in the hole  he's an expert marksman and a lifetime member of the NRA.Heston walks out because he hasn't good answers in fact he really hasn't any answers at all.  His explanations for why the USA is so violent are ones Moore has already discounted and he can't justify his brazenly fronting for the National Rifle Association in Colorado and Michigan right after the child murders by children in those two states.  Marilyn Manson the artist accused of complicity at Columbine because the young killers liked his music in contrast has not only good answers but also the greatest zinger in the film.  When asked what he would have said to the youth at Columbine after the murders he says  Not a word. I'd have listened to them. That's what nobody has been doing.'  In between telling interviews Moore has various ways of documenting contexts  an animation recited statistics with images and astonishing film clips like the Fifties one of cops admiring how realistic some kids' toy guns are and the one from a metaldetector company pushing for dress codes in schools showing a boy with baggy pants unloading a whole arsenal.  What's laughable are all such solutions that don't even begin to get at the problem  that are just profiteering from chaos and insecurity.It's encouraging that so many people are seeing and commenting on this movie.  When it was over I wished the lights would go up and there'd be a discussion group held right there in the auditorium.  There was a lot to talk about.  Not everything was by any means clear nor were all the facts to be bought without question.  But in one way or another Bowling for Columbine' brings up all the most central issues in America  today. Michael Moore makes you laugh and cry but most important he makes you think.".

Much of the footage deals with Columbine and the case in which a 6 year old boy shot to death a 6 year old girl.  It all culminates in an interview with the head of the NRA Charlton Heston.Riveting chilling hilarious and absolutely incredible movie despite what your views are on the gun issue.  Moore's views are definetely antigun but he does try to show the opposite side also.  Moore questions why there are so many killings in America by guns and almost none in other countries.  He gives no real answers to this question but he raises a lot of interesting points and theories.  I walked out of the theatre very shaken but in a way exhilirated.  This is truly a great documentary.I'm not going to review this fullyit's a movie you should see for yourself.  A definite mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was entertaining and interesting but in certain ways it left me wanting. Michael Moore himself is somewhat irritating and I found myself wishing he kept more to the background than he does. At the same time the conclusions that he draws are compelling and pragmatic. This movie was not designed to be an argument. It was not designed to sway the viewer. It was designed to fuel the fire of the already convinced. Though I think that this is Moore's intent concluded from interviews I've read I feel that goal could be reached at the same time as convincing a few fencesitters and that would have made the film more powerful. I have two main complaints regarding this movie First I felt that Michael Moore sometimes crossed lines in his interviews that in no way seemed to further his cause or drive his point home. He interviews people as though looking for his answer not their answer and particularly seemed to be trying to strike a blow at the conservative masses. I thought this distracted the genuinity and plausibility of the conclusions that he drew. It must be said that the conclusions that Moore drew are of a nature that strikes at conservative politics. However I felt that the facts he represented spoke for themselves and that the blows should not have been dealt to conservative interviewees by asking questions designed to get emotional responses out of them.Second I found some of the statistics needed to be qualified with per capitas or percentages. When comparing the United States to England for instance it is important to take population differences and density into consideration. Straight statistics do not apply. I think the statistics were somewhat skewed by this oversight however according to some rough guesstimates I made it wouldn't have diminished Moore's point only made it less dramatic which would indeed have strengthened his case. These two complaints hint at an even larger problem however and that is this Because Moore presents his case in this way he can never hope to have his message truly heard by anyone who isn't already on his side.".

At the heart of his argument however is gun control.

Moore points out that roughly 12000 deaths occur in America as opposed to the few hundred in Canada.To answer this question Moore goes to Canada where he talks to ordinary citizens.  As one student remarks Americans seem to want to fight over everything instead of talk things out.  Perhaps as Moore suggests there is something wrong with the very framework our country is built upon.An interview with Charleton Heston the President of the NRA is shocking.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this for the first time and pretty much like it. But something kept nagging at me. I am a pretty liberal person and believe in Gun control but I really have always liked Charlton Heston and couldn't believe he was as bad as he's portrayed here. So I did a little research and found out that his speech was so horribly butchered by Moore that he totally changed the meaning Heston was going for. Also Moore inserted a shot of Heston waving a gun over his head that was taped at a NRA function a year later in some other location and then cut in so it looked like it was part of his speech in Denver after the Columbine shooting. Moore never mentions that the meeting was planned way before the Columbine shooting and couldn't be canceled realistically in that short period of time. Other things found out. The Footage of the Dog with the gun is faked. The bank at the beginning mailed the guns to customers from a warehouse 400 miles away. They didn't hand them out in the bank the way its portrayed and the guns in the bank were models. The Foreign death statistics don't take into account police shootingsthe US figures do and they are not adjusted for the differences in population and a few of them he took the lowest death toll in a given period instead of an average???The scene with Dick Clark was another one that I just couldn't believe. Is he really that rotten? Turns out the the six year old's mother had lost custody of all her kids and was a convicted drug dealer. She had three children all from different father's and her son was not in her custody and living with a drug dealing uncle in a crack house with guns and Knives all over the place. Moore conveniently leaves all this out and tries to make Dick Clark the bad guy for employing the kids mother at minimum wage. When Moore approaches Clark he does it at the worst possible time. Why? because Moore WANTS Clark to get angry and close the door in his face. I'd shut the door in his face too. What's going on here? The list goes on and on and I'll leave it up to the inquisitive viewer to do a little research into how this films was made as almost all of the major points Moore is trying to make have been altered or major points left out to get his personal view across. And what's with Canada being portrayed as something almost bordering on Utopia? Did Moore ever mention that the film got major funding from Canadian government money through a Canadian production company!! And I have friends in Canada and they LOCK the doors! I agree with what Moore is setting out to do but the film really never draws any conclusions and his tactics are not in line with what's considered Nonfiction. I almost felt Moore's tactics were as disturbing as the subject matter. When you have to distort the truth to such an extent and not even realize or admit to it based on the way Moore defends everything in the film as the truth is a very disturbing trend. This film has a tremendous power to influence people and they should really know the whole truth not Michael Moore's truth. Anything else truly is fiction".

I loved this film. I even bought the DVD. I thought it was a brilliant documentary and that its presentation of the facts was spot on.However the scene where Moore talks about a bomber on display in the desert and the army plaque beneath it always made me wonder exactly how honest he was being since what he claimed the plaque said sounded too outrageous to me. It kept on grating me until about a year later I began to actually research his film and found that nearly every single thing Moore presents in BFC is either heavily manipulated facts or baldfaced deceptions.Take the scene of him getting a gun for opening an account at a bank. What he does not show is that there was a criminal background check including photo ID check and an FBI background check. Then to get the gun he had to open a 10 year Certificate of Deposit... basically he had to deposit nearly 1000 before he could get the gun not the smartest idea compared to just buying a gun if that's the only intent. Even then when Moore gets his gun and asks about the safety of handing out guns in the bank the audience is duped into forgetting a large portion of Moore's handingoutagunatabank safety joke the bank doesn't supply the ammunition!You even have his little cartoon where he tries to link the NRA to the KKK... never mind that him saying the NRA was formed the same year that the KKK was declared an illegal organization is 100 wrong... never mind that the NRA was actually formed by Northern Yankee's who fought AGAINST slavery... never mind that the NRA was primarily created in reaction to Southern laws that would ban blacks from owning firearms the exact opposite of the cartoon's suggestion the NRA wanted to suppress blacks and leave them defenseless... never mind that the cartoon is a South Park ripoff presented after an interview with South Park creator Matt Stone in order to make it seem like the cartoon was made by the creators of South Park. I mean no wonder Matt Stone hates Moore and made him a target of insults in his Team America World Police movie. Talk about complete deception from every angle.What's worse is that he is even hypocritical in how he talks about America's culture of fear and how the media tries to instill fear in the population and yet that is EXACTLY what BFC is a film that presents manipulated facts in order to create fear. Probably the best refutation of BFC one can find is the indepth article by Dave Kopel called Bowling Truths that literally shreds BFC from beginning to end showing it to be  as he puts it  more of a 'mockumentary' in the vein of This is Spinal Tap than a serious documentary outlining anything close to reality.In terms of gun control issues if you really want an intelligent look at the problems of gun control check out the episode of Penn  Teller's Bullsht on gun control. Now THAT is an intelligent and more importantly an HONEST delving into gun control. But if you are looking for facts and honesty in subject matter you couldn't find a worse choice than BFC.BFC is insulting to anybody who would be willing to take the time and educate themselves on exactly how honest Moore is. If you think BFC is truthful and honest go read Kopel's article readily available on the net and you'll see how much Moore stretches the truth. I mean even the film's title is deceptive since  as even the preliminary police report states  the two shooters at Columbine never showed up for bowling that morning! I still own the DVD if only to show people a perfect example of how sheep can be led around if they don't stop and ask whether what they are hearing is real. BFC offers little reality and a lot of political brouhaha that does little for intelligent discussion on gun control. In that he has hurt the gun control movement more than he has helped it.And by the way people in Canada do lock their doors. I have to wonder how many doors he had to try in order to get his shots of every door being open.".

	schema:reviewBody "What has become of the United States? Is there any difference from the United States that was formed by Puritans and tried to escape from persecution under the British flag? Has there always been a different mentality for the American than that of any other nationality of individual? After September 11th Michael Moore the director and writer set out to make a documentary that addressed these and other embedded questions that are addressed everyday in our news media school systems homes stores and street corners. Attempting to address all sides of the issues as a person of the media Moore used not only his own experiences his connection to the NRA but also other persons opinions that ranged from Charlton Hesston the well known president of the NRA and famous actor to the average American that was confronted with the violent acts that resulted from the accessibility of fire arms. This documentary took a new approach to the display of information. Not only was animation used to explain history American's imbedded fear of their own neighbors but it also used rock music  gave a beat or a pulse to the film that progress from slow to fast as the intensity of the issues progressed sarcasm interviews and casual conversations. Moore traveled the country to talk to all those that make up the spectrum of the American society he traveled to the scenes of some of the more recent American tragedies made impromptu stops in corporations such as Kmart where the boys from Columbine bought the ammunition used in the shooting and traveled to Canada to get an outside or foreign opinion. The idea was to move away from the documentary style of talking heads' he wanted a film that would not only touch a chord with the American people but one that would also be readily watched. This idea also made the documentary that there was too much influence placed on the words of the professional' or the  findings of the expert' that these findings and misleadings flooded the news at night to increase the amount of fear that the average American has as it looked for a scapegoat to blame. The information that Moor presented in his documentary did not technically follow a predescribed narrative but followed more of a form where the audience was left areas to think and to breakdown the information. Elements of the circular narrative were the foundation of the film where similar elements in opinions and the common American we continually addressed. Yet the only problem that could be addressed is one of the ways in which Moore collected some of his data. Some might see a use of trickery or manipulation was used on his part to get the responses and such passionfilled opinions stated. While others would see the same information in the light that no instigation was needed that people have these strong beliefs opinions and are willing to talk about them but they lack the examples or understanding of the topic to take a well informed stand on one side or the other. Such a problem is not new in the world of documentaries when controversial data is presented to the public. Moore did a great job of presenting a delicate subject to the American people and was deserving of the Academy Award for the project.".

Has there always been a different mentality for the American than that of any other nationality of individual? After September 11th Michael Moore the director and writer set out to make a documentary that addressed these and other embedded questions that are addressed everyday in our news media school systems homes stores and street corners. Attempting to address all sides of the issues as a person of the media Moore used not only his own experiences his connection to the NRA but also other persons opinions that ranged from Charlton Hesston the well known president of the NRA and famous actor to the average American that was confronted with the violent acts that resulted from the accessibility of fire arms. This documentary took a new approach to the display of information. Not only was animation used to explain history American's imbedded fear of their own neighbors but it also used rock music  gave a beat or a pulse to the film that progress from slow to fast as the intensity of the issues progressed sarcasm interviews and casual conversations. Moore traveled the country to talk to all those that make up the spectrum of the American society he traveled to the scenes of some of the more recent American tragedies made impromptu stops in corporations such as Kmart where the boys from Columbine bought the ammunition used in the shooting and traveled to Canada to get an outside or foreign opinion. The idea was to move away from the documentary style of talking heads' he wanted a film that would not only touch a chord with the American people but one that would also be readily watched. This idea also made the documentary that there was too much influence placed on the words of the professional' or the  findings of the expert' that these findings and misleadings flooded the news at night to increase the amount of fear that the average American has as it looked for a scapegoat to blame. The information that Moor presented in his documentary did not technically follow a predescribed narrative but followed more of a form where the audience was left areas to think and to breakdown the information. Elements of the circular narrative were the foundation of the film where similar elements in opinions and the common American we continually addressed. Yet the only problem that could be addressed is one of the ways in which Moore collected some of his data. Some might see a use of trickery or manipulation was used on his part to get the responses and such passionfilled opinions stated. While others would see the same information in the light that no instigation was needed that people have these strong beliefs opinions and are willing to talk about them but they lack the examples or understanding of the topic to take a well informed stand on one side or the other. Such a problem is not new in the world of documentaries when controversial data is presented to the public. Moore did a great job of presenting a delicate subject to the American people and was deserving of the Academy Award for the project.";

	schema:reviewBody "Is this supposed to be education from Michael Moore ? Okay people prepare to be educated Moore sets himself up as some working class intellectual but the gist of this documentary is based on stats  half truths and most importantly of all  Points that seem to have been missed out on purpose For example BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE centres around  America's astronomical murder rate  insinuating that the murder rate in that country is head and above any other country when it's not . Moore misses out the fact that per head of population the USA doesn't have the world's highest murder rate . That unwanted record is held by Mexico . Both Colombia and South Africa have higher murder rates per head of population than the US . He also fails to point out that many American states do have gun bans . New York for example has a total hand gun ban and the penalty for having an automatic weapon there is life imprisonment . He doesn't come out and say that anyone  everywhere in America can pop into any shop and buy as many guns and as much ammo as they want  but he heavily suggests it which misleads the uninformedMoore also misses out other points about the American death tolls from murder . If you study American murder rates you'll see a clear connection between the American government banning things . For example the prohibition of alcholic drink in the 1920s led to a massive crime wave of killing as gangsters fought to take over the black market due to the drinks ban . As drugs started to flood into the cities of America in the 1960s the murder rate rose as people tried to muscle in on the hard drugs trade to the point where now many US cities are battle zones . It's not the fault of guns that so many people are murdered  It's the fault of drugs and the massive profits they generate that are leading to violence in America . This information doesn't seem to creep into Moore's hidden agenda . Of course if the American government of the day decided to legalise all drugs the gangs and dealers would become instantly disenfranchised  but this suggestion would seem to be too liberterian for Moore . We're also treated to a wonderful piece of hypocrisy by Moore when he mentions that on the day of the Columbine school massacre the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia reached its peak . You may remember that because the Serbs were engaged in a violent conflict against Islamic insurgents  America is doing something very similar today in Iraq  NATO decided to bomb the Serbs until they pulled their troops out of Kosovo . Moore seems to be against the bombing of Yugoslavia in this documentary . What he doesn't tell you is that the NATO airstrikes were under the command of Wesley Clark  the same Wesley Clark who later ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination and the same Wesley Clark WHO MOORE LATER BACKED FOR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION !And being a Michael Moore documentary we are treated once again to Louis Armstrong's What A Wonderful World contrasting to images of human suffering. Moore has made a career out of this technique and it's not even his idea because he's stolen it from Barry Levinson in GOOD MORNING VietnamMy own opinion of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is that it's polemical rubbish  uninformative and just plain misleading . I also found it stomach churning that Moore is awarded every film gong going because he makes documentaries centered around human tragedy . His fans will point out that Moore's advertising the fact that guns are responsible for a terrible death toll in which case I'll point out Moore is benefitting from this terrible death toll via this documentary and the praise and awards it received . I wonder how his fans feel about that as they rush out to watch his latest documentary or buy his latest book ?".

	schema:headline " Moore Bowls Gutter Balls in Columbine Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Moore Bowls Gutter Balls in Columbine Filmby Ari ArmstrongWhat are we to make of a documentary that claims to discuss violence in America but fails to even mention a policy responsible for raising U.S. homicide rates at least 25?At the end of his film Bowling for Columbine director Michael Moore bowls a strike. Unfortunately his film is less successful. He heaves mightily and knocks down a few pins but he also rolls some gutter balls.Economist Jeffrey Miron of Boston University found drug and alcohol prohibition have substantially raised the homicide rate in the United States over much of the past 100 years by an estimated 2575. Why? Prohibition creates violent black markets. It's a simple theory supported by the evidence.So in his rambling exploration of many other facets of violence in America why does Moore completely ignore the domestic consequences of prohibition? Such an omission is inexcusable and it indicates Moore's social agenda trumps any serious effort to come to grips with the problem.That said at times Moore's work is chillingly poignant. During one segment he shows frame after frame of botched U.S. foreign policy moves. The U.S. helps kill or otherwise remove one leader of a struggling nation only to see the rise of an even worse leader. The U.S. has supported both Saddam Hussein and the Taliban though in retrospect that support seems to have been unwise. Moore's critique of American foreign entanglements mirrors libertarian concerns.On the morning of the Columbine murders Moore points out President Clinton was on television announcing the latest American bombing raid in Kosovo. Just an hour later Clinton was back on TV discussing the suburban terror. Is senseless violence on the personal level linked to the mass violence of the state? It's possible but Moore doesn't demonstrate a causal connection.Shockrocker Marilyn Manson continues this theme by pointing out the president has more influence than Manson does. Manson blames the campaign of fear and consumption constantly bombarding Americans. However Manson's suggestion that his music is a healthy escape is as ludicrous as his critics' assertions that Manson's music somehow drives people to mayhem.Moore notes the Columbine killers also attended a morning bowling class so why not blame bowling? Moore's comparison is silly but he does raise the excellent point that people shouldn't look for scapegoats following a tragedy.Which brings us to another of Moore's gutter balls. Scapegoating is precisely what Moore does only his victim is the American gun owner rather than Marilyn Manson.At one point Moore places a picture of the young victim of the Buell school shooting against a ledge of Charlton Heston's house. Moore seems to think Heston is somehow to blame for the death and he asks Heston to apologize.Moore also took a couple of Columbine victims to KMart and used media pressure to convince the chain to stop selling ammunition. He describes this as an overwhelming victory. Yet his selfserving media stunt accomplished the same thing keeping Manson out of Denver accomplished exactly nothing.In his incoherent badmouthing of corporations Moore neglects to remind us that his film was released by a large corporation his equipment was manufactured by corporations and his work was advertised by corporate web pages and media outlets. This doesn't prove Moore's case is wrong but it does prove he's not selfreflective.Moore offers some needed criticism of American media especially television news programs. One person Moore interviews notes that even as the American murder rate plummeted television coverage of murders dramatically expanded thus giving viewers a false impression of reality.Moore rightly rails against racism. Many white Americans have an irrational fear of black males and this encourages a violent mindset. That's a needed criticism. Unfortunately Moore seeks to replace bigotry against blacks with bigotry against gun owners.Many of my gunowning friends are doctors lawyers professors and professionals. Does Moore interview anybody representative of the American gun owner? Of course not. Does he interview any scholar who is an expert on crime and firearms such as David Kopel John Lott Gary Kleck or Don Kates? Of course not. To do so would be to treat the matter seriously rather than fan the flames of prejudice.Moore cites the gunhomicide statistics for a variety of countries with lower numbers than in the U.S. but he conveniently omits countries with more stringent gun laws and higher gunhomicide rates.He also ignores the fact that England's gun bans have been followed by an increase in violent crime there including gunrelated crime. All the evidence that demonstrates lawfully carrying a handgun or keeping a defensive gun in the home deters criminals is totally suppressed.Moore does wonder why Canada has a relatively high gunownership rate yet fewer murders. He concludes there is something wrong with American culture.He's right about that there is something wrong. He rightly points to poverty and America's racist past as part of the problem even though he looks to failed welfare schemes to solve poverty  whereas libertarians look to repeal the government interventions such as prohibition that have perpetuated it.But Moore overstates his case. He thinks America is a nation of fear and paranoia. But in some ways he feeds into the same media frenzy he criticizes in his film. Yes some Americans have problems with violence bigotry and paranoia. However the vast majority of Americans including the vast majority of American gun owners lead basically responsible and healthy lifestyles. This basic fact seems not to assist Moore in his quixotic crusades.".

	schema:headline " An NRA member review";
	schema:reviewBody "I met Michael Moore in 2000 while working at the gun department of a local outdoors store.  Moore told us he was filming a movie about guns in America. I was skeptical and told him as much he said he was not making an antigun movie but an antiviolence movie. He filmed a little singed my NRA card and left. After many months of reediting and after cutting me out of the movie he has finally released it. Bowling for Columbine is at times disjointed and contradictory that is not to say it's not shocking and thought provoking and as an NRA Life Time member I can honestly say I enjoyed it. Bowling for Columbine is the story of Moore seeking the reason to why America has such a high firearm homicide rate. His adventures take him from Littleton CO the site of the 1999 Columbine shooting to Canada to Flint and finally to NRA President Charlton Heston's home for a climatic interview.Moore seemed able to control his leftist view on life at various points during the movie but his overwhelming pathos in life permeates the entire film. Moore like many Liberals who live in the big cities have three truths in life 1 the rich screw everyone 2 the government only cares for the rich and the military and last but not least 3 America would be a better place if white Americans were not so racist. There may be certain amount of truth in all three of these but none are an absolute fact. With 1 Moore talks about the mother of the six year old boy who shot Kayla Roland at Buell Elementary in Mt. Morris Township MI. Moore sensibly raises the question as to why is a single mother being bussed 40 miles from Flint to Great Lakes Crossing Mall to work for near minimum wage.  Moore could have tackled the issue by talking to the administrators of the program but he makes a connection that only he could and that Dick Clark is responsible.  See Clark the cultural music icon owned the restaurant in the mall were Ms. Owens worked so using Moore's logic Clark in California should know why this poor woman was being bussed 80 miles a day and forced to put her son in a crack house owned by her brother where he found the gun. Moore never mentions that the house where the young boy was living was described as a flop house' by Genesee County Prosecutor Art Busch who is interviewed in the movie. Drug transactions were conducted at all hours of the night and the hand gun was stolen. But Dick Clark is the one to blame and when confronted by Moore Clark has a What the Hell are you talking about' look on his face before he sensibly orders his aid to slam the van door in Moore's face and drive off. Moore then insinuates that KMart The Persian Gulf War and the largest employer in Littleton the defense contractor Lockheed Martin are responsible for the shooting at Columbine. Moore makes no reference to the Trench Coat Mafia the two shooters ran around with and most importantly he never mentions the fascination with Adolph Hitler the two shared April 20 1999 would have been Hitler's 110th birthday. Throughout the movie there is a flow of racism that Moore believes accounts for America's high murder rate which makes the omission of Klebold's and Harris' Nazi fascination truly puzzling.There is a somewhat amusing animation piece in the movie that tracks America's fear of nonwhites up to the present. The cartoon goes astray by linking the NRA to the KKK and giving the best rebuttal to gun control in saying some of the first gun control laws in America prohibited blacks from owning arms. The movie ends when Moore walks up to Charlton Heston's home and just rings the buzzer. Heston answers and invites Moore back for an interview the next day. At the interview the then 77 year old Heston holds his own but Moore's relentless attack makes the legendary screen actor and civil rights activist seem befuddled and confused. Moore continues to pester Heston as to why Canada has a lower crime rate in proportion to their large gun ownership rate Heston then comments on our mixed ethnicity. Moore asks him if he thought race was the cause of crime in America and Heston flatly says no. However many reviewers have picked that one sentence out to accuse Heston of being a racist. Heston may be many things but a racist is not one of them.  Heston was one of the first of the few in Hollywood to march with Martin Luther King Jr. and Heston as president of the Screen Actor's Guild fought for the inclusion of black directors and actors in Hollywood. Heston throughout 40 years has traveled the world on behalf of civil rights. Once again Moore omits this and leaves it to the audience to make up their own minds. Moore then demands to know why the NRA is so insensitive as to hold a progun rally in Denver only ten days after Columbine and one in Flint eight months after the Buell shooting. The Denver rally was not a PR plus for the NRA but the Flint rally was months after and during a campaign season for these reasons Heston looks confused as Moore accuses the NRA for kicking the locals when they are down. At that point Heston stands up graciously thanks Moore for the interview and leaves. Moore races after Heston with a picture of Kayla but Heston continues down the path into his house. This scene I have a problem with as it flashes from Heston walking away and Moore holding the picture. Two cameras were involved but for one angle the cameraman would have had to race ahead of Heston to film Moore holding the picture.Is Bowling for Columbine manipulative and biased in the director's point of view? Yes. Is it contradictory? Yes. Besides the Nazi omission Moore never covers gang violence and the violent gun culture within the gang and drug filled places of our country. More truly Moore never actually answers any of his questions and that maybe is the reason why this movie works. One distracting point is where Moore idiotically implies that the CIA gave millions to the billionaire binLaden and taught alQaeda how to fly planes into buildings but if you can get past his leftist social agenda Moore has created a very thoughtful film that is not as antigun as it is antiviolence but with a little antimilitary and prosocialist health care thrown in as well.".

Not so much spoilers since the movie never gets any farther than Dude don't Republicans like totally suck?This movie is not a documentary  it's propaganda. The only thing that fools people into thinking there's anything documentary about it is that it's not even very good propaganda. I'm not a particularly conservative person  I generally think some gun control is a good thing rock music shouldn't be censored our current welfare and health care systems are woefully inadequate and more money should be spent on public schools than on missile development. And while we're at it yes Michael slavery is bad and so is the death of children. Duh. But I left the theater disagreeing with Moore to a greater degree than when I entered. He presented incomplete unsubstantiated and scatterbrained arguments for all of the way too many political positions he attempted to preach. I spent the entire movie silently providing the counterarguments he willfully ignored without the benefit of hearing how he might rebut them. And since I think I'm pretty smart I did a good job of convincing myself with my counterarguments.In addition to the bias problems in structure and content mentioned in detail by many here are other random things that really irked meMusic video games etc have NO influence on children's level of violence but watching news about Kosovo magically does? If the nightly news can make kids violent why can't Marilyn Manson? His oneliner about how the Pres is more influential than himself is so conclusory it's dumb. Most kids don't even watch the news.The question Moore posed to Charlton Heston and then mockingly watched him flounder in answering is a question that Moore himself never answers throughout the whole movie the sheer popularity of guns can't be the cause of violence because Canada has just as many guns as we do. So what causes it? As Heston struggles on the fly to come up with perhaps wrong but at least plausible suggestions for a puzzle that Moore himself can't answer Moore's mockery seems uncalled for and in fact cruel. Heston doesn't end the interview because he doesn't care about 6yearolds  he ends it because he's being verbally ambushed in his own home by a camera crew and a debate partner who won't fight fair. Furthermore insofar as Heston was slow on the rebuttal...Heston was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease about the same time as that interview was conducted  a fact Moore doesn't even bother to mention!Moore barges into Kmart pushing the crippled children in front of him as tools in his shockvalueratherthanpolicydebate argument strategy and proceeds to accost the poor minimumwage employees who work there. The 16yearold Canadians brag about how their neighbors' tax dollars pay all of their medical bills while puffing on cigarettes.Moore leapfrogs among issues because he can't argue any one of them successfully enough to make his point. Then when he's run out of pieces of argument he switches to the final resource of the desperate demagogue The psychological tool of rapidly juxtaposing jarring tragic images with images of his political foes then heightening the emotional impact by adding familiar and beloved music that stands out starkly in message and tone from the images we're viewing. A sort of fireworksdisplayfinale masterpiece of film editing effectively programming us to agree with what he could not persuade us to believe. So even if we don't remember any good arguments we'll remember that we cried and that somehow it was caused by Republicans.Even if we ignore the fact this movie is horribly biased it still doesn't make any sense. There's no coherent conclusion to be drawn. Moore begins his documentary with an interesting question What is the source of the staggering levels of gun violence in the United States particularly among our youth? He then leaves this question completely unanswered. Even if I overlook all of Moore's intellectually dishonest techniques and leave the theater preaching Moore's road to salvation my message would sound something like this To decrease gun violence I should start watching South Park instead of the evening news because the news is depressing and violent and that clever South Park creator has pluck! stop locking my apartment door at night because trust is good and fear is bad and faith alone will save me from rape and murder and stop eating at restaurants that employ poor people commuting by bus from far away because their unattended children will get shot while they're at work all because I wanted a burger. This doesn't make any sense at all.Moore doesn't have any more magical solutions than conservatives about how to stop Columbine from happening again. Not surprising since the tragedy of youth violence is a complex social phenomenon that can hardly be addressed competently in a 2hour montage of pop iconography and interviews with unprepared people.The only reason people think this movie has an important message is because they're not listening to the lack of message at all. They leave happy because the movie made them feel good it made them feel good because it appeared to justify their prejudices against conservative politics. The irony is that the movie justified their political positions by playing off of those prejudices  by incoherently babbling in familiarsounding vocabulary pointing to trendy celebs who share their political leanings and making people who disagree all look like buffoons. In short when the audience clapped in the SOHO theater where I watched this it was less a reflection on the quality of the movie than it was the audience congratulating itself on being liberal. It's that same selfcongratulation that motivated the Democratdominated Academy to give this movie Best Documentary not to mention classify it as a documentary in the first place.".

If he wanted to make a true documentary he should have had people that could participate in an intellectual debate instead of making all NRA members Littleton residents and censorship protestors look like rednecks and hillbillies.Also in the middle of the movie Michael Moore pounds into our brain that we should have a national health insurance plan.  What does this have to do with violence in America?Overall I am disgusted that something as biased and full of propaganda as this movie won the Academy Award for best documentary.";

I don't find that Moore is too concerned about making careful observation in general so I don't think he cares much about stereotyping others.His trip to Toronto in Bowling for Columbine was laughable given the statements he makes about Canadians. Moore suggests that Canada is a safer country because he pulls on a few doors in the city of Toronto and finds them to be unlocked. Moore has a penchant for stereotypes. If he were a bigot for the extreme right I would be frightened of him. Canada is not just Toronto no more than New York represents the US. And a few unlocked doors in a city does not make your point.I actually believe that a country with fewer guns will have less casual gun crime per capita and I believe that the US has much to learn in that regard from us in Canada.Unfortunately I came away from this film more with more distasteful feelings about the film maker than the subject material which is too bad. To me this was a film about Michael Moore Bully. The bullying personality type is pervasive in his work and life story and distracts me from the serious topics that he wants to side with.Moore and us viewers would do well to remember Woody Allen's cautionary sarcastic line from Annie Hall 1977 when he said I'm a bigot but it's OK because I'm a bigot for the left.".

Bowling is proudly hailed by some as incendiary. And of course it is. But in the current world climate being so is really no trick. Hitler was Incendiary too back in the 40s! Should we be proud of him as well? Hitler blamed the poor state of the union on the Jews and Moore blames the poor state of the union on the white man. A race which according to Moore has the unique distinction of being both incredibly cowardly AND viciously greedy. How convenient! Umm...can we say racism?Moore accosts the media for weaving tragedies and inciting fear while at the same time manufacturing a few tragedies of his own and basking in the attention. He exposes the tactlessness of Charlton Heston's NRA speech and its chronological proximity of to the events at Columbine while ignoring the disgracefulness of releasing an antiAmerican film so close to September 11th. Even more demoralizing than this movie was the crowd of lemmings surrounding me in the theatre all cheering and laughing in perfect unison. None of whom seemed to recognize the inaccuracies of Bowling's historical implications. Lies that would repulse even Howard Zinn.You won't see dissident propaganda like this in countries like China Russia and Japan because people get killed for it. In Japan the invasion of the Chinese mainland was REMOVED from the history books! Bowling confirms once again that in America we have the uncommon and fortunate privilege to say anything we like anyway we please and get away with it. It's IRONIC that Moore backstabs the same system which provides him these rights. Don't you think?".

I expected it be an antigun film and parts of it are but Moore tells us he is a lifetime member of the NRA so his point of view is not clear. If he thinks guns are so bad then why is he an NRA member? The film is muddled with Moore trying to make connections that are simply not there. For instance he goes after K mart for the fact that their bullets were used at Columbine. How is this their fault? Blaming K mart for selling bullets that were used in a crime is like blaming Budweiser because someone drank their beer drove a car and hit a pedestrian. In addition Moore doesn't at all address where the shooters purchased their guns. That to me seems more important as a responsible gun dealer would certainly think twice before selling guns to teenagers. There is a lot of footage of citizens target shooting but the vast majority of people who enjoy the sport are not going to turn into violent criminals so the connection is very tenuous to say the least. Moore does make a valid point that America has a much higher rate of gun deaths than other countries that also allow gun ownership but is not able to answer why this is so. The film doesn't really go anywhere. It's a bunch of interviews and images with no coherent message. At the end of this type of film the viewer should be able to figure out what the filmmaker had to say. But I have no idea what he was trying to say other than the obviouslike showing a rally that included signs saying Guns and children don't mix. Well duh! I didn't learn anything new from watching this movie or gain any insight at all into Columbine or the larger problem of violence. If you aren't going to learn anything new from a documentary then it's pretty much a wasted two hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Please note The following review was written in 2002. What's the biggest problem facing US society today? This is the core question that filmmaker Michael Moore addresses in his quasisatirical documentary about the American gun culture Bowling for Columbine. But as the film tries to figure out why so many Americans shoot each other to death every year watching it I noticed a larger problem in American culture the tendency to go to extremes. This  more than guns poverty the media rock music or bowling  is the single biggest problem that our neighbours to the south will have to address. And the film Bowling for Columbine never even saw it coming.You see this could have been a great film if it stuck to merely asking the questions. It does a fantastic job of exposing just how nuts the gun nuts really are. At times it is funny  for example when members of the Michigan Militia state completely straightfaced that anyone who does not own a gun is irresponsible. At times it is horrifying  such as when the school shootings at Columbine High were shown from tape captured by a security camera. At all times it is provocative and it raises most of the important questions relating to guns the NRA and the extreme right to whom nothing is more sacred than the secondamendment right to bear arms  not even life itself.Instead however Michael Moore attempts to impose some of his own answers. And that's where this film loses its way. I hate guns granted and I have serious problems with the extreme right. But that doesn't make me any fan of the extreme left either. The problem is that Moore injects his own social agenda and frankly quite radical politics into this film in a subtle manipulative way that made me feel somewhat used.Moore issues blanket critiques of US foreign policy and of government corporations and the media in general. Using logic as ingenious as it is fallacious Moore attempts to link gun violence to racism and oppression of blacks by the media to all US war and aggression and even to the state of Michigan's Welfare to Work program. The main problem is that the answers this film tries to provide fail to fit the questions it asks. Why is the American society so violent? We don't know but clearly Moore doesn't either. And in a movie that is loved by worldwide audiences for its Americabashing more than anything else it seems dishonest for Moore not to be up front about his underlying agenda. Leftist social criticism is presented as the logical alternative to gun ownership. Paradoxically the movie does not seem to conclude  as is suggested by its antiNRA stance and opening position  that guns are to blame for violence. At times he even seems to imply the opposite. At one point in an effort to support his claim that Americans have created an irrational unjustified culture of fear Moore cites a statistic that in the past decade crime has dropped while gun ownership has increased. But... look at that the other way doesn't that mean that there are more guns and less crime? I thought the point was to show that the gun culture is to blame for the high homicide rates.Of course that isn't the point at all. A favourite NRA slogan is that guns don't kill people people kill people. Moore's version of that one should be guns don't kill people Republicans government the media evil corporations globalization and capitalism kills people. How is this anything other than another way to pass the buck? Marilyn Manson may not be at fault. Bowling is in the clear. But rich people are all evil of course.The bottom line is everyone comes away from this film realizing that the gun fanatics are nuts. I have no problem with being asked to accept that the extreme right has problems. I do have a problem being asked to accept that the only solution is to move to the extreme left. There's a happy medium out there and Moore isn't it.".

I am generally in support of an armed citizenry and I have never liked Michael Moore yet I aim to criticize Bowling for Columbine apart from these general views in the sense that it fails as a documentary by not encouraging much real curiosity or real reflective sympathy.To begin with his framing of the central questions is way off the mark juxtaposing rare events involving children against an imposing number of American murders that reflects very different phenomena.  Even at the number itself bells should be ringing he uses a raw count rather than a per capita figure and all of the other countries he mentions have populations substantially lower than the U.S.  Yes the U.S. still has a substantially higher rate but that doesn't justify using a totally irrational comparison in the service of rhetoric.  But just as bad is the idea implicit throughout the film that gun deaths are spread moreorless evenly throughout the U.S. population.  The supposed contrasts with Canadians were a real jawdropper for me.  Kids that play violent games and don't want to really hurt people?  Folks leaving their doors unlocked in the daytime? Jeez every place I have lived in the U.S. except Washington D.C. I have known quite a few people to leave their doors unlocked at night!  What kind of mental realm is Moore living in?  The real fact is that contrary to the stereotypes held by many Europeans most people in the U.S. rich middle class and poor are extremely safe.  The problem we should really be addressing is not why we are so much more violent than them but why a few places in this country are nothing short of war zones.  That goes to gangs racial hatred and inevitably to the disastrous War on Drugs. Moore barely touches on this.  My point here is not to argue against him which is precisely what I would want a documentary to inspire but to illustrate the serious lack of thought that underlies this film.The one person who comes off worse than Moore is Charlton Heston who quite simply seems like a ghoul.  Either Moore has done an utterly unethical hatchetjob of their discussion or Heston is completely incompetent.  I don't care if you're ambushed coming out of the shower at 5 am if you're a freaking spokesman for the NRA you should be prepared to argue that firearms ownership by lawabiding citizens saves lives and reduces crime not just spout some Godgiven rights crap that evokes zero sympathy from most viewers.  When Moore shows a picture of the little girl shot by her classmate you should be able to show him the kids that don't have mothers because they were beaten to death by crazy exboyfriends with no realistic means to defend themselves.  Whether Moore or Heston has more to blame very little of the substantive progun view is raised in the film.The people that come off extremely well are Trey Parker or is is the other one? and Marilyn Manson both of whom show the kind of deep human sympathy that Moore fakes badly to cover his obnoxiously selfrighteous viciousness. I personally wish instead of using Columbine in rhetorical support of very muddled thinking on guns that a film would have concentrated more on the mentality of the Columbine shooters and victims reflecting the serious social problems in a typical high school experience and the effects of alienation in general.  But I know Michael Moore would have ruined that movie too.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I thought this would be yet another melancholic Scandinavian psychodrama involving a boy and his coming out lesbian mum. The plot is indeed somewhat along these lines but there's nothing melancholic let alone Scandinavian about this funny funny movie.However this is not exactly a comedy either although it turns out to be comical enough. Rather it's a slice of life seen through the glasses of an almost 30 years old drone brilliantly played by Hilmir Snaer Gudnason living off benefits and his far too indulgent mother.Hlynur the antihero sleeps til noon loafs around at home all day and drinks all night. Although he manages to sleep with members of the opposite sex he can't bear to wake up to them. In other words he's a modern Peter Pan refusing to grow up  if you can imagine Peter Pan as an apathetic chainsmoking sloth in a parka. And he seems fairly content with his simple nonlife until Victoria Abril waltzes in .The scene where Hlynur's mum confesses her new found sexual direction is nothing short of wonderful. It has an unerring ring of truth to it a family drama played out over a quiet cuppa in the kitchen and it manages to be moving and hilarious at the same time. In that very scene Gudnason also shows off his exquisite acting skills with great restraint and uttering PC platitudes he betrays the emotional battle raging within. Pathetic yet sympathetic.Hlynur is played with just the right blend of indifference impotence although not sexual and selfpity needed for the part and though fairly unsympathetic to begin with he grows on you as he reveals himself as a lost little boy. That much of his depressive nerd personality is more or less kept throughout the whole process is yet another proof of the quality of the acting and writing in 101 Reykjavik.All the main actors central to the plot give stellar performances and many of the marginals too. The music is interesting scored by our very own Damon Albarn of Blur and Einar the Sugarcube Bjork's Svengali. I especially liked the ambientreggae version of the old Kinks standard Lola.Some of the dialogue is in Icelandic which is fine as long as it is subtitled. Much of it is however in English delivered in a bizarre  but fortunately intelligible  cocktail of Icelandic and Spanish accents.There are few drawbacks to this flick the main one being the obligatory landscape scene of some glacier or lava... I forget. But that's like criticizing a three star restaurant for a spelling error in the menu.  The superb Reykjavik nightlife scenes are however not to be missed and could well serve as advertisements for Icelandair.One nice oddity is the nowadays little used narrator voiceover. Well actually Hlynur serves more as a commentator to the respective fixes he finds himself in deadpan mordant and hilarious but rarely explaining much which the viewer hasn't already divined far better than Hlynur himself ever will. I suspect that these comments are original quotes from the novel on which the film is based.Played out with extremely dry selfdepreciating almost Jewish humor the movie draws to an end as a fairly touching story of familial love disguised as an adult comingofage movie wrapped inside a black comedy. And as often enough happens in real life this Gordian knot of personal problems more or less unravels itself. In a movie however such a solution may seem cheap but this one gets away with it as the characters just carry on with their lives after redefining the nuclear family.This is the directing debut by actordirector Baltasar Kormakur who also wrote the script. Actors do often not make the best directors but Kormakur proves to be an exception to that rule. The characters are well developed as one could expect but they are not allowed to get in the way of the storytelling which relies more on visual details and physical acting than endless dialogue and overdramatization. This is doubly impressing considering the literary origin of the movie.And maybe this is a clue to why this film works so well it is uniquely Icelandic or should I say MidAtlantic drawing on European and American filmmaking traditions thus enjoying the best of both worlds old and new. I know it will work in Britain and Europe and the Americans seem to like it as well judging by the rave review 101 Reykjavik got in Variety and the success at the influential Toronto film festival.".

I must admit I've not seen any of her work with Almodovar but I was surprised to learn from the DVD filmography that she's been working in European cinema since as long ago as Richard Lester's 1976 Robin and Marian. She was 40 when this film was made so hardly a 'toygirl' for the fiftyish mother although quite a catch it must be said.I guess Lola was changed from an Icelandic character to Spanish to draw in the European arthouse audience but it's still a decision which works well as she personifies an outside force which arrives and turns Hlynar's world upside down.The film feels very much like the novel adaptation it is  quite a lot of voiceover and exposition  but there are a number of deadpan cinematic jokes of the Kaurismaki variety combined with sexual outrageousness in the Almodovar vein. Some of the humour only becomes apparent on repeated viewings in all the fusion of styles works surprisingly well.Overall this probably won't change your life but it's a lot of fun.".

A 30 years old guy still living with his mother refusing to get a job and quite retarded in regard to any relation with the opposite sex runs into one crazy situation after the other and his complete disability to handle them simply makes you scream out laughing. Yet the humour in the movie is not of the dumb slapstick or nonsense kind but with some exceptions actually quite intelligent as social issues like sexual orientation identity and general problems of way of living are dealt with. The spanish girl as an intruder in the rather decadent and boring scenario of small Reykjavik raises questions and perturbs the world of the small family perfectly by first seducing the son and then the mother though unwillingly. Great acting. If this movie had a broader audience it could really have become a big hit now it encants only a limited number of spectators with its very unnordic warm easy and comfortable atmosphere and leaves you very satisfied. Big recommendation!".

Being set in an unfamiliar environment it gives the viewer a chance to see what might be an otherwise familiar story with a fresh set of eyes.  Well okay strictly speaking the story IS a little unusual but that's not my point. There are a few things you should probably know about Reykjavik before you see this movie.  It's not really very cold for one thing.  Sitting out at the end of the Gulf Stream it has very temperate weather rarely above 72F 20C in summer and typically around 30F 2C in winter.  You could probably get by in a sweater most of the year at least in the city.  Far away from the city in the uninhabited middle of the country you'll find a couple of active volcanoes and the largest glacier in Europe. For another thing it's an amazingly alcoholic place.  When we were there beer well weak beer anyway was sold in soda machines.  People drink until they pass out in public especially when getting primed for 3day weekends bank holidays and it's not considered shameful  their more conscious drunken friends just help carry them to the busairplanecar.  People line up around the block to get into discos even in the summer when it's light 22 hours a day.  These people party hearty.  If this seems like a conflict with what is supposed to be a predominantly Lutheran country it might be but nobody seems to let it bother them too much.  But back to the movie...This movie is both a frank look at this gleefully debauched ambiance and a more personal look at our hero Hlynur.  For the sake of discussion let's call him a fullygrown bird yet to leave the nest.  You could describe this movie a number of glib ways none of which would be truly accurate. Comingofage.  Selfdiscovery.  Rebirth.  The meaning of life. Sex drugs and Rock 'n Roll.What it is is funny.  Really funny.  Hlynur is sort of an existential being and the world mostly happens to him.  He's not sure why and not sure what it means.  Should he find it tragic incomprehensible or just funny?  For him comfortable in the ennui of his unchallenging existence these disturbances are a bit of a challenge.  For us the audience what it is is seriously entertaining!The directing is terrific.  The acting is excellent.  Victoria Abril is a treat as usual but the rest of the mostly Icelandic cast manages to keep up.  And the endless Lola remixes are hilarious.  A lot of fun highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film 101Reykjavik during one of my sessions as a projectionist at a movie theater in Helsingborg. I had no previous knowledge of the film neither had I heard anything about it but boy was I in for a treat.Although the movie seems incomplete story wise the characters and the dialog is superb and some of the plot twists make you fall out of the chair in laughter. So despite the lack in story development the overall experience is great. The music by among others Damon Albarn compliments the pictures wonderfully with its playful themes of the old classic Lola. It is really a variation of the old Slacker theme but it is done without any moral judgement on the characters. Some people aren't ment to become important and some are.

Would the story had been allowed to develop even further the movie would have been the ultimate voice of the Slacker generation but since it falls short the best one can do is just take it for what it is and enjoy.I would warmly recommend the movie to everyone under 35 the older generations might want to check out something else.".

I had no previous knowledge of the film neither had I heard anything about it but boy was I in for a treat.Although the movie seems incomplete story wise the characters and the dialog is superb and some of the plot twists make you fall out of the chair in laughter. So despite the lack in story development the overall experience is great. The music by among others Damon Albarn compliments the pictures wonderfully with its playful themes of the old classic Lola. It is really a variation of the old Slacker theme but it is done without any moral judgement on the characters. Some people aren't ment to become important and some are.

Anyway Hlynur is a 30 something single man who gives cigarettes to 4yearolds and daydreams about butchering his closest relatives with a shotgunon Christmas day!

Her name is Lola and every time her name is mentioned the song by The Kinks can be heard on a harmonica which is rather funny. Anyway Hlynur doesn't know that Lola is the lesbian toygirl of his motherJust your typical day in 101 Reykjavik. 101 Reykjavik is very funny only because the main character is such a loser! And everybody knows is a lot more interesting to observe a loser instead of a fake action hero right? The different subjects handled in this film all may look very controversial but the terrific use of black humor and satire makes it a lot easier to digest. And it must be said the film features a few extremely ingenious findings! In a brilliantly comical scene Hlynur irritates a traffic warden by putting extra coins in every parking meter so that he can't write a single ticket. I'd certainly recommend this film as long as you're not expecting an authentic masterpiece. It's clever creative and filled with nudity male and female. If they made one lesson clear with this movie it's don't ever settle in Iceland!".

The innocent enough sounding song but is in many ways the perfect theme song for 101 Reykavik by Baltasar Kormakur. This movie follows Hlynur a 29 yearold man who still lives with his mom whose days blend by in a succession of drug filled weekends and days spent at the computer but are quickly turned upside down with the arrival of his mom's new girlfriendLola. Once the love triangle develops between Lola his mom and Hylnur the boyman finds his life changing drastically. Reykavik both the title of the movie the setting for the story and the hometown for the director is a small Icelandic town under the oppression of winter. Hylnur played by Hilmir Snr Gunason though on the edge of turning 30 is perpetually living as if he was 17 and feels as if he is oppressed as much by the town as his own lack of ambition. His mother's house a small cupboard of an apartment where a bath doubles as a couch is the entirety of his world. His universe only expands to the local pub during the weekends where he drinks with the same group of people. There is no better description of his character then to say he is sleeping through his life.The movie is almost repetitious to a fault but perhaps that is the point by midway through the movie the viewer feels like they themselves are bored to tears by the cyclical nature of the scenes. Hylnur spends his days at the house and pub desperate women search for love only to be insulted by Hylnur and his friends and Reykavik remains buried in the snow and dark. However the movie is very selfaware of this best categorized in the scene where at a holiday dinner where the family actually sits and watches a video of the previous year's dinner party with the same people parroting identical phrases. While low budget Gunason makes excellent use of lighting and setting to reflect and parallel the story and tone of the movie. At the start Reykavik is cold dark and snowy the weather reflects the mood and feelings of the characters. As the movie moves along the snow melts the days grow longer there is more lighting in the shots new life is breathed into the characters. Mirroring the thaw of routine and the creation of new life as prominent characters become pregnant. Upon viewing of this movie it can become easy to be disgusted and distracted by the gratuitous scenes of sex and drugsoften included for comedic value and miss the central points the film tries to convey. While these scenes do detract from the overall message 101 Reykavik hits uncomfortable nerves. Can a person have a second rebirth? While no one who watches this film could ever possess the lack of ambition of Hylnur there is a common feeling that one falls into ruts that cannot be broken. We feel like we are just passive recipients of life just participants in events beyond our control. In this sense the movie is redeemingmuch like Hylnur experienceswhat takes us out of ruts and makes us feel like we are once again living life' is what pushes us out of our comfort zone and into uncharted territory. In many ways the fundamental judges of a movie such as 101 Reykavik is whether or not the viewer enjoys viewing it or it stimulates thought. On these grounds the movie succeeds with flying colors. The comedic aspects most often do fall short but the movie stands on other grounds. It makes one examine their own life whether or not they themselves are sleeping through life or an active participant do they truly know what they want out of life or is it simply a less extreme version of Hylnur's life plans to perpetually live off welfare?".

	schema:headline " 101 Reykjavik Confronts Willingness to Adapt to Modernity";
	schema:reviewBody "Eskimo Brother is a colloquialism that I hear thrown around which describes a bond between two people via having slept with the same partner. Hallgrmur Helgason's film 101 Reykjavik 2000 brings a new dynamic tension to this term. The movie's protagonist Hlynur Hilmir Snr Gunason after sleeping with Lola Victoria Abril a flamenco instructor from Spain who has been lodging with his mom Hanna Mara Karlsdttir and him finds out that this attractive dancer is his mother's lover. This information is difficult for Hlynur to pallet and he becomes emotionally distraught because of his new stepmother's infidelity which results in him becoming the illegitimate father of his baby brother. 101 Reykjavik is an intriguing watch. It's a bold film pertinent to Iceland where there is a strong sense of kinship identity in the tightknit country. With a national population of 280000 an outsider could easily be mistaken that everyone knows everyone and this film plays into that idea that your family business is theirs. Considering the new slendingabk database which is a project that aims to trace and record the genealogy of everyone in Iceland back to the settlement it is a fascinating time to watch this movie that plays so heavily on complicated and taboo relationships. In a country where patronymic and matronymic surnames are used instead of unified family names in Iceland rather than Payne McMillan I would be Payne Martinsonthat is son of Martin 101 Reykjavik shows that humans are a less linear product of upbringing than an amalgamation of sources and experiences. In a sense Helgason's film is about keeping up with the times. Released ten years before Icelandic Parliament adopted a gender neutral definition of marriage we see Hlynur off put and perplexed by Lola's sexual identity that does not fit into his narrow scope of the homosexualheterosexual dichotomy. 101 Reykjavik is a millennial coming of age story. Hlynur who is unwilling to make radical changes to his lifestyle in the face of his new family structure. When his mother announces that she is going to raise Lola's baby with her it does not occur to him that he should move out and start a life of his own but instead must adapt to these abnormalities within the existing family structure. This film might drive some viewers crazy just by the nature of Hlynur who lacks any semblance of direction in life. He starts out living with his mother surviving on welfare checks unmotivated to go out and find a job Hlynur spends most of his daylight hours surfing the internet and masturbating and then going out at night to binge drink and party. His assumption though that there is nothing wrong with this sloth lifestyle but then condemns his mother and Lola who seize upon opportunities to expand their horizons make Hlynur an extended metaphor for those who usher in change when it benefits them but scoff it when poses personal obstacles. The film does take a judgmental tone toward people who are indignant to change because it is uncomfortable for them however it does not advocate outright for modernity. Hlynur's obsession with internet pornography for example shadow his relationships in the real world. And Hlynur all but ruins the magic of Christmas when in order to save time cleaning up needles he purchases a hideous aluminum colored tinsel tree that rotates while proclaiming Merry Christmas. At other times though Helgason blends themes of globalization with the Icelandic landscape in an enjoyable and accepting way. Notably the musical score throughout has a very futuristic sound like robots or synthesizers but the melodies sound folksy. Also Lola who is the greatest outsider of anyone in the filmHlynur even says that people don't come to Iceland they are only born theiris fascinating and welcomed by almost everyone she meets including Hf another woman who is romantically invested in Hlynur.The heavy mismatching and confusion of identities illustrates the cultural paradigm of old versus new that is prevalent in Icelandic cinema. For those American viewers that don't particularly care to read they are in luck because much of the film is spoken in English because that is the language the Spanish character and Icelandic people are able to speak in common. The fact that neither are able to communicate in the language most comfortable to them parallels nicely the uneasiness of these characters that are experimenting and developing while faced with serious emotional complication. I recommend this film because of its humorous confrontation of issues regarding identity and ability to defy new obstacles. Even though it deals with heavy issues such as addiction and adultery it has a heartwarming ending. It's a great film for people that are anxious about the challenges that accompany increasing development and globalization.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was extremely impressed with this movie as I'm pretty sure it's the first film I've ever watched that originated in Iceland. It's very obvious that they don't mess around over there! Both in making motion pictures and their everyday lifestyles. American slackers can't hold a candle to the main character here. He had the system going for him in each way he could. All he did was surf the Internet and watch porn sometimes even weird stuff like the animal kind or even as simple as women exercising and would either drink do drugs or have sex at night. The girls in this were pretty cute they weren't hot compared to Hollywood standards but they're all natural and that's a thing we rarely see here anymore. The European people seem more laid back when it comes to their forms of entertainment and don't get all worked up if a little adult content slips into their art which is a good thing. The parents over here are such hypocrites it's disgusting. They'll go all crazy if they see the slightest displeasing thing on the screen but then when it comes to their real lives they do some highly immoral deeds themselves. But that's just the way it goes. I did like how the main character in this is both funny but also steps back and analyzed life at times too which proves he's deeper than you'd think at first look.Final ChillMovies Not much would be added to the viewing this way.DVD Purchase Yes but it'll take awhile to track it down for a decent price.Rental If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path then you'll love it!".

It's very obvious that they don't mess around over there! Both in making motion pictures and their everyday lifestyles. American slackers can't hold a candle to the main character here. He had the system going for him in each way he could. All he did was surf the Internet and watch porn sometimes even weird stuff like the animal kind or even as simple as women exercising and would either drink do drugs or have sex at night. The girls in this were pretty cute they weren't hot compared to Hollywood standards but they're all natural and that's a thing we rarely see here anymore. The European people seem more laid back when it comes to their forms of entertainment and don't get all worked up if a little adult content slips into their art which is a good thing. The parents over here are such hypocrites it's disgusting. They'll go all crazy if they see the slightest displeasing thing on the screen but then when it comes to their real lives they do some highly immoral deeds themselves. But that's just the way it goes. I did like how the main character in this is both funny but also steps back and analyzed life at times too which proves he's deeper than you'd think at first look.Final ChillMovies Not much would be added to the viewing this way.DVD Purchase Yes but it'll take awhile to track it down for a decent price.Rental If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path then you'll love it!";

Not towards his mistress not towards his in many ways perverted relation to his mother and absolutely not towards his life. Then the beautiful bisexual Spanish woman Lola enters. Life is shaken and the main character even begins to feel some responsibility in the end.But this is too clever too laid back too ironic too sarcastic. It's too much of Anarchy chic here and the film doesn't take stand for anything which maybe is what the director wants. Anyhow there is a kind of morality also in that kind of view. Entertaining oh yes but we are not really surprised not even about the ending. We have seen these people before.".

	schema:reviewBody "Presently Iceland is not a major player in the international film circuit  the Icelandic Film Centre website proudly adorably proclaims that they now have over one hundred! feature films released. However if 101 Reykjavk so named we can only assume for being the country's first postcentennial film is any indication it's quite worth tracking down those other 100 as well. For a film that casually positions itself as encapsulating the spirit of its nation 101 Reykjavk is in many ways exactly the remediation of stereotypes you'd expect from an Icelandic film it's thoroughly odd bleak and full of isolating grandeur. And yet debut director Baltasar Kormkur navigates expectations with a cheeky confidence and sharp quirky sense of selfeffacing humour that you can't help but love it so even amidst the inevitable doubletakes at the bizarro twists and turns it throws your way with cheerful nonchalance. Here's a prime example of how genre can be deceptive the film is a romantic comedy revolving around an immature manchild afraid of commitment. If that sentence alone is enough to make you retch and run the other way you're not alone. However somehow tossing these tropes into the icy winds of Reykjavk is enough to strip and scatter every whiff of clich like so much powder snow. There's something utterly disarming about Kormkur's cheerily matteroffact approach to circumstances and character beats that would be abhorrent to traditional Hollywood audiences that somehow takes the sting out and makes them irreverent and silly instead of the stuff of major studio nightmares. What sort of 'circumstances' are we talking about here? Well you'd be remiss to expect a traditional straightforward Hollywood 'romcom' from the country that created an ancestry smartphone app to avoid incest in bar hookups and you can only imagine the field day Kormkur would have with that. As such our belligerent manchild's misadventures fumble past pregnancy speed dating calibre hookup swapping the experience of coming out in a claustrophobic community as one character eagerly exclaims A REAL LIFE lesbian? What's it like?? and yes incest. Kind of. And yet they all weave unobtrusively into the grain of the film with such wideeyed indifference it's almost a heartier laugh than the film's snappier punchlines of which there are many. Just check out Kormkur's depiction of the excruciating claustrophobic dullness of an extended family dinner  we laugh because it saves us from shuddering in painful solidarity. Naturally Kormkur's skews firmly for satire rather than neorealism here thank goodness but this is not to say his film is merely silly and superfluous. Here and there amidst the goofiness the film surges with genuine passion  pride for its beautiful barren landscapes captured in gorgeous panoramic crane and aerial shots here and frustration for the boredom and aimlessness which consumes all too many of its inhabitants. It's for this reason protagonist Hlynur perfectly charming Hilmir Snr Gunason who skulks around like a wry hipster Crispin Glover isn't that easy to write off in spite of his infuriating belligerence in the face of employment romantic partnership responsibility hell adulthood as a whole. We know he's still suffering the aftershocks of an ambiguously tragic childhood but his perennial smug selfishness burns through any accrued sympathy. And yet in his poetically grim voiceover interludes Hlynur seems to diagnose himself as a product of the deep stagnation and hopelessness of his environment. He's not as badly off as many of the substanceabusive or infected sexmaniacs who whirl around him but in his own words he's so pleasantly functionally depressed he considers life only a fleeting break from death. Eat your heart out Ingmar Bergman. There are bright spots assuredly  the wildly effervescent Victoria Abril's visiting Flamenco teacher Lola for example who lights up the film every time she flits through it. However time shows that even they are usually as amorally tainted as the rest of the snowy wasteland surrounding them. Not bad though as Hlynur's sole moment of introspection crucially expresses  every person scenario and facet of life is both good and bad and must be accepted as is.It's a resonant moral in a film full of little universal truths all wrapped up in a deceptively mesmerizing surprisingly catchy soundtrack of Icelandic electro mostly remixes of the classic The Kinks tune Lola. 101 Reykjavk is thoroughly fresh sharp hugely funny and soulfully mournful yet bundled together with such quirky charm you would pinch the film's cheeks if the film had cheeks to pinch. It may not be the most obvious pick for Friday night viewing for nonIcelandic viewers. But it could just scratch all of those originality itches you didn't even know you had. 810 Yes really. It's called slendingabk translated as The Book of Icelanders. Its tagline is Bump in the app before you bump in bed. If you find this as hilarious and awesome as you should you will thoroughly enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film 101 Reykjavik produced and directed by awardwinning Icelandic director Baltasar Kormkur is a dark cerebral comedy that proves to be a strong first feature length film for Kormkur. Based on the book by painter novelist translator and writer Hallgrmur Helgason 101 Reykjavik is titled after a section of the downtown of Iceland's largest city and capital which is populated by people whom the protagonist would no doubt describe as idiots. From that setting sprouts a facetious and twisted tale of transfiguration lust and profundity that contorts notions of familial relations and seeks to both entertain viewers and incite thought.The films selfcentred and listless protagonist Hlynur a roughly 30 year old unemployed loser with a penchant for porn proves to be both a comedian and a philosopher. Dedicated to his selfproclaimed profession of being unemployable and unwanted wreck the nihilistic Hlynur revels in his insignificance wishing nothing on himself except porn booze and a swift death. Hlynur shirks all responsibility and leaves his mother's tiny apartment almost exclusively to get drunk with his two acquaintances or harass civil servants. When pushed to describe what it is that he does Hlynur responds by saying he does the nothing kind of nothing. A perfect descriptor for his life thus far.That all begins to change when he is introduced to the vivaciousflamenco instructorgirlfriend of his mother Lola. Lola plays the parent and tries to coax a person out of the reclusive Hlynur but he has other ideas in mind. Despite Hfi throwing herself at Hlynur he rejects her entirely while spending time with Lola during his mother's vacation. His efforts culminate in an alcohol fuelled night of drunken passion the final night before his mothers return. What follows for Hlynur is a whirlwind of confessions selfpity and unprecedented growth that is riddled with comically dark humour and philosophical commentary.The apartment feels much smaller to Hlynur as he is slapped in the face by the reality of his situation. The thin walls of the apartment bring his frustration with himself to a boil and in a fit of childish rage he repeatedly seeks to find solace in alcohol only to be berated by the idiots in the bar. However as Hlynur grows as a person he also begins to come to terms with his mother's love for Lola. With changing times and rising tensions in his homelife Hlynur is roused from his hibernationesque lifestyle and pushed to not only make something of himself but also of his nowtopsyturvy family. How he comes to terms with his mamma'sboy role changing in the congealing familial unit is a core point of growth and a central theme in the film.Seekers of intellectual stimulation fear not the philosopher inside Hlynur is awash with notes of existential and moral nihilism. With comments like Family dinner or a funeral... I'd rather go to a funeral at least there's one less idiot and The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it Hlynur cements himself as someone who places no value in both his life and the lives of even his closest family. His philosophical outlook undergoes a parallel morphology to that of his tumultuous private and social lives.The pace of the camera work contributes a deceptively monotonous plodding feeling to the film which occurs over what appears to be several weeks if not months. The abstraction of perception of time contributes to the film by implying that by and large nothing important happens in the everyday lives of the characters and that they live a relatively empty existence. Furthermore for a large portion of the film the setting of Christmastime in Reykjavik lends a chill and vacant appearance that serves as an ample metaphor for the utter lack of activity in Hlydnurs life. In the words of Hlydnur There are no insects no trees no nothing... The only reason why people live here is because they were born here. Which makes ever more apparent the state of his existence.Despite its meandering pace and at points glaringly obvious metaphors 101 Reykjavik has a twisted and unpredictable plot that surprises with each turn. The comedy like great chocolate is dark and you most certainly have to be in the mood for it. As comic Erma Bombeck said There is a thin line that separates laughter and pain comedy and tragedy humour and hurt and 101 Reykjavik walks that line with dexterity. That said it is nighimpossible to watch and not chuckle in the least. Needless to say 101 Reykjavik is an excellent first showing for Kormkur.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewing life through the lens of an uninspired socially defective 30 year old man doesn't seem particularly uplifting. Geek Hylnur the protagonists of the film '101 Reykjavik' doesn't want much out of life. He is content living at home with his mother spending time at the local bar and surviving purely on the social benefits the state provides. However the story of Hlynur transpires to be one full of fantasy humor and lust. And in the end it gives the audience the hope that maybe meaning can be found after all. '101' Reykjavik' directed by Baltasar Kormakur is set in Reykjavik Iceland. The location sets the mood for the entire film and can be seen as a representation of Hlynur. Hlynur is somewhat of an antihero  an immature childish and socially isolated man who does not want more out of life than he currently enjoys. He spends his days halfheartedly searching for employment without any real conviction behind his actions. He is blissfully unaware of any greater pleasure that can be found in life. How quickly life can change. A night of passion an unexpected love affair and an unusual family dynamic all emerge shocking Hlynur out of his lull and into a world full of confusion and complications.Kormakur's characterization of Hlynur is the driving force behind the film's success. Hlynur isn't an active participant in life  life mostly just happens to him. His life borders on the brink of tragedy meaningless and hilarity. It's an uncomfortable balance that leaves the audience desperately entertained. Voice overs are utilized to convey the isolation of Hlynur and how desperate his struggle is to connect to the world his lives in. The coming of age of Hylnur is a huge theme throughout the film. Hlynur begins rid himself of his past life and a chance to turn away from the dark and gloomy tones that had pervaded his life. The stunning Icelandic landscape around him suggests that there is in fact beauty and hope to be found in the world. Kormakur directs the film brilliantly. The setting of Reykjavik is used as a metaphor for for Hylnur. It is snowy desolate and unwelcoming  a perfect representation of Hylnur and his love life. The establishing shots throughout the film of the magnificent landscapes of Iceland and it's bustling nightlife do a marvelous job of making the audience feel like they are actually at the location of the story. Dry unexpected humor is strewn throughout the film in a masterful way. This is displayed perfectly in an interaction between Lola a local Spanish flamenco instructor and Hlynur Lola So what do you do? Hlynur Nothing. Lola What kind of nothing? Hlynur The nothing kind of nothing.Kormakur uses humor to engage the audience while at the same time revealing the depths of Hlynur's meaningless and loneliness extend to. I particularly enjoyed the performance of the actor who portrayed Hlynur  Hilmir Snaer Gudnason. Through him we can get a sense of Hlymur's emptiness and longing for meaning throughout the film. I found myself feeling sympathetic towards him despite many of his unendearing character traits. Gudnason and all the other actors in the film deliver their dialogue in a believable and engaging way pushing the film along with their wonderful performances.'101 Reykjavik' is a wonderful reflection of the changes occurring in Iceland in particular the progressive social values that the film depicts. I enjoyed the film thoroughly. I felt as though the plot progressed a little slowly at times but the performances of the lead actors drove the film through these dull periods. Despite the fact that the plot is completely bizarre I found myself relating to the plight of Hlynur and hoping that he could overcome the trap in which he had found himself. UItimately the film conveys a timely message of hope. I would definitely recommend this film. If you are able to overcome the complete absurdity of the storyline you will find yourself engaged with the characters while at the same time enjoying the breathtaking scenery that is on offer throughout the film. Kormakur proves himself to be a fantastic director and the dialogue between the characters is dry witty and unpredictable. '101 Reykjavik is constantly entertaining and well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of 101 Reykjavik follows Hlynur a young man in his midthirties who lives with his mother. Hlynur enjoys spending his days and unemployment checks drinking watching porn smoking and web surfing. He occasionally has sex with Hofy a girl he regularly sees at the club he frequents but resists having more than a physical relationship with her. He has several friends he goes to the pub with but his closest relationship is with his mother. At the beginning of the film Hlynur is content to watch life on a television or computer screen and live in close quarters with his mother. When asked what he does Hlynur replies he does nothing the nothing kind of nothing. He detests his extended family and finds their company so mundane that he has fantasies of killing them with a shotgun. However his routine is upended when his mother's dance instructor Lola moves in with them for the holidays. Hlynur is attracted to her and invites her out to an evening with friends. Lola enjoys going out and drinking even more than Hlynur does and leaves the bar with another woman. On New Year's Eve Hlynur finds out that Lola is a lesbian but despite this insight he sleeps with her. Complications arise when Hlynur discovers that his mother is in a lesbian relationship with Lola and that Lola is pregnant with his baby. 101 Reykjavik employs clever film techniques to tell the story of an isolated young man and his journey to take an active role in life a story that could be used as a metaphor for larger situations. Watching Hlynur step out of his isolated world and into reality is part of what makes 101 Reykjavik an enjoyable film. As the movie progresses Hlynur is less and less content to continue his aloof lifestyle and becomes more and more engaged with the world around him. The transition is not smooth. Hlynur enjoys his isolation commenting with relief at a club that it was too noisy to talk and too busy to dance thus providing a barrier to anything potentially engaging or intimate. Lola becomes a major force in Hlynur's life pulling him out of his selfimposed isolation. This is represented when she makes him watch the fireworks from the balcony and not on the TV regardless of his protests that they actually look better on a screen. Despite his blas attitude towards commitment he is genuinely upset when Lola becomes pregnant but does not reveal he is the father and describes the father as a 'donor'. While Hlynur readily accepts his mother for who she is he has trouble accepting that she will raise his baby and becomes very emotionally conflicted. He tries to reconcile his newfound feelings with his isolated world but the audience can see he is struggling when he attends a party and ends up watching two people have sex. For Hlynur an avid porn watcher this could be seen as progress into the real world because watching real sex does not involve the isolation of watching it on a screen. At the end of the movie we see that Hlynur is an active part of his child's life and has a job checking parking meters proving that Hlynur has started participating in life and even taking on some responsibility. Several film techniques are employed to include the audience in Hlynur's isolated world and his journey to becoming an active participant in life. Voice overs are a film technique employed to give insight into Hlynur's thoughts and feelings. Hlynur's thoughts track his character change. At the beginning of the film Hlynur voices his complaint that they don't show porn in the morning. Whereas at the end of the film Hlynur describes himself as a harmless flightless bird his inner voice shows that his thoughts have gotten deeper and more selfexploratory. His voice emphasizes his struggle to take more control over his life and become more active. Crane shots of Hlynur trudging through the mountainous Icelandic landscape are also used to convey his isolation as they sweep over the deserted land. These shots give an idea how vastly isolated and especially at the end of the film how lonely Hlynur's life is.Despite the films clear comedic undertones 101 Reykjavik is a good metaphor for change coming to a small nation like Iceland. Iceland is an isolated country and like Hlynur may not completely engage the rest of the world. One of the major changes in Hlynur's life is the revelation of his mother's sexual preferences. Hlynur accepts his mother and notes how social views in Iceland are changing by describing how 'the lesbian is new to Iceland' thus describing how his story could be transcended to the national level. 101 Reykjavik is a good model for change in a small isolated country and how people deal with that change and engage with the greater world as a whole. 101 Reykjavik artfully tells the story of an isolated young man becoming more engaged in life as a message that is universally understood. The film employs techniques such as voice overs and crane shots to convey the isolation that Hlynur feels and his struggle to become fully participating in his world. Many understand Hlynur's struggle to take control of his life and will be able to relate to him and enjoy 101 Reykjavik.".

	schema:headline " A Strange Yet Oddly Appealing Film";
	schema:reviewBody "101 Reykjavik was undoubtedly the best film I've seen come out of Iceland. The premise of the movie is funny by itself a lazy 30yearold unemployed guy named Hlynur as played by Hilmir Snr Gunason lives with his mom as played by Hanna Mara Karlsdttir in Reykjavik Iceland and finds himself going from out of luck no prospects and not a care in the world to a potential father for the children of both his semigirlfriend Hf as played by rur Vilhjlmsdttir and his mom's new Spanish girlfriend Lola as played by Victoria Abril with whom he had an affair. Hlynur's reactions when he learned of the pregnancies were priceless. So all things considered this movie was pretty good. Not only was it a unique plot that had a twist or two thrown in but the character development the tone of the film and even the soundtrack was good. Quite a few of the characters really grew up in the film such as Hlynur with his more responsible lifestyle at the end his mother and her finally coming out of the closet despite the fact that apparently everybody knew including Hlynur and Lola who ended up being a pretty solid mom herself. The movie's tone was just great in my opinion. It was lighthearted yet still serious. Hlynur had some serous problems but he could always make light of them which is an admirable trait. It shows an inner strength to be able to make fun of oneself. The song Lola by Ray Davies is used in a variety of ways including a few instrumental versions which cracked me up because a it's got the pun value what with one of the main characters being named Lola and b I was one of the only people in my group who got it since it was the instrumental version that played first. Not only that but there were a few completely unnecessary scenes that were thrown in that were just great. For example there was this scene where Hlynur is at a family reunion and he quite graphically imagines himself taking the shotgun off of the wall and shooting his entire family. Now while the plot would have been unaffected by the absence of this scene it adds relatability to the film since everyone imagines doing that at some point or another. Plus the scene itself is downright hysterical. Also the film is pretty educational on the whole. You get a pretty good handle on how boring Iceland is for its residents. 61 of the population lives in Reykjavik and that's around 200000 people which is around the population of Des Moines Iowa which is the home to the world's largest truck stop. Not exactly a highexcitement zone. Which is what the character Hlynur tells you. They live for the weekend and all there is to do then is to drink and to be promiscuous. This is undoubtedly why he gets into the trouble he gets into. The ending of the movie was in my opinion truly phenomenal. I won't spoil it for you the reader though.But the movie isn't without faults. There are a few moments in the movie where you question the sanity of the characters. There's one scene where Hf and Hlynur talk over an intercom at Hf's apartment complex and she casually tells him about how spoiler alert not only did she get an abortion but it wasn't even his baby to begin with after he had spent the last few months agonizing over it. The viewer and Hlynur both have the same reaction WTF? I thought to myself Well what was the point of that? What did she really stand to gain by messing with his head like that? That was below the belt pun intended. Despite the few shortcomings it had in the character department though the good aspects of the film really shine through while the inadequacies almost fall away and I was left with a good feeling coming away from the film. It was one of those rare films where I left saying to myself I'm glad I watched that. It was all in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The movie had a good moral too. Everything will turn out fine. Hlynur stressed over his seemingly insurmountable problems but in the end it wasn't nearly as bad as he thought. This is I feel life in a nutshell. It seems worse than it is and when you finally realize that all of your cares tend to melt away.".

Hlynur is a young healthy man still living with his mother we see him sleep through most of his days and spend the rest of his life watching porn or clubbing at night.

His interactions with Lola are the highlights of the movie without a doubt because it's the only time that he finally shows any kind of emotion towards another human being.101 Reykjavk is beautifully shot the gorgeous landscapes of Iceland and the busy nightlife serve as a wonderful backdrop to the story by the end of the film you almost feel like you have been to Reykjavk. The movie has also a very good dialogue with many witty moments be it from Hlymur conversations with his friends or his monologues. All in all this is an entertaining charming movie that takes us to the life of a young man with so much going on in his head and not much to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are no new horizons in this film. Yes there are quite a few perhaps talented young fellows who have a difficulty to adapt to mature life to get a job to get a stable relationship financial independence. Haven't you known that already? But there is a novelty a middleaged mum comes out of the closet and declares her lesbian preference. Hang on though could you imagine a dad coming out of the closet? Probably yes but then the emphasis of the film would have been very different. I mean I'm somewhat suspicious about this lesbian line isn't it just another sexy literally and figuratively speaking saucy attraction added to the film for its own sake? Hardly anyone presumably would be curious to watch middleaged or old men engaged in gay sex. Not so with women. Likewise I've never been to Reykjavik but I'm stunned to discover the apparently large number of lesbian or bisexual girls in its pubs. The asymmetry with homosexual men is obvious. So I have my doubts about this film's realism or more exactly its cynical exploitation of basic instincts. The film pretends to be a comedy. But it fails. As far as I'm concerned there's just one genuinely funny momentthe scene with the parking inspector. All the rest are only supposed to be funny. A positive moment however is that they are not tasteless still.  If it's a failed comedy does it deliver a message? Hardly. Except possibly one Hlynur eventually finds the job. That could be a serious message if Hlynur were described as a rebel at the beginning. Which he isn't. Hence the film doesn't aspire to be anything but a comedy and in that department it fails I believe.Now you might think that such a mediocre film should have poor acting. You are wrong! Oddly enough the acting is of very good quality. Guonason is perfect entirely natural and other leading actors are quite decent. I'm no great fan of Victoria Abril but she does a good job too. To sum up watch this film after a busy day and go to bed. Rating 6.5.".

The plot might be controversial a lazy geek living off state unemployment money in Reykjavik Iceland impregnates a hotblooded Spanish flamenco instructor who then turns out to be his mother's lesbian lover. Trouble ensues... However the movie manages to portray this as just another twist in family history without preaching the gay gospel  or condemning it as yet another sign of the times involving hell and a handbasket.Victoria Abril of Pedro Almodovar fame is well cast as the temptress of mother and son giving him a son and a brother in one fell sweep but the rest of the cast is Icelandic and unknown to me although they are obviously experienced according to IMDb. Newcomer Hilmir Snaer Gudnason deserves special mention as the leading male a difficult part as the character goes from a thin version of Ignatius J Reilly Conderacy of Dunces to a pretty nice guy without the changes being very noticeable.This is a black comedy dealing with unusual themes but it works as the humor strikes home in a dry bemused manner without revelling in the standard cynicism. The story is a good one but it is really the characters and the fine cinematic storytelling which hold 101 Reykjavik together.It's also nice to know that there is more to Icelandic films than loud vikings and senior citizens. The Reykjavik club scene looks rocking.".

For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this movie you never once feel as though Streep is going overthetop. That says alot for someone who spends just about half of the time in her scenes with a tear in her eye. Everything about her performance just seems so effortless and natural. This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly or English with a very convincing Polish accent.The fact that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are not completely lost in this movie says alot for their performances. Kline himself delivers a great performance of a man suffering from delusions and bipolar syndrome. It is one of his greatest performances as well. Peter MacNicol plays the role of a character who pales in comparison to the other characters. MacNicol has the somewhat undesirable task of having to play the character who carries the least amount of baggage. He therefore might be overlooked when viewing at the movie as a whole. However MacNicol does a great job with the character not trying to make more out of it than it is supposed to be. His role is very important to this movie.But the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep just digs down deep here  delivering lines that just put a chill down your spine.".

	schema:headline " Meryl Streep raises the bar";
	schema:reviewBody "After enjoying Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in the recent ensemble comedy A Prairie Home Companion it was great to see their dramatic performances in Sophie's Choice the movie that made them famous. Here they play Sophie and Nathan a volatile young couple living in a Brooklyn boardinghouse in the summer of 1947. Their story and eventually the story of the Polish Sophie's time in a concentration camp during World War II is presented through the eyes of Stingo Peter MacNichol their young Southern neighbor.Though other characters appear especially during the flashbacks Sophie's Choice is largely a threeperson drama that relies on subtle interactions. Meryl Streep can always be counted on to give a nuanced performance but here especially she raises the bar. Speaking three languages including a very realistic portrayal of how foreigners can hesitate and hunt for words when speaking English going from a haggard Auschwitz inmate to a pretty blooming rose consumed by guilt even during the madcap or romantic moments she shares with Nathan she gives a brilliant performance of a very complex character. Her big scenes with Nazi officers are of course powerful but I was equally struck by smaller moments the heartbreaking little flashes of emotion that reveal Sophie's postwar wounds or the extraordinary conversation she has with a Nazi's daughter.Kline throws himself into the role of the fatally glamorous Nathan and also displays impressive range he goes from charming to menacing. MacNichol is not up to these admittedly high standards. He can play the wideeyed innocent but he always seems somewhat thickheaded and lacking in passion. The movie would be more effective if Stingo seemed more truly changed by his experiences with Sophie and Nathan.Despite Stingo's weakness as a character I liked the unusual structure that reveals Sophie's story gradually in flashbacks that draw closer and closer to the ultimate horror. The movie is nicely shot and some of the Brooklyn scenes look as though they actually could have come from a 1940s movie. But no director from the 1940s would have confronted the brutalities of the Holocaust so directly and few actresses from any era could have given a performance like Streep's.".

Kevin Kline and Peter Macnichol are terrific and together the three of them make a highly enjoyable film. The 'choice' Sophie has to make is shattering a beautifully acted and unforgettable scene.

They were at last able to confront one another in Baby Jane  attempting to outdrama one another made it the wonderful film it is.There is simply no other actress that we know of who is more talented a performer than Streep. Unlike Davis and Crawford she is not concerned about her starpower. She becomes whatever character she is playing no matter if we like them or not. SO WHAT if Sophie's Choice was a vehicle to demonstrate her power? Please write another !! William Styron stand forth ! Because of her absorption into her characters and the many nuances she developed in Choice take a look at The Deer Hunter to see how powerfully she played an unextraordinarily plain woman perfectly. Underplaying a character to make you believe people are actually like that is the mark of a great actress.I ardently pray there will be another role for Ms. Streep  even in her older years  that will allow us to become totally engrossed to get outside of our own lives to become completely destroyed delirious shattered just for a couple of hours to realize there is still such talent in the world  THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO WATCH at least.....thank heavens for this magical film.....".

Sophie's Choice is and always will be a classic film a film that will be watched decades from now by other generations. Meryl Streep is simply one of the greatest actresses of our time and has truly made her mark. Sophie's Choice is not another Holocaust film. In fact most of the movie doesn't refer to the holocaust but of Sophie the character so brilliantly created by William Styron in his novel 'Sophie's Choice' and beautifully adapted into a screen play. We see Sophie through the eyes of Stingo the young writer from the south who becomes infatuated with Sophie. Little by little Sophie's story is revealed. The title 'Sophie's Choice' refers to a particular choice made in the film by Sophie but in my eyes there are many choices that Sophie makes through out this film. Meryl Streep completely transformed herself into this character which she won the Acadamy Award for Best Actress and rightfully so. I don't think anybody else could have created Sophie as Streep did. Sophie lives for Nathan the man she claims saved her life 6 months after coming to America. Sophie and Nathan's relationship is a roller coaster of highs and extreme lows. Stingo their best friend is constantly on the outside looking in at the complex characters of Sophie and Nathan. This is a beautiful film as Sophie is a beautiful character you can't help but love and feel her pain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young wouldbeauthor from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie however is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author Stingo gets to know them better he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past where a hidden pain resides.Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be blackandwhite. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past.At the end of the day in spite of the emotionally shattering story Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities united by a common love for literature.But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscarnominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms her accent her speaking German and Polish her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say her restrained kindness her pain none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema.I did fear throughout the film what exactly Sophie's choice was and I was right for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing and unmissable for cinema buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alan Pakula directs Sophie's Choice adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries Holocaust 1978 which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution.Highly melodramatic the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski Meryl Streep who has left PostWar Europe for life in Brooklyn New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau Kevin Kline a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie plays power games with her and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present choosing between one of two lovers Landau or a young writer called Stingo but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews.Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs the Holocaust was antiChristian as well as antiSemitic and like Lumet's The Pawnbroker a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel  completely absent in the film  focuses on whiteonblack racism the American South and the slave trade and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says rejects Christian antiSemitism as causative in favour for the belief that in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre. The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story desperate to claim her victimization for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's Ararat a more overtly postmodern Holocaust story in which different tribes literally attempt to coopt the past for themselves.Interestingly Nathan a kind of Doppelgnger of German sadists is himself a Jewish Nazi whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God a weight which he eventually grants Sophie he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the grey zone a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations. The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction which calls into question the very notion of ethics.Pakula may never go down as a great director but he was interesting in the way like Kubrick he tended to focus on power conspiracy and power's reliance on doublebinds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's Parallax View who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of andor destroy Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem a famous thought experiment in cognitive science neuroethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian for example would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act had you not intervened the ethical breech making the choice to deliberately kill does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys most people instinctively refuse to choose perceiving choosing as being a complicit and unethical act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones who will hypothetically die people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless.The film is handsomely shot but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose? is somewhat tasteless Pakula's delaying of the choice and making it the final solution to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth  that always wins awards Pakula should have reigned her in.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophie's Choice is set in Brooklyn in the late 1940s soon after the end of the Second World War. The three main characters are Stingo a young writer from the Deep South and Nathan and Sophie the couple who befriend him. Nathan is a Jewish New Yorker who tells Stingo that he is a research biologist for a pharmaceutical company. Sophie is a Polish gentile immigrant who has survived imprisonment in Auschwitz by the Nazis. At first the atmosphere is relatively light one of love friendship and fun. This part of the film is shot in brilliant colour in a summer setting and the affluent suburbs of New York seem a safe haven from the horrors of the war that has recently ravaged Europe.Gradually however the tone darkens as we become aware that the gentle beautiful Sophie is hiding a dark secret. We learn that her beloved father was not as she claimed an antiNazi intellectual but was actually a rabid antiSemite and admirer of Nazism whom the Germans murdered by mistake. Nathan originally seems eccentric but vivacious and likable but as the film progresses he begins to show signs of disturbance insulting Stingo whom he has previously treated as a friend and unreasonably suspecting Sophie of being unfaithful to him. We and Stingo learn from Nathan's brother that he is in fact suffering from mental illness and that he is only employed by the pharmaceutical company in a lowly clerical position not as a research scientist although Sophie remains unaware of these facts.In 1982 there had been many films made about the Second World War but relatively few about the Holocaust which seemed to daunt filmmakers by its very enormity. Alan Pakula was therefore breaking new ground particularly as he approached the subject from a controversial angle tackling the question of war guilt not the legal and moral guilt of those who perpetrated the Holocaust but the psychological guilt of those who survived it. After liberation from the camps many survivors such as Sophie experienced feelings of guilt that they had survived whereas many others including friends and family members had died. Sophie's feelings of guilt are exacerbated by her knowledge of her father's odious political views and by the fact that she had attempted to exploit her father's reputation and her fluent knowledge of German in an attempt to ingratiate herself with Rudolf Hoess the commandant of Auschwitz whose secretary she became. Sophie's most agonising secret however is the choice of the film's title the fact that she was forced by a brutal Nazi officer to choose which of her two children should live and which should die. Her love for the Jewish Nathan whom she clings to despite his mistreatment of her may be a way of atoning for her guilt feelings.There are a few weaknesses in the film. During the first half the action can be too slow and Stingo as played by Peter MacNichol seems a fairly weak figure. The scene of his sexual encounter with a girl who talks like a whore and acts like a prude would be funny in a comedy but is out of place in a serious film like this one. Despite these weaknesses however this is a film which more than justifies its ambitious theme. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest film actresses of all time and certainly the best of the early eighties and this is possibly her bestever role. She demonstrated her famed linguistic talents playing the Auschwitz scenes in excellent German and the Englishlanguage scenes with a Polish accent but contrary to what some hostile critics have sometimes claimed there is more to her acting than a collection of foreign accents. One criticism that is sometimes made of Streep is that she is too intellectual an actress selfconsciously thinking her way into a part rather than trying to live it emotionally but in this case at least this seems to be the right approach. It is difficult to see how the Method could cope with a role like Sophie whose emotional experiences are so far beyond those of any actress likely to be called upon to play her. Certainly I found this one of the most affecting performances I have seen. Never can the Best Actress Oscar have been better deserved. Kevin Kline was unlucky not to have been nominated for his part as the tormented and tragic Nathan. This is a dark sombre film but one of high quality and great emotional power. 810".

The setting is postWorld War II late 1940s Brooklyn New York.Meryl Streep is Sophie Zawistowski a Polish immigrant. This is the movie that caused all of us to fall in love with Ms. Streep. Her performance is impeccable. In some scenes she is flawlessly dressed and absolutely beautiful while in others she is completely dehumanized at the hands of the Nazi Germans and yet Meryl Streep is completely convincing throughout the film. Her accent sounds genuine and you feel Sophie's pain throughout the movie.Kevin Kline is Nathan Landau Sophie's mentally unstable boyfriend who meets her in Brooklyn. Kline's performance as the 'Jekyl and Hyde' Nathan is ominously realistic. Peter MacNicol is Stingo a naive young writer from the South who moves into the same building as Sophie and Nathan. Stingo soon learns the secrets Sophie and Nathan have been keeping from each other.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is brilliant especially by Meryl Streep. This movie contains one of the most haunting scenes ever depicted in film history.Sophie's Choice is an excellent film that portrays the suffering many endured during World War II.".

I remember being so moved by Meryl Streep's performance and by the story. I still feel the same urgency to be reminded of the Holocaust. Especially with the horrors and torture still so prevalent we still need to recall what happened not so long ago. Sophie's Choice is still as great as I remember it.

	schema:reviewBody "Meryl Streep has received a number of accolades and awards for her acting over the years possibly the best being that many of the younger actresses have publicly proclaimed Meryl as their role model.  But you need not see any other movie than Sophie's Choice to see why she has been so universally acclaimed.  This is no doubt the best single featured acting by a female in any single movie similar to Robert DeNiro's in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver. Meryl's Sophie is a person who is naive jaded innocent guilt stricken soft and gentle hard as nails loving and giving and both practical and poetic to a fault.  She is a classic tragic figure a lesson in how to deal with the horrors of life and how not to deal with how those horrors haunt you.  She is funny soft and sweet and you want to put your arms around her. Then you realize that underneath that childlike woman is a woman who has given up on childhood.  She is a study in contradictions speaking English German and Polish to survive at all costs.  Then along comes Nathan expertly portrayed by Kevin Kline possibly one of his most challenging and multilayered roles and her life takes another turn.  But we see all this through the wondering innocent eyes of Stingo and the terror love laughs friendship and alienation he experiences we experience.  This is primarily due to a fantastic portrayal of Sophie by Meryl.  And yes the key scene  The Choice of Choices  is possibly the most painful scene ever on film and how Meryl interprets Sophie during this scene is by itself worth an award!  I love this movie.  Someone once saw it for the first time and commented I didn't think I would like it especially because it was such a downer at times.  But it was so good! Excellent summary.".

His switch to a southern drawl the stinging quality of his words amazed me.  I've watched this movie so often I'm about to wear it out.  Also the music is very well done.

Inevitably no one will ever match it but to think Gwyneth Paltrow won the same award for her role in Shakespeare in Love is laughable.Kevin Kline is brilliant as the chilling yet endearing Nathan whilst Peter MacNicol is the character whose superb narration and acting transmits us into the movie.I noticed that the morose Pauline Kael the most ludicrously overrespected film critic of all time once again shows her cynicism in finding much fault with the movie I will have none of it it is utterly moving without having to resort to clich or overloud haunting music to influence our emotions. Quite simply the subject matter  Sophie's tragic life and inability to come to terms with what has happened to her  is enough to do this on its own.The final frame is to me perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen and the film will stay with the viewer long after.".

And only those who REALLY know Jewish culture  and very few nonJews do  will be able to refute all the 'evidence'. Now if you forget about content and purely look at the buildup of this documentary one has to say that is a brilliantly executed piece of propaganda that is a warning to everyone who relies on their own media to tell them the truth. Statecontrolled television only tells you what they want you to know and it can fill you with lies. The use of color the use of socalled stockfootage the use of ghettoJews  who were forced to or tricked into taking part in this movie the buildup of evidence culminating in the truly atrocious and sickening footage of cattle being slaughtered 'in the Jewish tradition'. These are the images that remain with you long after the movie has finished. And after this we hear Hitlers famous speech in which he first talks about 'die Vernichtung des Judischen Rasse in Europa'! Probably the most powerful propagandafilm ever made extremely wellmade but it is a bunch of lies. My grade is based simply on the technical credits of this 'documentary' not on its content.

This movie is in German and I am not aware of a subtitled version in English and even the German version needs technical improvement to be comprehensible.This is a historical document no doubt. It is not a document of the Jews of the time but of the producers and the powers to be of that time. As such it is more than a tad enlightening.The Nazis were masters at massmanipulation without so much as an agenda but when they latched onto something they sure wouldn't let go. It seems almost by chance that the Jews became victims of their bizarre ideology but then antisemitism had quite a breeding gound in Eastern Europe for half a decade before Hitler's time.What makes this movie so chilling is that it does have an emotional impact on you  whether you like it or not. When the movie goes to ridicule Einstein as a Zionist which he never was I was almost taken by it.This movie is dangerous. It is the quintessential counterpart to the 'Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' a booknovel produced apparently in Russia at a time beforehand to discredit the Jew. It is evil propaganda at its best.Its not Hollywood its bad quality its German only although I understand a subtitled DVD copy will enter circulation but when you hear Hitler end his Reichstagssitzung with the words that 'if Jewry will not join civilized nations instead of bringing about WW II they will be exterminated' you sure know which way the wind blows.Wait for the subtitled copy if you don't speak German and wait to see hatred insanity and bizarre politpropaganda come to life. This movie is intense some truly disturbing scenes but much more at what it says about the unfocused ideology of the holocaust than any statement it might make about Jewish lifestyle tradition and culture.".

Objectively speaking the pictures have been so well selected as to fit perfectly to the text and thereby the massage of this movie. F.ex. we see only GhettoJews living in dwellings full of cockroaches Jews who are trying to cheat their Christian neighbors Jews who proliferate like rats. So also the famous comparison of the Jews and the rats is already prepared and does not seem to be lugged in. The migrations charts of the Jews on the one side and of the rats on the other side are based on a scientific technique that is still in use f.ex. the expansion of certain marine animals which have been brought to foreign continents by early oceancrossing ships hence allowing to conclude the ways of the latter ones and so the earliest settlings e.g. in America. So every single detail in this movie is correct  in the pictures as well as in the commentaries to the pictures but the neutral watcher has no chance to decide if the mappings of the pictures to the texts resp. vice versa are correct too. And here we have reached the most important question concerning all documentarylike made propaganda movies incl. Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico! !!

From logic we know that from a false conclusion everything can follows  true as well as false sentences.

Bytwerk argues that the propaganda machinery focused on the idea of making Jews seem so wretched disgusting and hateful that they would appear to be beings simply not worth caring about. This film it seems to me takes that as its motivation.There is one interesting moment that hurts the filmmakers' cause the camera panning over the crowds in the ghetto when a group of Jewish youngsters are shown plainly trying to look over one another's shoulders and heads grinning at the camera.

Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed. The weakest link in the film's logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of Well Jewish people are like that too. Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad. The film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as lightskinned Europeans thereby the text admits that socalled Hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture. It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roachinfested filth despite the supposed treasure they've hoarded and then flipflops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto. Incidentally who wouldn't? The use of scenes from a wellknown American film House of Rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic. First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the Rothschild character's spin is that Jews are taxed excessively finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account. This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching. For all of Eternal Jew's imperfections I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a 5 to date. I'd say the reason is that EJ's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence. Needless to say the film's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandist's tool. About this time I should expect director Hippler to flipflop once again springing forward to say That's what I meant to do all along! The scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of Kosher law to prevent animal suffering. I would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate.".

The design of the perfect electric chair does not leave me standing in awe it makes me cry. I give this film only 1 star out of moral reasons. No achievement in any other category can make me spend even a second one. I hereby state that I really meant what is stated above so I have enough lines to make this review valid for IMDb.".

The first time I saw this film was in 1984 on tv and with a much shorter version than the one released in England in 2002 which is the full 300plus minute original.That day I was scared really scared watching the scene where Alexander is been helped to let out his most evil thoughts by Ishmael a completely mysterious character with supernatural insight. And then a blackout. You can imagine if I was truly scared this left me breathless.Then almost twenty years passed until I found this remarkable jewel in its full version perfectly digitised and audioenhanced in dvd. I bought a dlp projector and used a previewing room to show it to my students. I didn't know what was going to happen. But that doubt was worth the waiting.I think it's very difficult to say any other thing than breathtaking to underline what this film accomplishes. It's the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful beautiful fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration like. Yes but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details not a Bergman's new to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot! forget about whole scenes!The troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension pure fun or pleasure with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye trained to see what most disregard as common finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.When the maxim of making every frame a Rembrandt comes to my mind this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further he gives or I'd rather say Nyvqyst the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. Think the kids playing at the nursery the housemaidens sewing socks the meadow and the boat the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother.And a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander's Bertil Guve when he was twelvethirteen enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any bigtheatrerole actor.Superb. Don't think you've seen the whole thing until you get the 5  hour fullstory.".

It's the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful beautiful fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration like. Yes but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details not a Bergman's new to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot! forget about whole scenes!The troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension pure fun or pleasure with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye trained to see what most disregard as common finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.When the maxim of making every frame a Rembrandt comes to my mind this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further he gives or I'd rather say Nyvqyst the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. Think the kids playing at the nursery the housemaidens sewing socks the meadow and the boat the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother.And a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander's Bertil Guve when he was twelvethirteen enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any bigtheatrerole actor.Superb. Don't think you've seen the whole thing until you get the 5  hour fullstory.";

	schema:headline " Bergman's ultimate best";
	schema:reviewBody "Swedish director Ingmar Bergman has a reputation for dark intellectual and introspective dramas which is only partly justified because many of his early movies were rather lighthearted. Here is the longest movie he did three hours and the theatrical version is only half of the original which was twice as long. But length should not stop you from watching this jewel of a film which is both complex and accessible. After all Gone with the Wind is just as long.Fanny and Alexander isn't exactly a family movie but it is a movie about family. Family seen in all its different facets through the eyes of two children. The film is divided into three very different parts each of them showing a different aspect of family life. It is set in Uppsala Sweden Bergman's native city at the turn of the twentieth century. The story begins on Christmas Eve and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexanders family seems a happy one actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmother's heavilyfurnished house the atmosphere is joyful at first glance especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The children's father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manicdepressive and the other is a skirtchaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker played by Erland Josephson a Bergman regular that has lasted for many years.The children's world collapse as their father dies. Soon after their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop whose name is Vergerus that's the name of the villain in all Bergman's movies don't ask me why. The atmosphere in the bishop's house could not be more different from the children's first home. It is bare silent freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the children's mother is pregnant she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandma's Jewish friend who is also sort of a magician manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion the role is played by a woman. From then on reality and fantasy get blurred but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate and the children's mother finally makes it back to her former home. The film ends as it began with a party. Two new babies are just born  the mother's baby she had from the wicked bishop and the maid's baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian openmindedness in 1900 illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards.Despite the title attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements more than any other Bergman and if so Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergman's father happened to be a minister and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus it is quite possible that Alexander's step family is a representation of Bergman's real family while Alexander's real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergman's renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergman's first color movies had nothing special until Cries and whispers where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in Fanny and Alexander and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmother's colorful home and the bishop's house which is mostly all black and white. There are many characters in this story and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties especially well remembered as the whimsical Monika. Here she is ungratefully cast as the bishop's elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid she is played Pernilla Wallgren who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in The best intentions directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...".

	schema:headline " review of the 5hour cut A total unabashed work of art that you'll love or hate. I loved it and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see";
	schema:reviewBody "As Ingmar Bergman's swan song which wasn't necessarily the case once After the Rehearsal and the recent Saraband were released Fanny and Alexander was a film I saw many months ago in its truncated 3hour version. I knew I had witnessed something special something lifeaffirming and above all a work that contained enough poetry passion and humanity for two movies. But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there. So once the complete TV version was released as with Scenes from a Marriage I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety. Broken up here into 5 Acts Bergman takes another semiautobiographical approach to his storytelling and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family the Ekdahls comprising of Oscar and Emilie the parents Fanny and Alexander the kids Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf brothers of Oscar Helena Alma Lydia and also the housemaid Maj who own a theater company.What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts with story and characters each sharply defined. The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering. A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner. This scene involving more or less two dozen people is sometimes very funny sometimes a little unnerving and towards the end depressing. But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors despite it taking place in 1907 you can see these people in modern settings just as easily. There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep in which he tells them a story which ranks as one of the more memorable touching scenes of the film  from here we can understand how this brings to Alexander Bertil Guve in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of childhood to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture.Then the second and third acts come around and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film much less from Bergman. It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness and passes away. From here Emilie Ewa Frling a performance meant for Liv Ullman which she fits just as well tries to go on as usual and it just doesn't feel the same. She seeks counsel from the village bishop Edvard Vergerus Jan Malmsjo previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage and subsequently falls in love with him or at least thinks she does. They get married and the children are forced into leaving almost everything behind to live at his dreary caged residence a far cry from where they once lived a place lush with colors and life in the rooms. Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team and the foundations of how these two including as well the theater display how periodperfect some of this can be.The last two acts are when things get rough which is a standard Bergman is known for. This kind of standard if I could call it such includes his personal connection to the Christian church in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest. I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life and I really don't want to either. One of the things I loved about the film than some likely hated on it's original release I know for example that my father was devastated after watching this film is how the good and the bad or what could be seen as good and bad are paired off and how the middleground is just as clear or unclear. Emilie is a good person wanting the best for her children and for herself but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband who appears sometimes to Alexander which is another matter. Alexander who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not. The Bishop on the other hand is one who as he says at one point has only one mask. His is a puritanical approach who sees imagination in only one strict aspect and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people. Veregus along with his family that live in fear and suffering Harriet Andersson's character and with the character of the heavy ill aunt know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived. What ends up happening even from the getgo of the third act in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess. Bottom line this character whether you like the film or not is one of Bergman's greatest creations and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy disturbing perfection it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of right up there with Nurse Ratched HAL 9000 and Darth Vader.But what torment and anguish the characters as well as much of the audience seem to endure in the fourthfifth acts there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment. A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop for example display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney. And a particular long soliloquy by Isak Erland Josephsson not underused at all to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century. As the catharsis comes it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have. With the fates of the Bishop Emilie and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close as with the Grandmother the uncles and aunts and so on it's all very symbolic metaphorical and real and it gels together.One last note Sven Nykvist who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams. When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark with the subtlety and nuance it's all the better. To put this all in another way I could go on and on about this huge heartrendering work but it all comes down to this as an emotional intellectual and spiritual surprisingly for me who sees religion as a kind of fantasy sort of filmviewing experience Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had. Some may feel the same some may want to forget they ever experienced it. But one thing the film does is stick with you if only for a little while and that's really what a film can and should do....by the way the 5hour version at least in America is only available on a highpriced special edition DVD pack from Criterion but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film it makes for a great holiday gift.

The development of the storyline is superbly handled in an absorbing and coherent manner manifesting the great empathy between director and actors.

I realize when it was made Bergman had been around for a long time and had his own clout but it still has too much of a philosophical slant to be mainstream here. This film is amazing. The first hour moves at a slow pace but it really sets up the rest of the movie well and then it really picks up. The cinematography is breathtaking and while this story makes you think a lot you don't feel ambivalent towards the characters through the rest of the first film after having been slowly introduced to all the characters you have a certain identifcation that is purely emotional and blends wonderfully with the other aspects of the film. It's truly great and should be considered one of Bergman's best works.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fanny and Alexander isn't utterly terrible. I enjoined parts of the film very much and thought I'd gotten the hang of it on several occasions. However the film has several peculiarities that make me question Bergmans talent for composing a unity. The whole film seems to be merely a series of loosely connected scenes. Is Bergmans ambition to make a realistic portrayal of the times the beginning a lascivious farce the erotic adventures of Gustav Adolf an artistic endeavour to portray children's odd fantasies and views of the illogical adult world the end? For me Bergman seems to fail completely in composing a cohesive film.The big interest in the film lies on the personalities of the characters and Bergman does succeed in portraying the bigger part of them credibly Alexander Carl Oscar the bishop. However illogical characteristics of other characters make me doubt Bergmans understanding of the human nature. For example Gustavs wife lets Gustav play around with other women without feeling jealousy. This could work if only the film in the whole would aim on being a farce or allegory of sexual oppression of women. In the context of the rest of the film however these details spoil the credibility of the film as a character study.In the case of the bishop Bergman seems to rely on insufficient reasons for making him appear as such a beast of a man. Why does Emelie suddenly start hating her husband so passionately? He is slimy and idealistic but nonetheless the same man with whom she originally fell in love. Bergman doesn't motivate these feelings and for me paradoxically the bishop appears to be the true victim  haunted by an ignorant director. As far as the bishop's injustice is concerned I take it that spanking wasn't uncommon in those days. Nevertheless Emilies hate becomes known already before the punishing.Also I couldn't really comprehend the poetic and incredible ending. Later I read on the internet how to interpret the scene where Isak comes to save the children. Putting this scene in the context of the rather realistic earlier parts of the film it seems to me farfetched that Isak should have conjured the children in the chest invisible and at the same time made their bodies show up in their room to convince the bishop he wasn't taking them anywhere.Considering these confusing aspects of the film I wonder how much was cut from the original fivehour film. On the other hand it is selfevident that skillful cutting and planning plays an important part when rating a film. Fanny and Alexander should be understandable without having to see any edited scenes. Regardless of what is said above I refuse to believe that the whole filmloving world could have been fooled to like Fanny and Alexander. I must have missed the point somewhere on the way. Maybe the film needs a second chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I have disliked Bergman's earlier films and thought they were by far too overrated that did not apply to this film. I saw the director'scut version over five hours. A little long yes and there is not much music but it's not slow like Tarkovsky's films can be. The opening is great and the first act the first one and a half hour was the part I liked the very most. The realism is utter so is the casting the best acting I have seen in a Swedish film it's amazing. I can't complain about any actor they were all extremely good. So is the dialog. Alexander had a typical upper class look so did his grandmother who looked extremely fresh and healthy and beautiful for her age. All together the language and milieus are very credible. No overcolorful costumes and silly dialogs that is such a frequent element nowadays in historical plays especially from America. Bergman succeeds to capture the customs and behavior that were used and to some extent still is used within the Swedish upper class as well as general Swedish customs and behavior. I know this because I am familiar with it and have partly experienced it myself. The result is sometimes amazing. Bergman succeeds to capture the atmosphere of the old times through language and decoration. The photo is at time dazzling some scenes are identical to 19th century Swedish painting and I get the thought that Bergman turned to these in search for the right setting of the film.Unlike early works by Bergman which tend to be somewhat theatrical the keyword here is realism which I appreciate greatly. The actors manage like I said to speak and play in a way that I feel was customary at that period of time. It might be too much to claim this work to be a Swedish Tarkovsky film but I sensed it had some philosophical material and it is definitely thoughtful. Otherwise I think it is worth watching for the acting and dialog alone.One of the best Swedish films ever made and Bergman's best in my opinion. 910".

Because of this I never felt like I knew him as a character or the nature of his relationship with the father before he died ... as a result Alexander's pain and preoccupation with deathghostsvisions never felt earned and just seemed contrived and out of place.The first act reminded of the first third of the Deer Hunter where it's sort of a panoramic portrait of a closeknit group of people  this was interesting to me and I enjoyed the interaction between many of the characters ... but these relationships become minor subplots of little consequence or are left by the wayside altogether. So it's kind of like what's the point of introducing these narrative strands if they are not going to be developed any further? Basically the film felt like Bergman had bitten off more than he could chew and wanted to throw everything he could into this story of a family which was intended as his swan song with several narrative strands that lack pay off or development  they're of little consequence and end up distracting from the subsequent focus of the narrative the mother's marriage to the bishop.The second act of the film was the most compelling for me the conflict between the bishop and Alexander ... but this shift of focus was jarring because after the first act I felt like we get very little of the rest of the family. It's as if Bergman really didn't know what he wanted this movie to be a tapestry of a family that chronicles each member a coming of age story focusing on the child a smaller domestic melodrama with an authoritarian bishop parental figure ...Overall I suppose my main problem with the film was how Bergman chose to structure the narrative which I felt was too broadly outlined ... which resulted in something very bloated and ponderous.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the most impressive feature of this wonderful film is the humility with which its creator presents it to the world as if it were no grander than the oldfashioned Nativityplay shown in the early scenes at the Theatre.     At the end of this experience  to term it with any mere technical tag like 'movie' would be inadequate  Bergman's profoundly grownup disillusionment has transformed into the pure spirituality of abnegation and acceptance. His intellectual pilgrimage through possibly the greatest career in films finds the director arriving back where he began with the great simplicities of life. But there is a difference with his return which is that his prodigality over the years has burnt the rage out of him and finally allowed him to 'enjoy what may be enjoyed' as one of the Ekdahls says without further fretting over the puzzle of human existence. From all this human folly he clearly feels comes the only wisdom which is  simply  to be human.     It is indeed a film like no other for allowing the pieces of experience to settle into their appointed places. There is a beautiful quality of selfless resignation in this last of his works for cinema which finally and forever excels the sadistic disciplines of The Bishop.     This perverted creature confesses to the new wife whom he has lost how it is impossible to 'tear off the mask' as it is 'burned into my face' He is become an authoritarian '... a rite a law a custom  not a man'. Shelley Having put the notional love of God before that of humankind there is nowhere for his personality to be reenacted in the bosom of any kindly recollections that will survive him. Except in that of AlexanderBergman where his two eachintheirownway terrifying fathers both the White and the Black opposites of an imagination flickering with the director's haunted vision will project forever onto his Cinematic arena of stark absolutes the inner strife where each of us is locked away struggling to endure the turmoil of these eternally irreconcilable truths.     The White Knight and The Black Bishop These are phantom moves in our great game with Death and pieces that will be returned into play for as long as humanity continues. How like Chess Life is Just a game we play with arbitrary rules and yet whose progress is of supreme and abiding concern to each and every one of us.     This great work is a monument to play in all its senses not least the play of light and the play of ideas both equally insubstantial and yet the essence of reality eloquent as the silence of a great roofless Cathedral. Out of the Ruin of Faith Bergman has wrought a Peace that passeth understanding. And it is in this ultimate bypassing of the relentless structures of intellect that Bergman finally achieves the resolution of his productive neuroses in a truly magical film whose every phase is as inevitable as breathing or the changeable and unimpeded weather.     As the grandmother reflects. at last 'I don't want to put Life together anymore. I just leave it broken. Strangely it seems better that way.'     Death in the end is not a calamity but the choice of all who have truly known Life. In other words to choose Life is to accept its Dark partner Death. And to accept each as part of the family group even though they seem complete misfits there.     The old lady with Strindberg's Dreamplay in her lap knows at last that the whole history of her family is only a personal reverie. And yet how much more real it seems than her son Carl's immature and somewhat absurd angstridden railings against 'cruel Fate'!     Had he only accepted his patient wife's gently sympathetic injunction to 'Never mind' the Professor would have been both wiser and happier enduring with patient fortitude the oceanic inconsequentialities of life's real Mystery and attending far less to the trivial pseudomysteries of his solipsistic men's club. All his morbid rationalising is precisely as much use in real life as the usual state of alcoholic befuddlement which is the only serious pursuit of this club.      Reason as befuddlement The sleep of reason as deliverance. With saintlike humility Bergman gives us back our ordinary human life as he surrenders his exceptional life in films. But he knows that the ghost of this life will always be with us. His anguished worldliness will haunt us  as the Ghost of Hamlet's father must haunt Alexander  forever.".

Except in that of AlexanderBergman where his two eachintheirownway terrifying fathers both the White and the Black opposites of an imagination flickering with the director's haunted vision will project forever onto his Cinematic arena of stark absolutes the inner strife where each of us is locked away struggling to endure the turmoil of these eternally irreconcilable truths.     The White Knight and The Black Bishop These are phantom moves in our great game with Death and pieces that will be returned into play for as long as humanity continues. How like Chess Life is Just a game we play with arbitrary rules and yet whose progress is of supreme and abiding concern to each and every one of us.     This great work is a monument to play in all its senses not least the play of light and the play of ideas both equally insubstantial and yet the essence of reality eloquent as the silence of a great roofless Cathedral. Out of the Ruin of Faith Bergman has wrought a Peace that passeth understanding. And it is in this ultimate bypassing of the relentless structures of intellect that Bergman finally achieves the resolution of his productive neuroses in a truly magical film whose every phase is as inevitable as breathing or the changeable and unimpeded weather.     As the grandmother reflects. at last 'I don't want to put Life together anymore. I just leave it broken. Strangely it seems better that way.'     Death in the end is not a calamity but the choice of all who have truly known Life. In other words to choose Life is to accept its Dark partner Death. And to accept each as part of the family group even though they seem complete misfits there.     The old lady with Strindberg's Dreamplay in her lap knows at last that the whole history of her family is only a personal reverie. And yet how much more real it seems than her son Carl's immature and somewhat absurd angstridden railings against 'cruel Fate'!     Had he only accepted his patient wife's gently sympathetic injunction to 'Never mind' the Professor would have been both wiser and happier enduring with patient fortitude the oceanic inconsequentialities of life's real Mystery and attending far less to the trivial pseudomysteries of his solipsistic men's club. All his morbid rationalising is precisely as much use in real life as the usual state of alcoholic befuddlement which is the only serious pursuit of this club.      Reason as befuddlement The sleep of reason as deliverance. With saintlike humility Bergman gives us back our ordinary human life as he surrenders his exceptional life in films. But he knows that the ghost of this life will always be with us. His anguished worldliness will haunt us  as the Ghost of Hamlet's father must haunt Alexander  forever.";

	schema:headline " An Ingmar Bergman Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!";
	schema:reviewBody "There are so many things I want to say about this film that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying that this has been the shortest 5 hours I've spent watching a film. At first I had planned to watch it in parts as the film is divided in acts but I was so instantly taken engrossed and fascinated that I just felt like watching the whole thing in one sitting. I know that a 5hour long film can sound very intimidating and exhausting but the film is specifically divided in 5 distinguishable acts that make it more digestible and believe me it's so absorbing that you will barely notice you spent all that time watching it it's that good. I've skimmed through the 3hour theatrical version and while it is a great film some of my favorite parts are either shortened or completely cut from the film which for me lessens the impact the whole 5hour extended TV version has. Both versions work of course but if you want to get a greater understanding of Bergman's vision I totally recommend the extended version.Now onto the film itself. What can I say? It's magnificent. A grand rich and glorious tapestry of life family love hate imagination art fantasy reality religion magic death faith spirituality God despair redemption youth innocence maturity old age and the supernatural. Fanny and Alexander is all of these things and even more. I don't want to go into much plot detail but point out what I liked so much about the film by mentioning some of my favorite scenes and commenting on them. And in this film there are plenty. Rarely I've felt the sense of familial warmth and love in a film or elsewhere as I have with Fanny and Alexander. The first act shows us a Christmas dinner family celebration and it is instantly intoxicating and beguiling and you're instantly drawn to these flawedyetloving and caring characters that constitute this large happy family and Bergman's direction is so vivid that you totally feel the joy in sharing and the affection and love. One of my favorite scenes in this part is Oscar's the family patriarch and owner of the family theater heartfelt and candid speech about the importance of the theater this little world as it is referred to and how art can reflect the big world and help us have a greater endurance during bad times. This theme is more thoroughly explored in an enchanting and beautiful scene in which Oscar explains to Fanny and Alexander through the simple story of a chair how art is connected to life how important and essential art is in enriching our lives helping us have a deeper awareness and appreciation of the world at large and how there is more to what meets the eye an inner life lying underneath the surface of things. Bergman was raised within a very strict and oppressive family and I'm pretty sure that the Ekdahls is the kind of family Loving supportive encouraging freethinkers he would've liked to be raised in. I echo his likely sentiment. Likewise if I got a profound sense of love and family in the first act when tragedy strikes in the second act I got a great sense of suffering and despair. One of the most strikingly moving scenes in the film involves Oscar's wife Emilie giving these primal animal cries of grief over her dead husband the scene is simply heartwrenching. Similarly engrossing is the open and penetrating conversation between Emilie and the bishop about her faith and her spiritual confusion and longing. But in the third and fourth acts is when the characters' resilience are really put to the test. None of the pain humiliation and the frailty of the human heart throughout the film is better illustrated in a scene of tremendous impact in which Alexander is severely punished by the bishop and Fanny has no other option but to stand and watch as her brother is being physically abused only moments later to see her defiantly turn down the bishop's affections. Another favorite scene during this act is Helena's  the family matriarch  beautiful and eloquent soliloquy to her son Oscar about the joys and pains in life the futility of fighting against its forces and just living it as it comes. It is what it is. Another standout is Isak Jacobi's a family friend and magician metaphorical story that encapsulates the importance and at the same time the futility of searching for meaning in life. Some of the film's most intriguing revealing and fantastical moments are in this act. In what's probably the greatest moment in a film full of great moments is Alexander's encounter with a mysterious character named Ismael. I think this scene is the climax of the film as it brings closure to Alexander's arch. There's also a deep sense of the supernatural as it is suggested that everything fantasy and reality the logical and unexplainable the material and the ethereal the good and even the bad is a manifestation of God. I feel that with those statements Bergman is telling us that he probably managed to finally exorcise the demons that had been haunting him throughout his life or at least come to terms with them as his on screen alter ego Alexander has as well. All of this told detailed and presented with the skill of a master storyteller.I was fully enraptured by this film. I love the way it beautifully conveyed the relevance of art and imagination and how they're actually essential for humanity. I loved how it showed life in all its joyful fantastical realistic tragic resigned and ultimately hopeful glory. I loved its sense of completeness yet also leaving the viewer with an air of mystery that implies the endless possibilities of life. A masterpiece and easily one of my favorite films ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Ingmar Bergman's semiautobiographical Life and Times of wealthy theater family Ekdahl in 1907 Uppsala mainly told from the eyes of young Alexander as his mother is widowed remarries a harsh bishop and moves into his church estate with both the children. A fairly gripping saga gorgeously photographed and sumptuously produced with marvelous performances from Malmsj and Wllgren... but mostly a more artistic gem to admirably behold rather than be moved by and involved in. Considered a masterpiece by many not by me. Why?Well I caught the 188 min' version and many bits  although enjoyable on their own such as Kulle's monologues and erotic shenanigans  seem to be from completely different films altogether in tone patched up to a big quilt with unfitting seams in contrasting the children's ghastly torment of their stepfather Alexander's headtohead battles of will with him IS a highlight with the unrelated more easygoing content from the family's head estate. The relatives fates from the first act are unresolved and completely detached from the remaining main story Emilie her failed remarriage and the children's struggle. They all honestly don't evoke terribly much emotional sympathy because we don't really get to know them for example Alexander misses his dead father and hates his stepfather... and that's basically all. And we also really have no other sign of the family's togetherness than their spoken confirmations which contribute to this film's most disjointed highly inconsistent feel with quite a few leaps in the storyline. Perhaps the TVseries version is more cohesive?Bergman's love for the theater is of course ubiquitous both in establishing the family's relation to it as well as much of the overly theatrical actingline delivery heavily metaphysical  religious symbolism and solemn theme presentation with a nod to August Strindberg at the end. That style blend is of course a matter of preference and I'm not a huge fan of it presented this way NOTE this is my third Bergman altogether. And one major question truly arises where the hell is Fanny in this movie? A character with her name in the title has no impact on anything whatsoever in a story spanning 3 hours... how can that be? 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe".

	schema:headline " A true masterpiece of epic proportions with stunning cinematography and sumptuous set";
	schema:reviewBody "We are introduced to a large welltodo family as seen through the eyes of young Alexander Helena Ekdahl his regallylooking grandmother and matriarch who tries to keep the family together his uncles philandering Gustav Adolf and Carl who continually has financial problems. Then Alexander's younger sister Fanny and their father Oscar and mother Emilie. Both their parents are actors and some of the other family members too whilst Oscar also works as director of the acting company. A large and generally happy family as we see in hauntingly beautifully filmed Christmas scenes.Things change for the worse when Oscar suffers a stroke and passes away. Emilie manages the performing company for a year and then decides to withdraw from it. She is lonely and falls in love with the local bishop Edvard who conducted Oscar's funeral service. They get married and she moves to his household with the kids. They were in for a rude shock. They had to leave everything 'worldly' behind no toys their beloved books or fancy clothes. The contrast with their previous lavish and luxury lifestyle and their new life behind cold unadorned thick walls with bars in front of the windows couldn't be more pronounced. In their new and austere depressing household they had to follow strict new rules something the kids were never subjected to. Furthermore they had to share the house with Edvard's vicious spinster sister meddling mother and bedridden aunt. Alexander has a lively imagination and sometimes makes up stories or tells fibs. He has a rebellious streak too and clashes with his stepfather. As a result he is caned and locked up alone in the cold attic. It seems as if Emilie is powerless not knowing what to do to help the kids entranced by the charismatic Edvard.The grandmother comes to learn of the kids' hardships that they were practically being held prison and decides to do something about it. But it is not going to be easy the bishop is a very powerful and influential man... I watched the full uncut and original version part of the excellent 'The Criterion Collection' nearly 5 hours long. I also have the shorter theatrical version but will leave that for another day. It's length did not bother me in the least and that should be a good indication of the quality of the film.The wonderful cinematography music score lavish sets and costumes are all out of this world. And particularly so the outstanding cast. All the actors were excellent but mention must be made of the remarkable performances of Ewa Frhling Emilie Gun Wllgren the grandmother and Bertil Guve Alexander. And then the clever storyline fluctuating between the real world and the acted world the makebelieve world. On a flimsy framework of reality the imagination spins weaving new patterns.In my view 'Fanny and Alexander' is one of the best films I have ever seen. 1010.".

Of course the tape was so worn from multiple viewings that by the time I got round to it I couldn't watch it properly. It took me a couple of years before I finally saw it in a cinema and I came outside just reeling. Now more than ten years later having grown familiar with the TV version as well I am still in awe.This week I am watching the TV version on my Criterion DVD one episode at a time. The Prologue alone just blew me away. Visually it is as precise and complete as it gets I wouldn't hesitate to say it touches perfection. I find it so powerful in the way it treats its themes  most notably the power of imagination in childhood  that most scenes have become an archetype in my personal visual vocabulary. I think that's the mark of truly great art. My first love and I lost touch long ago I could never thank him enough for handing me this treasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely detest making distinctions like this but I would rate this the best movie of all time purely on the way it affected me. Viewing this film for the first time left me with the feeling that I would never again experience the world in quite the same way. The second time only deepened my appreciation for the simplicity of the story and the depth and precision of every detail. The third time I viewed the five hour Swedish Television version and realized that I was watching the equivalent of a Tolstoy novel on film. The highest compliment I can pay to this movie is that in being a child of the eighties an adolescent and young adult in the 90's and well now venturing towards middle age in this young century few works of media or art escape my mind's deconstruction of them or my generation's greatest blessing or greatest curse a very well developed sense of irony. Fanny and Alexander along with a few of Bergman's other films including 'The Virgin Spring and Wild Strawberries is the exception to this rule. There is no way to simply break down how Bergman casts the spell he does. His work gathers you in completely envelopes you and at the same time is utterly impenetrable to any form of rational criticism. In the end you are left with a pure emotional response to what you just experienced with little idea of how Bergman took you to that place. You believe television media advertising the constant bombardment of images into your brain has desensitized you to pain agony regret violence disappointment dreams longings and questions of God and death and then Bergman gets a hold of you. I can only say this work is what one would call truly spiritual art and Bergman's films are the only place I have ever experienced this phenomena.If cinema is the closest we have to a truly magical experience then Bergman is and perhaps forever will be the greatest magician of them all. Fanny and Alexander should be preserved along with the works of the greatest masters of art in any medium. Every time I see this film no matter what state of mind I'm in it somehow makes me fall in love with movies and life all over again.Thank you Mr. Bergman for spending your life sharing your dreams visions and nightmares with us. You have made this world an infinitely richer place for your efforts.".

It contains so many moments of sheer emotion my favourites being the confrontation between the two brothers and the bishop the appearance of God and the father to the boy and the end scene. A great deal of symbolism peppers the film and Bergman takes hold of the material with such expertise that one cannot turn away at any point. This film is a real treasure and I advise anyone to watch it and love it as the latter comes very easily. I know that Bergman has a reputation for being heavy handed is this a crime? but this film is a lyrical song to the family and should be compulsive viewing. The fact that this film is over four hours is irrelevant as this is often the first thing people comment on when the title is mentioned. Go and see this film today as it is quite remarkable.".

And to admire.I like it that it's a little loopy and fantastic which usually turns me off completely in movies and literature because when the creator trots out fantastic elements I almost always feel like they're over reaching and could have used ordinary life as a vehicle of expression but are too lazy. It's like they want to underline it big idea folks! Don't miss it. IB takes a bunch of schlocky devices and proves that in the right hands they all can work the imagining of the fire for instance or the stark face off of good and evil or the dangerous homosexual the heavy handed symbolism the play within a play. All corny elements we've seen too much of but fresh and compelling in this picture even after 25 years. In fact I was reminded again and again of my childhood and how I had first encountered many ideas. What did I think of Hamlet when I was forced to read it in the 7th grade? What did I think about life when I was forced to confront it with my developing brain? Have I lived up to my ideals? The best movies change you. This one has certainly given my a new standard for domestic beauty. I'm going to put a little lace on my sideboard today and cut some flowers. My little world.".

Or perhaps he was feeling bored one day and decided to make a movie about......himself.Wang Lee Hom writes directs and stars in what is easily a glorified fanfiction about himself. Lee plays Du Ming Han pop idol extraordinaire with an over active imagination and adored by millions. Along with his loyal manager Joan played by actress....JOAN Chen everyday is a routine of performances evading the paparazzi through the use of disguises and partying at night with his bandmates. One night after giving the Press the slip Ming's posh Van literally runs into a female music student named Song Xiao Qing.

Perhaps exploring the different types of love that need not be just romantic love or expounding on how a Soul Mate might be more of a metaphysical connection than a merely emotional one. Instead after a small tease the narrative conveniently lumps romantic partner and soulmate together again and we are back in clich land.As much as Clark Kent's glasses is an absurdly thin disguise for Superman so is Du Ming Han's disguise in this film. That same thinness translates to the plot the characters and even the dialog. Love In Disguise feels like a lazy vanity affair. A self promoting tale of a musical Mary Sue that offers nothing new to the genre not even some new laughs.".

Lee plays Du Ming Han pop idol extraordinaire with an over active imagination and adored by millions. Along with his loyal manager Joan played by actress....JOAN Chen everyday is a routine of performances evading the paparazzi through the use of disguises and partying at night with his bandmates.

But that's something for the final act. Instead he has to grapple with snooty senior classical music students such as Mufan Qiao Zhenyu who lambasts manufactured pop idols like DMH and worse to know that the object of his desireinspiration turns out to be infatuated with Mufan. Even then DMH himself thinks Xiao Qing is just his aural soulmate meant to stimulate his senses and nothing more until the inevitable flying of sparks where what's love gets to be quite messy in its revelation before a climax that ended up with Song Qing being wet from head to toe. I kid you not.As with all stories about disguises and secret identities there is bound to be a scene where the two personas have to meet at a single venue and it's no surprise that a rookie like Lee Hom will opt for the same having this scene played out purely for laughs. You may think I am making fun of his story but fair enough there were some nice touches from animation to comedy that the best were reserved to scenes where the directoractor goes into self deprecating mode showing he's not shy to laugh at himself and the crazy world he lives in where every move he makes is subject to scrutiny by his manager fans and the media. Perhaps this film served as a pressure cooker release for him to let out some steam.Liu Yifei on the other hand had scenes crafted for her to reprise her look and feel for the Little Dragon Girl role from television and with films like The Forbidden Kingdom this marks one of the first few forays she's taking to make the leap to the big screen. She may lack behind other contemporaries from the Mainland like Zhang Jingchu or Xu Jinglei but I'm hedging my bets that she'll grow from strength to strength and we should see a more active filmography soon enough. Should anyone think of remaking A Chinese Ghost Story she'll be an automatic shooin as Xiao Qian.Love in Disguise isn't as bad as what others may have made it out to be the disaster it is not. Despite its formula it still has enough to market itself as a romantic comedy suitable as a safe option for dating couples. And of course Wang LeeHom fans who should be making a beeline to support their idol's latest effort on celluloid both as an actor and more importantly directing a film that's an exaggerated mirror of his idol lifestyle.

With a running time of slightly over a hour and a half. Everything is just so darn predictable generic and clich. The lead actor who is also the director of this movie. Is likable and it does have one or two cute moments. Plus it has Crystal Liu Yifei as the lead actress. But it mostly only focuses in on the lead actor and is just so darn boring. This movie overall is just barely bearable. The development and build up is so poorly done I just didn't care what happens next. There is simply hardly any chemistry between the two lead characters. Plus nothing about this movie is believable and just comes off overly cheesy and silly. Yes movies doesn't necessarily have to be believable to be good. But this one takes it to another level for even a comedic romance movie. I can see why this movie might have been a slight hit in China. But it's just almost everything wrong with romance movies even when it comes to teenage comedic romance movies. The acting is bad and bland even laughable for all the wrong reasons. You know those fictional fantasy romance stuff youngsters write up for fun? Well picture it in a movie form except way way way more generic clich predictable and boring and that sums up this movie. Also the modern pop music is mostly awful in this. Wang LeeHom who is the director and lead actor for this movie. Just seemed like one of those pretty boys that blog on Youtube.

	schema:reviewBody "I found the movie to be funny and cute. I am a fan of Lee Hom. I love the soundtrack in this movie. I am also a big fan of Chinese instruments and it's awesome that Lee Hom inquired that in his movie. Lee Hom portrayed Chinese instruments in this movie so superbly. Also I've never seen this humor side of Lee Hom before too and it's good to see that. But I have to say that he did add too many fantasy humor moments of him daydreaming away in this movie. I think he went a little overboard on that. Since he portrayed himself as a singer in this movie he did do a lot of music in this movie which I love so I wasn't sure what I was watching or feeling about this movie. Was it music or really Love in Disguise? In my opinion the music seems to overpower the movie more than the love relationship between the main characters. Like with the confrontation of the two main characters at the fan signing I wanted to feel that sadness and pain of watching that part when Lee Hom was sad but it wasn't as strong as how I felt about the music. Maybe he should've have titled it something else like Music to your Soul or For the Love of Music or somewhere along that line. But to title it Love in Disguise kind'of made it to what it was but really wasn't either. In the movie I would have liked it if he was able to target the relationship between him and the main girl more deeply just as he did with the songsmusic in the movie. And not just the two main characters but also build some story or feelings for the other characters in the movie too would've been nice. Well not too much feelings or storyline but enough to at least know that they too were in the movie instead of looking like extras. If he was able to balance both music and the realtionship with the characters out evenly I think it would have been great.Overall the movie was fun to watch. Lee Hom did okay on his first movie he produced and directed. Maybe his next movie will be an improvement. Maybe he will try something new or a different genre. But whatever it is Lee Hom will do his best.".

	schema:headline " From a loyal Lee Hom Fan LH I know you are reading this";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is Lee Hom's first debut as a director of his romantic Comedy 'Love in Disguise.' Unfortunately along with his other films his acting leaves much to be desired. This movie has very cold humor no character development no climax unnecessarily melodramatic and the storyline is narcissistic in nature. The connection of scenes is also poor.As a singer Lee Hom is dedicated to his goal of revolutionizing Chinese music. He incessantly rejects the gossip engine of the media and secludes himself to the creation of unique music and infusing genres. I think an understanding of his singing helps recognize his deficiencies as an actor.One of his greatest weaknesses in his singing is his own natural vocal range. He peaks into head voice too early which limits the genres that he can successfully create as opposed to a singer like 'Se7en' who in his tenor range has a mixed voice that peaks much later than Lee Hom.This explains his choice of music genre and preference for Jazz. Most of his songs that he sings 'comfortably' are in the Soprano range. His live performances of some of his more popular songs are sung in a higher range above what he can consistently produce as evidenced by his poor execution in live performances which he likes to cover up by asking the audience to sing.This can be further demonstrated when we look at his musical influences 'Stevie Wonder' and how he failed to capture the essence of Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror' in his cover tribute which essentially drained the life out of what is an iconically an energy driven song. Being of a lower vocal range would not generally be a problem with songs based in other languages but with Chinese music being able to sing as a higher range while maintaining the richness of a mixed voice is often categorized as good singing. Lee Hom suffers from his own vocal deficiencies but is able to make up for them by composing unique and functional music as well as various vocal tricks which he uses in live performances to hide his inadequacy in hitting high notes. Much of the techniques he used are borrowed from speech level singing and the album before this tried to demonstrate them in songs such as 'Wan Quan Mei you ren he li you li ni' amongst many others. The effect was the creation of a very audibly unsatisfying listening experience covered only by the fact it has unique and had never been done before. One could argue this was so not only because many singers from Taiwan had not been trained in speech level singing but also because even if they had no one would be foolish enough to that showcasing in a song which really shined only as an experiment at some parts it sounded like I was listening to a 'learn how to sing tape.' Unfortunately as a pop star with very few people to relate to Lee Hom becomes the victim of selfdelusion. This is of course exacerbated by the Taiwanese media circle which would surround him with nothing but praise and with people who are afraid to give such open and honest advice with the fear of offending someone with such an outstanding musical career. To some extent i think Lee Hom recognizes his own vocal limitations and is trying to improve his singing using lessons by Seth Riggs. He also innately refuses to recognize the talent of someone like Jay Chou whose success lies quite closely with his ability to compose 'mainstream' songs and taking advantage of his tenor voice. I believe Lee Hom is trying to challenge the music industry to accept nonmainstream music. He does this in his latest albums by using techniques that use his vocals as an instrument rather in the traditional sense of a medium to express words in a typical high voice that traditionally makes up most Mandopop songs. The result however is not what you would expect and as a fan I find it quite difficult to enjoy some of the songs on his last album where he really does not focus on what sounds pleasing to his audience in his attempt to experiment with new sounds. It's no wonder why he emphasizes continually to the media that he is not a 'you zi ou xiang' but he wants to be recognized as someone with 'shi li'. Unfortunately no new music arrangement will earn him that title unless the rest of his songs from now on are as high as Wei Yi Forever Love and Kiss Goodbye the very ballads that Lee Hom is resisting not to make by choosing not to cave into mainstream pressure. It's the same stubbornness that prevents Lee Hom from feeding the Taiwan Media in any way even for public publicity. As a singer or classical musician like Yundi Li maybe it doesn't matter but as a pop singer a certain idol profile is required and Lee Hom should give away a little of his personal life to the media and to make his fans happy. He is not at the level yet like Michael Jackson where he can make his music do the talking no matter how much he wants it to be the case.As an extremely handsome individual I expected Wang to have had quite a few invitations to star in movise. The reason why he hasn't is his poor acting as evidenced in the range of movies that he has been involved in such as 'China Strike Force' 'The Avenging Fist' and 'Moonchild' amongst those that I have watched. The lack of quality in his acting in these cases has been so bad that it has completely overshadowed the benefit of having a 'successful pop idol' bringing his fan base into a movie this is not an easy thing to accomplish.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is Lee Hom's first debut as a director of his romantic Comedy 'Love in Disguise.' Unfortunately along with his other films his acting leaves much to be desired. This movie has very cold humor no character development no climax unnecessarily melodramatic and the storyline is narcissistic in nature. The connection of scenes is also poor.As a singer Lee Hom is dedicated to his goal of revolutionizing Chinese music. He incessantly rejects the gossip engine of the media and secludes himself to the creation of unique music and infusing genres. I think an understanding of his singing helps recognize his deficiencies as an actor.One of his greatest weaknesses in his singing is his own natural vocal range. He peaks into head voice too early which limits the genres that he can successfully create as opposed to a singer like 'Se7en' who in his tenor range has a mixed voice that peaks much later than Lee Hom.This explains his choice of music genre and preference for Jazz. Most of his songs that he sings 'comfortably' are in the Soprano range. His live performances of some of his more popular songs are sung in a higher range above what he can consistently produce as evidenced by his poor execution in live performances which he likes to cover up by asking the audience to sing.This can be further demonstrated when we look at his musical influences 'Stevie Wonder' and how he failed to capture the essence of Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror' in his cover tribute which essentially drained the life out of what is an iconically an energy driven song. Being of a lower vocal range would not generally be a problem with songs based in other languages but with Chinese music being able to sing as a higher range while maintaining the richness of a mixed voice is often categorized as good singing. Lee Hom suffers from his own vocal deficiencies but is able to make up for them by composing unique and functional music as well as various vocal tricks which he uses in live performances to hide his inadequacy in hitting high notes. Much of the techniques he used are borrowed from speech level singing and the album before this tried to demonstrate them in songs such as 'Wan Quan Mei you ren he li you li ni' amongst many others. The effect was the creation of a very audibly unsatisfying listening experience covered only by the fact it has unique and had never been done before.

	schema:headline " Melancholia";
	schema:reviewBody "Melancholia is a 2011 film written and directed by the controversial Lars Von Trier and follows two sisters as the end of the world draws near. The film is actually more about the current lives of the two sisters than it is the end of the world yet the impending doom does heavily influence a series of events. Presently the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film.To truly appreciate all that Melancholia has to offer the film must be analyzed by taking a look at its two separate acts. The feel of the first act is much different than the feel and plot of the second act. The first act is titled Justine as it focuses on the character Justine Kirsten Dunst and her severe depression on her wedding day. The first act doesn't have much to do with the fact that all life on Earth is going to be wiped out. In fact it doesn't really focus on the impending planet collision at all it is simply about Justine as a character and all those around her at the time of the wedding. It is clear the Justine suffers from some type of mental illness but it is not made clear exactly what is wrong with her. She does very odd things throughout her entire wedding day including cheating on her husband. She spends a majority of the time away from her party hiding out either on the golf course located outside or with her nephew which seems to be the only things she derives joy from. Justine can be a very annoying character to watch as she seems to want to do nothing but ruin her own party yet the camera shots of her off on her own either on the golf course or in the backyard are some of the best in the film. The second act of the film titled Claire focuses mainly on Justine's sister Claire Charlotte Gainsbourg and the impending impact of the planets. The first act can be slightly more interesting because as a viewer it is not really explained why Justine is doing all of the things she does a lot of mystery surrounds her character. The second act picks up slightly after the events of the first but follows Claire this time. She is worried about the collision yet her husband assures her it will miss Earth and they will be able to gaze upon it with their telescope. Throughout the second act Claire must deal with her Justine's depression as well as her own husband and child all while constantly worrying about the collision. The second half of the film is much more intense than the first and the editing reflects that especially towards the climax. The use of shaky shots gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness and uncertainty as to how it will end.Perhaps Melancholia's greatest achievement is its cinematography and beautiful sequence of unique shots most notably in the opening sequence. The first opening sequence takes place entirely in slow motion showing many of the main characters and is one of the highlights of the entire film. The camera work and settings used in this film are really something to talk about. The setting of a mansion is both isolating and elegant and these two things are reflected within the carefully planned camera work.My biggest gripe with the film would definitely be its pacing. It will be really engaging one minute and then slow down to a dead halt the next. However when the film does have its shining moments they are extremely memorable.".

It is seriously not fun to watch her being depressed. It made me feel very depressed as well and this was just the beginning.The family seems to be broken but in a very boring way. Nothing much happens here except for people running away I wish I did the same thing after opening scene but I was hoping for at least some pretty pictures later on. Then nothing happens then nothing happens then nothing happens then the sister suddenly understands the World is going to end so she freaks a little runs around a little then all three remaining heroes decide to sit at their asses and to wait for collision.Yes there are some pretty pictures of the castle where the boring people live but seriously I would rather watch another Miss Marple murder case. These movies are silly but at least something happens! Seriously I never expected to see another Armageddon or something like that but this bottle is completely empty. There are not even questions it just frustrating wait for the end of the World so the movie may end as well.I'm so so disappointed. If you were attracted by the trailer you may go home now. There is nothing more interesting to see here. The trailer is misleading it is pretty poster consisting of all the action in the movie. The rest is just cold empty freezing hell of boredom disguised as a art. Even the worst Lynch movies are at least an order of magnitude better than this!".

	schema:reviewBody "Melancholia is LVT's Wagnerian opera. Justine is a mythological creation. She is the white goddess Diana bathing la Belle Dame Sans Merci Cassandra tormented by futurity. It ends in Gottedammerung the destruction of the world. The Cannes jury was right to honour it. In 2 10 or 100 years this will be manifestly THE film of 2011 capturing as it does this precise historical moment on the cusp of epochs. More than just an economic crisis or even the end of Western capitalism or the American Century or of Europe  though it is all that  it is the consummation in fire of all we have ever known. Leaders and experts sit mesmerised and powerless making reassuring noises or setting aside puny provisions taking shelter in denial or custom. While Melancholia and Earth act out their dance of death gravity the most ineluctable force in the universe does its work. Justine being incapable of happiness is therefore incapable of illusion. She has always known. Herself untouched by affect by human assimilation or persuasion she writes the killer tag lines which manipulate others. Having a damaged soul she suffers from a disorder of perception  she sees things as they actually are. She knows precisely how many beans are in the jar like those who called the top of the Dow Jones index at 12807 exactly. On one level she represents the spirit of financialisation the final hottest white dwarf phase of capitalism quantifying inhumane ultracompetitive seen also in Skaarsgard's brutal ad boss and in the brotherinlaw who paid for the wedding  an arm and a leg for most people he means it literally I think  chilling! And like the Sybil Justine wants to die. She wills the destruction of herself and everything else. 'The Earth is evil.'LVT is the holy idiot of European cinema. Much as Justine destroys her stellar career then hours later in the garden consciously and irrevocably obliterates her marriage and future happiness so LVT  in the most perfect example of parallel process  in his acceptance speech at Cannes compulsively befouls himself his credibility future opportunities his film and all associated with it. Poor Dunst beside him. Did she always know? I wonder. Which brings me to Kirsten Dunst.Once the allAmerican teenage sweetie in some of my favourite films.The US invented the teenager much as the English Victorians invented childhood and its richest and most creative seam of film and TV deal with this stage of life. In a way America is the world's teenager and all teenagers are Americans by proxy. In fact Dunst is GermanAmerican with all the ancestral baggage that implies. Read Sylvia Plath's 'Daddy' if you don't know what I mean. Beneath the applepie sunny exterior of her teen roles there was always something remote and uncanny about her beauty. And now with teen  young adult roles behind her this strangeness this well Germanness is exposed. In the riveting opening shots of 'Melancholia' she looks like Marlene Dietrich  unheimlich fascinating. Like la Belle Dame Sans Merci she takes possession of a man through his unconscious like the groom in the film he will follow her exchanging all that is dear  home family and hope of happiness  for bitterness and despair. In the scene in the limo the earliest lightest part of the story she seems American in accent face body She becomes less American  more northern European and ultimately less like a human being at all as her story unwinds. Those who criticise the inconsistency in her accent are missing the point. The change is about the character not her nationality which is purposely vague. In fact in what country does the film take place? Would you ask that question of 'the Ring'? I get the impression that just as Lars is working through some issues around his Germanness  hence the Wagnerianism  so is Dunst which must have made his Cannes performance doubly excruciating. I hear she wants to be called 'Keersten' now pronounced the German way. For the girl who has been being other people superbly well from her childhood it seems to me that Dunst the adult truly exposes something painfully real of herself in this film. 'Exposing' is the right word in every way. And she pulls it off. The film is stunning. She is stunning and thoroughly deserves Best Actress. Bravo Lars von Trier!".

	schema:headline " At times absolutely brilliant mostly just boring and annoying";
	schema:reviewBody "Melancholia was a movie I went to see expecting it to blow me away. I thought now here's a movie that doesn't have the massfriendliness of the average Hollywood movie but at the same time actually has a nice budget and some good actors. Now don't get me wrong I often find low budget films with fresh talent amazing but with Melancholia I was hoping for something that successfully molds together the Hollywood and indie movie scenes. Here's what I thought of the movieAs it opens there's a quite long slow moving apocalyptic scene that I won't even try to explain. But to be honest I found it to be quite nicely done. With the occasional space imagery to me it looked like if Ingmar Bergman had made a 2001 A Space Odyssey based short film. Wagner's music really made it an extraordinary experience.Part I The Wedding no I'm not calling it Justine live with it At first it seemed like a pretty nice slow starting atmosphere building part of the movie note that at this point I still really wanted to enjoy this movie but as time went on I found myself hating most of the badly written annoying and shallow cast and I was hoping for bad things to happen to them all especially Justine Kirsten Dunst's character. By the way why does everyone consider her performance so great? Sure she was good at playing an angsty character whose motives remain a mystery to everyone but honestly being either expressionless or having an intentionally painful fake smile on shouldn't be that hard. When the wedding scene was over I thought finally now can we get to the part where this gets good?Part II The Generic Ranch So after being bored with the first half of the movie I was hoping for something a bit better. Well I never got what I was hoping for. Justine just got a lot more annoying we found out she has paranormal abilities and people were taking a planet sucking out some of earth's atmosphere probably taking it off it's course and killing everyone on it regardless of weather it collided or not really goddamn well. Not even Kiefer Sutherland's great performance could make me have any motivation for watching on. For the first time in my life I was actually contemplating walking out of the theater I was so bored and annoyed. Long story short Justine was a total douche her sister paniced and the world came to an end and the movie ended. Oh yeah and there was that kid who did an even worse performance than Jake Lloyd on Star Wars ep. 1. Yes it was really that bad.Okay the very end was pretty epic with Wagner's music almost blowing my eardrums out and a huge blue planet smashing into the earth. I have to admit though when the movie ended I accidentally let out a giggle much to the dismay of most people sitting near me. Seriously as well made as it was it was a pretty silly way to end the movie in my opinion. Alright pros and consPros We saw Kirsted Dunst naked a couple of times and although I really disliked the jumpy amateuristic camerawork the movie was at times visually amazing and not really ever over the top. Also the idea for the movie was pretty cool and I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherland's acting. The very beginning and very end should have been made into separate short films because they were really worth watching.Cons Exceptionally shallow characters whose ridiculously small backstories were just thrown on to the viewers mostly just average sometimes painfully weak acting and plentiful filler scenes that had no purpose whatsoever and that could have been cut down without the movie losing anything while some scenes were just cut off completely for example the impromptu sex scene with Justine and her husband which if correctly made could have told us most everything about their relationship and many more scenes that were just cut way too short.Conclusion I'd like to give the movie more points just for it's beginning and end and the story that had great potential for a scifi  sporting drama but I just can't. For the first time in a while I seriously had trouble getting through this movie without walking out in the middle. Sorry to all the people who think it's a great movie but personally I think I'd seriously rather do the dishes and mow the lawn than watch this movie again.".

Instead I found it as an indulgent superficial look from Von Trier on mental illness. He tried to show how it affects those around the sufferer but it was portrayed in such a cold and insignificant light I felt more for Cruella De Ville and her plight to only want a warm winter coat made from dogs than for the Dunst character. At least 101 Dalmatians HAD a plot. Speaking of plot this movie had none. I am smart enough to know that a planet cannot hide behind the Sun and that the planet crashing plot was simply thrown in so those with a brain wouldn't storm out of the movie.

	schema:headline " An utter waste of time";
	schema:reviewBody " MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS  The movie is visually interesting at times but I frankly cannot fathom why it is so highly rated here on IMDb. Personally I have a long list of problems with it.The movie opens with Justine a psychologically unstable selfish woman who is later revealed to have psychic powers getting married. We are introduced to the gallery of deeply despicable characters ranging from her boss a powerhungry social misfit her dad a broken man who has given up on life her mother a cynical bitch who wants to make her daughter's decisions her husband a naive loser and various others. The wedding has no relevance to the story and nor do the characters with the exception of one not completely awful man  an astronomy enthusiast.Everything in this story is told as if in an attempt to test your patience. There is hardly any progress at all until near the ending when a planet looms large on the horizon and we are supposed to marvel at the emotional impact of doomsday on a couple of unsympathetic characters. The premise is so silly that anyone with the most basic knowledge of astronomy will immediately recognize it as such a planet several times larger than Earth has been hiding behind the sun but is now about to smash into us. In case you didn't know the earth orbits the sun in one year. In order for another planet to have remained hidden behind the sun for as long as we've had not just telescopes but really good astronomical data it'd have to be moving around the sun exactly opposite to us with almost exactly the same period. How it could then suddenly be about to collide with us is of thankfully never addressed as it would no doubt only have made matters even worse. Some interesting visuals towards the end and a lot of nice symphonystyle music cellos but unfortunately nothing that could make up for the painfully slow and for me uninvolving story. A rocksolid rockbottom rating of 1 from this reviewer then.".

	onyx:emotionText " MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS  The movie is visually interesting at times but I frankly cannot fathom why it is so highly rated here on IMDb. Personally I have a long list of problems with it.The movie opens with Justine a psychologically unstable selfish woman who is later revealed to have psychic powers getting married. We are introduced to the gallery of deeply despicable characters ranging from her boss a powerhungry social misfit her dad a broken man who has given up on life her mother a cynical bitch who wants to make her daughter's decisions her husband a naive loser and various others. The wedding has no relevance to the story and nor do the characters with the exception of one not completely awful man  an astronomy enthusiast.Everything in this story is told as if in an attempt to test your patience. There is hardly any progress at all until near the ending when a planet looms large on the horizon and we are supposed to marvel at the emotional impact of doomsday on a couple of unsympathetic characters.

	schema:reviewBody "So I was on vacation for a few days and I had the opportunity to load up a few films onto my iPad that I had been meaning to watch. I am going to try and review them all over the next few days. First up is Lars Von Triers Melancholia. I saw Von Trier's last film Antichrist and truthfully I didn't think much of it. I didn't have very high hopes for this film either but I have been hearing really good things and decided to give it a chance.I pretty much hated everything about this overrated selfindulgent tripe. The story is really broken into two parts. First there is a long marriage scene where Kirsten Dunst flits around giving everyone the stink eye. She refuses to have sex with her new husband bangs some dude on a golf course instead and then tells her boss she hates her job and that she quits. Then she gets all depressed which takes us to part 2. Kirsten Dunst acts all depressed and walks around giving everyone the stink eye while she stays with her overbearing overly emotional sister played by an always annoying Charlotte Gainsbourg. As a side note we find out that a planet named Melancholia has been hiding behind the sun you sneaky planet you and now may or not be on a collision course with earth. So Kirsten Dunst takes all her clothes off and lays down on the ground so she can give Melancholia the stink eye.This movie sucked in ways I was not aware a movie could suck. It's artsy and weird just for the sake of being artsy and weird. It's and emotionless mess that leaves you feeling absolutely nothing at all. They assembled a pretty interesting cast and then did nothing with it. Kirsten Dunst is just plain annoying and Charlotte Gainsbourg does her best to take that title from Dunst. Kiefer Sutherland spends the movie acting like a simp with a poop eating grin on his face. This is the last time I waste any more of my life on that nazi loving corncob Lars Von Trier.".

Also an abject that massive would create a horrendous gravitational effect which would dramatically alter the Earth's and the Moon's orbits create massive earthquakes and huge tides that would overwhelm all coastal cities etc. I couldn't stop laughing in the last scene when the planet nearly fills the whole sky and the sea in front of the mansion is not even disturbed a bit. Oh please. And the cheap CGI rendering of nebulae etc. are not worthy of a B movie see The Tree of Life for breathtaking handling of such images created by a master filmmaker. The absurdly long wedding scene with every arthouse blacktie trope imaginable was just insufferable. What a piece of garbage.".

One can't help but be mesmerized and terrified by the magnitude of Melancholia and the attention to detail the science dear lord! was easy to understand and though it wasn't the focal point of the film it was enough to offer the audience an idea as to how something like that was possible. I would be lying if I said it didn't make me weep. The film is separated by chapters that focus on the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg and their lives before and after they found out about Melancholia. I believe that by taking the time to show us how the sisters were before the end of the world even became a possibility we understand why they react the way they do to the news. Accepting what is to come instead of fearing it is what separates the sisters and the conversationsarguments that transpire speak a lot about the human condition and forces us to ask ourselves What will I do with the time I have left?

If you are a depressive masochist you might find the middle part enjoyable though. I gave it 2 stars for those few minutes.It looks like sh.t. I'm shaken. These are not my words. It's from Lars Von Triers director's statement about this film. When Lars Von Trier appeared with Kirsten Dunst at Cannes promoting his latest effort in tormenting audiences he claimed to understand Hitler. Maybe because this rather endless self indulging narcissistic arthouse piece about the annihilation of rural upper class Denmark had brainwashed him to the point of calling himself a Nazi and Isreal a pain in the ass. Who knows. Maybe he meant to promote the film. It did not reach me.His promotional efforts got Trier banned from Cannes. He is banned from my play list too after I have been bored to tears one more time with outdated arthouse tricks that have ceased to impress me in the last millennium. Kiefer Sutherland Kirsten Dunst Charlotte Gainsbourg they don't look like sisters and others are working loyally with their tormentor. It's sad watching them waisting their talent though on this pointless journey. Udo Kier has a short cameo and is funny as always even in pointless surroundings.The editing is bad enough to use it as an example for film students on how to make wrong choices.Yes jerking a camera endlessly and pointlessly can be done even 15 years after Breaking the Waves. Back then shaking cameras without meaning was some kind of arthouse fashion statement. Now it looks like someone wearing the wrong trousers to the wrong party.The implausible arrival of another planet being observed through an obscure piece of wire until it finally smashes an idyllic pasture was great for two things it ends both the endless camera jerking and the movie.Even if this review will be stowed away deep in the bulk of this distributor's guest reviews I'd like to warn you. The film leaves you in pointless depression. If you think that's a good way to invest your time end money I can highly recommend it.".

If you have any little doubt whether you want to watch this movie or  not you better don't because this is not for everyone and if you  still want to see this then prepare yourself for what you're going to  face. The movie is all about how Lars Von Trier sees the world the  people and the dearness between them. It's beautiful it's real it's  disgusting it's terrifying  it all depends on how you want to  perceive this film. The opening and the ending scenes are mesmerizing!  The music used in the film is taken from Wagner's ''Tristan and  Isolde'' opera which fits the movie perfectly. Cinematography  amazes.  Special effects not for 3D but are very realistic and breathtaking.  Kirsten Dunst gives us her best performance to date forget the girl in  Spiderman this is a new level for her. She finally proves us how good  she can be with the right movie choice. An Oscar nomination is on its  way...  I'm not a fan of Lars and his movies but this one had me at the edge  of my seat to the last minute. 1010".

The movie hints at a correlation between the lack of love and the threat of impending doom that's present throughout.I speculate that every viewer will take something slightly different away from the picture because the movie is designed to make you think about us humans and our behaviors toward each other as well as enjoy the work of wonder that the movie is. What you end up with is dependent of what you take to the movie in the first place. Trier's movies are usually adept at making you feel. In this movie you are left to your own devices. There is no inherently good person to root or feel for. There is only the state of the world. And the future of the human kind. Can you be bothered to feel for us?Truly Trieresque 1010.".

However a film short of plot needs something else to interest an audience for two hours and sadly there isn't much more to take away from it.

	schema:headline " An extremely poor documentary about an interesting subject";
	schema:reviewBody "How much the Hebrew Israelites' depicted in this film have in common with 'real' Jews is a mystery that is never revealed in this film.  In fact nothing about this religious community is explained.  The Kingdom' as this community is referred to is comprised of several hundred black people most of whom if not all  emigrated from the United States to Israel.  The film explains nothing of the religion how this exodus of sorts began how these Israelites' interact with the other real Jews outside of their community and how they manage to support themselves financially.  There is some talk about their disenchantment with the U.S. what with its racism and cycle of drugs and crime in the black community but it would be interesting to know how these folks took such a dramatic step in this direction.  This documentary instead chooses to look solely at an element of their society that makes the Hassidic community seem progressive in comparison.  In The Kingdom' polygamy is quite acceptable.  We don't learn how many of these Israelite families practice polygamy but given the fact that 52 of the general population of the Earth is female well statistically there just wouldn't be enough wives to go around for every man especially since in the law of The Kingdom a man CAN have up to six wives!  So we don't know if the family that this film focuses on is extremely unique somewhat common if The Kingdom is just lucky enough to breed more females than males or if there's some kind of recruiting program for women going on back in the States WHITE slavery anyone?.  Who knows?  I sure would like to!The documentary is cinema verite i.e. no narrative just bits of facts that will very likely give people all sorts of impressions that may or may not have much to do with the reality of this community.  Most of the eyeview we get is from the two wives of one particular man.  They don't seem very happy except when they suddenly become aware that the camera is focusing on them. One can't help but cringe to hear one of the Israelites' in the film talk of past slavery and then see how it is still propagated against women in this community. In The Kingdom the man is king.  The husband featured refers to his wives as queens but I've never heard of any queen who had no choice but to live as a servant to her husband.  It would be interesting to know how a man who has a job as a laborer machinist can support himself ten kids and two wives.  It would seem that the community might have taken a page or two out of the Kibbutz world everyone chips in but in a Kibbutz each community is mostly selfsufficient by growing crops that bring in income for the community.  Your guess is as good as mine where the shekels ARE coming from but I could imagine that it's part of the overall income from selling books and paraphernalia throughout the U.S. and other countries.  Again who knows?  One also wonders if this cult er religion enjoys nonprofit status since Israel does not recognize them in a religious context let alone as citizens.  Overall this documentary brings up far more questions than it answers.  I'll try to give the filmmakers some slack because I see that IMDb has registered this film as having a 60 minute running time and I saw it on the Trio channel which means that about fifteen minutes were cut out to make way for commercials.  Still a documentary of such a controversial subject needs to have a variety of angles and as much in depth coverage as possible.".

	onyx:emotionText "How much the Hebrew Israelites' depicted in this film have in common with 'real' Jews is a mystery that is never revealed in this film.  In fact nothing about this religious community is explained.  The Kingdom' as this community is referred to is comprised of several hundred black people most of whom if not all  emigrated from the United States to Israel.  The film explains nothing of the religion how this exodus of sorts began how these Israelites' interact with the other real Jews outside of their community and how they manage to support themselves financially.  There is some talk about their disenchantment with the U.S. what with its racism and cycle of drugs and crime in the black community but it would be interesting to know how these folks took such a dramatic step in this direction.  This documentary instead chooses to look solely at an element of their society that makes the Hassidic community seem progressive in comparison.  In The Kingdom' polygamy is quite acceptable.  We don't learn how many of these Israelite families practice polygamy but given the fact that 52 of the general population of the Earth is female well statistically there just wouldn't be enough wives to go around for every man especially since in the law of The Kingdom a man CAN have up to six wives!  So we don't know if the family that this film focuses on is extremely unique somewhat common if The Kingdom is just lucky enough to breed more females than males or if there's some kind of recruiting program for women going on back in the States WHITE slavery anyone?.  Who knows?  I sure would like to!The documentary is cinema verite i.e. no narrative just bits of facts that will very likely give people all sorts of impressions that may or may not have much to do with the reality of this community.  Most of the eyeview we get is from the two wives of one particular man.  They don't seem very happy except when they suddenly become aware that the camera is focusing on them. One can't help but cringe to hear one of the Israelites' in the film talk of past slavery and then see how it is still propagated against women in this community. In The Kingdom the man is king.  The husband featured refers to his wives as queens but I've never heard of any queen who had no choice but to live as a servant to her husband.  It would be interesting to know how a man who has a job as a laborer machinist can support himself ten kids and two wives.  It would seem that the community might have taken a page or two out of the Kibbutz world everyone chips in but in a Kibbutz each community is mostly selfsufficient by growing crops that bring in income for the community.  Your guess is as good as mine where the shekels ARE coming from but I could imagine that it's part of the overall income from selling books and paraphernalia throughout the U.S. and other countries.  Again who knows?  One also wonders if this cult er religion enjoys nonprofit status since Israel does not recognize them in a religious context let alone as citizens.  Overall this documentary brings up far more questions than it answers.  I'll try to give the filmmakers some slack because I see that IMDb has registered this film as having a 60 minute running time and I saw it on the Trio channel which means that about fifteen minutes were cut out to make way for commercials.

Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach.

It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right.

Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's Juden! Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger stronger braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it.

I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the threedimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen but from my perspective this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What Saving Private Ryan does extremely well is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without looking I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article Best War Movie Ever Made and I agree. However before briefly discussing the film let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie DVD.It's a great film to start with and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you  as in that spectacular 22 minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks  is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding too. I've never seen so many grays beiges and olivegreens look this good perfect colors for the bombedout French city where the last hour takes place perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers for the machinery the smokefilled skies etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 2530 times but hey when you consider it's tough men in tough times that's what you are going to hear. In real life the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks the leading actor in here both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway language or blood and guts aside this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almostthree hour film is riveting starttofinish especially with that memorable beginning action scene probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As entertaining as those action scenes were I found the lulls if you will to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the lulls is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later Harve Presenell playing Gen. MacArthur eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film too and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is memorable just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period.".

	schema:headline " Excellent despite some Spielberg slips into sentiment";
	schema:reviewBody "During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed.  In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors and humanity of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and to a lesser extent the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers which had a few cockney accents this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British or any other voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's ie  when America joined.However this is a minor flaw as in fairness it's an American film  why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors current actors old faces up and comers etc.  Sizemore Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon Ribsi Diesel Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.".

	schema:reviewBody "War films can be broken into two basic categories the propaganda film which celebrates bravery and patriotism and the antiwar film which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a postwar environment. An exception to this warinprogress concept was is Saving Private Ryan. Cloaked in an antiwar facade this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 its setting than 1998 its year of release. Under its thin antiwar facade of realistic looking destruction Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an antiwar work. Almost by definition antiwar films use a faceless enemy Paths of Glory or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war The Enemy Below. Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them The Longest Day. This is because after a war both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how facing such a totally inept enemy the war could have gone on more than a few days after the DDay Landings. Among the most obviousA sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of antitank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older secondtier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.So just what is Saving Private Ryan? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the Longest Day whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistakeridden choppy and contrived remake of The Big Red One. Ultimately this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than Kelly's Heroes a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. Then there is the finale a total ripoff of Arthur Pohl's The Bridge 1949 which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost that is not particularly unusual but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting postwar portrayals such as Das Boot and Cross of Iron of the German soldier as something more than the sub human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own Raiders of the Lost Ark series. The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized and unexamined by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema where McCarthyparalyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releaseAlthough Saving Private Ryan was popular remember that the Rat Patrol ran for 58 episodes watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.Then again what do I know?

	schema:reviewBody "Saving Private Ryan Spielberg's continued descent into narrow arrogant lowbrow revisionism is at best a languid patriotic trumpcalling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the glorious morally superior American armed forces who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all good guys. This is not the case history has shown us so. Americans for all their good intentions in World War 2 were just as loathsome as the Nazis they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color arrested and imprisoned innocent hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions fire bombed nontactical European cities most notably Dresden hired former Nazis to combat the communist threat and finally dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war things got even worse the Red Hunt which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.It is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the best wars film ever as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen. Perhaps instead of giving Spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre they should go out and rent Come and See Russian The Burmese Harp 1967 Fires on the Plain 1959 or Paths of Glory 1957 truly far superior films to this Hollywoodbastardization and candy treatment of war. There is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at DDay according to Spielberg was in some way just a side show to saving Private Ryan. With such a simplistic statement it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that 'action action action' is equated with 'greatness'. I only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth. While most viewers who are safely tucked away in their houses waving American flags and discharging a few tears saying You German scum! You German scum! can truly appreciate blood and guts as cinema then there is a market for it. After you get through the puerile premise then you can sit back have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most clichdriven rubbish that has ever been produced. The scenes themselves are overdrawn stolen from previous war films from the 1950's namely the Longest Day 1962 which was a great film in itself. The beach landing is too long and it shows only the Americans as heroic while the Germans are seen as evil Hun scum. Tom Hanks in his most idiotic and candid self seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save Private Ryan and in one completely absurd scene the remaining 15 Americans defeat a battle hardened superiorly trained SS special unit group with just a few guns. Now if you know anything about history then you would know that the SS were not an easy group to defeat they were some of the most fanatical and welltrained soldiers of the German Reich but since Spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots he'll continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines. This is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else I would suggest watching Hell Is for Heroes 1962 with Steve McQueen because it is a lot better and we don't have to be forced to carry an American flag at the end.".

If we take the special effects from his movies would they still be great? What you're waiting for an answer? Just like every Spielberg movie we find Steve desperately clinging to special effects like a fish to water. Like Bush to oil. Like Uwe Boll to a video gametomovie conversion last one is not necessarily bad by the way.Just like everybody else I was amazed by the realism of the first 5 minutes. Once you get past the battle scenes there's not much to work with. I'm glad people as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here are starting to realize this.Let's set aside the absurdity of the plot I use 'plot' very loosely. That's just a vehicle a pretext an excuse to use special effects Spielberg's one and only leverage. The main plot is that a mother lost a number of her sons so the general or whatever his rank was thinks she shouldn't lose her last remaining son Ryan. He reads a letter Abraham Lincoln sent to a mother who went through a similar experience during the civil war. Using musical cues and closeups Spielberg is not trying to tell us how to feel he's practically begging us to do so. After all he knows better than anybody that people will  during the course of the movie  realize that the battle scenes aren't that numerous or long so there better be some story to back the movie up.Since he knows that he's addressing a crowd that made movies like Armageddon and Independence Day box office hits he correctly realized that the script needs to be comprised of one element only text. So long as the script contained text it was good enough. And he was right. With enough flash and special effects he was able to appeal to the idiocy of the average American a tactic mastered by Jerry Bruckheimer Michael Bay and their likes.Now back to the 'plot' once you set it aside you'll realize that this movie is trying to instill many ideas into the minds of the movie goers. When he shows German soldiers he shows them from a distance so by not giving them a face a human side he teaches us that it's totally OK to thrill at killing them. Bad German bad! After our heroes free a German Spielberg makes is very clear that he came back later to kill Tom Hanks. Spielberg is saying they should've killed him the first time. The only good German is a dead one apparently. Astonishing dishonesty and malice on the part of Spielberg. Not a trick was a spared to demonize every single one of them.Unlike masters of movie making a title Spielberg will never come close to like Scorsese and Coppola he desperately needs musical cues to tell when to feel sad fearful excited etc. His approach to emotion is so utterly sappy shallow and downright laughable that it's virtually impossible for him to let the scenes and the story speak for themselves. He must have very clear cues to give the viewers signals. The music is like a slap in the face. Spielberg manifests in moments like tell me I lived a good life grabs you by the throat and ORDERS you to shed a few tears. Insulting. Pathetic.The only good part in the movie is the whole scene of the mistaken identity where they realize this whining little weakling crying his eyes out is not the Ryan they wanted. Other than that and looking at the chutzpah of the musical cues the absurdity of the plot the dehumanization of the Germans and the hilarious warfare errors the movie is only good for another laugh albeit not one Spielberg was aiming for.".

	schema:reviewBody "112017 Update edited for corrections written as is.Of course the first combat sequence was great. But unfortunately I was considered a sociopath for snickering at a man wandering around to pick up his dismembered arm while the camera is still shaking on the ground  it became obvious that Spielberg tries too hard to elicit the emotions from a cynical person like me. I eventually became sick and nauseated at having been forced to watch the ultimately annoying and repetitive guerrilla cinematography while the violence and mayhem prevails. Is it supposed to depict the reality of war? Maybe yes but all it does is always impact impact impact and I felt little or no emotion. After the first sequence SPR stooped for the lowest level  and I tried to keep awake during some tedious parts but I ended up snickering and laughing at a few utterly lame and manipulative scenes Remember Edward Burns' arrogantly stoic character and Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller's speech?. One of the biggest problems with the film is that the audience at first showed disdain for the translator because he's a coward why the critics say this in their reviews is beyond me and then cheered when he shot one of the German soldiers to death just to show his courage  I found this disturbing. After the final battle the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax I've ever seen  from the slowly progressing and clichd morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the U.S. flag waving for another 25 seconds. After I left the theater quietly I let out intense ribaching laughter all the way driving home. This is what Mr. Goldman observes as phony and manipulative to serve our Country. I'm sorry if I sound crude but I debunk SPR for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with Patch Adams another worse movie that year.This is my honest opinion  to observe dissect and criticize  and I don't trust the critics anymore because they went overboard just for the realistic depiction of war violence calling the movie the greatest war movie ever made! In truth older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting Paths of Glory and The Longest Day  despite the fact that they're tame for not being profane and gory.And most importantly SPR shouldn't be shown in English classes in high schools just as another critically overrated The Clockwork Orange shouldn't. It only serves to desensitize the kids because of the war is bad propaganda coupled with the U.S.saluting totalitarianism. The epitome of a doublewham hypocrisy just like the propagandizing Nazi films.".

After the final battle the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax I've ever seen  from the slowly progressing and clichd morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the U.S. flag waving for another 25 seconds. After I left the theater quietly I let out intense ribaching laughter all the way driving home. This is what Mr. Goldman observes as phony and manipulative to serve our Country. I'm sorry if I sound crude but I debunk SPR for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with Patch Adams another worse movie that year.This is my honest opinion  to observe dissect and criticize  and I don't trust the critics anymore because they went overboard just for the realistic depiction of war violence calling the movie the greatest war movie ever made! In truth older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting Paths of Glory and The Longest Day  despite the fact that they're tame for not being profane and gory.And most importantly SPR shouldn't be shown in English classes in high schools just as another critically overrated The Clockwork Orange shouldn't. It only serves to desensitize the kids because of the war is bad propaganda coupled with the U.S.saluting totalitarianism. The epitome of a doublewham hypocrisy just like the propagandizing Nazi films.";

Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow the American people stand revealed for what they really are stupid selfabsorbed morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.Saving Private Ryan is typical Steven Spielberg fare a big budget spectacle bereft of style filled to the brim with childishly heavyhanded moralizing and peopled with facile characters who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby  America GOOOOOD Nazis BAAAAD. The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the DDay landings and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention hamfisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered hint with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone  because obviously the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List. The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory full of irritating disorienting jump cuts pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail camera tricks and special effects artifices all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood this I'm sure was Spielberg's intent.Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan Matt Damon is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall Harve Presnell decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.At this point Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motleycrewofexperts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled the toughasnails seargent the feisty Italian the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God if the historical setting had been Vietnam I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro the REMF pussy  all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die does anyone really remember which ones?. The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man  having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF  returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead it panders to that audience with easy answers impressive effects a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains cowards and the courageous us and them. In the place of subtlety it gives us spectacle in the place of art it delivers technically proficient propaganda.".

Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach the disorientation the killing etc. But after that this movie drops on the level of Armageddon a mother has a number of sons all of them died during the war except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course that is completely logical.The German soldiers in the contrary don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them they are ugly leanmeankilling machines shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field they don't have any feelings at all. So what could have been a great movie with all the money spent for and stars on it playing in the same league as All quiet on the Western Front gets to be completely pathetic unrealistic superpatriotic and onesided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a real American and was leftout because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an Oscar until Schindler's List. That was a well done movie but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war watch All quiet on the Western Front or Das Boot.".

But some of You mostly from the U.S. write things like proud to be an American or part of American History or every American should see this movie.First of all I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II but I as a 25year old German and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war their first babyimpressions were gunshots and explosions  for years! Nowadays in Germany it still is common to find old still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second this is not American history it is not German history it is World history  Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third I don't mean to be rude but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place making a war movie has two major aspects Making money bad and Reviving History for educational purposes respectable. But then feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood there was a Concentration Camp only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France and let me tell You Just seeing the sea the sand the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma she led a baby nursing home in that time that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie may it be as realistic as possible and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building Sophie Scholl and her friends threw AnitNazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen that's  The Bridge from 1959 but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway how can war films be good or best? Saving Private Ryan is an exceptional educational masterpiece it should be recommended together with Schindler's List but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So I recommend this Watch the movie everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then book a ticket for Europe see the Normandie for yourself see Berlin see Dresden see Munich see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from I promise You then will have a different view of reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change take a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example. What Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonderwhich Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who know little about the battle that's almost everyone who's in the theater probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.Believe me the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if itwere as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon which they did. I wonder for example how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film it looks about a couple hundred yards. It was in actuality almost ten miles wide. The timing was also inaccurate  Hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM. Another historical error is the implication that the events at Omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches Juno Sword Gold and Utah. That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach for example the other US assault beach took about a dozen casualties  many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action. But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script. Here we have the US Army sending a squada squad!!! to march straight thru the entire German 7th Army something two Divisions with total air superiority couldn't do for weeks waltz around an area of 300 square miles and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this nonsense the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning. Gliders what gliders?  said Spielberg. That's what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't know very much about his subject.  A stupid stupid film. What a waste of 100M or so.".

But that company with one notable exception experienced the worst that Omaha Beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 06300800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example the entire 5th Ranger Battalion Col Schneider 6 companies landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded.  It all depended on where your landing craft touched down or allowed it to touch down  Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was  Dog Green but had the sense to order the craft eastward and Capt Hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes they didn't crawl up inch by inch etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes  very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves 06300800was not much over 10 far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disastersetc. Beside Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of nonexistent eyewitnesses. It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to authenticate the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers. Anyone who sees Pvt  Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenesthe rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase  Call the 101st on the radio and tell them to pull Ryan from the line. That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together  they would never have done that  the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait as is obvious from the casualties taken approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces O and B 60000 troops.".

From the 1920 serial JUNGLE QUEEN right through TV shows like Jungle Jim and Ramar of the Jungle there was always some lost civilisation just over the next mountain. Such is the case in this movie also hey if a plot point works why change it?This time out we have Bruce Weldon Heyburn and his pal Andy Robert Carson a couple of rich bored yachtsmen who decide to abandon sailing regattas and head for Africa to search for The City of the Dead. Coming along are Bruce's fiance Bety Sheila Darcy and her dad William Paul Scott. William is hoping for a reunion with his brother Charles Middleton who became a missionary and has been in the jungle for many years. Now in real life any safari that has perennial comic relief actor Vince Barnett as guide normally would not have much of a chance but hey fascinating indeed are the things you can get away with in a movie.Also in the jungle is Dr. Robert Hammond Buster Crabbe who is known as Junga to the natives. They may have been enemies in the Flash Gordon serials at Universal but in this PRC picture Buster and Charles are the best of friends. Buster has been searching for the cure to a fatal disease the natives call malaka and has sent a sample of the serum he has developed to the States for testing. Sadly the ship carrying the serum is lost  . . .sunk by a torpedo as Middleton informs him a vague reference to WW2 which the US was not yet involved in when this movie was made. I'll get back to this point later.Bruce and Andy head off looking for the lost city. Whoever lost it must not have looked for it very hard because they find it with relative ease and does anyone besides me think that Lost City looks an awful lot like Angkor Wat? Along the way there are many problems like attacking lions giant snakes headhunters and of course a sudden outbreak of malaka. Can Buster do anything to save the natives and the explorers? If only the serum were not lost when the ship went down! Ah but wait that wreck may not be lost after all! But can Buster get to it in the shark infested waters? That would be telling! You'll see for yourself.The low budget shows. This movie uses tons of stock footage that looks to be about 10 years old or even more. Watch as the actors in this movie look offscreen and react to scenes of wildlife that look like they come from an early documentary. Performances are good despite the limitations. Vince Barnett is amusing while never getting annoying. Buster and Charles react well with each other. Sheila Darcy is quite good and for one scene she even gets to go native wearing a skimpy well by 1941 standards sarong while she flirts with Buster.I had fun watching JUNGLE MAN and if you give it a chance and overlook its shortcomings I think you will too.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the third jungle adventure I have seen from director Harry Fraser. The other two were The White Gorilla and The Savage Girl. This one Drums of Africa is at best marginally better than those other two. Harry sure knew how to knock out shoddy product in this genre. Like the other two films this one is full of stock footage of wild animals. Although I don't really mind this as this footage is always kind of quite good fun to watch. In fact some of the scenes with the lions and tigers were actually pretty good especially where some guy wrestles with them. Impressive stuff. My main gripe about the movie would most probably be its rubbish story line. There's a thread about a lost city a fatal disease and a multiple lion attack. Nothing wrong with having a few things going on but with the exception of the lion attack the other story elements are dealt with very halfheartedly. The lost city turns out to be you guessed it more stock footage this time hilariously it's shots of Angkor Wat which is of course in Asia. It just goes to show the things that they could get away with back in the 40's. Also on that subject I could never quite understand why there was a tiger in the middle of the African jungle. I think they just included it because they had it. The deadly killer disease is the other plot thrust of the story. And it's this that explains the presence of Buster Crabbe's doctor character in the middle of the jungle. He's there to find an antidote and help the natives. But this too is pretty lacklustre and it really is hard to care very much about this plot element at all.Drums of Africa is a pretty poor jungle adventure overall. It's not completely devoid of entertainment though.".

I think they just included it because they had it. The deadly killer disease is the other plot thrust of the story. And it's this that explains the presence of Buster Crabbe's doctor character in the middle of the jungle. He's there to find an antidote and help the natives. But this too is pretty lacklustre and it really is hard to care very much about this plot element at all.Drums of Africa is a pretty poor jungle adventure overall. It's not completely devoid of entertainment though.";

	schema:reviewBody "Already seen all of Universal's Wolf Man movies? Want something more? Well here's a little piece of werewolf movie history you probably never even knew about.It's really more of a romance story than a werewolf story but it's definitely the werewolf aspect that makes it interesting. Two logging companies are rivals with one another and Dick Bannister played by George Chesebro is the head of one of them. When the other company starts shooting and wounding his men he telephones the city and sends his boss and a surgeon. It just so happens that his boss is a young woman played by Marguerite Clayton and she is engaged to a surgeon. Bannister instantly falls in love with her when she arrives.Later the rival logging company begins to build a dam across a vital river. When Bannister confronts them they attack him and leave him for dead ... but he is saved by the surgeon and taken to a nearby cabin. The owner of the cabin refuses to give his blood for a transfusion to save Bannister as they have previously argued about him selling alcohol to the loggers but suggests that he can use the blood of his shewolf instead. He does and Bannister lives.But when word gets out that he has wolf's blood in his veins his superstitious employees begin to fear that he is no longer human but some kind of manbeast. Bannister himself also begins to fear that this is the case and his fears become deepened when the head of the rival logging company is torn apart by a pack of wolves. He starts to go slowly insane hallucinating that he is part of a pack of phantom ghost wolves running through the woods nearby ... but when the girl returns his love he snaps out of it and all is well. Yipee! Wolf Blood is the only time George Chesebro ever directed but he has acted in over four hundred movies. Ouch! He gives a good silent performance here and it seems fairly welldirected for it's time. The acting is pretty much what you expect from this period of film history  melodramatic and stagey with every movement and facial expression emphasised. It has it's dull moments but the last ten minutes or so are particularly memorable.While it's certainly not a classic this is a fairly interesting and entertaining silent movie and notable as George Chesebro's single directorial project.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful silent film set in a wilderness logging camp. I really wish that I had seen this on a big screen in a good print instead of on video with a lousy video source. The title comes from a man who gets a transfusion of wolf blood and begins to think he's a wolf. Its not a wolf man story despite what the material on the DVD box says. The rest most of the plot has to do with a new owner for the logging company and what happens when a young woman ends up in the woods and in the middle of a romantic triangle. Its not a bad film but its nothing spectacular. What I'm going to remember is the outdoor photography which is absolutely stunning. I'm in awe of how silent films have such great cinema verite shots of life that were often dropped into films.

	onyx:emotionText "Beautiful silent film set in a wilderness logging camp. I really wish that I had seen this on a big screen in a good print instead of on video with a lousy video source. The title comes from a man who gets a transfusion of wolf blood and begins to think he's a wolf. Its not a wolf man story despite what the material on the DVD box says. The rest most of the plot has to do with a new owner for the logging company and what happens when a young woman ends up in the woods and in the middle of a romantic triangle. Its not a bad film but its nothing spectacular. What I'm going to remember is the outdoor photography which is absolutely stunning. I'm in awe of how silent films have such great cinema verite shots of life that were often dropped into films. I know that the disappearance of the real life shot disappeared with the coming of sound because of the sound equipment was too bulky but at the same time documentary filming like that was never the same.

Dick is back to his old self in a few daysduring which time the fair Edith cares for himand falls for him.When Dick is up and about everything seems peachy and he is blissfully unaware of the canine blood within him. But a jerk who happens to be a TERRIBLE actor who knows the truth begins spreading the story about the wolf blood and people in the camp all begin acting strangely whenever Dick is about. Soon he too hears about the blood and he begins to believe the silly tales about him becoming a werewolf! Only after he is saved from killing himself by Edith does he and the audience learn the truththrough a very long exposition! Not exactly a terrific way to end a film huh?! This film has a decent story idea and it would have been better had it been made featuring competent actors and director. So although there should be suspense there really is none. The story comes off as silly and the occasionally bad acting of a few of the cast sure didn't help. Often with silents I cut them some slackafter all they are early films and so I compare them to other films of the same era. And compared to other silents of 1925 by which time the quality of films had become excellent it was poor all around and aside from an interesting plot idea the film has little to offerparticularly as the print is just awful.".

We did not need 35 minutes worth of background on romance and two rival logging companies because the film's focus is suppose to be on the wolf's blood in the man's veins. We really only needed about 10 to 15 minutes for the background NOT 35 minutes worth  they could have used the extra time to build suspense surrounding the wolf's blood in the man's vein and how it was effecting him psychologically local superstitions concerning werewolves etc.Now once we finally got to our werewolf the film was pretty good.... just not enough focus on the reason people would want to see the film lycanthropy  even if it is only in a person's mind.The movie is however worth watching just because it is the first surviving film on the subject and the second film ever made about it.

One chilling scene has the man who has been transfused with the wolf blood following after a pack of phantom wolves towards the edge of a cliff where the wolves jump off one by one. There is also a scene of a Roaring 20s party in full swing that has little to do with the rest of the movie but is of interest to fans of flappers and the culture of the 20s. One thing that always cracks me up watching silent films is the actors in them. Many of them are so ordinary looking that they could not possibly star in a Hollywood film today. The star here George Chesebro looks like a mechanic at a gas station but turns in a good performance nonetheless. Considered a forerunner of the Wolfman movies of the 40s but the Wolfman is only hinted at in this one.".

Unfortunately despite how it is marketed nowadays it's not a werewolf film. It isn't even a horror movie at all. Instead it's a melodrama with a little bit of fantasy elements added towards the end. Sadly the narrative is somewhat dull and the wolf material is only introduced three quarters of the way in. It's here where the film has some potential but it's too little too late.

Up until tonight I'd never seen a movie directedproduced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal Statham Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.If you read this review don't make the same mistake I did.

Jason Statham fights off big monsters who are armed with broadswords with what looks like a flimsy machete while Ron Perlman uses a pickaxe!. The opening scenes are amazingly clumsy they just dump you randomly into the story with no preamble. And I am so tired of the overused Chinese martial arts film clich of showing the audience a plain shot of mysterious badguys who suddenly aren't there as soon as the movie characters look  it's so cheaply manipulative. Lame predictable line follows lame predictable line.

Burt Reynolds comments on seaweed seemed singularly bizarre and produced heckling. That being said it had a few nice action bits and Michael Lillard was very funny probably on purpose.Way too long and in the QA afterwards Boll said there is a longer director's cut coming on DVD but if you're in the mood for fantasy have seen Lord of the rings recently so you don't want to watch it right now and don't mind actors hamming it up hello Ray Liotta you could do worse I suppose. No where near as bad as Bloodrayne if that means anything to you.".

King Burt Reynolds? Oh well. We have to admit that Ray Liotta's Goodfellas reprise as an evil mage was the most amazing thing we've seen since Jack Lemmon's service as Horatio in Branagh's Hamlet. Of course this mention of Uwe Boll's effort alongside Kenneth Branagh is totally appropriate except that Branagh's Hamlet had little entertainment value of any kind.

Nonetheless many of the second tier characters were convincing and well acted amidst all the mishmosh of incongruous effects and disaffects.

Boy I was wrong.Like previous reviewers that have posted before me I would say that this movie was choppy in that you never are watching one sceneactor for more than 5 minutes at a time. The back and forth between all the characters makes you feel a bit overwhelmed at first but after a while when you get to grasp the plot it just becomes annoying. It's like the Director is saying Okay now we've got to show you what's going on with these characters right this second even if what they're cutting to is inconsequential.The acting itself is underwhelming as is the script. The script calls for the cast to sound noble or poetic at times but it just comes off as cheesy. The plot was a bit outlandish but I cannot complain here as I knew it could be as this was a Fantasy. So you'd think that the special effects would redeem this as it's a big ActionAdventureFantasy type? Sorry the monsters didn't look more than a pile of mud wearing mud colored armor the battle scenes weren't anything special and the magic special effects weren't anything we haven't seen before with a few twists.Pros Jason Statham finally shows that a Boomerang can be a deadly weapon. Much Better than Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. Cons Choppy too long bad acting bad script subpar effects.".

I had never seen a movie by Uwe Boll prior to this and honestly had barely even heard of him except maybe in passing but certainly not enough to have an preconceptions about his work.That said this movie was definitely one of the top ten worst films I've ever seen in my 22 years of life. No scratch that... top five. The dialog is awful the writing is boring the action scenes are jerky and stupid and the characters are onedimensional and phenomenally uninteresting. This movie's got it all the humble farmer who just wants to be left alone the noble king who knows about seaweed and a villain who seems to have picked up his bad guy speak by following Skeletor around and taking notes.So with storytelling and writing in general being somewhere between incomprehensible and grating let's look at the fight scenes. The choreography was bad the same shots were used over and over again and I got the impression that nobody working on the movie knew how to actually USE a sword you do not fight with a longsword like you would with a rapier you simply do not nor did they have any comprehension on battlefield tactics. A few gems including why the Krugs are bringing siege engines to a battle in a forest and exactly where the human army traveling on foot with no wagons or ships managed to acquire boulders huge enough to roll down a hill and crush the enemy.So... pretty much this is the first and last Uwe Boll movie I'll ever see there is nothing good in this film and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at anytime. Even if you ABSOLUTELY MUST rid yourself of eight dollars you'll have more fun converting it into pennies putting it in a bag and tossing it off a bridge to watch the splash.".

There are many young filmmakers out there who could take the same script and a small portion of of his budgets and do a much better job than Mr. Boll.In The Name Of The King in my opinion is the worst movie ever made. Complete laziness from everyone. No actor took the time to work with a speech coach to achieve the proper accent. Ray Liotta sounds like he was fresh of the set of Goodfellas and Burt Reynolds as the king is laughable with his southern draw. But worst of all is Matthew Lillard who brought this turd to it's lowest point. I have been a fan of every actor in this movie but I have lost a lot of respect towards all of them. None of the music fit the tone of the scenes the editing was done by a blind twoyearold. All of the fighting and battle scenes were stolen from Walker Texas Ranger. The only thing this movie had going for it was the locations they were beautiful. But that's it no other redeeming quality at all.How on earth Uwe Boll continues to get money to make movies is beyond me. There are so many young filmmakers out there with the talent and inspiration that can't get a nickle to make what could be great films. Yet some continues to finance Bolls talentless pursuits into film making. Now is the time we should all stand together and stop buying tickets to see his films and stop renting or buying anything with his name on it. And maybe he will disappear with all of the crap he has given us The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because I can't give it negative stars".

Like slide through beneath the door flat. Not even cardboard. The combat scenes are fastpaced almost all the time in closeup aka what'sgoingon mode except for the final fight which was along the lines of who can spot the most MATRIX imitations. The evil wizard Ray Liotta? who cares... somehow lacks any qualities of being someone you love to hate spoiler? combined with evil's usual incompetence when dealing with the almost defeated good guys. spoiler The good king Burt Reynolds seems more bored than bothered by the events throughout the whole film. Ron Perlman is seen without a ton of makeup. Camera knows of two color tints for the film brown for all the outside scenes and reddish brown for all the dungeon scenes. Sky is generally either blaring white or pitch black image contrast is harsh and on some occasions when the camera sweeps across the rather nice landscape the results are blurry blotches. Some nice stunts and fight choreography while the camera does it's best to hide that by shaking and moving but that's about it.All in all slightly belowaverage fantasy fare.

But it was sort of like they called these people up and said How much to show up and stay till the final cut?. Then paid them just that amount gave them the scripts started filming but the had the director or producer work on something else. The acting was terrible. How do good actors act that poorly? Were they supposed to look like drama school dropouts? If so mission accomplished.Stay far far away from this movie. Watch anything else. Watch an infomercial watch paint dry just please don't watch this movie.".

The CGI is very impressive and i was surprised. The fight scenes are good and fun to watch. I actually enjoyed it.Things that let it down are 1 Matthew Lillard is a joke  he really cant act and makes you cringe when he speaks its so bad. 2 A terrible music score  people talk about how music can make a movie  imagine Jaws without the theme and Halloween without the tense music!! Well the music is so bad in this film it spoils it. I wonder how well it would have done with Hans Zimmer or the late John Williams behind the music 3 Nothing particularly new in the story very similar to parts of LOTR and EragonOverall i liked it and people who gave it such bad scores must not be into this sort of genre or are being too picky as its an enjoyable movie to watch.".

The dialogue is horrible the script and director give the actors nothing meaningful to work with and the setup is completely cardboard in its appeal.Don't get me wrong cardboard can be entertaining so long as some of the other elements of successful filmmaking come together as well. No such luck here.As other reviewers have pointed out the action choreography is lame the camera work weak the editing often insane the art direction and cinematography limited or nonexistent the musical score pointless at best...where to begin?Well I have nothing personal against a silly anachronistic amateurish action movie script that is concocted as a means of wiling away a harmless hour or two even when it results in bad acting because of the director's complete lack of vision. It's kind of fun to observe how certain actors manage themselves in such a void. And as bad as he was in his role as King Konreid Burt Reynolds was quite entertainingly cardboard in my opinion. He walked right through the role playing his bored wigwearing self and he was the only thing I could readily remember months after I had seen this movie. He was so bad he actually stood out amongst this filmic muck...for the wrong reasons of course.A friend of mine had loaned me the DVD along with several other movies he owns but I couldn't be sure months later whether I had returned this one or something similar. So after searching my place recently to no avail I was racking my brains for the name of the title and I finally resorted to searching online using Reynolds' name and the word king. That was all I could remember of this dud.Pretty sad huh? That my memory seems to be failing me. Or that Burt Reynolds in a miscast role is the most memorable thing in a movie starring Ray Liotta also miscast with Matthew Lillard also miscast. The list of miscast actors taking away career embarrassment and presumably hopefully a hefty paycheck in exchange for their participation in this 60m stinker continues most of the way down the line. A possible exception and what stands out in retrospect for me the most since my memory has now had a chance to be prompted by IMDb's cast listing for the movie is that I was barely able to recall John RhysDavies or Kristanna Loken in their respective fairly substantial roles here. I think this may be a compliment to the jobs they did because it may mean that they turned in acting performances that rose above the level of outright ridiculousness and they thereby avoided the WTF stare I was giving the rest of the cast.I can't be sure though. 'Cause none of this movie was memorable for the right reasons.".

The movie began with the grade of watchable. As the story developed I realised that I like it improving the rating to interesting. There were some quite good humorous scenes and the film's story itself made sense. There were battles that even made me care about the notsoimportant characters the generals near the end. The acting was also good in my opinion. The CGI if the landscapes were CGI which is probable were nice enough.I only never understood why Jason Statham never got some armour. The other good guys hang around with armours he saves the world with a cloth. They could've given him at least a chestplate... DMind you I've never played Dungeon Siege so my good opinion might be because of that.To sum up I really liked that film. I didn't expect to see The Lord of the Rings or something epic and grand. I expected a movie that does not deserve to be seen. But I saw one that does indeed deserve your time.This movie definitely was several grades better than most other titles in the fantasy genre like the ones they show on TV here in Bulgaria.

I've seen the movie I don't need to enjoy the scenes I just seen them?? Tell me about the film not about how Peter Jackson committed taxfraud with the 14 billion of stolen money from Germany next Commentary track give me information which I care about how did the actors do on the set how did you create the movie itself and why did you make certain choices. The movie The main actors did a good job. Easily said. They were believable they were into it and well typecast. The Krugs were just bad.. instead of spending 8 months of getting the right sound of the krugs which could have been done in an hour rrooaagg it should be checked how to make them scary instead of reminding me of the powerrangers... Jason Statham in a serious role he simply did a good job!! and is a great actor CGI some parts are very good swordfight books fog's etc. some where simply bad.. Don't exaggerate just to make it more fun.. the catapulting of krugs was just giving a bad touch to a good movie.. I know Boll wanted to give the battlefield something no one has seen before but maybe there is reason that other directors never showed it to us???? Continuity there are some mistakes but I don't think you will see them the first time you see it... Breaking the rules of nature.. When a boomerang hits something it won't come back unless it is a magic boomerang which it was not. Story Yes the story was fun it wasn't the script from e.g. Shawshank Redemption but it was OK This was just a nice movie to watch there will be some moments that you will be annoyed but there will also be a lot of moments on which you won't say a word. A nice movie to watch on a night off and I will rate this film with the 6 it deserves. Michael".

	schema:reviewBody "ABRAHAM LINCOLN United Artists 1930 directed by movie pioneer D.W.  Griffith is an interesting antique being Griffith's first of two  ventures in talking pictures. This movie about an American president is  more of Griffith's style in spite that his technique in movie  directing has become pass since the start of the roaring twenties.  Handicapped by its slow pacing Walter Huston gives a very fine  performance in his title role with Kay Hammond somewhat satisfactory  as his wife and later first lady Mary Todd Lincoln along with Ian  Keith adding fine support with his few scenes as John Wilkes Booth a  crazed stage actor who puts an end to Lincoln's life on that tragic day  of April 14 1865. However it is Una Merkel as Ann Rutledge Lincoln's  true love interest in the early portion of the story whose performance  weakens the film. This capable actress might have made a go with her  role if it weren't for some bad dialog she recites such as responding  to Lincoln following his proposal to her Yes Abe. You've got your  gingerbread. Then there are Griffith screen veterans of the silent  era Henry B. Walthall as Colonel Marshall Hobart Bosworth as General  Robert E. Lee and the great character actress Lucille LaVerne the  spiteful old hag in ORPHANS OF THE STORM 1921 appearing in an opening  scene as Mrs. Lincoln's midwife. Her raspy voice fits her personality  to a T.  With the screenplay by Stephen Vincent Benet this epic biography with  episodic events opens with the birth of a great man Abraham Lincoln  on February 12 1809. Moments later viewers find the infant now the  ugliest and smartest man in New Salem clerking at Denton Offut's  general store his romance with young Ann Rutledge who later dies and  functioning as a young lawyer. After he meets Mary Todd at a society  ball the scene shifts to Lincoln as a bridegroom having second  thoughts about attending his own wedding. He eventually marries her.  Move forward to the 1860 LincolnDouglas E. Alyn Warren debate  which as seen on screen is not much of a debate but just two  participants delivering a few words of dialog each. Lincoln wins the  presidency and is soon faced with his long battle with the Civil War  and placing Colonel Ulysses S. Grant Fred Warren in charge to put an  end to it. After the end of the war 1865 Lincoln wins his second term  election but doesn't live to fulfill it.  Originally released in theaters at 97 minutes ABRAHAM LINCOLN in  recent years has become a public domain title distributed by various  video companies most presenting bad copies with shorter lengths many  cut down to about 84 minutes some eliminating scenes with Lincoln  heading over towards the cemetery during a thunder storm crying over  Ann's grave another involving Lincoln tender moments with his youngest  son Tad Gordon Thorpe. After coming across these inferior copies in  video stores I've managed to locate an excellent and more accurate  video copy in 1986 compliments of Blackhawk Video. Not only was the  video print clear in both visuals and sound it included restored  events eliminated from reissue copies the ones that had played on Arts  and Entertainment channel Turner Classic Movies where it made its  debut March 8 2007 and many public television stations during the  late night hours. Reissue prints begin with a view of a log cabin and  sound track of whistling winds superimposed with the title of February  12 1809. In the nearly restored 93 minute video copy it begins with a  five minute prologue done in the silent film tradition showing slaves  being shipped to the United States followed by other historic events  and conversations amongst various politicians one of them played by  Henry Kolker before shifting towards the event of Lincoln's birth in  a log cabin. There are other silent sequences interacted into the story  later on as well as some off screen singing in the sound  track not shown in the edited versions.  It's been said that ABRAHAM LINCOLN was a financial and critical  success upon release. By today's standards it hasn't stood the test of  time. Future retelling on Lincoln's life YOUNG MR. LINCOLN 1939 with  Henry Fonda and ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS 1940 with Raymond Massey  are both excellent in their own way and continue to hold interest.  However Griffith's adaptation is the only one of the three mentioned  to focus on the Civil War. Regardless of its handicaps Griffith's  first talkie on the life of Lincoln has some interesting moments but  otherwise it's a rather dull affair. Worth viewing for history buffs  but aside from Lincoln's frequent remark The union must be  preserved don't expect an accurate history lesson out of this.  12".

In fact it was chosen as number two of the Ten Best Pictures of 1930 by The Film Daily just below All Quiet On The Western Front! Sadly due to the horrible condition of the available prints of this film no really fair analysis can be made today. As with so many early talkies Abraham Lincoln is now a sickly shadow of what it was in 1930. To begin with it's original running time is listed at approximately 96 minutes. The version presented on Laserdisc runs 83 minutes.The film shows signs of wear and duping. The soundtrack is horribly distorted and in several scenes seems to be missing totally replaced by terrible music from a stock library. Even so if one can look past these things and take the acting style in the context of its time one can see that Griffith had not lost his flair and would have probably continued directing had the fates and probably Hollywood not conspired against him. There are wonderful cinematic moments reminiscent of some of his earlier triumphs. This is a film that cries out for restoration but alas there is most likely little or nothing left to restore. UPDATE In 2008 KINO International released a DVD version of Abraham Lincoln that is far more complete than the old Laserdisc I reviewed from in 1998. While some soundtrack from the Prologue is still missing KINO has made up for it by adding subtitles for the missing dialogue. Also the picture quality is far superior to anything else available. It is evident that much effort went into making this forgotten film much more watchable and available!".

	schema:reviewBody "This being a presidential election year made me curious about this early talkie. I had seen it before but it's been a while and so I wanted to actually go through a diagnosis of the movie itself. So I dragged out an old AE VHS made copy. Griffith had tackled the Booth assassination of Lincoln before in the silent Birth of A Nation. Here he did it in sound and Ian Keith is great as John Wilkes Booth SIC TEMPER TYRANNIS... As he yells after he shoots Lincoln at Ford's theatre and jumps onto the stage. And Walter Huston is much more Lincolnesque than Henry Fonda would be ten years later. Also the scene where Lincoln  U.S. Grant are conversating over cigars was kind of priceless. Una Merkel is compelling in an early film performance as Lincoln's first wife Ann Rutledge.This was Griffith's first sound film and he shows a somewhat uneasiness with the new medium but what director didn't in 1930. Griffith faired better than most. If you can look past the oldness of the film you'll see that this is pretty much a straight forward  accurate  well madeby 1930 standards telling of the events of Lincoln's life. The sort of way Masterpiece Theatre would later tell stories episodically over many hours decades later. Griffith shows an aptitude for shooting that had already happened in  the late silents of Hollywood. He makes quality use of the moving camera. Roving in and out of some scenes. The shot where the soldiers are fighting in trenches during the Civil War are similar to the same kind of shot Lewis Milestone did in All's Quiet On the Western Front which also came out in 1930. But even both of these films hark back to Griffith's own scene in Birth of A Nation where the South is battling the North and the Colonel jumps out of the trench to stoke a cannon. This was not Griffith's first experiment with sound. He had shot some experimental dialogue scenes for his 1921 feature Dream Street. A short 1921 intro to Dream Street with Griffith talking up the film still exists as well as a 1930 sitdown interview with Huston promoing Abraham Lincoln. But Abraham Lincoln showed a 'newer' Griffith. Moving away from the static camera of which he was famous and adopting a more fluid style which was recently introduced by some German directors. Griffith even this late still liked old fashioned 19th century melodrama stories. Lincoln's life story is certainly a subject he could sink his teeth into. He had done bits and parts of Lincoln's life before particularly the Ford's Theatre scene in BoAN. Abraham Lincoln is Not necessarily a great film nor the best of 1930 but a very interesting foray into sound by a great film pioneer and like mentioned before a lot of the Lincoln life is covered quite surprisingly well.".

The film uses an appreciative tone and does not fairly represent Lincoln's considerable political acumen and the very calculated campaign strategies which put him in office. Instead Griffiths chose to present Lincoln as the good but somewhat melancholic president we know him to have been.The story is told in a series of vignettes depicted in scenes of about equal length  probably a limitation of the film technology available at the time. This mode of presentation does nothing to reduce the boredom factor. Most of the lines are pronounced very clearly with lengthy unnatural pauses between each line. Clearly Griffiths was a little uncomfortable in the new sound medium and did not wish to experiment a great deal with it. The film picks up a bit as the civil war becomes its main focus. And some of the battle scenes are classic Griffiths' nearsilent cinematography. However even this is somewhat muted by the scenes of the president brooding over the dispatches he receives from his generals describing defeat after defeat.Recommended for early film buffs and young Lincoln afficionados only".

Clearly Griffiths was a little uncomfortable in the new sound medium and did not wish to experiment a great deal with it. The film picks up a bit as the civil war becomes its main focus. And some of the battle scenes are classic Griffiths' nearsilent cinematography. However even this is somewhat muted by the scenes of the president brooding over the dispatches he receives from his generals describing defeat after defeat.Recommended for early film buffs and young Lincoln afficionados only";

Today however this is not a very exciting film. It succeeds somewhat as a series of staged vignettes depicting stories about President Lincoln.Walter Huston is given the difficult job of portraying the revered Lincoln and he excels after a shaky start. Director D.W. Griffith employs a fine supporting cast with mixed results. Early scenes are hampered by the characterizations offered by Una Merkel as Ann Rutledge and Kay Hammond as Mary Todd these are the romances of Lincoln's life and they are awful. The courtship scenes involving Mr. Huston and Ms. Merkel are particularly absurd. Henry B. Walthall is notable later on but. he doesn't have much to do. It might have been interesting to see Mr. Walthall play John Wilkes Booth  admittedly this was an unlikely consideration at the time and Ian Keith is perfectly suitable in the role. Walthall graciously supports Hobart Bosworth as Robert E. Lee during his screen time and Mr. Bosworth is outstanding.There is no mystery in the main story elements he was born in a log cabin and is assassinated in the end. Griffith acquaints himself well with sound in a film though in hindsight it is a technical weakness. There are moments or flashes of greatness in the film but they don't contribute to a collective work of consequence. Griffith treats Lincoln with a reverence that is oddly uncomfortable by the film's end the story structure confirms Lincoln has become Divine. The ending reprise of Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on... nicely evokes both John Brown's Body and the Battle Hymn of the Republic. An appropriate connection.  Abraham Lincoln 82530 D.W.

Huston's size also seems to vary from scenes to scene depending on the actors around him for a truly odd effect The rest of the film is a throw back to the cinema preBirth of a Nation with much of the scenes arranged in odd tableaux. To be certain part of it maybe the uncertainty of early sound equipment however the result is like watching stuffed animals in a museum. The script is awful. It zips through Lincoln's life faster then cliff notes pausing only for romance jokes and the odd highlight. Only one scene works Lincoln's legendary late night walking the halls of the White House. Its a sequence that is strangely poignant. The rest of this film is like watching a bad road accident. Even allowing for the passage of 80 years I can't believe anyone ever took this film seriously.

	schema:reviewBody "D.W. Griffith's 'Abraham Lincoln' is one hell of a film still today as it was back in the 30s. It sure is fitting that Kino decided to release this particular film now what with the recent election and Spielberg's big budget 'Lincoln' film still in theaters. Not too mention that since the 2012 election we are seeing several states trying to secede from the union a very real scenario back when Lincoln was president as well. What might set this particular film aside from the rest of the Abraham Lincoln centered films besides this one being one of the first films to be solely about the 16th president is that Griffith's 'Abraham Lincoln' covers the entire life from birth to death of the legendary president.Plus Griffith's 'Abraham Lincoln' is an opposing look to his previous film 'The Birth of Nation' the latter being a very racially charged film being released in 1915. 'Abraham Lincoln' jumps around quite a bit as we have to get the full span of Lincoln's life in under 100 minutes. The film starts off on a slave ship and cuts to a log cabin where Lincoln is born and given his name. We immediately jump to a young twenty something Lincoln Walter Huston having fun with some friends in a bar as he lifts a giant barrel of alcohol to drink. We also get to see a young Abraham become smitten with his first love Ann Rutledge Una Merkel win a wrestling match and being a fun loving charming and powerful young man. It's great to see our 16th president be a normal guy as he studies law and is always ready and willing to be intimate with his girl.However Ann becomes ill and passes away. Abraham becomes a broken man and even resorts to lying down on top of her grave because he misses her so much. But since the film's runtime is short we swiftly move into Lincoln meeting his wife Mary Todd Kay Hammond as we see Abraham dive into his early political career then onto his presidency where we get the epic beard.As this film is more of a dialogue driven film rather than epic battle sequences we don't see a lot of action during the Civil War. This movie focuses more on the emotional and psychological state of Lincoln. It was great to see how the name Honest Abe became about and how frustrated and sadden Lincoln is during this war time. But when Lincoln isn't bogged down by the important serious issues he is actually a fun and silly guy one you might want to hang out with.This is one of Griffith's last movies he made and it is a pretty straight forward film without a lot of creative art direction. And we all know that the Gettysburg Address was one of Lincoln's biggest moments however that whole speech was not given any screen time. I was hoping for an extra on this disc that discussed why but unfortunately there is none. However there are a several key moments in the film that lead up to the murder of Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth Ian Keith.If it wasn't for Huston's performance as Lincoln I'd say this was a pretty lackluster attempt at making a film about our 16th president. That being said I think this is worth a look if you haven't seen it especially on bluray.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Griffith had stuck to Lincoln's personal life this could have been an interesting amusing and occasionally insightful film. Griffith gives us a multilayered and largely accurate portrait of Lincoln the man. We see the ungainly country lawyer countrified in speech and manner often serious even melancholy but with a rare ability to find humor in the most unlikely places and to laugh even at himself. We see Lincoln the inveterate storyteller the insomniac the doting father the determined commanderinchief the patient husband. If this had been the whole of the film it would have been easy to overlook its painfully outdated style and to forgive its frequent omissions and exaggerations as poetic license.Unfortunately the film necessarily includes Lincoln's political life and here it moves from poetic license to outright falsehood. Slavery was the central issue of Lincoln's political career a fact that Griffith tries to obscure going so far as to turn Lincoln's pivotal 'House Divided' speech into an argument against secession. This is particularly ironic since it was really Lincoln's battle cry against encroaching slavery. When South Carolinians seceded two years later this was the speech they pointed to as proof that when Lincoln took office the slaveholding States will no longer have the power of selfgovernment ... and the Federal Government will have become their enemy. During Lincoln's presidency the question of slavery occupied much of his time and attention yet again Griffith chooses to ignore it. His Lincoln spends more time admiring the courage of Confederate soldiers than worrying about slavery. Even the Emancipation Proclamation gets only the briefest attention. Lincoln reads a line from the document signs it and says Well gentlemen it is done. It's oddly dismissive coming from a man who considered emancipation the central act of his presidency and the most meaningful act of his life.Denied his opposition to slavery and concomitant commitment to democracy and the inalienable rights of man Lincoln is reduced to endlessly repeating The Union must be preserved. Why it must be preserved is left to the audience's imagination. The film never gives us the slightest clue.".

Walter Huston's portrayal is good but the makeup is better especially in the later years. This is a technically well made film and Griffith does some good montage sequences to bring us from scene to scene but watching this movie is almost like reading a history book. Granted Lincoln is a treasured part of America but still a human being in my book. This was made during a time when we wanted our heroes fullproof unlike today where we like to see all sides of individuals. Therefore the movie doesn't age well. Sure this is a good bit of history that can be viewed in a classroom but not enjoyed in a movie house. Again maybe our enlightened age just dampers the viewing but I have to say it how I see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its historical accuracy may be questionable but overall I still thought this portrayal of the life of Abraham Lincoln directed by the famous D.W. Griffith was an interesting enough film certainly helped by a very good performance from Walter Huston in the title role and by a very human interpretation of Lincoln himself who is often portrayed as an almost messianic figure but whose life here is shown to be a generally unhappy one as Lincoln deals with the death of his only true love Ann Rutledge who I thought was well played by Una Merkel is saddled with a largely unhappy marriage to Mary Todd Kay Hammond and of course deals with the carnage of the Civil War once in the White House. The first half of the movie feels more like a series of vignettes of Lincoln's early life with little flow to it. The second half of the movie deals exclusively with the Civil War although even in this depiction much is left out. There's a lot of focus on Lincoln's decision to make Grant the Union Commander for example but nothing on the earlier decision to relieve McLellan from command which caused Lincoln a lot of problems. It's clearly and accurately pointed out here that Lincoln's real concern was not with ending slavery but was rather with preserving the Union. The line the Union must be preserved or variations of it is spoken at least 10 times in less than an hour and a half. The portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln is not a flattering one. She comes across as grasping selfcentred and controlling and some modern historians believe that she was schizophrenic although these qualities also lead to a bit of humour in the movie as Lincoln tells Grant he may take up smoking after Grant's cigar smoke drives Mary away.Having recently watched his silent classic The Birth Of A Nation I continue to be surprised by D.W. Griffith's very positive take on Lincoln. Griffith clearly sympathized with the South here Lee comes across as quite noble and seeking to avoid bloodshed as the war nears its end while Grant is portrayed as a drunkard and yet it's also clear that he thought highly of Lincoln who was portrayed as very sympathetic to the South to the point at which he wanted Jefferson Davis to be allowed to escape. All things considered this isn't a bad movie at all especially considering that it's a very early example of a talkie and the technical quality of the movie shows that moviemakers still had a lot to learn about the new medium. 710".

While director D.W. Griffith is often portrayed as a racist due to his earlier BIRTH OF A NATION one must remember that he was a product of his time and of his southern roots. His scene of General Lee nearly overcome with fatigue in his tent near the end of the war after saving the life of a Union spy indicates that he wanted to show the humanity of the Confederacy's leader was no less than that of Lincoln. But he merely uses this to show that the Confederate struggle had its good points which takes nothing away from the Lincoln story. It's clear that Griffith must have greatly admired Lincoln and he does a masterful job in bringing him to life. His images of Lincoln Lee and other historical figures are perfectly craftedby his use of makeup and finding actors to play those parts. His casting of Walter Huston in the title role was a stroke of brilliance and his First Lady on screen was played equally well. It's not Griffith's best work by a long shot but he proved he could have been a capable director of talking pictures if he'd been given the chance. Sadly he only made one more film after this. While he probably deserves more acclaim for his pioneering work in the film industry this film is well written by Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Vincent Benet and directed by one of the true giants of the silver screen. As a historical writer I heartily recommend it as a fine way to learn more about our 16th President while enjoying the work of a true master filmmaker. Dale Roloff".

	schema:headline " Not Much to Do With Politics War or Abraham Lincoln";
	schema:reviewBody "Abraham Lincoln is a 1930 film based on the life of the sixteenth president of the United States of America. The story follows Lincoln from his birth through adulthood and into the hardships of his presidency. The film is a dramatized version of Lincoln's biography and essentially goes through every important event in Lincoln's life.One of the best parts of the film is the uncanny resemblance between the lead actor and Abraham Lincoln. This doppelganger effect helps the actor achieve a very convincing Lincoln. Some of the humor in the film still holds up and you'll get some laughs from the dialogue. It is also nice to see such a friendly political debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. The point versus point format of the debate in the film appears more realistic and civil than what we have in reality.Unfortunately there is much about the film that can be criticized. There are spots of bad acting throughout such as the I'm angry folding of the arms and pouting bottom lip routine. There are awkward camera stares by the characters that are meant to accentuate their points but instead are confusing and do anything but accentuate. Lincoln said three times that he wanted to preserve the Union and then looks directly at the camera and practically yells it. Is he talking to me or is there a character directly behind the camera he is speaking to? There are corny melodramatic moments especially between Lincoln and his first wife. The movie moves from one event to the next at a breakneck speed never allowing the story or characters to develop. His ascension to presidency is clumsily foreshadowed in his early years repeatedly. Far too often. Not to mention the fact that Lincoln's wife Mary Todd is completely insufferable.The cynicism of the Mary Todd character is not based on any historical inaccuracies it is the fact that we are shown her vapid and selfish personality and it is never addressed or resolved. We know that she was pursuing Lincoln before she met him due to his potential wealth and power. But why does Lincoln like her? For that matter why does Lincoln have the political feelings that he is so adamant about? The film never addresses the conflicts and thoughts of the characters. Of course we can learn what has happened in history ourselves but the movie itself does nothing in this regard and honestly should have been the basis of the story. The audience knows the historical chronological events but when the why of the matter is dropped the film loses all feeling and meaning. Instead of developing the character of Lincoln we are given a checklist of important events which are then dramatized.I do not recommend this film to anyone. If you want to explore the personality and life of Abraham Lincoln you're not going to get it here. If you want a civil war movie you're not going to get that either. If your intent is to delve into the slavery debate at the time that doesn't exist in this film. Perhaps you're simply interested in Lincoln's personal life and his familial relationships. You won't get that either. I hate to say it but this is definitely one of the worst Abraham Lincoln films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early talkie biopic of Abraham Lincoln by D.W. Griffith and starring Walter Huston in the title role. This has the distinction of being the first sound film directed by Griffith he only did two and for its script cowritten by Stephen Vincent Bent. It covers Lincoln's whole life and features pretty much all of the things you have likely seen or read about before. The film plays fast and loose with historical accuracy as biopics generally do for dramatic purposes. This doesn't upset me but it greatly bothers other viewers. If you're the type to be angered by biographical pictures that take liberties with facts then you will likely hate this.It's a creaky movie and more than a little melodramatic. Neither of those things is surprising given when this was made. Huston does a good job and the rest of the cast is fine. I see Una Merkel singled out a lot in criticisms of this movie and I can kind of see why. I happen to like Una and think she was a wonderful talent particularly with comedy. But this is early in her career and here she's like nails on a chalkboard. Thankfully she's only in the movie for a little bit at the beginning. The biggest problem with the movie is that it just drags on and on. Even when exciting things are happening it just seems so dull. Film history buffs will probably enjoy it more than most. For those looking for a more entertaining movie about Lincoln see Abe Lincoln in Illinois or Young Mr. Lincoln instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "If You Are The One didn't enjoy too long a run at the local cinemas here although it did make it to one of my favourites of the year 2008. I had reservations whether Chinese director Feng Xiaogang could make an outright romantic film despite being known for more big budgeted spectacles such as Assembly and the recent Aftershocks and he had proved me wrong then. However this first attempt at making a follow up film of his own didn't fare too well bringing to mind if one doesn't have a proper and strong story to work on then a sequel will never make sense.What I found extremely charming in the first film besides the point of pairing Ge You and Shu Qi opposite each other as unlikely lovers in a sort of beauty and the beast old cow versus tender grass situations will be the tremendous amount of witticisms that Feng had put into his film sharing delightful nuggets of jibes sayings and idiosyncrasies of his observation of relationships and modern love. Yes there were some picturesque locations to sweeten the deal as well but that was something secondary to the main plot a backdrop serving as staple to all romantic films.In this effort however we flit from the Great Wall of China right down to Le Meridien's Shimei Bay Beach Resort in Hainan Island note to self to must check this out one day and to chic Beijing only for the locales to become what's the highlight of the film and the story taking a firm backseat. Not only that the narrative was in really a tale of two halves the first being a firm continuation from where we left off and tried to preserve plenty of positives from the original but the second was somewhat a letdown as it dealt with a different kind of relationship in that of friendship between Ge You's Qin Fen and Sun Honglei's Xiangshan the latter who is found to be suffering from an incurable disease.There were plenty of scenes that didn't make much sense nor to further the plot making the close to two hour film a really long plod to the finishing line. Starting with a Divorce Ceremony which was really unnecessary there was a beauty pageant that you don't get to see many beauties an after event rave party a wine auction and a farewell party which I think is the fad here even from Bollywood with its fairly recent Guzaarish. All these scenes serve little interest and purpose other than to announce to the world that China has arrived check out that homage shot on the military's naval warship too and to show off how ostentatious the filthy rich in China can truly be.The lack of chemistry between Ge You and Shu Qi somehow took a really wrong turn here and the differences in their characters really stood out so much so that the best scenes here don't involve the lovebirds at all which is a pity since their togetherness or attempts at being together served as a highlight. When the same got treated here it somehow rang into the familiar territory that the Twilight films possess with the protagonists stuck in an endless YesNo aimai state of mind with Qin Fen being adamant in wanting to make his trial marriage to Shu Qi's Xiao Xiao work but then spending most of their time throwing a tantrum and the latter realizing that it's not actually love she's experiencing. I do get the point Qin Fen is trying to make about eventually needing his wife to care for him since he's significantly older but isn't this trial marriage plan nothing but a sham designed to stifle relationships rather than to enhance it? We become caught up with a lot of whatif's instead of trying to live the now in life and being lost in the many indecision that come to plague a relationship that's just trying too hard to make it work. And what this couple were trying to dabble in is in some ways uncanny to Nicholas Tse's love philosophy ok something which I read online which deals with four stages from Passion Romance Family Love then Friendship the latter most which is what Qin Fen and Xiao Xiao are trying to see if it will work since the first two are likely to exist in the early stages of any relationship and Family Love well being out of topic in this film.This could be director Feng Xiaogang's unfortunate first dud and I hope there won't be another halfhearted attempt with his next although the doors were blatantly thrown wide open for a possible follow up on this one. If that happens then hopefully it'll bring back the magical charms of what made the first film tick and banish this as a blip like those temporal hiccups found in almost all relationships.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to agree with the previous 3 reviewers. A sequel to a romance movie has to answer the question what happens once the couple finally gets together? Inevitably the answer is disappointing since no one really wants to see them fall out and spend another movie's duration trying to figure out if they belong together or not. But that's what this movie does and throws in all matter of contrivances to occupy the characters' attention while they are separated.

	onyx:emotionText "I have to agree with the previous 3 reviewers. A sequel to a romance movie has to answer the question what happens once the couple finally gets together? Inevitably the answer is disappointing since no one really wants to see them fall out and spend another movie's duration trying to figure out if they belong together or not. But that's what this movie does and throws in all matter of contrivances to occupy the characters' attention while they are separated.

One of my friends who is usually uncritical and easily entertained said he thought that The Tree of Life made more sense than this film.Unlike Terrence Malick's metaphysical masterpiece however there is no confusion here as to what the subject matter is it's the life of professional gamblers what is confusing is how that subject matter is presented and how the narrative is or isn't constructed around it. For example what was the intended tone of the movie what was the filmmaker trying to convey? Was it supposed to be amusing? entertaining? or moving? were we supposed to be excited or to feel intellectually stimulated? Who knows. My main emotional reaction to the film was a kind of repulsion because I felt like I was being exploited like the film was insulting my intelligence and my basic humanity. Like I might expect to feel if I'd been suckered into spending an evening feeding coins to a slot machine.The first 10 minutes were slightly amusing to be fair but after that that it just descends into complete mindnumbing absurdity. You might think Vince Vaughn would offer some comicrelief but for the brief appearances he makes he's just going through the motions though it's still the most convincing and consistent performance of the movie. There was no tension or intrigue at all for the first seventy minutes. I mean nothing seems to really matter to any of the characters they behave so unrealistically and incoherently. And when things finally seem to get real and there is some adversity for the characters to face you just don't care because you can't feel sympathy for such pantomime puppets as these. They could have gone more into the details the mechanics of the gambling operation that might have been interesting but they thought it would be better to pad the story out with completely vapid romanticinterest scenes.Maybe with the attraction of Willis ZetaJones Vaughn and Rebecca Hall's legs it was thought that such things as humour narrative direction consistency and pacing character development etc. were unnecessary. After seeing the movie I learned that it was adapted from a book that at least goes some way towards explaining why there were so many undeveloped seemingly irrelevant details obviously included for the sake of those that have read it. For example Holly Laura Pripon's character keeps warning Beth that she is becoming one of us in the book there might be context for this but when you watch the film you're just like what is this I don't even....But even for those that have read the book maybe moreso this film will only bemuse and bewilder. While I'm informed the book was written in a 'picaresque' and no doubt droll not to mention selfdeprecating style on screen without the benefit of a narrator this translates into characters like Beth who starts off as some kind of cartoonairheadbimbostripper sunbathing with babyoil on her back ending up as an extraordinarily articulate mathematical genius who goes on to become a writer... Rebecca Hall was a bad choice.And another thing I couldn't help feeling that this film was nottoosubtly trying to indoctrinate me. Maybe I'm just paranoid but beyond just the obvious product placements nice Mercedes being driven by Bruce Willis' Mr. Nice character it's like they're glamorizing the lifestyle and completely glossing over any moral issues and Beth just follows the money from Las Vegas to New York to Curaao are we supposed to admire that to forget about community and meaningful relationships just go where the money is and keep working and consuming?.Whatever I've wasted enough time on this drivel already please heed my warning and don't waste yours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lay the Favorite has many dissenters most complaining that it's completely unbelievable. It's true it is. Beth Rebecca Hall is a ditzy bimbo who quits her job as a stripper and moves to Las Vegas to become a cocktail waitress. A great idea! Instead as soon as she arrives she gets a very lucrative job as a sports bettor for a bookie who isn't a bookie since bookmaking is illegal. She's a genius with numbers and words.She's also capable of getting guys to do whatever they think she wants. They need to do the thinking since she's too dumb to even know what she wants. The kicker to this story of an oversexed ditzy bimbo numbers genius sportsbetting millionaire is that it's a true story. I decided to watch the YouTube video of the real Beth Raymer reading from her memoir which this film is based on to see if Hall accurately captured her varying characteristics. And she did. She does the hair twirl and the dumb girl giggle as she describes the kings of sports gambling giving her job after job after job.I'm one of the few who liked Rebecca Hall in this. So different from her usual indie fare. She has to ooze sex and play beautiful even though she has never really been described that way before. But in order to like this movie at all you need to care about this floozy. Other than her ridiculous free ride through life nothing really interesting happens to her. Her first job in Vegas is with Dink Bruce Willis who owns Dink Inc. She loves him he loves her  mind? Yeah right. Apparently he does. So when she gets herself in trouble along with a nice smart successful guy Joshua Jackson who doesn't seem to mind throwing his life away for her he comes to the rescue. Personally I found Hall's sexy naivet and Willis' extreme gambling entertaining enough to keep watching. However the movie doesn't seem to play the unfortunate reality that this is a true story for laughs. When there's a story too unbelievable to be true then you should be making fun of everybody who allowed it to occur instead the film just wanted the audience to go along for a fun ride. It is somewhat fun it's also very unbelievable and ultimately pretty stupid.Who Might Like This Anybody who likes seeing ditzy bimbos succeed in life people who like watching unbelievably true stories fans of Rebecca Hall.".

It is somewhat fun it's also very unbelievable and ultimately pretty stupid.Who Might Like This Anybody who likes seeing ditzy bimbos succeed in life people who like watching unbelievably true stories fans of Rebecca Hall.";

Willis seems jaded Vaughn merely rehashes his loud and brash comedy routine for the umpteenth time and Jackson gets a boring role and looks bored playing it. ZetaJones has slightly more to get her teeth into as the sharptongued rich bitch Tulip some viewers might get a kick out of hearing her screech the C word at her long suffering husband but later in the film her character mellows out somewhat and quickly loses her appeal as a result. It seems ironic that ZetaJones chose this of all films to return to screen acting after a three year hiatus can this really be the best offer that came along? The incomprehensible gambling jargon makes many scenes all but impossible to follow. Worse still the plot never builds to a dramatic conflict worth caring about. Things just amble around meaninglessly for an hour and a half or so then the film ends. Overall Lay The Favorite is a waste of time and talent. The book upon which it is based Lay The Favorite A Memoir of Gambling by the real Beth Raymer is reportedly a rather fascinating read. If that's the case put your chips on the book because the film is an utter donkey.".

I thought maybe it was doing some kind of retro pretend to be a B movie thing that would have some good laughs over how ironically lame it was. Nope. It really just is a B movie and a terrible one at that that somehow managed to trick big stars into it. I kept gasping in disbelief that the movie really could be that bad and still have big names. I thought maybe it was some lost movie that they decided to release now for some reason but even that didn't make sense because even Bruce Willis' first movies were leagues better. When I saw the cast list I thought this would have to be at least okay. I mean it has B. Willis C. ZetaJones V. Vaughn J. Jackson and L. Prepon. All well know actors and usually in decent films. I still can't believe that every one of these actors actually decided to do this film. It is just mindblowing. This is easily the worst film of all of their careers and the worst acting any of them has ever done. Even these stars couldn't overcome the script and make themselves look like good actors. If you were only listening and not paying much attention you wouldn't even know it was them seriously. Then you would look up half way through the movie and it would blow your mind that it was these stars you were listening to bumbling through their terribly lines. Nothing about this movie was accurate or realistic at all. The script is terrible the acting is terrible and it looks like it was filmed by amateurs using cameras they bought from Futureshop. How did this movie possibly cost 20 million? I kid you not Kevin Smith's Clerks looks like it has higher production value than this. No real plot either. No twists no nothing. There is not one single interesting thing in this movie. I was only able to get through it so I could verify that it was bad all the way through. It is one of those movies you keep watching only because you just can't believe it is THAT bad. The main character is played by Rebecca Hall a complete unknown and my god what an atrocious acting job. Get ready for one of the worst I can'tbelievetheyputthispersoninamovie performances you have ever seen. I feel bad for the girl working with such a poor script even Willis appeared to be a bad actor in this but man I would be terribly surprised if she ever gets an acting job again unless it is just for sex appeal.I just can't emphasize how terrible this was. Just astonishingly bad. You won't believe your eyes. The only remotely redeeming quality is that Laura Prepon's breasts make an appearance and I say this only jokingly. It certainly won't do anything for her career to get naked in this mess of a film.The movie The Room is actually better than this and it is widely regarded as the worst movie ever made.".

And part of the reason for that is you got millions of people out there who can't appreciate a movie unless it's full of catch phrases and one liners and dramatic emphasis and cornball speeches and overly dramatic acting what this movie has is sooo much better. It has reality. Beth Rebecca Hallis a stripper from Tallahassee who wants to get out of her shitty life and find something bigger something better. And well of course when your a stripper what isn't a better job right? So her big dream is to be a cocktail waitress in Vegas. And that is where it all starts. You see in this movie you won't find any phrases that will linger in movie history or incredibly enigmatic characters that will be imprinted on our memory forever what you will have is something much better you will walk away from this movie with your belief that if you want something bad enough you can make it happen renewed and strengthened again. It makes you feel like if Beth a slightly ditsy but secretly smart stripper from Florida can make something from nothing surely there's still hope for you. Beth encounters a myriad of people who all teach her something about surviving. One of the other critics of this show said all she does is follow the money well in reality most of us don't have money growing from a tree in the back yard we have to follow the money that's how we eat! As Beth points out at one point in the movie to another person when he says money isn't everything that's always what people with money say. This movie is a slice of a small persons life. That's all just a slice a small slice of a small person but that's why it's relateable. These people are real these events happen to people that's why you can relate to Beth and why you root for her all through the movie even when you want to bonk her on the head. And at one point in the movie when one of the characters Holly refers to herself and others as one of them or when she refers to herself as one of us what she's talking about are street people. It may be hard to understand but there are the normal people who go around doing everything that makes sense and they generally do pretty well. They have jobs and cars and spouses. They are always on time for work they work hard they take pride in their work they are honest they don't lie and they don't steal. Then there are street people. Street people will tell you that they are loyal and honest and true and that they will always be there for you but in reality they lie to your face all the time they rob you blind while stabbing you in the back and sometimes in the face sometimes figuratively and sometimes literally and yet while they do these things to each other they repeatedly deal with each other anyway. They work with and hire the same thieves addicts liars and backstabbers repeatedly and don't understand why they wouldn't. These are the street people the them and the us that is referred to now and then. Beth came from the street and wants to become a normal person and she learns how to survive from the other street people whilst learning who she doesn't want to be. She meets 1 street person Dink who ends up becoming semi normal and a better person at the end and she meets Jeremy who is cute and incredibly normal and loyal to Beth to the end and she wants to become normal like him and be with him and this movie is how she gets there. Another critic of this movie said your not sure if your supposed to be moved or disgusted or if it's supposed to be humorous or sad realize that if you have to have someone tell you what your supposed to feel that that is very sad. You should know your own mind well enough to know if something strikes you as funny or moving or not without needing someone to tell you if your supposed to be or not. This movie is not going to hand you a moral on a silver plate nor does life you have to look for the lessons. This movie is based in reality the other critics said that the performances were Lukewarm but that's because they didn't get what the actors were doing. They were playing real people not scripted characters. Real people aren't larger than life. They're just trying to live like everyone else. On the contrary these actors turned in phenomenal performances as characters they have never had to play before. Normal people. And they did it excellently. Would you ever say you would ever see Bruce Willis playing a weak asshole? No! But he does it so well and so convincingly that it's fantastic to watch.".

Rebecca Hall plays a ditzy quite annoying stripper who becomes a Las Vegas high rolling pro gambler within the blink of an eye utilising her Rain man style abilities that are mentioned once and never spoken of ever again. It really is amazing how easy it is to get a well paying job in this movie so much so that in this universe there's no such thing as poverty and everyone retires at 22. Bruce Willis plays the boss of a group of gambling speculators and even he managers to annoy with his character who doesn't seem to accept that betting on anything is massively risky and requires nothing more than blind luck to succeed. While Catherine ZetaJones and Joshua Jackson are hardly featured and play mostly pointless roles anyway. Overall this managers to be both mundane dry and straitlaced yet still a bit of a mess.".

	schema:reviewBody "The pull of this film for me was the cast Bruce Willis Joshua Jackson Catherine ZetaJones and Vince Vaughan... and that it looked a funny premise. I didn't realise it was based on a true story  the story of Beth Beth Raymer who leaves small town America to make a life for herself in the big city bright lights of Vegas. I always enjoy stories where girls build themselves up from nothing doing whatever it takes and I liked Beth's outlook on life well played by Rebecca Hall lightheartedly and convincingly. Her character was flighty and silly and it is nice to see such a story where horrible things didn't happen to her lucky! Other than the language in this film the worst of which is from the Welsh lips of Ms ZetaJones almost unrecognisable as American Tulip both in terms of look and character it's pretty innocent some topless sunbathing excepting. Bruce Willis wasn't so Bruce Willis as usual and I liked his wayward yet lovable character and he brought some much needed contour to otherwise quite flat performances. During the film I did wonder why everyone was so onedimensional but as it's a true story they were I suppose just going with the story that happened  some of the reactions people had were unexplained as were Beth's seemingly easy transitions. The gorgeous and talented Joshua Jackson was underutilised in this film as an actor but seeing as it was a characterbased biopic there's not much that could be done about that. Vince Vaughan managed to be exactly who he usually is in films and Laura Prepon as Holly had a good small part character role which she did really well in.The film is about gambling so I didn't understand all that went on but there were moments where it was quite tense given what was being done was illegal but the end was predictable but as it's a true story why shouldn't it be? You cared enough about the characters that you did want a happy ending and it's nice that Beth's good personality and sunny disposition wins out and all is well. As films go  biopic aside  it's not that great as it wasn't particularly challenging or deep and the main character's antics were nave and rather silly so you find her a little annoying but she was plucky and from the point of view of the real person she did very well for herself. It is what it is. It entertained for an hour or so but I'm glad I didn't see it at the cinema as I would have been disappointed as it wasn't as funny as I expected. It's definitely an average middle of the road standard film on all counts screenplay direction and performances but it's worth watching.".

Rebecca Hall looks rather old to be playing the lead and although she is energetic her quirks tend to be off putting. Willis and Zeta Jones do not fare any better. Vince Vaughn has a small and thankless role and only Joshua Jackson comes off best.Its a light tale that is neither funny satirical or even show the thrill of sports book gambling. It does not amount to much despite the star wattage and a usually reliable director.".

Rebecca Hall looks rather old to be playing the lead and although she is energetic her quirks tend to be off putting. Willis and Zeta Jones do not fare any better. Vince Vaughn has a small and thankless role and only Joshua Jackson comes off best.Its a light tale that is neither funny satirical or even show the thrill of sports book gambling. It does not amount to much despite the star wattage and a usually reliable director.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bruce Willis is everywhere it seems from reprising his iconic role in John McClane for the fifth time to being called on as the Original Joe in the G.I. Joe franchise. Soon he will be seen in yet another follow up film to Red inspired by the graphic novel and that pretty much sums up a busy release schedule in 2013. But here comes Lay the Favourite where he plays a character that's uniquely different from all of the rest so far  he doesn't wield a gun and gone are the wisecracks. Instead he's a serious gambler so serious that he's made a business out of his passion and doing so legally in the state of Nevada USA.But this is not the story about Bruce Willis' Dink but rather one that's purportedly based on the memoirs of an exotic dancer who made good while working under the tutelage of Dink but not before some shenanigans that expectedly occur along the way pulling in some serious lessons in life about nursing an addiction whether the thrill of the win or for the affections of someone. It's about Beth Rebecca Hall a freelance exotic dancer who decides that it's times up for her current career and decided to embark on a new one as a casino cocktail waitress in Las Vegas.Stroke of luck would have her meet Dink who runs his own company getting revenues from making bets against the odds hence the title for every conceivable sport and for every conceivable play. If you like me think that this is one film that will reveal to you the secrets to sports betting and making a career out of it well think again as these scenes really just gloss over the bare basics lest it be known as an elementary 101 instructional manual for professional gaming. But it is through this premise that life lessons get imparted from knowing when to quit not be greedy to knowing how to operate within set limits.And it's about discovering one's talents too. For Beth her uncanny skill with numbers and being the only female operative in Dink Inc puts her in good steed amongst Dink's peers in the industry and for a while she personified Dink's good luck charm until Dink's wife Tulip Catherine ZetaJones comes frowning especially when being threatened by a nubile upstart whom she can feel starting to bear some pangs of infatuation for her husband who had lifted her self esteem. This leads to another automatic rote expectation of how romance will figure into the plot with Jeremy Joshua Jackson being the goody two shoes boyfriend that Beth hooks up with.Lay the Favourites tend to go all over the place narratively with director Stephen Frears unable to keep a solid grasp on the story to keep it focused. It developed much like Beth's scatterbrain hitting multiple plot points at the same time and didn't fully develop their potential. There were solid moments when the story angled into a lessons learnt in how we sometimes bite the hand that feeds us. Its romance didn't go beyond the perfunctory while the comedy seemed to be reined in for the most parts instead of letting it rip. Having Vince Vaughn play the chief antagonist guaranteed a riot of a time until you realize that he's somewhat restrained in delivery of some of the best lines in the film that belonged to his character.While this may not be Stephen Frears' best work it still contained little takeaways through its themes of heeding advice from experienced hands and not be seduced by things that are too good to be true because it's a high chance that they are. Bruce Willis may be playing against type here but he does seem a tad uncomfortable in the role. Rebecca Hall however was at her element here as the trashy girl discovering her talents and herself making good of her potential but the rest of the supporting cast such as ZetaJones who was really pedestrian failed to keep up with her energy. Lay the Favourite is a valiant attempt that ultimately proved that the odds were stacked against its favour from the start.".

So far I have seen you in almost 4 no make that 5 crappy movies that have all come out this year. What is going on BRUCE? You are selling yourself too SHORT AND CHEAP you are better than this. Oh no is something going on cuz Nic Cage is also doing the same thing. Looks like you two are trying to get as much money as you can before the WORLD ENDS. Well NOW IT WILL END WITH OBAMA in for another 4 more years. Back to the film this movie is GOD Awful. TERRIBLE STAY AWAY. You can not have the main character out to be a stupid idiot stripper who is trying to STEAL a married man from his wife. especially since she is HOT and he is a 60 year old Mobster. STUPID. It would have been better if you made the Mob wife go out and shot her kill her and dump her dead body in the swamp then at least you would have gotten a 5 out of 10. But you can't have us SUPPORT A STRIPPER going after a married man. Sorry but that is just wrong. You also made the stripper completely ridiculous. You just wanted her to SHUT UP AND GROW UP. Half way through the movie I couldn't watch the rest of the film it was that bad and it made me MAD. WHY? cuz ZETA JONES WAS HOT. Sorry but you can't have a stupid stripper go up against ZETA JONES. Its just like Michael Douglas in FATAL ATTRACTION the audience already forgave Michael and was on his side the whole entire time. SAME WITH THIS the AUDIENCE will BE ON ZETA JONES SIDE and I WAS. So I HATED THE STUPID STRIPPER. There you go Next time please contact me before you make another stupid movie like this and LOOSE ALL YOUR MONEY unless that is what the plan was. If the plan was to make a BAD MOVIE then you DID A GREAT JOB IN MAKING A HORRIBLE FILM.".

Her attempts to forget about her past are not as satisfactory as she wished they would be after she meets the person she had shot 10 years ago. What I found interesting is that the man who failed miserably in his life because of the accident tries to put all the fault for that on the woman and when he finally has the chance to meet her again he believes he can solve all his problems only by accusing her for what had happened. The realization of the fact that there's nothing that can be done now gives a sad tone to this very downtoearth movie. The contrast between the idealist woman that spent most of her youth in prison and the nihilist professor and the close look that this movie takes on how historical events can affect an individuals' life are the two main reasons I would suggest this film.".

The contrast between the idealist woman that spent most of her youth in prison and the nihilist professor and the close look that this movie takes on how historical events can affect an individuals' life are the two main reasons I would suggest this film.";

	schema:headline " Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise";
	schema:reviewBody "It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films the series pretty much went down the toilet beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat creditcards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringeworthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened and start the whole series over again with a talented director compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento' widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As directorco screenwriter Nolan creates a richly dark atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit similar to that of the Burton films but less cartoony. The film's screenplay written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character Ducard but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless the pace never slows and the story is so unexpected and fascinating who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off! there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is a trait none of the past movies were able to capture including the Burton films. We see what drives him what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation and he brings that talent to a peak here playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of BatmanBruce Wayne you would find that it is essentially three characters Wayne as Batman behind the mask Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy and the real brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already and needless to say he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mindboggling if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here but if one had to be found it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance on the contrary but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role giving a very strong and often funny performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard Wayne's mysterious mentor as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon the only decent cop in Gotham and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And surprise surprise! the villains are also actually menacing for once as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters  there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism  true Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?and further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for onceOverall I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer'  it's a well written authoritatively directed impeccably acted especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow and very high quality production. Indeed most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago let us rejoice this glorious rebirth  Batman truly does begin here.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman  12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?However I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise every scare every concern every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing Katie Holmes is strong and sexy I particularly thought she'd be insipid she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent  which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April  speak for itself and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wiseguy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains especially Murphy great story great cast great action... put simply great film. Probably the best comicbook movie ever made that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comicbook rather than a comicbook movie that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind.".

	schema:headline " The Batman film I've been waiting for...";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen it is well worth the wait. In my opinion Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets again making the film work by today's standards. Plus we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it what a line up! Christian Bale Michael Caine Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman Liam Neeson Katy Holmes Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there waiting to see this movie let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale Dark brooding and tortured by his past yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....".

	onyx:emotionText "Finally after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen it is well worth the wait. In my opinion Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets again making the film work by today's standards. Plus we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it what a line up! Christian Bale Michael Caine Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman Liam Neeson Katy Holmes Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there waiting to see this movie let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale Dark brooding and tortured by his past yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....";

	schema:reviewBody "I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie I turned to my date and said to her This is it! This is the movie! I just can't believe that after all these years Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film apart from the great script and great acting was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director and the creative team alone and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grownup. Her performance isn't bad per SE it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action edited too quickly and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles the film is excellent and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.".

	schema:reviewBody "Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce WayneBatman Christian Bale. It covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman but goes much further in depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be batlike.One of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father Thomas Wayne Linus Roache and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him a point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas too teaches Bruce valuable lesson such as We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up. This is pretty close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father  son is pretty good too.I also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming invincible. Bruce is trained by Ducard Liam Neeson in many ways like a ninja The concept of Batman IS similar to a ninja. He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually we even see his first real enemy as a superherovigilante.Although I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is I am sure it took a few liberties as did SpiderMan. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette or whatever that was. Same with the Batsuit.Katie Holmes is excellent as Rachel Dawes a D.A. who is not afraid to go after the big villains in court. Also worthy of mentioning is Michael Caine as Alfred the butler. I do not believe they could have found a better man for that role although I could not get the image of Caine as Austin Powers' dad out of my head when he was on screen.Finally in my opinion Christian Bale makes a much better Batman than the three recent previous ones in Michael Keaton Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Something about him makes Batman darker and more mysterious. Hopefully DC Comics and movies have learned from their mistakes and we will not have to worry about Batman picking up a sidekick in this newest installment of the Batman series. 910".

What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along think twice. When we left a terrified 8yearold boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses Christian Bale convinces in his dual role while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support as does Morgan Freeman. Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that say Daredevil tried and failed to do although the director's cut is better.

All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film it incorporates all aspects of genre action fantasy drama and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping  laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented veteran actors such as Michael Caine Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role he had the intensity physique and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of the young girl or girlfriend. I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste my time watching a conventional corny overdigitalizedplot less film. To be honest I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic you'll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty respect and humility. Not only is Batman Begins the best of the Batman series it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches arthouseindependent films.".

He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eyepopping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw direct of gaze he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness underplaying his role as most of the others do so as not to become a caricature as so often happens in these Batman enterprises.

	schema:headline " Mature Batman Origin Story With Enough Comic Book Flair To Satisfy Fans Of Every Kind";
	schema:reviewBody "Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat as it were with Joel Schumacher's childish mess Batman and Robin Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through detailing Bruce Wayne's Christian Bale emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark mysterious figure is a valiant one and it makes sense. However context rarely hurts and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat why he needs a cape how he gets a supercar and supergadgets and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes a bit. Luckily unlike Nolan's two followups Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl there are a few jawdropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark brooding wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie but on the whole the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging engrossing and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one and once Batman finally enters the scene the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman Batman 1989 takes that title but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies a film that balances gritty realism human drama and thrilling comic book fun.85100".

	onyx:emotionText "Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat as it were with Joel Schumacher's childish mess Batman and Robin Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through detailing Bruce Wayne's Christian Bale emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape.

	schema:reviewBody "With all obvious accounting the Batman Magic' is back! Not since Michael Keaton when the first modern and great big screen Batman appeared in 1989 has there been such a commotion made about a new Batman movie. I had not seen this in the movie theater but as with the first I started seeing bumper stickers and baseball caps and posters of the Batman Begins logos and the like that's what let me know this was different than the others. The first Keaton one I saw it rightoffthebat! No waiting with this there had been so many in between that seemed to be slipping more and more with every new installment that I simply 'balked' at the thought of Batman 'Again'.Well after I had caught my breath I was astounded at the beauty of the first scenes and how this film instantly whisked me into the whole story. Amazed as I watched 'Bale' brought on the 'Knight' with a new era of and a freshfeeling crisp new characterhero. Liam Neeson enters from out of nowhere and he is a thing of beauty. A solidcast mentortrainer in the fine art of crime fighting. Neeson is a pillar in the 'Begin' set. As the grueling training comes to a successful end there comes the time to reenter his broken life complete with his estate and butler. Michael Caine is delightful as the classy care servant 'Alfred'. There was some real genius to place Caine in this position he fits to a 'T'. Rutger Hauer is an acting hero of mine from way back and this was just an unexpected treat of a performance that he had in the story. Gary Oldman is versatile Tom Cruise wishes he was as good as Old' Gary. Oldman is inspirational with every labored breath that he took. I was amused too at one point as the Batman made a surprise appearance at Gordon's Oldman home on the steps Batman informs him of the situation and as he answers Oldman is doing a perfect 'Christopher Walken' styled delivery just in those few sentences. That gave even a wider performance overall. In the hotel I laughed as Bruce Wayne having friendly dinner conversation with colleagues from his company when asked about the news of the Batman says A man dressed as a bat clearly has some issues to take care of. Schluffing it off as just another crazy man in the dark city. Pure gold.I must say that Katie Holmes seemed a little too young for me in the beginning albeit she came through toward the end with a satisfying role. Tom Wilkinson playing the big crime boss was reminiscent of the days of Nicholson the Joker with the late great Jack PalanceBoss Grissom but surely didn't reach the criminal element that these two gave off in stellar performance's in Burton's 89' Batman. At one point in the prison holding room Wilkinson seemed to be acting much like Dan Hedaya as he was speaking to counsel as the crime lord.Morgan Freeman is wondrously refreshing and apart from other roles he has played I enjoyed Lucius Fox for everything that he Freeman gave it simple easy and likable. The other players all found excellent fitting surrounding our main names. There was a lot put into this one no denying it I was overtaken by the classic yet new styling of the camera shots and the places that the story took us to and last but not least that BatVehicle is something that every Hummer 'wishes' it could dream wakeup and become. The BatS.U.V. for all your needs.Thoroughly penetrating in delivery this has a strength and smoothness in it's style it is a solid tailorcrafted actiondrama ...a sure fire hit. ".

Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way' but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly Batgirl alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins and I thought great this was called Batman in 1989 selfishly I said I want something new!.But of course being a big Batman fan I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to and yes I have been to some great ones where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip this was a standing ovation for 1030 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong so wrong. After seeing the XMens and Spidermans I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up again so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark gritty and pleasantly realistic view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though XMen and Spidermanall of them are wonderful superhero movies Batman Begins is just a good no great movie. And I think that is what blew people away that it wasn't just some superhero special effect hero gets girl good guy wins movie it was a truly dark and well crafted movie and it maybe stupid to say but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton and his animated stylewhich works could have revived this troubled series that Schumaker wrecked because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic.".

It was cheesy it had the POW WHACK KABOOM very very tongueincheek which brings me to my next point is what batman eventually became. Batman featuring Michael Keaton was a good film keaton was a good batman he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans a darker batman less camp plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson turning in another great performance as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel Keaton yet again Batman Returns not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin Devito and Catwoman Pfeiffer adding something different to the batman series. All is going well then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever in come the clichs the tongue in cheek oneliners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until dare I mention it Batman  Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eyecandy for the ladies the addition of Batgirl oh dear Lord and the villains just coming out with the most tongueincheek one liners ever example Mr Freeze You're not sending me to the cooler wrong oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series singlehandedly it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman the story is well paced it's not all talk or just mindnumbing action it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes Liam Neeson Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal not to mention betterlooking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins.

	schema:reviewBody "........ ..............................................from PastoColombia...Via L.A. CA. CALI COLOMBIA and ORLANDO FL Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise so far but also that it is definitely the best superhero film ever!Director Christopher Nolan who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic MEMENTO has assembled a formidable cast Michael Caine Liam Neesom Gary Oldman Tom Wilkinson  Morgan Freeman among others an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! In the title role we have Christian Bale British 31 at the time the film was made someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras without reaching at least at this juncture in time the longawaited status of SuperStar. In 2000 Bale took on another title role in American Psycho a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. If you have not seen this psychological thriller do soWhat a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy! On the one hand Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors Well Welsh to be exact capable of playing an American where his accent intonation and even body language is absolutely perfect impeccable! After taking in American Psycho I could have sworn he was American! However in BEGINS although his performance seemed quite good it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First as I'm sure Bale was already awareaudiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .For my taste the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise'sEX Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS Ms. Holmes never had a real standout role at least in my opinion nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her though it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us unlike almost all movies in this genre its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis responding and interacting with lady luck day to day life events and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly not the least bit farfetched. .Before rushing out to see it just a little warning. For those who yearn for Actionpacked blockbusters Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama since at the end of the day this is still a comic book superhero not some conflicted politician or not even anything closeLet's try to keep things in perspective O.K.? In conclusion if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! 10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOYDISFRUTELA! Any comments questions or observations in English or Espaol are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPastoYahoo.com".

Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and socalled villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and allstar celebrity casting we lost grasp of what the saga is really about Batman.Batman Begins opens with Bruce Wayne's discovery as a little boy of an underground cave where he is traumatized by an attack of massive waves of thousands of hideous bats. From this incident came an instilled fear that will forever torment Bruce Wayne. After the death of his parents a deep hatred towards crime grows more and more until Bruce decides to vanish from Gotham City. He learns the skills of an ancient vigilante ninja organization developing not only the skills of martial arts but most importantly the mastery of fear skills that will ultimately be the best weapons in facing the evils that will reach Gotham City and to avenge the death of his beloved parents.Batman Begins restores the integrity of the Batman saga and goes into an even deeper conflict... his constant struggle with fear and his deep hatred towards everything evil. What the other Batman movies lightly touched on Batman Begins tells vividly. Why a billionaire would devote his life to fighting evil. Where he gets all his nifty convenient gadgets. Why Bruce Wayne can take on 30 armed guys all on his own and without a gun. And finally why he dresses up as a bat... after all A guy who dresses up as a bat... clearly has issues. And Batman does and should have issues especially after witnessing first hand the death of his loving parents deaths that he feels partly responsible for. The other movies didn't emphasize enough the true anger Bruce Wayne has towards those that commit to a life of evil but in this movie Batman effectively played by Christian Bale is clearly depicted as a man anxious to release his anger and frustration to avenge the death of his parents.Evil is definitely present in this movie. Where the villains in previous Batman movies seem like decent people to hang out with or in Poison Ivy's case make out with the enemies in this movie know there is a job to be done and that there is no time to be funny not to belittle Jack Nicholson's role of the Joker who has a right to be funny. The depiction of the Scarecrow was amazing possessing an evil presence unlike any other Batman villain.As much as I loved Tim Burton's work and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce WayneBatman I'd have to say that the direction of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale as Batman put together the best Batman movie ever made. Besides Christian Bale the casting was impressive. Alfred played by Michael Caine and Fox played by Morgan Freeman are both characters you'll be glad to have alongside Bruce Wayne.It really is refreshing to see Batman and to finally learn after decades who he really is. A Batman who is angry and troubled and there to kick some ass not just for show but with a passion. Now the legend can live on with dignity and generations from now on can see the true man behind the bat... not just some heartthrob in tight pants.".

	schema:reviewBody "yup this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan i assume i know every little secret history background about the dark knight. i've waited 13 grueling years discounting batman forever and batman  robin for reasons far too obvious to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect BatmanBruce Wayne. Charming handsome and rich as Wayne. Terrifying maniacal sadistic and blacker than black as Batman. It's not who i am underneath but what i do that defines me. Michael Caine as Alfred humorous he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him You still haven't given up on me have you? Caine answers Nevah. Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology which for me is the comic books but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his spilunking stuff.  Morgan plays it brilliantly from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. Didn't you get the memo? That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul he was cold beyond reason. Cold badass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of hideandseek with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the weakest link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned but for a fan well she actually is. Not weak but pretty much the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series Jason Todd But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. Oh speaking of history Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton And imho the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno but for me it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up well there ya go. You better run! Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his doctor mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. I have to get me one of those. Damn right. I think you're trying to help. Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars  This movie has it all. Great plot dialogue action and an array of Oscar caliber actors definitely Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins.".

	onyx:emotionText "yup this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan i assume i know every little secret history background about the dark knight. i've waited 13 grueling years discounting batman forever and batman  robin for reasons far too obvious to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect BatmanBruce Wayne. Charming handsome and rich as Wayne. Terrifying maniacal sadistic and blacker than black as Batman. It's not who i am underneath but what i do that defines me. Michael Caine as Alfred humorous he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him You still haven't given up on me have you? Caine answers Nevah. Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology which for me is the comic books but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his spilunking stuff.  Morgan plays it brilliantly from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. Didn't you get the memo? That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul he was cold beyond reason. Cold badass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of hideandseek with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the weakest link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned but for a fan well she actually is. Not weak but pretty much the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series Jason Todd But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. Oh speaking of history Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton And imho the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno but for me it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up well there ya go. You better run! Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his doctor mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. I have to get me one of those. Damn right. I think you're trying to help. Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars  This movie has it all. Great plot dialogue action and an array of Oscar caliber actors definitely Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins.";

Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted Batman Begins has a pretty sizable budget but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it it is a dark movie which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly thank God!.I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10 as I am pretty brutal with ratings but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally this is what Batman should have been all along  The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman Nolan Bale Murphy fan will not be disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all WHY HAS THIS FILM NOT BEEN RELEASED IN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES??!!  Is it because Hollywood is afraid of German films that are actually as good as theirs?  Is it because this is a foreign film that isn't foreign enough e.g. Bergmanesque symbolism or Wender's poetic imagery or is it because neither America nor Britain have the nerve to properly dub this film into English? In any case the world is missing out.  This is a highly entertaining film with a simple plot lots of humor plenty of action and two terrific leads. The plot regardless of how many people will compare it to pulp fiction a comparrison by the way which I simply cannot understandis a straightforward buddy flick about two terminally ill men in their early thirties.  Like all buddy movies Lethal Weapan 48 hours Nothing to lose the characters couldn't be more different at the beginning and find a way to get along by the films end.  Nothing new here except for the fact that both men know they will be dead by the film's end thus eliminating thank goodness any chance of a sequel. Anyway our heroes meet in the hospital and quickly decide that they want to really live their final days on earth and see the ocean before they pass away.  They steal a car which happens to belong to a dutch gangster brief cameo by rutger hauer.  Thus begins the chase across Germany and Holland a chase which combines roadmovie laughs ala Dumb and Dumber there is a VERY similiar scene where the two men find the suitcase filled with money and check into a rediculously fancy hotel with genuine character development and bonding ala Thelma and Louise.The real star of the film is not the plot but the little moments of genuine humor and tenderness between the leads.  Director Thomas Jahn's balance between overthetop actioncomedy and emotional cancer drama is amazingly played out by the two actors til schweiger and jan josef liefersI would recommend this film to ANYBODY who likes to be entertained.  The music is great the jokes most of them at least fly and the relationships are genuine.  The only problem is probably that at this point you have to speak German fluently to understand most of what's going on. BUT BE PATIENT!  Someday Hollywood will discover this film and at least SUBTITLE it like they did the equally terrificer lola rennt.  My only hope is that they don't simply ruin the film by remaking it with american stars.  That would be a great letdown because this film is already perfect. I doubt that most people would even think it's foreign if they simply forget the subtitles and get into it.".

Also very good is the performance of Moritz Bleibtreu who became wellknown because of his great play of a turkishgerman gangster. But this is as far as Im concerned only funny for people who understand german very well.It would be quite nice for american people to watch a REALLY good german movie that is better as some hollywood movies counted together. If you have the opinion to see it  use your chance!".

	schema:reviewBody "Knocking On Heaven's Door has been a big German box office hit in the winter of 199697 and is still considered one of the best German movies of that decade next to the international success Lola rennt. This is a breathtaking comedy about two losers Til Schweiger and JanJosef Liefers dying of cancer and getting anything they want during their last days on earth. They are robbing a bank and nicking a car containing a gangster's suitcase with a million marks in it. Of course the gangsters and the police hunting the guys who just want to reach the sea to die somewhere at the shore.Although this roadmovie story itself isn't very new and has been filmed many times in Hollywood movies it stands on its own. The story has dozens of quotes and references from American movies and film genres but it also knows how to add a local German and European style to it. You see two henchmen a Turk and a Belgian dressed in black suits and with sunglasses like taken from a Tarantino film. You see Hannes Jaenicke dressed as a fatallylooking leather cop U.S.A. style drinking Jaegermeister a popular German spice liquor. You see popular fifties girlie actress Conny Froboess playing Til Schweiger's mum an Elvis Presley adoring fan.There are plenty of funny scenes in this movie many witty dialogues absurd situations and brilliant performances by all actors featuring Corinna Harfouch as a doctor Sexluder Jenny Elvers as a nurse Dutch movie stars Huub Stapel and Rutger Hauer as gangster bosses Ralf Herforth as dumb police officer etc. Schweiger and Liefers are giving the best performances of their career adding pain sadness and tragedy to the allactioncomedy style. The photography editing and the surfrocklike sound track by Selig are also outstanding. Take a look at this example of best German nineties cinema!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the centre of the storyline there are two male patients whose days are numbered. They have fatal diseases but they don't want to die in the hospital. So they decide to escape and enjoy the last days of their lives. There are a lot of films about the life's value but this is the most memorable one in my opinion. Despite the fact that the theme of the movie is very serious it is a great comedy. The main message of the film is Fear is stupid. This movie makes you rethink your vision of life and leaves behind a sense of sadness and at the same time the ease. It leaves you feeling the sea breeze on your face after watching. There is an interesting fact this movie is full of socalled movie flubs. For example in one shot we can see legs of the camera crew in the other  the crew is reflected in the glasses pf one of the actors etc. Although I watched the film numerous times I'd never noticed these flubs until I read about them on the one website. For me this is a sign of the plot completely preoccupying the audience. I think that it's one of the movies you can watch over and over again and update your feelings and emotions on the transience of life and the absurdity of many of the conventionalities.".

	schema:reviewBody "And hubba hubba one of those men is tall gorgeous Gary Cooper. End of discussion! This is a very melodramatic film with a lot of World War I action scenes. Apparently the role that Joan plays Diana Ronnie's sister was added to the script and does not appear in the Faulkner novel. Ronnie is Franchot Tone and he and Crawford met and fell in love during this film. Diana is engaged to Claude Robert Young and in fact one of the major moments of the film is when they decide to sleep together though they're not yet married. Diana however soon falls in love with the man who took over her family home Richard Cooper who is also a soldier and winds up in the same division as Ronnie and Claude. For a time he is presumed dead but when he reappears problems arise for Diana especially when Claude is badly injured and Richard realizes that she is living with him.The film is very dated. The acting is pretty good except that all these people are supposed to be British. Apparently in order to give a clipped British sound to the dialogue it goes something like this throughout the film Bad thing. Told him. Going away. Cooper is handsome and likable Young is fine Crawford is pretty good and Tone is excellent. There are many rainy action scenes and a very dark atmosphere throughout.All right. Franchot and Crawford. In love.".

Gary Cooper and Crawford survive not only the world's most abbreviated courtship but also convey the hurt and betrayal that each one's character feels subsequently.In some ways the film is even daring portraying heroism without histrionics or flagwaving.

Crawford was freshly divorced from Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  She and Franchot Tone fell in love and started their romance ultimately leading to marriage while making this film. Since their characters are brother and sister it's very interesting to watch the passion and familial kisses between them that is a LOT more potent than between Joan and her other two leading men who were SUPPOSED to be the love interests.Although the story was based on a William Faulkner novel it is NOT very true to the book .... since there was NO female character like Joan's in the book.  MGM wanted to use Crawford and had Faulkner add a character to the screenplay to accommodate a role for her.  Trouper that she was she does a good job but this basic World War I men's story is very strange due to the newly added love triangle.  There are also some very abrupt editing sequences that make you ponder what was left out.Crawford manages to look great although her clothes were NOT correct for the period  wait til you see her gown as Lady of the Manor  Adrian on the Moon! and has some good closeups but she is not believable as a Brit or in her supposed love for Gary Cooper.  Her suffering and caring towards Robert Young is very touching though.Cooper is always pleasant to watch but this does nothing extra for his resume.  Robert Young is sweet and winsome and commands the movieunderdog fanlove but Franchot Tone is the one who knows how to take belowaverage material and make it interesting.  What he can do with a few curt words a small prop like an upside down pipe in the rain or a quiet entrance into a room is sublime.For Joan Crawford fans I'd rate this movie a 5.5 for war and general movie fans I'd rate it slightly lower at a solid 5.".

It's hard to distinguish from any other triangle romance except that the war background gives it added interest.The script is a strange affair. It's hard to believe that JOAN CRAWFORD and GARY COOPER would openly declare their deep love for each other after exchanging a few glances across a cup of tea. In the very next scene they're hopelessly in love with Crawford feeling guilt because she's the fianc of ROBERT YOUNG.Young's brother is the carefree FRANCHOT TONE who walks off with the earlier scenes in the film while ROBERT YOUNG gets his chance to do a fair share of emoting later in the film as his role expands. It's nice seeing these wellknown actors at an early stage in their budding careers and still in their prime.For GARY COOPER fans this is nothing special but Crawford's admirers will find that she was at the height of her photogenic sculptured beauty despite some odd dress designs by Adrian that don't suggest anything but the studio's line of glamor during the early '30s. She wears a boldly designed dress with a strange wing collar that has to be seen to be believed. It's hilarious! And that's just so she can pour tea with some dignity.The actors all speak in clipped lines. Good girl says Franchot Tone on several occasions trying to sound like Colonel Blimp I suppose. And the others too adopt a strange way of clipping phrases so they sound more British. Very funny.It goes into darker territory in the later war scenes and there director Howard Hawks seems more at home. But for a film in which the Joan Crawford character was added as a last minute script change she certainly gets her fair share of footage and dominates the first fortyfive minutes. But the love angle is certainly a strange one. She treats Cooper with rude indifference several times during their first meeting although his behavior is that of the perfect gentleman. Shortly thereafter she confesses she's in love with him. That's the movies for you.".

All in all her character appears more like a nuisance than anything else. Her first appearance during the tea scene is promising but from there on she'll lack the mannish qualities of other Hawks' females. It is clear that the love interests all through the film are between Cooper Tone and Young. Claude's blindness reminds other physical impediments of Hawksian heroes. This film however closes with a display of self sacrifice and heroism seldom seen in the director's universe. There's also some unusual appearance of religious elements.

Some fine scenes like the aviator instructing the neophyte gunman about the dangers of throwing up or the wake of the dead cockroach are a true landmark of the director's imaginary and a clear proof of his ability to turn any material into his own.".

The daughter Diana Joan Crawford moves into one of the servant's quarters and her brother Ronnie Franchot Tone and their lifetime friend Claude Robert Young join up with the British forces and ship out to France. The development of the romance between Bogard and Diana consists onscreen of exactly one bike ride in which Bogard declares his love and Diana's one word sentences make her seem disinterested. However at the end of the ride she says rather emotionlessly that she loves Bogard. The two might as well be using semaphores to communicate the conversation is that wooden.Diana goes to France to help the war effort with her brother and childhood sweetheart seeing action nearby. In France she gets news that Bogard is dead although that news is incorrect. Based on that information she then makes a rash decision that she later regrets when Bogard shows up at her door.On the other hand the action sequences both in the air and on the sea are extremely well done and photographed. It's just a shame when such a fine cast as this film had all have their performances put in a straight jacket. The one thing that even the director couldn't do was put a complete damper on the chemistry between Franchot Tone and Joan Crawford.

It might have been better handled by someone like Frank Borzage or George Cukor where they might have made the tender romantic lines believable. I don't think anyone would have believed Joan Crawford as British. Elegant she does look however in those gowns she was famous for in her early films.Joan shouldn't be blamed for not sounding British. The story involves a mixture of British and American characters. But in checking out the entire cast list I found only three of them were actually born across the pond and another born in Australia. Where was the fabled Hollywood British colony in this film.?Gary Cooper is an American aviator who takes over Joan's estate following the death of her father. She's already involved with fellow countryman Robert Young who's in His Majesty's Navy. Also around is her brother Franchot Tone who gives the best performance in the film. As we all know this was Tone's first film with the woman who became his wife in a couple of years.The romance is pure soap opera with Joan going back and forth from Cooper to Young and back. You know that someone is going to have to do the decent thing. If you're interested you can watch the film for who does.Courtesy of Hawks's earlier masterpiece and from Mr. Howard Hughes came some nice aerial footage from Hell's Angels. Aviation enthusiasts if there willing to sit through the drama will get a real treat with all the vintage World War I aircraft.It's too bad Cooper and Crawford did not get something better. Of course Gary later worked with Howard Hawks on Sergeant York and Ball of Fire. Now those are films not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that is entertaining to watch but if you think about what's occurring too much your brain might just explode!! That's because the script is amazingly bad in spots and the casting is among the worst of the 1930s. While it's obvious MGM spent a lot of money assembling such talent as Joan Crawford Franchot Tone Robert Young and Gary Cooper what lamebrain thought that the first three stars would be great playing Brits?! The stars attempt no accent whatsoever but come off as being as British as Carmen Miranda!! The film begins with WWI. Three lifelong friends are torn apart as the two men Tone and Young go off to war and the lady Crawford is left home alone. Due to financial difficulties she is forced to rent the family estate to an American Cooper as the Americans still are neutral and Cooper thought it would be fun to live there. Over time Cooper falls in love with Crawford and they plan on marrying. However Cooper also finally sees what Britain is fighting for and volunteers for the Royal Air Corpswhere he is soon reported killed in an accident. Heartbroken Crawford seeks solace in the arms of Young and soon marries him. Naturally later Cooper turns up alive and Crawford is conflictedstay with her husband who is more of a friend than lover or run off with dashing Cooper.Now although this plot is rather soapy it still could have workedeven if it seemed very very unlikely and clichd. However combined with lousy casting AND two very long and unnecessary macho interludes the film seemed to lose its way. When I say macho interludes I am referring to several action segments that did nothing to further the plot and strained credibility beyond the breaking pointthough they were pretty exciting and looked very good for 1933. In one Cooper takes Young along for a bombing missioneven though they fought for different armies by this point in the film American and Britishand you can't just take a friend up for laughs during wartime!. Amazingly Young is able to shoot down four fighter planes while operating as a gunner on this plandespite having no training whatsoever!! Later Young returns the favor and takes Cooper on a patrol boat missionduring which time they easily sank a German merchant ship with this minuscule souped up motor boat. In fact later in the film this same tiny boat sinks a German battleshipsomething that just could not have happened in real life. If planes and tiny ships had been THIS effective the war would have only lasted a couple weeksnot four years! Needless to say because of all the film's clichs Young is killed in action by the end and this allows Crawford to finally marry Cooper. Don't worry about the fact that Young now blinded in his last combat mission STILL went on yet another mission in which he bought the farmit was needed to further the very predictable romance between Crawford and Coop.Overall a very silly and impossible to believe film that still manages despite its many problems to entertain due to nice action sequences and excellent cinematography. But please please DON'T take this as a good history lesson or lesson on how to write a proper romance.".

She's OK cause she moves into a garden house. Her brother and his friend played by Franchot Tone enlist into WWI. From here we get a lot of melodrama such whilst in France fighting the Germans. Gary Cooper decides to be a pilot and do his bit.This one needed some real script rewrites or extra scenes added all the way through. First off Gary Copper's character is on this very briefly in the beginning. From this we get him coming to take his house...riding a bike next to Joan Crawford on the road...and in the same scene he says he loves her...and she the same. Wait a minute! Am I missing something? Where's the lead up to this so called love between these 2? There isn't any. This was a serious misfire in this film.That premise is basically the whole film. Joan Crawford's character marries her childhood friend even though she loves the Cooper character. She loves him but more in a friend like way. She finds out the Cooper character is killed off and she marries her friend. Eventually he surprises her and shows that he wasn't dead. It was a mistake. Now she's torn.The film works itself out. The ending is typical happy go lucky and they get together but it shoulda went another route.This was just too generic a film to be rated any higher than it is. Gary Cooper is dead wooden in this one and is most certainly not one of his high points in his career.Browse past this one and try Hell's angels...a way better alternative.".

Joan is surrounded by three leading menGary Cooper Robert Young and Franchot Tone. The premise has her loosing her house to American Gary Cooper whom she falls in love with in spite of the fact that childhood friends Young and Tone both love her. Cooper gets into the war before America does and is presumably killed so Crawford goes on to become reinvolved Young who is blinded while on duty. But in typical Enoch Arden fashion Cooper shows up alive.World War I films of the first five years of the talkie era are sort of creaky not at all like the silent classic Wings and the early talkie All Quiet on the Western Front. This manages to rise above some of the others particularly because of the MGM gloss. The segment of how the women worked behind the scenes is fascinating and manages to overshadow the sappiness of the romantic triangle. Crawford by now had risen above her early shopgirljazz baby image and was equally as glamorous as MGM's top female stars Garbo and Shearer if a bit more popular at the box office. The lovable Louise Closser Hale is on hand as Crawford's devoted housekeeper. While its nice to see Cooper and Crawford together in their only film he would have more magic on screen with spicier leading ladies like Jean Arthur and Barbara Stanwyck. Young and Tone do what they can with unremarkable material and seem even less British than Crawford. Still it is all put together in an entertaining package that along with Crawford is simply lovely to look at.".

	schema:reviewBody "In what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story Turn About William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone Young and Cooper characters but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her costars' Young and Tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraphlike shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch Wuthering Heights performed in semaphore. Seriously the almost entirely pronounless sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James.The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his Sanctuary and elsewhere. When Young proposes to Crawford in Tone's presence in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their Thelma  Louise fate. Frankly it's creepy.Not as creepy to this New Yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach Wellington which Crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her handsI had to turn away! and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech.That being said there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in Cooper's fighter plane and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying buddy. Tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young's fate. Crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one role.The battle scenesnot surprisingly for a Howard Hawks filmare the most exciting part of the entire picture. But not enough. As far as I'm concerned this is 75 minutes of my life I'm never going to get back.".

Joan Crawford Robert Young and Franchot Tone all play Brits. None tries an accent thankfully but one has to wonder what MGM was thinking by this casting. Couldn't they find any British actors? The story is about American Gary Cooper buying the estate of Joan's family. Her father just died in the war. Joan is allowed to stay on at the guest house. Joan's friends Tone and Young go off to war and leave Joan with Cooper who she of course falls in love with. But then he also goes off to war and is falsely reported as killed in action. So a sad Joan agrees to go through with marrying Young who has always been in love with her. When Coop shows back up she's conflicted as to who to be with. Joan seemed to be torn between men in nearly all of her MGM films from the '30s. These plots must have been successful at the box office back then but they sure are difficult to care about today. Maybe I just don't care for romantic triangle stories that much. Anyway there are some out of place but nicely done action sequences inserted into things. Whether this was because Hawks was bored with the soap opera elements or what I don't know. It's an interesting film to rate. I didn't hate it but I didn't like it all that much either. I doubt I would watch it again. Despite the star power behind the camera and in front it just doesn't click for me. I will recommend it solely because any movie with these stars as well as Hawks and Faulkner attached is worth checking out for curiosity's sake alone.".

It's possible that with some major script revisions and a different cast it might have worked. But in it's current state it more resembles a train wreck that you just can't turn your head away from. With it's stars and it's director expectations are high. Just does not deliver.My major problem with it is that 3 actors in the lead are supposed to be British. Looks like only a halfhearted effort was made by Crawford Tone and Young to adopt an English accent. The result is some sort of hybrid that not only sounds unauthentic but succeeds in making their dialog almost impossible to understand. One curious thing is that through almost all of it's running time there is no background music. Then towards the end at an emotional high point the sound of a solo piano is heard. Being a high class production you would expect to hear the legendary MGM orchestra. The score for the solo piano is so wrong for this scene that it makes me wonder what were they thinking? Crawford does her best overthetop emoting from start to finish trying desperately to breath some life into this all for naught.Cooper gives his characteristic laconic reading. Just about right for this part. Tone is not given much chance to show what he can do here. He fools with his pipe a lot and sort of mumbles. Pipes are a visual cue that shows the character to be British right?Young never was much of an actor and never seemed to rise above the level of acting here through the rest of his career. He is just plain wrong here. Maybe Howard Hawks knew early on that this one was going to be a railroad disaster and just sort of punched the clock to it's finish.Waste your time on this one if you insist but in my opinion it is NOT an undiscovered jewel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Jack Bernhard was on a roll when he made this lowbudget crime drama for the interesting Film Classics company all of whose releases that I've seen have been fascinating on some levelhe had made VIOLENCE about a cryptofascist secret society preying on returning veterans and DECOY a noir classic with the ultimate femme fetale as played by Jean Gillie at Monogram in 4647 and after BLONDE ICE he went on to direct two of the three John Calvert Falcon films which I found entertaining in a quirky way. BLONDE ICE teams Leslie Brooks who played a similar deadlier than the male female two years earlier in SECRET OF THE WHISTLER here playing a upwardlymobile woman who uses marriage and murder as a way of improving her social status with actorsingergameshow host Robert Paige a reliable performer best known to me for the serial FLYING GMEN and the horror classic SON OF Dracula. The film will not make anyone forget DETOUR or DECOY because to me it doesn't really aspire to the dark world of noirit's not a corrupt world here just an empty one for Claire Cummings. Les her friend and the man she keeps coming back to whenever she conquers a new financially successful man played by Robert Paige is an interesting character because he is a devoted friend who knows that something is wrong but doesn't want to know about it. Claire states many a time that she loves him but he seems to have gone beyond any romantic feelings for her before the film startshis feelings for her are more like those of an exspouse who has moved on but who still wants to help his former partner who is having a run of bad luck. I disagree with those who don't care for Brooks' performanceshe has a number of wonderfully feline poses and it's easy to see how men who ought to know better such as the congressional candidate fall for her. I also like the fact that no real explanation is ever provided for her actions other than social climbing and she always seems unsatisfied with each new level she reaches. The supporting cast does a good job alsomy favorite being Russ Vincent as the sleazy flyerblackmailer in a performance straight from the Jack LaRue school of acting.

	onyx:emotionText "Director Jack Bernhard was on a roll when he made this lowbudget crime drama for the interesting Film Classics company all of whose releases that I've seen have been fascinating on some levelhe had made VIOLENCE about a cryptofascist secret society preying on returning veterans and DECOY a noir classic with the ultimate femme fetale as played by Jean Gillie at Monogram in 4647 and after BLONDE ICE he went on to direct two of the three John Calvert Falcon films which I found entertaining in a quirky way. BLONDE ICE teams Leslie Brooks who played a similar deadlier than the male female two years earlier in SECRET OF THE WHISTLER here playing a upwardlymobile woman who uses marriage and murder as a way of improving her social status with actorsingergameshow host Robert Paige a reliable performer best known to me for the serial FLYING GMEN and the horror classic SON OF Dracula. The film will not make anyone forget DETOUR or DECOY because to me it doesn't really aspire to the dark world of noirit's not a corrupt world here just an empty one for Claire Cummings. Les her friend and the man she keeps coming back to whenever she conquers a new financially successful man played by Robert Paige is an interesting character because he is a devoted friend who knows that something is wrong but doesn't want to know about it. Claire states many a time that she loves him but he seems to have gone beyond any romantic feelings for her before the film startshis feelings for her are more like those of an exspouse who has moved on but who still wants to help his former partner who is having a run of bad luck. I disagree with those who don't care for Brooks' performanceshe has a number of wonderfully feline poses and it's easy to see how men who ought to know better such as the congressional candidate fall for her. I also like the fact that no real explanation is ever provided for her actions other than social climbing and she always seems unsatisfied with each new level she reaches. The supporting cast does a good job alsomy favorite being Russ Vincent as the sleazy flyerblackmailer in a performance straight from the Jack LaRue school of acting. I'm glad to see this film available in a crisplooking DVD. It has the flavor of a paperbackoriginal crime novel with a lurid cover the film's poster and title card have that flavor tooand it pulled me into its world for 70 minutes.";

	schema:reviewBody ".. but this film perhaps more highly regarded because it was thought to be lost for many years is pretty ordinary film noir.  There are half a dozen or so discernible film noir conventions that define a movie as noir.  One is people are rotten and women are the rottenest people.  Claire Cummings is an archtype for tawdry women ambitious completely innerdirected amoral oblivious to all except her own desires conniving manipulative a pathological liar .. and gorgeous.Her looks easily ensnare the men around her and those same looks blind them to what she's capable of until it's too late.  What this movie lacks however is this requisite corruption in the rest of Claire's universe. The police are honest even competent her lovers are mostly straight arrows the newspaper where she works is not a scandal sheet dishing dirt on the rich and famous.  Claire is thoroughly rotten and there's a blackmailer who knows what she did and tries to cut himself in on her inheritance .. but these are the only ones.  There is none of the overwhelming sense that the whole world was full of Claires that we see in some film noirs.She has one mostly normal relationship with a reporter she works with.  He sees her for what she is but seems unwilling or unable to walk away from her wiles.  So he's a prime candidate for one of the other conventions of film noir that men are weak and stupid.  Claire wraps him around her finger and keeps him on a leash pretty much throughout.  But even Les comes to his senses when she frames him for one of her murders.  You're not warm.  You're ice .. Blonde Ice!  he says at one point.Claire kills to get ahead or stay ahead.  She kills her first husband for his money becomes engaged to a congressmanelect for the position that will give her and kills the wouldbe blackmailer to cover her tracks.  We get the idea what kind of babe she is at her wedding where she makes excuses to leave the groom and is kissing Les the man she still has feelings for on the terrace.A quick embrace and the thrill of forbidden pleasures is enough to keep the boyfriend interested and a peck on the cheek with a little smoke and mirrors explanation of how it was just a friendly goodbye kiss is enough to soothe the husband's ruffled feathers.  Her charm her guile and her looks are how she gets through life.Did I mention she was gorgeous?But there's another rule in film noir  evil schemes never succeed. There's always a day of reckoning even if you're dropdead gorgeous and that moment comes for Claire.  When it arrives it is weak frankly and largely unsatisfying.  It involves a psychiatrist and a lot of 40's psychobabble about the nature of crime that clearly removes this little thriller from any serious contention as film noir.Not bad.  I'll watch it again.  6.5 out of 10.".

And there are a few satisfying if never quite resplendent turns by a handful of character actors wellversed in what is expected of them. Although  as commented upon already  there is not quite enough shadow and darkness to make it a solid noir presentation there are  in fact  some rather welldrawn night scenes and the requisite venetian blind shadows aslant scattered here and there. And there is a limp stab at analysis of Claire's problem by a weaklysketched German shrink who also concocts a rather vapid and seemingly pointless plan to upend her schemes. The ending is perhaps a bit perfunctory although the very last line is snappy.The main positives however are the terribly efficient storytelling often a lost art in Bmovies hell in ALL movies! and some truly terrific compositions.

The direction and writing are on par with her not spectacular not ever really a downer. Blonde Ice probably has an amazing poster one of those you might see in an artmuseum installation celebrating pulp fiction advertising. The content itself is just there to pay a couple of small bills and fill some seats for a double feature. It's recommended only to those who sniff out whatever 40s noir might have promise.

Before I saw this film I remembered her most in Cover Girl 1945  She played Rusty's catty rival the one who gave her tips on how to impress the editors.Claire Cummings Leslie Brooks a gossip reporter has just married wealthy businessman Carl Hanneman John Holland but that doesn't stop her from pigeonholing Les Robert Paige a former flame and pledging her undying love for him  he of course is flabbergasted!!! Later at the race track Carl is astonished at the amount she is betting 500 even though she wins!! A letter reveals that she is tired of Carl and her marriage. Carl accidentally sees the letter and announces the marriage is over. She concocts a plot that involves Les a sports reporter he is suspicious and wonders why Carl has taken a business trip on their honeymoon. When Claire decides to pop into her apartment to freshen up they find Carl dead  Les assumes it is suicide and Claire agrees. The police believe it is murder but Claire gets off through lack of evidence. The next day she asks for her old job back  she feels she must carry on!!!She soon sets her cap at Stanley Mason Michael Whalen a high powered attorney who she wants to represent her late husband's estate. Like Carl he is completely under her spell and he is also able to get the police to close her late husband's file. A blackmailer who has helped give Claire an alibi but now wants payment is shot in the back  by Claire!! Mason starts to have second thoughts about Claire and after talking to a doctor tries to convince Claire that she needs counseling to help her deal with issues she has about wealth power and ambition. Unfortunately Claire doesn't like that idea. At the end she has made her own headlines and her true colours shine forth  even to a dope like Les.The only films I have seen Robert Paige in are Can't Help Singing 1944 where he costarred opposite Deanna Durbin in a Technicolored musical western and Split Second 1953 a rather good thriller directed by Dick Powell  he has been in dozens of films but to me he is just not that memorable. Which made him perfect for the role of Les. Michael Whalen who played Stanley Mason started out as a leading man in a couple of Shirley Temple movies Poor Little Rich Girl 1936 and Wee Willie Winkie 1938 and later developed into a character actor.Recommended.".

That's where I got the chance to see Leslie Brooks weave cinema magic as the coldest babe in town. Her performance ranks right up there with the wonderful Ann Savage's Vera in the greatest B of all times Detour.Brooks plays a newspaper columnist who goes from one wealthy victim to another kills inherits the money and moves on. A blackmailer gets in her way so she dispatches him as well. All the while her exboyfriend played by Robert Paige a familiar face to movie buffsis hanging around on the fringes of her life. He becomes the main suspect in the murders and complications arise.Brooks should have gone on to bigger and better things but here again her career mirrors the aforementioned Ann Savage. The low budget films were not always a stepping stone to stardom.This is an unusual film with a totally unrepentant and psychologically twisted main character who in a word is a bitch. The supporting cast is strong and the cinematography is quite good. Now that I have said that I must admit that this is definitely a B film and can sometimes be rather hard going. But it is Leslie Brooks that makes it worthwhile. The film was made by Film Classics originally a releasing company which tried it's hand at it's own productions with some limited success. The company disappeared early in the 1950s as did most of the Poverty Row studios much to the chagrin of all aficionados of the genre. Blonde Ice is one of the stars in the crown of low budget film making due to Brooks. Make an effort to find it.".

Incidentally the latter constitute some of the most important men in Brooks life apart from Paige justly bewildered at the sight of his loved one blowing her cool they are James Griffith making a good impression as a smarmy colleague of Paiges and who also carries a torch for Brooks  by the way the latter had her own spot on the paperwhich is then amusingly but cruelly put down by none other than Paige himself in the films closing line! and Walter Sande as their longsuffering editor whos often reduced to acting as referee between Paige and Griffith over their common affection for Brooks!. Also making a significant contribution is Michael Whalen as an ageing politician  having already married into money Brooks had next intended to acquire standing in the U.S. capital! Qualitywise the VCI Special Edition DVD leaves a lot to be desired  but I guess it was to be expected from a film which had long been considered lost! Theres a surprising amount of bonus features to be found here  I bypassed Jay Fentons Audio Commentary but did get to watch his fairly interesting interview which rather than focus specifically on BLONDE ICE drew also on other subjects particularly on Film Restoration techniques and closer to home being itself a VCI release his own involvement in the rediscovery of Mario Bavas THE WHIP AND THE BODY 1963.

Thanks to the DVD medium Ive watched a handful of 1950s TV programs all of them were fairly crude technically but also reasonably entertaining in themselves. This one then was no exception  being a mildly engaging detective story featuring veteran Hollywood character actor Wallace Ford the plot again revolves around a femme fatale as she schemes to come out on top at all costs. Shes involved in a diamond robbery contrives to kill her two partners and even tries to make a dupe out of Ford  but hes too experienced to fall for her type! While the proceedings are entirely predictable what makes the show palatable is its constant flurry of hardboiled dialogue though this was an intrinsic element of the genre the overall easygoing approach here results in an agreeable mix of thrills and chuckles throughout.".

	schema:headline " Blonde Ambition  Collateral Damage";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it was made on a shoestring by a small independent company and features some belowpar acting this movie redeems itself because of its lively pace its outrageous story and the performance of its leading lady. Based on the 1938 novel Once Too Often by Whitman Chambers Blonde Ice follows the exploits of an extremely ambitious femme fatale whose pursuit of wealth power and status leaves in its wake a lot of collateral damage in the form of broken hearts and dead bodies.At a ceremony held in his own mansion wealthy businessman Carl Hanneman John Holland marries Claire Cummings Leslie Brooks in the company of his guests who include some of Claire's colleagues from the San Francisco newspaper where she's employed as a society columnist. Immediately after making her vows she leaves her new husband to join her old flame Les Burns Robert Paige on the balcony. There she tells the sportswriter that he's still the man that she loves and adds I'll think of you on my honeymoon.Whilst on honeymoon in Los Angeles Carl sees a love letter that Claire's written to send to Les and immediately decides to divorce her and return to San Francisco. That night Claire hires a charter plane to fly to San Francisco and back and pays the pilot Blackie Talon Russ Vincent an extra 100 to ensure his future discretion about the trip. When she returns home after her very brief honeymoon she arranges for Les to meet her and take her back to her husband's house where they discover Carl's dead body. He'd been shot dead in circumstances that suggest that he'd committed suicide. The police are convinced however that Carl was murdered but don't have sufficient evidence to charge either Claire or Les.A short while later. Claire gets another of her boyfriends to introduce her to a politically ambitious attorney called Stanley Mason Michael Whalen who she wants to administer her late husband's estate and soon they become an item. When Mason is elected to Congress he announces his engagement to Claire but problems then arise when Blackie Talon turns up to blackmail her and Mason's psychiatrist friend Dr Geoffrey Kippinger David Leonard expresses strong reservations about her suitability for marriage. Naturally Claire resolves these problems with her usual ruthless efficiency but further complications follow.Blonde Ice is a film noir with a number of the usual archetypes such as the femme fatale the weak man who repeatedly gets into danger because of his obsession and the good girl who the man consistently ignores. The involvement of psychoanalysis in the plot and the presence of a blackmailer who suddenly emerges from the shadows are also typical noir components. What the story eschews though is the twists and the uncertainties surrounding identities and motivations which often add greater intrigue to some of the best films of this style.Leslie Brooks exemplifies what's best about this movie as she's bold brazen and shows no reservations or conscience about her character's actions or crimes. Everything she does is treated as simply the next logical step in her progression to her goal. The remainder of the cast are adequate at best but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment because the uncomplicated nature of the whole undertaking makes all the wickedness onscreen highly entertaining and often comical to watch.".

The film lacks those deep dark shadows and night time location shooting it even lacks any real baddies unless you count the aspiring politician but it does have a femme fatale.

	schema:reviewBody "Claire Cummings San Francisco society reporter blonde and gorgeous is a woman to die for. If you make the mistake of marrying her you probably will. Claire Leslie Brooks goes through men who want to marry her like a sharp knife through your side. She keeps news columnist Les Burns Robert Paige handy even when she marries a very wealthy San Francisco businessman. She makes the mistake of letting a letter to Les fall into her husband's hands on their honeymoon. My darling Les she writes three more weeks until I can see you again dearest. Poor stupid Carl tries so hard to be a good husband but he can't get used to an expensive wife. Carl says it will be a divorce. Twentyfour hours later Carl isn't going to say anything ever again. Blonde Ice lets us tag along as Claire not only goes through her new husband but through a blackmailer and a new high social fiance. She manipulates Les who loves her until even he has her number. I once said I couldn't figure you out he tells her. I can now. You're not a normal woman. You're not warm. You're cold...like ice. Yeah like ice...blonde ice. It might not have been wise to be so frank with Claire because now she plans for him to take the fall for one of her murders. Justice finally comes to Claire as it must to all bad people in Hollywood movies of that time. Even then it takes a threeway setup some psychoanalysis and a bullet to do the job. The movie is a great example of a lowbudget B programmer which just manages to rise a little above the average. The script is okay the acting is adequate the story is interesting. What makes it work? Director Jack Bernhard just as much a journeyman as the actors keeps the film moving briskly with little time to let us get bored or impatient. The photography helps quite a bit with several noirish scenes at night. Also important is Leslie Brooks as Claire. Brooks was an actress that stayed firmly planted as a lead in B movies with an occasional foray as a second lead in A movies. She's not an actress who would worry the A crowd but she does a fine job as Claire the selfcentered manipulative and deadly ice queen. The only really weak part of the movie is the conclusion when psychiatry is used as an explanation for her behavior. For me this undercuts her nicely murderous actions after all don't we all just want the nice things in life? There are even tips for fine living. What could be a healthier lunch than martinis chicken salad for two and coffee please. Or four Manhattans waiter with half French half Italian vermouth. Why that's a Perfect Manhattan.".

She kills her wealthy husband and then moves on to the next guy who is a pretty nice guy. He has suspicions from the start but his affection for her gets in the way and he becomes too forgiving. When she finally hooks up with a senatorial candidate things get really dicey and she reveals herself to the one friend she has. She plies her tricks a little too long.

	schema:reviewBody "Had this film ended better I could easily have seen giving it a higher score. But sadly the movie really caught my attentiononly to end in a hasty and unsatisfying scene that should have been so much better. It's a shame as up until then it was a dandy lowbudget film.Leslie Brooks stars as an incredibly conniving and dangerous woman. You get an idea of how conniving as the film begins. Although she's been in love with a coworker she marries a rich guy simply because he's rich. But Leslie has no intention of being faithful to her new hubbyand has every desire to pick up with the old boyfriend! When the husband catches her writing love notes to the guy while they are on their honeymoon he announces that he's divorcing her. Enraged she kills himand then concocts a plan to give herself an alibi. The investigators believe her and soon she begins batting her eyes at the D.A.and her path to riches and the high life appears to be leading directly to him. In the meantime she STILL keeps the old boyfriend hanging on in hopes that they'll marry. Eventually all this leads to MORE murders and you realize that she's one of the earliest serial killers shown on film. Of course other films featured female murderers but this one repeats itself several timesand it's pretty shocking even for a noir film.This film was made with a shoestring budgetusing noname actors simple sets and a swift pace. Despite that it was engaging and wellmade....that is until the end where the woman is confronted and she quickly admits to her murders!!! It's like the end of practically every Perry Mason showwhere the killer inexplicably shouts out that they did iteven though there was no hard evidence to support this!! This rarely happens in real lifeat least on this planet! It's a shame as even a halfway decent ending would have made this movie well worth seeing. As is it's too disappointing to place it among the better examples of film noir.".

Too bad her career was so brief confined for whatever reason to the 40's. Paige does well enough as her sometime 'true love'. I'm just wondering if this heart tug was to soften her image for censorship purposes without it she's a pretty ruthless case. Also thinfaced bigeyed James Griffith excelled at eccentric parts. Here he sort of mugs it up in semihumorous fashion as though he's not taking any of this too seriously. Worse by implying that he Al was ever a romantic interest of Claire's produces a real stretch. The direction by Jack Bernhard is smooth enough if uninspired. Too bad the production didn't reach for noir lighting since the material is perfect for creepy shadows. Instead staging and lighting remain conventional perhaps because of budget constraints. However I do wish the script had dispensed with the omniscient psychiatrist Leonard. A lot of films of that period included 'head doctors' and I'm not sure why. I guess he's supposed to bring Claire's behavior within science's grasp. To me however it's more intriguing to place some behaviors beyond science.Anyhow this cheapo remains an interesting little feature.

The film ticks along as we follow Claire and her pursuit of wealth. The best parts of the film are whenever she decides to kill someone  it's always a very determined and direct approach and I found myself looking forward to her next crime. She saves the best for last as she tells a psychiatrist what she thinks of him and then goes for him. She's got 3 people surrounding her but it doesn't stop her. It's top quality.The film slowed down a bit in the middle and the ending was contrived and convenient. She seemed untouchable up to that point and I had no idea how they were going to put a stop to her behaviour. Her final actions just didn't ring true. Nevertheless it's an enjoyable film and Leslie Brooks is most entertaining.".

Beasts of Southern Wild is an unique vision that sweeps viewers away with energy attitude and a full vibrant sense of life. Containing outstanding performances great cinematography and a fantastic score the film is just so engrossing.Hushpuppy feels her connection not only to nature and animals but also to the prehistoric era represented throughout the film by her interest in cave drawings andmore fancifullyprehistoric beasts called aurochs that have been released from the ice caps and make their way toward the Bathtubat least in Hushpuppy's mind. The difference between what's real and what lives in the imagination of our sixyearold heroine is not always clear but it's all delivered with a beautifully assured sense of wonder.Beasts of the Southern Wild unfolds through Hushpuppy's eyes and it's a sight to behold sometimes wondrous often disordered and dysfunctional. It's hard not to see the film through a political lens even if you're apolitical. But there's no stridency here Fantastical moments and a fantastic script manage to juggle so much with grace.

	schema:reviewBody "Beasts of the Southern Wild is shot through the eyes of a six year old. To Hushpuppy Quvenzhane Wallis the islands of southern Louisiana are a magical place filled with lucky people who do not have to live like cowards behind the levees and only get one holiday a year. Hushpuppy's voiceover reveals the island folk rarely need an excuse to have a party or take another holiday. If this film were shot through the more perceptive eyes of an adult the audience I bet would get a much different take on things. Extreme poverty alcoholism and child neglect are just the first few overt issues which come to mind. It was a very wise move for the filmmakers to stick with the child protagonist. Magical realism is far more acceptable and preferable to an audience than what could arguably be termed child cruelty.Hushpuppy and her father Wink Dwight Henry live in an area called 'The Bathtub'. It is not protected by the New Orleans levee system people scuttle around from place to place by haphazardly crafted boats and everyone expects that some day the melting polar ice caps will submerge their homes and only the strong will survive. It turns out that some day in Beasts of the Southern Wild is now. When Hushpuppy first hears the thunder of the coming storm she believes it to the be the sound of melting glaciers falling off of Antarctica. It is never mentioned by name however the storm appears to be Hurricane Katrina. Since the main part of her father's and his friends' days consist of drinking there are no preparations for the coming calamity just praise for the brave souls staying behind for what they claim will be a little wet weather and catcalls to those fleeing behind the levees. Where is mama in all of this? The idea of mama to Hushpuppy is and old dirty basketball jersey she carries around with her and sometimes talks to. Every now and then Hushpuppy thinks she sees mama when she glimpses a far away lighthouse or watches an approaching helicopter. Whether mama is dead or has just run off is another unexplained phenomenon kept by daddy.After the storm Hushpuppy and daddy float around in their make shift boat which is the back of an old pickup truck with a struggling outboard hanging on behind it. They meet up with a few other survivors who immediately start engaging in activities they do best drinking. However this was not your regular storm. The water is not receding the animals even the fish are dying and whatever sickness daddy had to start with is starting to pick up speed. Throughout the ensuing scenes to remedy their dreadful situation Hushpuppy keeps the audience involved with her prescient voiceover. A notable example is her comparison of getting old and sick outside of the levee wall versus inside of it. Outside there is savagery the young will eat the old and move on. Inside they plug you into the wall ventilators. Whenever daddy feels he has been a particularly lousy father he teaches Hushpuppy to do something such as catch a catfish her bare hands and be sure to give it a good punch when she gets it into the boat. There is also an odd side story involving long extent carnivores called aurochs. They represent the savage beasts who kill and eat anything and everything. The allegory is not readily apparent and its payoff is understated at best. This description sounds starkly bleak which the subject matter surely is but the film is very well put together. The scenery looks like it would after biblical destruction the actors appear to all be locals and have the accents to prove it and the music is incorporated effectively. The very young actress playing Hushpuppy is phenomenal. Perhaps a few years from now she will realize just how deep her character is written and how only a very minority of child actors could have possible pulled it off. Her father while not necessarily a sympathetic character was well cast and while is not particularly an ignorant man is certainly a man set in his ways determined his progeny will follow in the local footsteps. Having respect for and maintaining the traditions of your place of birth is one thing but more than likely Hushpuppy is being set up for a life of substance abuse and unsteady employment. However that is jumping ahead. Beasts of the Southern Wild is about a very specific time and place with thoughts only of the next meal not tomorrow and definitely not next month. The camaraderie between our heroes and the locals is fun to watch and seeing how they make the best of a horrible situation is quite creative when you see it as Hushpuppy does. There is a high probability this film will continue to progress with strong word of mouth end up on several Top 10 lists and be in line for some Oscar nominations. The film is certainly worthy of the word of mouth it is getting because audiences have really not seen anything like this before but the automatic Top 10 inclusion is a bit farfetched. It is winning awards for cinematography but the hand held camera borders on annoying at times. If there is a party the audience intuitively understands it is fun. Does the camera have to wildly spin around as well? When someone is running must the camera bounce up and down too? See Beasts of the Southern Wild for the story the locations and the child actor. You will tell your friends about it the next day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every year or so there is a critically acclaimed Oscar nominee for Best Picture that just leaves me confused because I seem to be completely out of touch with these experts. Last year it was The Tree of Lifewhich the Academy loved and I hated. This year though I have not seen all the nominees it is Beasts of the Southern Wilda film that critics and the Academy adore but which left me wondering why I bothered watching the movie in the first place. I just couldn't see what they saw in this film.Before I discuss the odd meandering plot I'll address my biggest problem with the filmthe camerawork. I understand that this is a very cheaply made indie film so they didn't have a lot of money for fancy cameras. However it uses what I call 'the unsteady cam'camera work that deliberately heightens the sense it's being done with a handheld camera. Now they do have affordable cameras that will compensate for motion and can give you a nice steady shot. However about 20 years ago someone thought it would be great to have a shot that looks like it was done on an iPhone. All I know is that watching it might easily make you motion sick! Please please...just give me normal camerawork!!As far as the story goes it never made any sense. It involves a young almost feral child who lives in a horrible little hellish village in Louisiana where everything is broken and old and dirty. I know these people are poor but this went well beyond poverty. The children learn from a teacher who uses foul language and talks about prehistoric 'Aurocs'. As for the child's homelife NONE OF IT MADE ANY SENSE. Her mother was gone...okay. But the father lives in a SEPARATE home nearbyas well as in some separate reality. Seeing a tiny child running about a broken down filthy trailer and playing with a flamethrower of sorts just brought out the dad in meand I wanted to yell out that they need to rescue this child from this horrible environment. She also eats cat food. Soon she burns the place down and then spends most of the rest of the film hanging with her crazy father who was dying. Then there's a big storm and the village is a mess. And in the end after treating the child like a pet for much of the film the dad dies and the child burns him in a funeral pyre. WHAT?!?!?! What was the point?! Who are these people?! Why is this a film I should see?! A tiny little child barbecuing her dead daddy?! What?!? Maybe I am the oddball but I truly hated this film and can't see how it could appeal to the average viewer. It sure didn't appeal to me in any way. I guess the child was good at acting but apart from that I can think of no compelling reason to see this.".

At least The Artist won points for capturing a certain style of filmmaking but this year's candidate for most pretentious and overrated film The Beasts of the Southern Wild almost defies description. Anyway I'll try. Don't expect any attempt here to create characters that have any relation to real people. Beasts is designed to enter the realm of myth. We're taken to a mythical land dubbed The Bathtub a Louisiana Bayou community cut off from the rest of the world by a levee. The houses if you can call them that appear to be nothing more than ramshackle shelters in what appears to be a postKatrina environment.Almost every critic seems to be taken in by the youngest actor ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar sixyearold now nine Quevenzhan Wallis. Wallis in the role of Hushpuppy really should be nominated for best acting in a horror film as she plays an emotionally distant pyromaniac who is the victim of child abuse on the part of her father Wink who actually slaps the child causing her to fall violently to the ground. If you can believe this the rambunctious Hushpuppy retaliates in kind by striking Wink who briefly appears to lose consciousness.Director Benh Zeitlin attempts to mitigate Wink's violent demeanor by depicting him as some kind of tough love saint who saves the child through a raging Katrinalike storm after constructing a floating shelter out of flood debris. At one point Crazy Wink fends off the storm by shooting at the clouds reassuring the now scared child. Later he hatches an illadvised plan to drain salt water brought in by the storm surge by dynamiting the levee. The bottom line is that Zeitlin wants it both ways Wink is both a violent child abuser but underneath a selfsacrificing and devoted father. How touching!If this isn't ridiculous enough the townspeople are all dysfunctional with drinking problems. After everyone is evacuated by FEMAlike stooges Hushpuppy's comrades all make a beeline back to their ruined condemned community. These salt of the earth are particularly good at sucking the heads of crawfish. David Edelstein in New York Magazine puts it best when describing the denizens of the mythical Bathtub Late in the film Hushpuppy's surrogate family is absurdly romanticized their drunken dysfunction ennobled as if living below sea level puts you on a higher spiritual plane.Don't ask me to explain the meaning of the actual beasts of the film's title. In the beginning of the film we learn that melting polar ice caps are releasing prehistoric creatures called Aurochs. During a screening I learned that a separate camera crew took ten days to film fivemonthold pigs dressed up with horns to suggest giant wild boars. Hushpuppy later bonds with the creatures after she returns to the Bathtub with a coterie of inebriated allies.Wouldn't you know it that Wink has contracted a terminal illness and Hushpuppy is there for a grand sendoff at the funeral pyre. That dear friends is Beasts of the Southern Wild in a nutshell. Everyone turns out to be wonderful in the end including the former child abuser but now lovable but terminally ill Wink. And no one including government fiends can stop the wonderful salt of the earth from getting back to their roots in the Bathtub including the oh so lovable but hyperactive Hushpuppy. This time it's Sundance that must take principal responsibility for releasing this drivel to the world. On the other hand every festival can't be perfect. Let's forgive Sundance for this misstep and pray they don't make the same mistake when next year's festival rolls around.".

It's a celebration of animal behavior. It's about community and loneliness. There are echoes of ourselves in all these people in their craziness or compassion or their uneducated wisdom or lack of wisdom which then depends on luck and instinct.In short it's quite a ride and the leading character is a little girl who now is up for an Academy Award nomination for best actress with the only question about that being the weirdly simple and true questionhow much is she acting how much is she just being herself with amazing transparency on the camera? Well the same could be said of lots of adult actors who are really just themselves over and over and so you really can watch Beasts for the stellar and heartwarming effort by Quvenzhan Wallis.There are other performances startling for their gritty or downright filthy realism including the girl's father. But these start to intermix and blend into a larger effort involving the elements of wind and rain and flood unbridled partying moments of tender caring including some folk wisdom by the teacher and healer of the group and so on in an up and down topsy turvy mix.You can love this movie just for its insider look at a culture that you hardly knew possible in the United States any more or even in any third world country for its primitivism. It is in fact rather based on truth though ramped up and made sensational and into a kind of fairy tale. There are in reality some islands that have communities struggling on the fringes along the complex coastline of Louisiana and some of them have almost no development and correspondingly little education and health care. The film was shot on an actual island like this though it given a fictional name nicknamed the Bathtub by the characters.You can also love this movie for its metaphors. If there is misunderstanding and cruelty between father and daughter there is also a base instinct to stick together and survive. If there is a sense of independence there is also a dependency on neighbors and outsiders. If the world seems out of whack and insane you still find ways to make part of it reasonable by either makeshift construction or by changing your outlook. And there are those giant boar animals menacing the main character in some kind of dream. This is really about survival in ways that go beyond physical comfort and food.There is a problem especially for people who appreciate more sophisticated movies for their plots and their filmmaking savvy with the generally meandering narrative. The movie is not without ups and downs and an evolving sense of drama. But it depends more on its scene and its characterizations than on what happens with them. Things happen but they don't particularly develop in the usual sense. You'll be spellbound and maybe even frightened or according to some reviews disgusted by many of the scenes but you might also start to wonder what it's all leading to. That's the narrative instinct in all of us for a development toward some kind of climax or turning point and it's not compelling.So just be immersed. Admire the fact these are amateurs and independents. Click back a few expectations and be surprised by some of the content for its immediacy. Unique and riveting.".

She has her own wisdom and is like all children taking things quite literally.At first the handheld camerawork and insufficient lightfill to illuminate the deep shades gave me the impression that this was a documentary style movie a story reporting the lives of a group of people living off the grid in some southern state of the United States. But when I understood that the Beasts of the title was not a judgment of the movie's humans and their poverty their ignorance their unsophistication but only an alternate noun for animals which the protagonists calls both her pets and humans alike I started seeing the movie for what it really is A dream a fantasy an imaginary story that merged with the contemporary awareness of global warming and so a low tech scifi prediction of how the world may soon become.With that key I read most character's actions the father figure who needs to train his child to survive inciting her to show her guns and be self assured the woman who teaches children the use of herbs to cure the meaning of magic and mythology the tolerance of the other adults for what in a parallel reality would definitively been child abuse. All this is righteously done to prepare the children to survive in a world that wasis? going from merely hard to impossible.Wink's seemingly unsentimental and insensitive behavior towards the little wee child makes then perfect sense and thus his letting go when she can keep at bay the Aurochs a metaphor for her still childlike imagination and her ability to step out of that world and into that of an adult I've got to take care of mine now is the proof that she had grown up enough to survive on her own.Looking back to it this movie is a miracle as improbable as that of La Vita  Bella where Benigni infused humor in a story about the Holocaust without becoming offensive or demeaning. Beasts of a Southern Wild is able to merge a child's world with that of an adult to make us see how the effects of global warming will challenge the lives of many it is a comment and a reminder of Katrina its victims and consequences finally it is a poetic way of describing the world and its inhabitants escaping the ugliness and despair of certain realities by converting it into hope survival and beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film carefully twice. Apparently liberal reviewers got caught up in the notion of a natural mixedethnic local community in Katrinaland and concentrated on the themes of community family and the triumph of naturalness over modernity. These are important themes if dealt with in a coherent sensitive intelligent fashion. However this film offers none of these qualities. In giving the film high ratings many reviewers ignored the film's countless flaws and negative aspects including idiotic at times phonymystical dialogue acceptance of child abuse alcohol abuse and sheer stupidity glorification of prostitution and romanticizing pervasive squalor. A key moment of triumph in the film involves the filthy ragtag assortment of characters physically assaulting a group of public health workers who are trying to assist them. I ask any New York Limousine Liberal reviewer who found this mess to be uplifting to answer the following  would you allow any of the central characters in this film to reside in your apartment building? Of course they would not. Oh  the central character is a very graceful and beautiful young child actress Quvenzhan Wallis. Her main acting consists of grimacing at the camera. I found her to be more puzzling than convincing and literally she has about onetenth the acting chops of Dakota Fanning at the same age who did more with her eyes alone in any one minute on camera than Miss Wallis does in the entire movie. Standing there looking sullen when you are supposed to be experiencing a run of emotion is not acting no matter how adorable you are.".

A key moment of triumph in the film involves the filthy ragtag assortment of characters physically assaulting a group of public health workers who are trying to assist them. I ask any New York Limousine Liberal reviewer who found this mess to be uplifting to answer the following  would you allow any of the central characters in this film to reside in your apartment building? Of course they would not. Oh  the central character is a very graceful and beautiful young child actress Quvenzhan Wallis. Her main acting consists of grimacing at the camera. I found her to be more puzzling than convincing and literally she has about onetenth the acting chops of Dakota Fanning at the same age who did more with her eyes alone in any one minute on camera than Miss Wallis does in the entire movie. Standing there looking sullen when you are supposed to be experiencing a run of emotion is not acting no matter how adorable you are.";

	schema:reviewBody "I heard a lot about this movie on IMDb a few months ago and its recent Oscar nominations peaked my interest. So I decided to give it a go and not only was it a disappointment I was actually pssed off after watching it. In some ways I'm flabbergasted that this film has received so much praise. But I can also see how it very much fits a formula of what certain critics and film buffs usually want to spew praise over. 'Into The Wild' being another great example of this. 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' BotSW is one of those movies that comes along now and then and manages to pull a great hoodwink on a lot of the movie going public. A hoodwink in that it seems from the majority of the reviews that the content of this movie and the messages that it leaves you with seem to have been largely ignored by most people. Those messages being that things such as child abuse alcoholism and casual prostitution are fine as long as they're done against a backdrop of tweeness.There is so much wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start but I'll give it a go1. The Acting Apart from the girl who plays Hushpuppy the acting in this film is pretty poor. I guess some of the actors aren't helped by the roles that they're playing nearly all of the adults that we see for the majority of the film are either layabout drunkards or prostitutes.2. The Dialogue When it's not incoherent nonsense being babbled in a thick Cajun accent by some drunkard it's some pseudointellectual twee subForrest Gump twaddle being philosophised by a 6year old. When it all goes quiet behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. Urgh3. The Story BotSW drags out for 90 mins yet the story itself that's actually hidden within the movie would be told in a third of that time. Oh yes but that's right it's not the destination that matters right? It's the journey? And what a tedious journey it is for all concerned.4. The Cinematography As other reviewers have pointed out the handheld camera work is taken to the extreme on BotSW to the point that you're almost nauseous by the end of the movie.5. The Moral Messages of the Film This is by far the biggest problem that I have with this movie and why I'm somewhat shocked that it has received so much praise. There are many number of issues that I have with this.The Parent  Child Dynamic Hushpuppy's father is an unemployed somewhat unhinged drunkard. He has apparently made no effort to provide a life for his child as they live in a shack that looks like it has been assembled from foraged and discarded junk. He drinks almost constantly he beats his daughter screams at her regularly he finds out he has a serious terminal illness and yet he makes no plans to provide a life for his daughter after he passes away. Yet rarely does the director or the story suggest that Wink isn't a good father. His death isn't portrayed as Hushpuppy being freed from a man who may little to no attempt to father her when on earth. Rather it's more portrayed as poor old Wink being freed from the illness ravaging his body.The Actions of the Protagonists As other reviewers have pointed out they make absolutely no sense. Rather than seek help from the mainland after the storm the main characters decide to try and blow a hole in the levy with an improvised bomb. The suggestion being that rather than lower themselves to accepting aid from the outside they are willing to endanger lives of people directly on the other side of the levy and destroy it through their criminal actions. Wink consistently refuses any assistance for his apparent Leukaemia and makes no attempt to provide a life for Hushpuppy after he dies short of leaving her in the care of a man with an even worse drinking problem than he has.Them vs. Us any help offered by kind people from the outside in the aftermath of the storm is consistently treated with utter distain by the main characters. Their rejection of outside assistance is never explored past the shallow suggestion that they are outsiders  not from the Bathtub  don't understand our way of life.".

She of course loves her mean drunk father and all the furred and feathered creatures that live in their little farmlet. There is an air about the film that is surreal. The characters in their madness are a bit like the characters in Mad Max. They are all oversized and eminently watchable in their enthusiastic inebriation. But I wished for a few moments of lucidity where people just talk to each other without ranting and raving. The overall impression that I got is one of sadness. There is very little joy  other than that which comes from the bottle  in their lives. This said I enjoyed the movie. It is very watchable but in a guilty sort of way. Their lives are painful.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why Beasts of the Southern wild has connected with critics so much. This is a lowbudget film directed by Benh Zeitlin in his debut feature. Movies like this typically find a strong critical reception but are forgotten come award season in favor of bigger movies from more accomplished people  this happened to Duncan Jones' excellent Moon in 2009. Sure Beasts is visually creative original and a prime example of how ambition and imagination can overcome a small budget but movie has some serious problems that can't be ignored. I don't blame the filmmakers intents clearly a lot of work and heart went in the making of this movie however the characterization and storytelling are amateurish.Beasts has three good things going for it the score performances and the setting. The musical score is truly exceptional and it might be my favorite of the year. A lot of the film's beauty and style comes from the excellent sound design and music. Much has been made of young Quvenzhan Wallis' performance and rightfully so. This is an incredibly strong performance for somebody so young. The rest of the actors are solid as well. The performances aren't showy but incredibly naturalist and convincing. The setting of the movie a forgotten area of the southern bayou territory is wonderfully realized and provides dozens of incredible shots.Before I get into the problems with narrative I have to mention the poor use of handheld photography. I really do not understand where independent filmmakers got the idea that having shaky cam automatically makes their movie somehow more artsy but Beasts is yet another movie that poorly utilizes the technique though nothing here is as bad as in Melancholia. Handeld camerawork can work well in the hands of somebody who knows what they are doing  check out Breaking Bad to see this style perfected. The setting of the film provides many aweinspiring vistas and landscapes but the camera can't stop moving long enough for the viewer to fully digest and admire the image which is truly a shame.The characterization in Beasts is the weakest area of the film. Though Hushpuppy is a wonderful character and perfectly portrayed by Wallis the supporting cast isn't up to the same standard. First I have to question the purpose of writing somebody so young as the main character. I suppose the goal was to see a harsh reality through the eyes of somebody young and innocent but it is at odds with the movies message one's culture and family are all important I'm simplifying the main theme but I don't want to get into a discussion of the movie's misguided attempt to criticize modern society and civilization which is embarrassingly handled and even includes stock footage of glaciers breaking apart. Global warming!. However Hushpuppy is too young to comprehend her own situation. She lives in crushing poverty her father is an abusive drunk and her friends and family put her own wellness at risk for the sake of preserving their cancerous lifestyle. The filmmakers want us to stand up and cheer at these people's will to fight the influence of modern society but I can't help to look in horror as this child is abused and put in constant danger for no real reason. For this reason any moral ambiguity is left out. Hushpuppy isn't old enough to question her situation. If she was capable to debating about whether to stay in her manner of living or move to a more modern culture and ultimately chose to stay then the film would have supplied its character with a strong arc. However Hushpuppy stays because she simply doesn't know any better. This is a problem because our main character is not capable to supplying any dramatic tension or conflict.Every person in the community aside from Hushpuppy is onedimensional and often an empty husk brought to life simply with southern stereotypes. I don't care about any of them and I was hoping Hushpuppy could escape this life and find a place where her thoughtfulness and intelligence could be fostered. However the filmmakers don't see how incredibly contradictory their own film is. Perhaps if this society's way of living was properly explored and the audience given a reason to understand why these people love their way of living so much then we could sympathize with their plight.Beasts of the Southern Wild feels like a mishmash of ideas handled better in other films. A young girl dealing with hardship through imagination was better realized in Pan's Labyrinth. A forgotten area of America where young people are trapped is a concept explored in the superior Winter's Bone partly because that movie doesn't romanticize suffering and poverty but portrays it in a honest and real way. As a celebration of the United States' unique Southern culture Treme makes Beasts look like a high school research paper. I'm not saying that Beasts of the Southern Wild has to be the best at what it does expectations that unreasonable will only lead to disappointment but I do expect the filmmakers to delivery a story that is consistent with its thematic goals. Beasts fails in this and the movie is hard to care about and the characters impossible to empathize with.".

It is terrible that is for sure. Let me tell you why I think so. If it is trying to be a cautionary tale about climate change it shouldn't try so hard entertainment and politics are like oil and water the two don't mix and should always be kept separate. If it is trying to breathe life into the worst ideas and conspiracy theories from Hurricane Katrina it succeeds in doing that. Don't evacuate during a storm somebody blew up the levies don't go to a government shelter try to ride out the storm with your community. These ideas should be buried along with this alleged script.If this movie if trying to show the courage of a father trying to raise his daughter alone it fails miserably. The father is physically and emotionally abusive to his daughter and this abuse is disguised as preparation for a brutal world. It's an insult to single fathers and mothers everywhere who raise their children with love and respect. This movie is like The Road meets Waterworld if you like those movies And I didn't you will love this movie.The socalled story meanders aimlessly and has absolutely no structure no dramatic arc and the story seems to end whenever the writers run out of dumb ideas to peddle. And when all else fails the writers pour on the sentimentality there's no sign that a movie is in trouble more than shameless tearjerking. There didn't seem to be a script at all the actors seemed to be making it up as they went. And oh yes not to be left out there are prostitutes to take care of the children. Family values? I hope not.On the positive side Ms. Wallis was cute in typical Hollywood precocious kid fashion but hardly deserving of an Oscar nomination. And I learned what aurochs are hardly worth sitting through this listless film.Beasts of the Southern Wild Incoherent ideas tame this beast.If you like more fearless truthtelling about film read my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.".

	schema:headline " A Revelation";
	schema:reviewBody "What a gorgeous film. I saw this last Saturday night and was instantly in love. With family from the bayou which is where this film takes place I marveled at how rich and accurate the dialog was. The acting lacked in several of the supporting parts but wow! there was no acting prowess lacking in the two main characterizations of the film I also enjoyed the acting by Gina Montana as Miss Bathsheeba.Dwight Henry is truly something in his turn as the protagonist Hushpuppy's father Wink. He is convincing in every facet of his reasonably complex portrayal of a confused and directionless father. He is frightening when angry smileinducing when kind and heartbreaking when both. You may say Well he's just playing himself. In response He's not. He may be a father but he lives in New Orleans and had to be convinced to audition because he couldn't afford to not work at the small bakery he owns in the 7th Ward to go across the street and read for the producers and director. He's a revelation who has unfortunately already stated that regardless of what happens he's pretty much done acting. What a shame.Anyway moving on the real revelation is Quvenzhane Wallis as the protagonist a girl named Hushpuppy. Never having acted before she really is something else. Many child acting performances receive acclaim because they are children and you simply don't expect children to be able to act at all much less some. In Wallis's case she a 9 year old I believe deserves any award nominations and perhaps wins she may receive somewhere down the line this year. She acts better than half the paid bodies on celluloid these days and she too lives a normal life in a town not one in the swamp. The only comparable performance to which I can liken hers in terms of prowess and general effect is that of 9year old Justin Henry and the fabulous portrayal he gave in Kramer vs. Kramer. Garland in The Wizard of Oz is too old as is Peggy Ann Garner in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. The difference between Wallis and Henry however is that Henry was a supporting player in a film in which his other 3 main actors were nominated for acting Oscars with Hoffman and Streep winning and Alexander losing to Streep. Henry of course lost to Douglas though he should have lost to Duvall instead. Conversely Wallis is required to carry an entire film. She is present in probably 80 of the fantastic film and she is magnetic. I don't usually have an issue with voiceovers in a film but there are a few instances where I have almost pulled my hair out because they were so bad. Not the case here. Much of Wallis's lines especially early on are said via voiceover. This just makes Wallis's job even more difficult. She has to act convincingly without saying much of anything and simultaneously has to make the voiceover sound interesting so that people don't bludgeon themselves to death. It's an understatement to say that she succeeds completely. Her voiceover melds eerily perfectly with everything that she does on screen something that the cinematographer film editor and sound editor also all deserve major kudos for.One more thing firsttime director Benh Zeitlin's direction is brilliant though elongated at a few points. His ability to tell the story effectively basically nullifies every issue with his pacing. Many films with child protagonists are hard to follow because the director fails to effectively engulf the viewer in the child's point of view. Therefore the following childish plot action is seen as confusing or stupid or both. Zeitlin and his amazingly competent crew completely succeed at bringing the viewer in the mind of Hushpuppy. We see her father like she sees her father. We see Miss Bathsheeba like she sees Miss Bathsheeba. The sharply divided opinions about the shaky camera work are unnecessary. The camera work is shaky but so it the mind of a child. Their minds are constantly flitting back and forth between one thing and the next they're swaying to and fro like the camera. Just another way to interpret the inventive camera work is this Hushpuppy is trying to find her place in the world just like she is trying to find her place in the camera view.In closing Benh Zeitlin please work your magic many times again preferably sometime soon. This is the best film of the year thus far and I will be hard pressed to keep my mind open enough to find a film that I think is better than this come September October November and December Oscar season.".

He may be a father but he lives in New Orleans and had to be convinced to audition because he couldn't afford to not work at the small bakery he owns in the 7th Ward to go across the street and read for the producers and director. He's a revelation who has unfortunately already stated that regardless of what happens he's pretty much done acting. What a shame.Anyway moving on the real revelation is Quvenzhane Wallis as the protagonist a girl named Hushpuppy. Never having acted before she really is something else. Many child acting performances receive acclaim because they are children and you simply don't expect children to be able to act at all much less some. In Wallis's case she a 9 year old I believe deserves any award nominations and perhaps wins she may receive somewhere down the line this year. She acts better than half the paid bodies on celluloid these days and she too lives a normal life in a town not one in the swamp. The only comparable performance to which I can liken hers in terms of prowess and general effect is that of 9year old Justin Henry and the fabulous portrayal he gave in Kramer vs. Kramer. Garland in The Wizard of Oz is too old as is Peggy Ann Garner in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. The difference between Wallis and Henry however is that Henry was a supporting player in a film in which his other 3 main actors were nominated for acting Oscars with Hoffman and Streep winning and Alexander losing to Streep. Henry of course lost to Douglas though he should have lost to Duvall instead. Conversely Wallis is required to carry an entire film. She is present in probably 80 of the fantastic film and she is magnetic. I don't usually have an issue with voiceovers in a film but there are a few instances where I have almost pulled my hair out because they were so bad. Not the case here. Much of Wallis's lines especially early on are said via voiceover. This just makes Wallis's job even more difficult. She has to act convincingly without saying much of anything and simultaneously has to make the voiceover sound interesting so that people don't bludgeon themselves to death. It's an understatement to say that she succeeds completely. Her voiceover melds eerily perfectly with everything that she does on screen something that the cinematographer film editor and sound editor also all deserve major kudos for.One more thing firsttime director Benh Zeitlin's direction is brilliant though elongated at a few points. His ability to tell the story effectively basically nullifies every issue with his pacing. Many films with child protagonists are hard to follow because the director fails to effectively engulf the viewer in the child's point of view. Therefore the following childish plot action is seen as confusing or stupid or both. Zeitlin and his amazingly competent crew completely succeed at bringing the viewer in the mind of Hushpuppy. We see her father like she sees her father. We see Miss Bathsheeba like she sees Miss Bathsheeba. The sharply divided opinions about the shaky camera work are unnecessary. The camera work is shaky but so it the mind of a child. Their minds are constantly flitting back and forth between one thing and the next they're swaying to and fro like the camera. Just another way to interpret the inventive camera work is this Hushpuppy is trying to find her place in the world just like she is trying to find her place in the camera view.In closing Benh Zeitlin please work your magic many times again preferably sometime soon. This is the best film of the year thus far and I will be hard pressed to keep my mind open enough to find a film that I think is better than this come September October November and December Oscar season.";

Water does a wonderful job of skewering the Big Powers the U.S. Britain Russia and France. The colonial nature of these empires forms the basis for a hysterical skirmish over water rights on a barely survivable Caribbean island. The film's executive producer was none other than George Harrison. Not surprisingly the music from the film is fantastic although no soundtrack album is available that I am aware of. The luminaries drawn to the movie's witty script included musicians Ringo Starr John Lord Eric Clapton and others and the cast includes Michael Caine J.J. Walker and Billy Connelly the latter two in their best roles I believe. Unfortunately most of the humour requires knowledge of international and colonial politics without which the film is pardon the pun dry.".

The colonial nature of these empires forms the basis for a hysterical skirmish over water rights on a barely survivable Caribbean island. The film's executive producer was none other than George Harrison. Not surprisingly the music from the film is fantastic although no soundtrack album is available that I am aware of. The luminaries drawn to the movie's witty script included musicians Ringo Starr John Lord Eric Clapton and others and the cast includes Michael Caine J.J. Walker and Billy Connelly the latter two in their best roles I believe. Unfortunately most of the humour requires knowledge of international and colonial politics without which the film is pardon the pun dry.";

The concept alone is a large part of the film's appeal rarely have we seen a big screen satire with the bravado to take on colonialism. The script is by legendary Britcom writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and while it is not up to the standard of the best of their television work it contains many amusing moments. The main problem with the film is that it has no real momentum. The plot often moves at a sluggish pace and some scenes feel like they add nothing to the film and could have easily been dropped. What ultimately saves the film is the performance of Leonard Rossiter in his last film role before his untimely death. Whilst the character of Sir Malcolm Leveridge offers little challenge to Rigsby or Reginald Perrin Rossiter still provides a great number of laughs and is the best reason to see the film.The film's soundtrack is also very enjoyable in particular a great title track from Eddy Grant.".

	schema:headline " A very funny political satire";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a very funny political satire with many wellaimed even though at times rather too obvious digs at the politics and politicians of the 80's. Although it is not in the league of Dr.Strangelove in terms of satiric black humour it doesn't really try to be. The jokes are at times hilarious and in most cases delightful in an oldfashioned comedy way. It is a lot looser in its structure and has a very easygoing pace that helps the satire along. Most of the political satire works even today which makes one think if things have changed all that much in the past 15 years. Both Michael Caine and Billy Connolly are very funny while being supported by a cast of relatively unknown but excellent comic actors. All in all it was a very satisfying comedy that had me laughing out loud in almost every scene.".

I say this for a variety of reasons the pacing of this drama is quicker and faster moving compared to other related Chinese films before its time. Generally Chinese film have a tendency to be slow when set aside the general American preferred standards.It presents to us some of the Northern Chinese cultural traditions. Its display of the Japanese brutality could not have been better presented.  The Japanese have been quite swinish during this period in Chinese history. All I can say is it says it all as it really was very well indeed.This is the last but most important reason to watch this film... look at its cinematography.  It has to be among the best I have ever seen.  It amazed me to see how resourceful a cinematographer can be when working for a film of little budget.  Yimou showed me how simple things can be filmed to be works of art.  Unfortunately I have not been able to see the film in its original cinematic scope however even in full screen it is still quite visually stunning.  The aperture fstop and lens settings were set just perfectly giving the film a very rich vibrant look making Yimou my favorite Chinese film cinematographerdirector of all time to date.

	schema:headline " Barbaric and beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I don't think this is quite as good as some of the other films that master Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou has madee.g. Raise the Red Lantern 1991 The Story of Qiu Ju 1991 Ju Duo 1990Red Sorghum is nonetheless an outstanding film strikingly presented visually and thematically.Gong Li stars as the betrothed of an old leprous wine maker. The film opens with her being carried in a covered sedan chair to the consummation of her wedding by a rowdy crew from the sorghum winery. It is the 1930s or a little before. They joust her about according to tradition and sing a most scary song about how horrible her life is going to be married to the leprous old man. Through a break in the sedan's enclosure as she sits alone in fear and dread she catches sight of Jiang Wen a burly naturalistic man with a piercing countenance. A little later after a bit of unsuccessful highway robbery during which she is released from her confinement they exchange meaningful glances. The young man doing the voiceover identifies them as his Grandmother and Grandfather. Obviously the leprous old man is going to miss out!Zhang Yimou's technique here as in all of his films that I have seen is to tell a story as simply as possible from a strong moral viewpoint with as little dialogue as possible and to rely on sumptuous sets intense highly focused camera work veracious acting by a carefully directed cast and of course to feature the great beauty of his star the incomparable and mesmerizing Gong Li. If you haven't seen her Red Sorghum is a good place to start. Jiang Wen is also very good and brings both a comedic quality to the screen as well as an invigorating vitality. His courageous and sometimes boorish behavior seems exactly right.I should warn the viewer that this film contains striking violence and would be rated R in the United States for that and for showing a little boy always naked and for the watering of the wine by Jiang Wen and the boy. Indeed the film is a little crude at times and represents a view of precommunist China and its culture that the present rulers find agreeable. The depiction of the barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese soldiers is accurate from what I know but I must say that this film would never have seen the light of day had communist soldiers been depicted in such a manner.Nonetheless the treatment is appropriate since Red Sorghum is a masculine lusty film suggesting the influence of Akira Kurosawa with perhaps a bit of Clint Eastwood blended in. There are bandits and tests of manhood. The men get drunk and behave badly. Masculine sexual energy is glorified especially in the scene where Jiang Wen carries Gong Li off to bed holding her like a barrel under his arm feet forward after having watered her wine as though to mark his territory. The camera trailing them shows her reach up and put her arms around his neck and shoulder as much in sexual embrace as in balance.Obviously this is Zhang Yimou before he became completely enamored of the feminist viewpoint yet somehow although Gong Li is allowed to fall in love with her rapist something not possible in contemporary American cinema Zhang Yimou manages to depict her in a light that celebrates her strength as a woman. One can see here the germination of the full blown feminism that Zhang Yimou would later develop in the aforementioned Raise the Red Lantern Ju Dou and Qiu Ju. As usual in Zhang Yimou's films not only are the sets gorgeous but the accompanying accoutermentsthe pottery the costumes the lush verdure of the sorghum fields even the walls and interiors of the meat house restaurantbar and Gong Li's bedroomare feasts for the eyes somehow looming before cinematographer Gu Changwei's camera more vividly than reality. There are some indications here however that Zhang Yimou had not yet completely mastered his art and indeed was working under the constraint of a limited budget. For example there was no opening in the sedan through which Gong Li could see Jiang Wen and there shouldn't have been one a peephole maybe. The pouring of the wine into presumably empty bowls that obviously already contained wine by Jiang Wen needed more practice. In his later films Zhang Yimou would reshoot such scenes to make them consistent with the audience's perception. Additionally Gong Li's character was not sufficiently developed early on for us to appreciate her confident governance of the winery she had inherited. Uncle Luohan's apparently jealous departure from the winery and his implied relationship with and loyalty to Gong Li were also underdeveloped.However these are minor points in what really matters in film makingtelling a story and engaging the audience in the significance and the experience of the talein these things Zhang Yimou not only excelled but gave promise of his extraordinary talent that would be realized in the films to come. See this by all means but don't miss his Raise the Red Lantern in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	onyx:emotionText "Although I don't think this is quite as good as some of the other films that master Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou has madee.g. Raise the Red Lantern 1991 The Story of Qiu Ju 1991 Ju Duo 1990Red Sorghum is nonetheless an outstanding film strikingly presented visually and thematically.Gong Li stars as the betrothed of an old leprous wine maker. The film opens with her being carried in a covered sedan chair to the consummation of her wedding by a rowdy crew from the sorghum winery. It is the 1930s or a little before. They joust her about according to tradition and sing a most scary song about how horrible her life is going to be married to the leprous old man. Through a break in the sedan's enclosure as she sits alone in fear and dread she catches sight of Jiang Wen a burly naturalistic man with a piercing countenance. A little later after a bit of unsuccessful highway robbery during which she is released from her confinement they exchange meaningful glances. The young man doing the voiceover identifies them as his Grandmother and Grandfather. Obviously the leprous old man is going to miss out!Zhang Yimou's technique here as in all of his films that I have seen is to tell a story as simply as possible from a strong moral viewpoint with as little dialogue as possible and to rely on sumptuous sets intense highly focused camera work veracious acting by a carefully directed cast and of course to feature the great beauty of his star the incomparable and mesmerizing Gong Li. If you haven't seen her Red Sorghum is a good place to start. Jiang Wen is also very good and brings both a comedic quality to the screen as well as an invigorating vitality. His courageous and sometimes boorish behavior seems exactly right.I should warn the viewer that this film contains striking violence and would be rated R in the United States for that and for showing a little boy always naked and for the watering of the wine by Jiang Wen and the boy. Indeed the film is a little crude at times and represents a view of precommunist China and its culture that the present rulers find agreeable. The depiction of the barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese soldiers is accurate from what I know but I must say that this film would never have seen the light of day had communist soldiers been depicted in such a manner.Nonetheless the treatment is appropriate since Red Sorghum is a masculine lusty film suggesting the influence of Akira Kurosawa with perhaps a bit of Clint Eastwood blended in. There are bandits and tests of manhood. The men get drunk and behave badly. Masculine sexual energy is glorified especially in the scene where Jiang Wen carries Gong Li off to bed holding her like a barrel under his arm feet forward after having watered her wine as though to mark his territory. The camera trailing them shows her reach up and put her arms around his neck and shoulder as much in sexual embrace as in balance.Obviously this is Zhang Yimou before he became completely enamored of the feminist viewpoint yet somehow although Gong Li is allowed to fall in love with her rapist something not possible in contemporary American cinema Zhang Yimou manages to depict her in a light that celebrates her strength as a woman. One can see here the germination of the full blown feminism that Zhang Yimou would later develop in the aforementioned Raise the Red Lantern Ju Dou and Qiu Ju. As usual in Zhang Yimou's films not only are the sets gorgeous but the accompanying accoutermentsthe pottery the costumes the lush verdure of the sorghum fields even the walls and interiors of the meat house restaurantbar and Gong Li's bedroomare feasts for the eyes somehow looming before cinematographer Gu Changwei's camera more vividly than reality. There are some indications here however that Zhang Yimou had not yet completely mastered his art and indeed was working under the constraint of a limited budget. For example there was no opening in the sedan through which Gong Li could see Jiang Wen and there shouldn't have been one a peephole maybe. The pouring of the wine into presumably empty bowls that obviously already contained wine by Jiang Wen needed more practice. In his later films Zhang Yimou would reshoot such scenes to make them consistent with the audience's perception. Additionally Gong Li's character was not sufficiently developed early on for us to appreciate her confident governance of the winery she had inherited. Uncle Luohan's apparently jealous departure from the winery and his implied relationship with and loyalty to Gong Li were also underdeveloped.However these are minor points in what really matters in film makingtelling a story and engaging the audience in the significance and the experience of the talein these things Zhang Yimou not only excelled but gave promise of his extraordinary talent that would be realized in the films to come. See this by all means but don't miss his Raise the Red Lantern in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!";

And yet for all its undeniable physical beauty and colorful action the film can be a dry experience at least until the outbreak of the second SinoJapanese War in the 1930s.

Each one of his films brings something new to the table and delves into such issues as urbanrural conflicts political corruption and JapanChina relations. Red Sorghum is Zhang Yimou's first film as a director and while it may be a bit simpler than many of his later films it contains elements that almost every fan of his films will be familiar with beautiful settings very fleshed out characters and moments of conflict where those who possess little power are overwhelmed by larger forces. Also Red Sorghum is Gong Li first film and it is nice to see that even at such a young age 21 that she already possessed on screen charisma that can really grip the viewer's heart. While not as masterful as her performances in To Live or Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine her tears and iron core are still quite moving.Based on Mo Yan's novel of the same name Red Sorghum tells the story of a young girl nicknamed Nine she is the ninth child of her family and she was born on the ninth day of the ninth month who was given to a leper named Big Head Li who traded a mule for her. On her trip to Big Head Li's home while being jostled about in the sedan chair as custom would have it Nine peeks from behind the curtains and spots one of the wellmuscled sedan carriers and falls in love with him at first site. Later After killing a would be thief and being able to see Nine for the first time the sedan carrier who is only referred to as my grandfather by the narrator falls instantly in love also. On a trip back to her father's home as custom would hold on the third day of marriage Nine is accosted by a masked man who turns out to be the sedan carrier. There under the shadows of the sorghum they make love. While a her father's home Big Head Li is killed although no one knows who did it so upon her return to the winery Nine inherits the place and asks the workers to stay and work for her. Included amongst these workers is an older man named Luohan whom Nine takes to immediately. However the Sedan carrier also returns drunk and says some quite rude things about Nine however the two eventually come to peace with each other and for a while things seem to be going welluntil the Japanese army invades.Red Sorghum is at times hilarious such as when The sedan carrier Jiang Wen sings and cries to himself when he is in a wine pot for three days sad and absolutely brutal. There are some scenes after the Japanese army has invaded that will truly make one cringe. While some of his later films are better known and show the evidence of skilled craftsmanship from years of experience Red Sorghum should not be missed for its significance in the history of recent Chinese cinema as the first pairing of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li.".

	schema:headline " Reviewing Red Sorghum 1988";
	schema:reviewBody "Reviewing Red Sorghum 1988 The movie Red Sorghum 1988 adapted from the novel of the same tile won Golden Bear Award at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival. The film won the international reputation for its director Yimou Zhang and also star the actress Li Gong.This film is about the story of 'my grandmother and grandfather' in a rural village in Northern China. The story started from my grandmother who was on the way to her prearranged old husband's winery distillery factory. My grandmother a young bride was sent to get married with an owner of a wine distillery factory. After experiencing attack by a bandit abduction and mysterious death of her prearranged husband my grandmother inherited that wine distillery. The story was ended by the death of my grandma during the period of Japanese invasion.Offscreen voices adopted as one important dramatic element is unique characteristic of this movie. The plot is structured into a completed story by the narrator I  the grandson of the protagonists. At the beginning audiences can hear the offscreen voices arose I'll talk about my grandpa and my grandpa Red Sorghum1988. The narrator did not appear in the movie which makes him in the neutral objective position in the other hand he is the descendant of story characters which makes him becoming a subjective participation to some degree. I was telling the story and also I was told about my family history. Offscreen narration appear 12 times in the movie. The relationships between characters and the progress of plot at turning point depends on 'my narration' for example the relationship between my grandma her prearranged leprosy husband and sedan carriage worker my grandpa the mysterious death of leprosy husband the process of my grandma abduction the left of Uncle Lohan and the appearance of Japanese troops. The integration of real family history and unreal story completely depends on my offscreen narrations which helps the connection of past with present the real with the unreal. The film narrative approach ultimately generates historical distant effects in time and space.Cinematographic style is another prominent characteristic of the film. The director stylized the film with intense and rich red color. The screen is completely occupied by bright red color. At the beginning a red scarf is filled with the whole screen under the red scarf is my grandma's brighten young face with red makeup the red sorghum stalk is glittered with the flash sunlight in the fields the red sorghum wine liking rains is prayed around the naked body is completely full of blood and the world become the totally red after the mysterious total solar eclipse.

	onyx:emotionText "Reviewing Red Sorghum 1988 The movie Red Sorghum 1988 adapted from the novel of the same tile won Golden Bear Award at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival. The film won the international reputation for its director Yimou Zhang and also star the actress Li Gong.This film is about the story of 'my grandmother and grandfather' in a rural village in Northern China. The story started from my grandmother who was on the way to her prearranged old husband's winery distillery factory. My grandmother a young bride was sent to get married with an owner of a wine distillery factory. After experiencing attack by a bandit abduction and mysterious death of her prearranged husband my grandmother inherited that wine distillery. The story was ended by the death of my grandma during the period of Japanese invasion.Offscreen voices adopted as one important dramatic element is unique characteristic of this movie. The plot is structured into a completed story by the narrator I  the grandson of the protagonists. At the beginning audiences can hear the offscreen voices arose I'll talk about my grandpa and my grandpa Red Sorghum1988. The narrator did not appear in the movie which makes him in the neutral objective position in the other hand he is the descendant of story characters which makes him becoming a subjective participation to some degree. I was telling the story and also I was told about my family history. Offscreen narration appear 12 times in the movie. The relationships between characters and the progress of plot at turning point depends on 'my narration' for example the relationship between my grandma her prearranged leprosy husband and sedan carriage worker my grandpa the mysterious death of leprosy husband the process of my grandma abduction the left of Uncle Lohan and the appearance of Japanese troops. The integration of real family history and unreal story completely depends on my offscreen narrations which helps the connection of past with present the real with the unreal. The film narrative approach ultimately generates historical distant effects in time and space.Cinematographic style is another prominent characteristic of the film. The director stylized the film with intense and rich red color. The screen is completely occupied by bright red color. At the beginning a red scarf is filled with the whole screen under the red scarf is my grandma's brighten young face with red makeup the red sorghum stalk is glittered with the flash sunlight in the fields the red sorghum wine liking rains is prayed around the naked body is completely full of blood and the world become the totally red after the mysterious total solar eclipse. At the end of the film the flowing black red sorghum emphasized on the screen which generates a brilliant and strong visual effect. This is not a realistic representation of time and space it is the externalization of human innate desire for natural life and validity. Regardless of the plot the extension of the red force gives audiences a pure emotional experience that is filled with wild and heroic.Unlike other Chinese films of the same period Red Sorghum is not a typical realism film.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very brief review of Red Sorghum 1987 Ju Dou 1990 Raise the Red Lantern 1991 The Story of Qiu Ju 1992 and To Live 1994 five films by Zhang Yimou. Each film stars actress Gong Li each works as a companionpiece to the other and each deals almost exclusively with the oppression of women within early 20th century China.Zhang's debut Red Sorghum stars Gong Li as Young Nine a peasant who is sold to a wealthy leper. Things only get worse for Nine who must fend off a series of rapists mean men and the Japanese Army itself all the while running a successful winery. Throughout the film Zhang uses boxes deep reds and tight squares to amplify Nine's sexist surroundings. Indeed the film opens with Nine literally forced into a box a social reality which she spends the film attempting to break free of or even transform. For Zhang China wasn't disrupted by the Japanese invasion it was hell long before. Like most of Zhang's films during this period Sorghum sketches the cultural and socioeconomic conditions which spurred China with hopeful arms toward Maoism.Zhang's next film Ju Dou covers similar material. Here Gong Li plays Ju Dou a woman sold to a violent oaf When I buy an animal I treat it as I wish! who owns a fabric dying establishment. After her husband is crippled Ju Dou forges a relationship with Yang Jinshan a relative. When Ju Dou and Jinshan have a child together the kid grows up into a mean brute. Like Sorghum Ju Duo is a tragedy obsessed with rich reds boxes and patriarchal violence. Whilst its plot superficially echoes Zhang's own adulterous thenscandalous affair with Gong Li Zhang seems more interested in the way Ju Dou and Jinshan hide their illicit affair from other villagers. For Zhang the duo's tacit submission to social mores merely validates the notion that their love is scandalous and so merely validates the symbolic power of the crippled patriarch a power which Ju Dou's son must  as per his mother's very own actions  thereby respect and avenge.The arbitrary nature of power and how this power is always symbolic and always unconsciously maintained via ritual personal belief and shared delusions is itself the obsession of Zhang's Raise the Red Lantern. Here Gong Li again plays a woman sold to a wealthy man. This man has several other wives all of whom begin to violently fight one another in an attempt to win the patriarch's adoration. Is it the fate of women to become concubines? a character asks pointing to the film's deft critique of feudal relations. Zhang's first masterpiece Lantern is again obsessed with reds boxes and sequestered women though here Zhang replaces the voluptuous colours camera work and widescreen Cinemascopes of his previous films with something more restrained. Because of this Zhang's conveying of claustrophobia and oppression of mind and spirit pushed to madness feels all the more powerful.Next came Zhang's The Story of Qiu Ju. A near masterpiece it stars Gong Li as Qui Ju a peasant farmer who embarks on a quest to avenge her husband who's had his crotch kicked in by a village leader. More emasculated by this attack than her own husband Qui Ju's quest takes her all across China dealing with a Chinese bureaucracy which seems quite helpful polite and even rational. And yet still this bureaucracy does not please Qiu Ju. It thinks in terms of commodities monetary recompense and punishment whilst Qiu Ju like Zhang Yimou himself whose previous films were banned without explanation by Chinese authorities seems more interested in acquiring a shuafa a simple explanation and apology. By the film's end both the primitive justice of rural China and the civilized justice of modern China are simultaneously mocked praised and shown to be thoroughly incompatible. Zhang's first neorealist film Qiu Ju was shot with hidden cameras amateur actors and so is filled with subtle observations cruel ironies and beautiful sketches of peasant life.One of Zhang's finest films To Live followed. It stars Gong Li as Jiazhen the wife of a wealthy man Ge You who is addicted to gambling. When this gambling results in the family losing its mansions riches and status Jiazhen and her husband are forced onto the streets. Ironically this setback saves the family the Cultural Revolution arrives and with China's shift to nascent communism all wealthy land owners are demonised attacked and killed.Unlike most films which tackle life under Mao's Great Leap Forward To Live carefully juggles the good and bad of what was essentially a nation shirking off feudalism monarchs uniting and then trying clumsily to cook up some form of egalitarian society. This quest results in all manners of contradictions and sociopolitical paradoxes community solidarity and a simple life save our heroes but their world is one of paranoia danger and in which everyone and everything is accused of being reactionary. The film ends with Jiazhen's daughter dying a death which is the result of both unchecked consumption a doctor dies gobbling food and communist reorganisation all competent doctors have been killedjailed for being counterrevolutionary. This jab at communism got the film banned in China further highlighting the insecurity of the regime. Ironically Maoism saw massive positive health care reformations and saw an improvement in mortality rates which at times surpassed even then contemporary Britain and parts of America life expectancy doubled from 32 years in the 1940s to 65 years in the 1970s. But such things don't concern Zhang. Spanning decades To Live is mostly a broad account of life love loss and growth the personal and political all unfolding upon a canvas that is devastatingly cruel. Significantly the film's title is both adjectival and a command this is what life is but one must nevertheless always push on. Gong Li and Ge You in particular are excellent.7.910  See Yellow Earth 1984.".

This is not her best work but that is like saying The Devil Wears Prada is not Meryl Streep's best work.

As the film progresses he grows closer to Gong Li's character.The last part of the movie deals with the Second SinoJapanese War and the invasion of the Imperial Japanese Army. Up to this point the film has been relatively light to digest. However the last part adds drama by depicting some of the horrors that the occupation brought with it.The film's end is definitely one of the highlights here. I won't spoil it but it makes a great case of why Zhang Yimou is often referred to as the 'Master of Color'. It's nothing short of amazing.In conclusion while I definitely like this film it does miss some of the drive and drama that are present in Zhang's best films.

	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with the narrator's telling us that a father has just arranged the marriage of his daughter  the egregiously beautiful Gong Li  to a wine merchant who is rich but leprous. We see the bridetobe carried in a bright red sedan by half a dozen men followed by another small band playing Chinese music on tinny instruments. It's not a Hollywood movie. The procession doesn't move solemnly across the arid landscape as it might if say Gene Tierney or Susan Hayward were being carried. The men holding the sedan have heavy round wooden dowels across their shoulders and are ridiculing the young lady bouncing her up and down singing riotously about how she will soon catch leprosy. None of this causes Gong Li any pleasure and she discretely tucks a pair of scissors into her blouse.After the wedding and a few odd interruptions somebody apparently kills the leprous winery owner and Gong Li is now the owner. She begins with a clean slate. From now on she won't be called boss but by her real name. The men will burn everything the leper touched and will sprinkle sorghum wine all around the plantation because the wine is known to cure all evil. At this point it was beginning to sound like an endorsement of communism but the dozen workers react with such unencumbered joy screaming drunkenly and splashing the wine all over the place that visions of Viridiana came to mind. What are they going to do next somehow desecrate Confucius? Gong Li was apparently raped on her way to her wedding by the narrator's grandfather. After she takes command of the winery she is kidnapped by bandits and apparently abused again before being ransomed. Meanwhile the narrator's grandfather penniless has been wandering the countryside. He's not too smart gets belligerent in a roadside beef house run by the bandits.Cut. Fortyeight minutes into the story the video clip ends with no parts to follow. And so we leave grandpa surrounded by murdering bandits who want to cut out his tongue for nonpayment of a bill at a Chinese restaurant.

	onyx:emotionText "The film opens with the narrator's telling us that a father has just arranged the marriage of his daughter  the egregiously beautiful Gong Li  to a wine merchant who is rich but leprous. We see the bridetobe carried in a bright red sedan by half a dozen men followed by another small band playing Chinese music on tinny instruments. It's not a Hollywood movie. The procession doesn't move solemnly across the arid landscape as it might if say Gene Tierney or Susan Hayward were being carried. The men holding the sedan have heavy round wooden dowels across their shoulders and are ridiculing the young lady bouncing her up and down singing riotously about how she will soon catch leprosy. None of this causes Gong Li any pleasure and she discretely tucks a pair of scissors into her blouse.After the wedding and a few odd interruptions somebody apparently kills the leprous winery owner and Gong Li is now the owner. She begins with a clean slate. From now on she won't be called boss but by her real name. The men will burn everything the leper touched and will sprinkle sorghum wine all around the plantation because the wine is known to cure all evil. At this point it was beginning to sound like an endorsement of communism but the dozen workers react with such unencumbered joy screaming drunkenly and splashing the wine all over the place that visions of Viridiana came to mind. What are they going to do next somehow desecrate Confucius? Gong Li was apparently raped on her way to her wedding by the narrator's grandfather. After she takes command of the winery she is kidnapped by bandits and apparently abused again before being ransomed. Meanwhile the narrator's grandfather penniless has been wandering the countryside. He's not too smart gets belligerent in a roadside beef house run by the bandits.Cut. Fortyeight minutes into the story the video clip ends with no parts to follow. And so we leave grandpa surrounded by murdering bandits who want to cut out his tongue for nonpayment of a bill at a Chinese restaurant. He's reckless lawless and stupid but I hope he keeps his tongue in the future in this colorful story  such as it is.";

'Raise The Red Lantern' is a fascinating film as well as the mythic 'Ju Dou' so I was keen to watch 'Red Sorghum' for the first time.It is a bawdy earthy film yet also mysterious  complex as represented by characters such as the boy's Grandfather  the steward Luohan as well as the bandit Sanpao. The sedan carriers sing a song mocking the bride yet cease when they hear her sobbing. A bandit attacks them but is fatally distracted by the young woman's beauty.It's reflected in the songs which accompany the film from the bawdy  slightly grotesque the bridal litter scene in the beginning to songs sung in praise of a wine spirit an older China of pagan rituals. It is about a peasant community with its own folklore the disappearance of Big Head Li  codes Sanpao  the Grandfather the ransom.'Red Sorghum' is about a land  the people rooted to its soil their rituals  traditions  following the Japanese occupation how these survive as the Grandfather is literally covered in earth  China reborn.The film is narrated voice over by the boy's adult self. It has a mythic kind of tone  mood. Ancestors occupy a special role in Chinese life  are venerated. Continuity is reflected by the boy's Grandmother who asks the villagers to call her by her family nickname 'Little Nine'. Later the story fastforwards nine years to the narrator as a young boy.The story begins with a poor young woman forced into an arranged marriage though this strand is of secondary importance in contrast to 'Raise The Red Lantern' as the story is about how she overcomes her dismal prospects her father barters her for a mule a comment perhaps on the treatment of womenof less value than a mule  assumes a prominent role in the peasant community. The sorghum becomes a symbol of China of its people. The fields can be dangerous  illicit a place where bandits hide but also a source of life  prosperity the red wine that resembles blood  which is sacrificed to the wine spirit. Later the steward  others make an even greater sacrifice for their land.The major turning point of the film is akin to the abrupt change of tone in 'The Deerhunter' structure domestic scenes giving way to the brutal Japanese occupation. The scenes are unsentimental  all the more shocking for this. The sorghum fields are trampled down  crushed like the Chinese people. The slightly comical butchers who worked for the bandit Sanpao are forced into a horrific choice the scenes where the older butcher gently washes Sanpao  his poor young assistant driven mad by what he has been forced to do linger in your mind. Images reinforce points here the Japanese are the real butchers.The film doesn't just depict the Chinese as passive but proud  defiant. 'Little Nine' urges the villagers to avenge the Japanese's victims leading to the violent explosive denouement.It is a beautifully filmed piece of work the red hue which imbues the cinematography to the indigo blue of the night skies with the moon high above. The final image of the sorghum swaying again in the red sunlight is a symbol of China itself  of its people whatever history may throw at them be it a decadent master to amoral occupiers  maybe even a one party state.".

The story is simple with little dialogue helped along by a near continuous voiceover of a storyteller. Normally this would be an intrusive device but somehow it works for such a visual film which aspires to an almost epic scale. I can't help thinking Zhang may have been influenced by Terrence Malick films like Badlands and Days of Heaven. But it is certainly an original and striking debut if not quite as good as his later masterpieces Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern. Of course what all three of those films share is a near obsession with primary colours but for visual effect and symbolism.Gong Li of course is charismatic and luminous it can never have been a doubt from this film onward that she would be a star. But the real star here is the lush erotic photography. It is a bit of a pity that the final third of the film loses its focus somewhat and becomes a more conventional melodrama.

Apparently this movie was based on a famous prize winning novel. I have no idea if that novel has a point but this movie does not. The movie opens to a bride being carried in a sedan chair to the site of her arranged marriage. The groom must have been born under a bad sign for apparently not only has he a big head but also leprosy. To cap it off he is murdered before we even get to see him so that at least was a saving on casting. For reasons that are not clear the girl has with her a pair of scissors. Maybe she was going to adjust her hem on the way but who knows. The sedan chair carriers burst lustily into voice with a song reminiscent of Bold Sir Robin in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It was actually pretty funny and I thought maybe the movie would reveal itself to be a laugh out loud comedy. But regrettably not any humour is simply because each scene is more ridiculous and illogical than the last. This movie could have been a love story. But it wasn't. It could have been a character story. But it wasn't  the characters are all cartoons of people I could not care less about. It could have been a drama. But it wasn't the only drama is contrived. It could have been a history lesson. But it wasn't we get a one line reference to communism and a random and out of context cameo appearance by the Japanese Imperial Army. 1940's China is one of the richest most complex heart breaking stories in the History of the World but do we see any of it? No dice. I could go on and dissect every scene for its stupidity and irrelevance but I would exceed the 1000 word limit and test the reader's patience. According to other viewers Gong Li is the next best thing to Venus on Earth. Perhaps she is in other movies but not in this one. She is portrayed as one of 500 million dirt poor peasants eking out a subsistence living out in the backblocks of China. To the credit of the film makers she is portrayed this way not unattractive but certainly not attractive either physically or as a person. Other reviewers praise the cinematography possibly because it is the only redeeming feature of this movie. Sure it has lots of sorghum leaves blowing in the wind silhouettes of a totally out of place arch against the moon in all its phases and lots of red tinting. But I'm sorry pretty as it is attempting to make a film arty by using all the usual suspects of Arthouse Film 101 is a poor substitute for a real movie. If I can compare this movie to a meal it is heavy on garnish but has no meat and potatoes. It leaves you unsatisfied.".

The groom must have been born under a bad sign for apparently not only has he a big head but also leprosy. To cap it off he is murdered before we even get to see him so that at least was a saving on casting. For reasons that are not clear the girl has with her a pair of scissors. Maybe she was going to adjust her hem on the way but who knows. The sedan chair carriers burst lustily into voice with a song reminiscent of Bold Sir Robin in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It was actually pretty funny and I thought maybe the movie would reveal itself to be a laugh out loud comedy. But regrettably not any humour is simply because each scene is more ridiculous and illogical than the last. This movie could have been a love story. But it wasn't. It could have been a character story. But it wasn't  the characters are all cartoons of people I could not care less about. It could have been a drama. But it wasn't the only drama is contrived. It could have been a history lesson. But it wasn't we get a one line reference to communism and a random and out of context cameo appearance by the Japanese Imperial Army. 1940's China is one of the richest most complex heart breaking stories in the History of the World but do we see any of it? No dice. I could go on and dissect every scene for its stupidity and irrelevance but I would exceed the 1000 word limit and test the reader's patience. According to other viewers Gong Li is the next best thing to Venus on Earth. Perhaps she is in other movies but not in this one. She is portrayed as one of 500 million dirt poor peasants eking out a subsistence living out in the backblocks of China. To the credit of the film makers she is portrayed this way not unattractive but certainly not attractive either physically or as a person. Other reviewers praise the cinematography possibly because it is the only redeeming feature of this movie. Sure it has lots of sorghum leaves blowing in the wind silhouettes of a totally out of place arch against the moon in all its phases and lots of red tinting. But I'm sorry pretty as it is attempting to make a film arty by using all the usual suspects of Arthouse Film 101 is a poor substitute for a real movie. If I can compare this movie to a meal it is heavy on garnish but has no meat and potatoes. It leaves you unsatisfied.";

Their aim is to create a more human society but by employing inhuman means they not only spread terror and bloodshed they also lose their own humanity.

I for one do agree with this approach and if you are prepared for it you probably can live with it too. In any case despite all the chases shootouts and explosions it hasn't become a mere actionfilm. What's more problematic is that the film follows the book by Stefan Aust VERY closely. Therefore the dramaturgy is more similar to real life than to a classical feature film e.g. there are many changes in pace several climaxes are distributed over the course of the film and a proper arc of suspense is somewhat missing. Fortunately real life offered a culmination of events with the Schleyer kidnapping in the German Autumn 1977 so that the film ends in a reasonably satisfying way. Nevertheless the end credits come a little abruptly.The second problem is that the film tries to show virtually ALL events from the book only some minor incidents like the Mahler detention Peter Urbach the burglaries in registration offices in order to steal blank passports or the visit of JeanPaul Sartre in Stammheim are missing so that it needs to squeeze 10 years of history into 140 minutes. The result is a film with breakneck speed at some points. The better scenes e.g. the training camp in Jordan or the lawsuit in Stammheim are obviously those where the film catches breath calms down and takes its time for the actors to shine.The quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara who is nothing more than wideeyed again and who thankfully doesn't even have dialogue. Especially Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek are sensational. It is THEIR film and the conflicts in Stammheim which led to Meinhof's suicide are acted Oscarworthy. But Michael Gwisdek Ensslin's father Jan Josef Liefers Peter Homann Sebastian Blomberg Rudi Dutschke Nadja Uhl Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Hannah Herzsprung Susanne Albrecht are also very good.The production values are excellent too. A lot of locations a great deal of main and supporting roles hundreds of extras good special effects mainly explosions and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70's atmosphere you can see that the film cost a lot of money. Every cent is on the screen.I didn't like the choice of music that much. Deep Purple's Child in Time is always great to hear but the rest Janis Joplin The Who Bob Dylan is just too mainstreamy and unimaginative for my taste but probably also very expensive.

In the US I expect the criticism that there are too many naked people too many swear words and even more cigarettes every one in BMK smokes everywhere and at all times in order to distract from the politics of the film  Der Baader Meinhof Komplex isn't the masterpiece on the history of the first generation of the RAF that I had hoped for in my comments on Todesspiel but altogether it is a very suspenseful fascinating densely narrated and well acted film.

In this case the myth of the RAF. To everyone who lived through the seventies in Germany it is clear that the influence of the RAF on Germany can hardly be exaggerated. I was a kid but my impression at the time was that both sides were wrong. There was a constant fear of terror coming from the terrorists but also from the state. People did not get jobs if it was suspected they were left. So to make a blockbuster film even if it does not really explain the motives of the main characters involved at least gives us some facts. Not everyone is prepared to watch documentaries or read the book by Aust but everyone should have some thoughts or maybe discussions on the subject. Okay but does it succeed as a film? Not entirely. The actors as everyone agrees were excellent the cinematography as well. You do think you are in the seventies. That in itself is amazing. The action scenes are done splendidly especially at the beginning the riots during the visit of the Persian Shah which culminated in the shooting of a student which in turn was at least to some extent the origin of the rise of terror. Of course the film is episodic and there are too many characters in it most of them are not introduced in any way and ten years of complex history cannot be told in an altogether satisfying way. But the film succeeds in giving us a sense of what was going on. The producer Bernd Eichinger has been accused of vanity. Which is a funny thing. Of course he is vain. He has the duty to be vain as long as he also feels a responsibility to make movies that try to tell something. And the challenge he feels is to say it to as many people as possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the movie at a teacher's screening in Wuppertal on a Sunday morning. I was quite impressed with the accurate and detailed portrayal of the RAF and the events of the so called 'German fall' Deutscher Herbst. I myself knew of many of the events beforehand and thanks to documentaries such as Veiel's Black Box BRD and Breloer's Todesspiel I was able to compare. For the two and some hours that the movie lasted I was on the edge of my seat. None of the scenes were boring everything was well paced at times maybe a little too fast paced and I felt like I was being taken back to the important past of my native country. However at the end I felt a little empty. The documentaries I just mentioned focused on only one story but these documentaries were better because they gave us an indepth analysis of the opposing forces the bourgeoisie the elite and the socialist rebels. The portrayal of Meinhof and Baader seems accurate too but often I wondered if Baader really was the smalltime crook he's made out to be in the movie. Except for Meinhof and Ensslin nobody seems to have some really deep thoughts about what was is wrong with our society. Mohnhaupt played by Nadja Uhl isn't explained at all she's just there all of a sudden and we just go along thinking that she is in it for the same reasons as everybody else Which are???.That way the movie seemed a little biased as if trying to tell us that the RAF was mainly criminal and not so much political. Although I believe that a lot of their motives were right even though they didn't justify any of the actions. Bruno Ganz as Herold is allowed to play his character in a way that everyone thinks of the German government at the time as a dignified and moderate administration although I don't believe that to be true after all Herold said that he can only cure the symptoms of the RAF disease but not the disease itself yet he didn't do anything to make the German people understand that the RAF is not altogether wrong when it accuses the German people of laziness cowardice and complacency. Now leaving the movie I figured that there was nothing much left to talk about. The teacher material that we received was pretty useless because it doesn't offer any interesting topics for discussion. I for one think it would be interesting to discuss the present situation bureaucracy war in Iraq terrorism with the situation of Germany in the 70's. We are still dealing with many of the problems that caused the insurgency and civil disobedience back then yet today we don't do anything at all. We are dissatisfied with the Bush administration we oppose the war in Iraq and Afghanistan we suffer from a financial crisis mainly caused by the deregulated free market economy capitalism and we watch the divide between the rich and the poor getting bigger and bigger.However the youth of today doesn't protest. Why not? Maybe because we taught them well that in the end it's everyone for themselves and that it's best to be obedient docile and commonorgarden if you want at least a little security in your life. One of the stronger scenes was the one where Ensslin accuses Meinhof of jerking off on her socialist theories instead of actually doing something. That's where you can see how Meinhof was influenced by the RAF. Finally she met some people who were willing to take action instead of just talking and philosophizing about a better world. This scene lends itself well to the followup scene in which Meinhof helps Baader to escape from prison. The jump from the window sill is a the same time a jump towards extremism. Well all in all I think it's a good film to get people interested in Germany's past but it can only be the beginning of a more subtle analysis of what the RAF stood for and what it was trying to do.".

Bruno Ganz as Herold is allowed to play his character in a way that everyone thinks of the German government at the time as a dignified and moderate administration although I don't believe that to be true after all Herold said that he can only cure the symptoms of the RAF disease but not the disease itself yet he didn't do anything to make the German people understand that the RAF is not altogether wrong when it accuses the German people of laziness cowardice and complacency. Now leaving the movie I figured that there was nothing much left to talk about. The teacher material that we received was pretty useless because it doesn't offer any interesting topics for discussion. I for one think it would be interesting to discuss the present situation bureaucracy war in Iraq terrorism with the situation of Germany in the 70's. We are still dealing with many of the problems that caused the insurgency and civil disobedience back then yet today we don't do anything at all. We are dissatisfied with the Bush administration we oppose the war in Iraq and Afghanistan we suffer from a financial crisis mainly caused by the deregulated free market economy capitalism and we watch the divide between the rich and the poor getting bigger and bigger.However the youth of today doesn't protest. Why not? Maybe because we taught them well that in the end it's everyone for themselves and that it's best to be obedient docile and commonorgarden if you want at least a little security in your life. One of the stronger scenes was the one where Ensslin accuses Meinhof of jerking off on her socialist theories instead of actually doing something. That's where you can see how Meinhof was influenced by the RAF. Finally she met some people who were willing to take action instead of just talking and philosophizing about a better world. This scene lends itself well to the followup scene in which Meinhof helps Baader to escape from prison. The jump from the window sill is a the same time a jump towards extremism. Well all in all I think it's a good film to get people interested in Germany's past but it can only be the beginning of a more subtle analysis of what the RAF stood for and what it was trying to do.";

	schema:headline " Entertaining but Somewhat Empty";
	schema:reviewBody "This film captures much of the historical tensions that existed in 60s70s Germany and world at large by focusing on one of its most visible phenomena the socalled BaaderMeinhof Gang which was also called even beyond the reign of Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof the Rote Armee Fraktion or RAF. The struggle between leftwing terrorists and the established political and state apparatus mediated through the perception of the masses via mutual propaganda makes for an interesting story and an important saga in Europe's confrontation with the limits of liberal democracy and of the populace's flirtation with bloody acts of terror.This film tells the story in its crude general details in the course of about 2 hours. It focuses largely on three figures Andreas Baader portrayed as a rash control freak Ulrike Meinhof shown first as a timid reported and later a ruthless organizer of violence and Gudrun Ensslin the lover of Baader and a determined fanatic. Many minor characters pop in and out and at least 4 or 5 countries are visited in the course of the group's exile and international reach. Many shots are fired many bombs exploded many victims guilty and innocent assassinated and many plans hatched and botched.Overall the film does a pretty good job at carrying the story forward at a rapid pace. At no point did I lose touch of the essentials of what's going on. I found the movie to be eminently easy to follow and a pleasure to watch. The best part of the movie is the first half or maybe first twothirds during which time the focus in on the sympathetic figureheads Baader Meinhof Ensslin. By the time they are in prison the story is driven as it was in real life by a new generation of fighters who are comparably less interesting and whose motivations remain a mystery. Not only that but I thought that the ending of the movie was highly unsatisfactory. The last half an hour of the film is a real mess. It's not catastrophic but it's still a huge stepdown from the wellpaced storytelling of the rest of the movie.Now the movie can easily be faulted for being a superficial exercise in crowd pleasing. It focuses only on the barest of motivational factors. It doesn't care for depth or subtlety. People are portrayed as onedimensional and events flash by so fast that we don't have time to reflect on what we see. Action is favored over thought but maybe this aptly represents RAF's philosophy? there are chase scenes gun fights bombings sieges and a few orgies. Overall the movie is a loud exercise in simplistic historical narrative. For example we get the obligatory news reels of Nixon MLK the War in Vietnam and the student riots of '68... There's nothing new to be seen or heard here. Not even the actions of the BaaderMeinhof Gruppe itself are explicated beyond what everybody who has read anything about the group already knows.Still there are many things that speak on behalf of the movie. For one all the actors do a very fine job indeed. From Bruno Ganz as the head of the police hunt to all the youthful and anarchic terrorists the cast carries the film from beginning to end. Martina Gedeck as Ulrike Meinhof does an excellent job and her character has also been given the most depth and complexity of all the RAF members. There are a few caricatures but mostly the failures of character development in the movie have to do with the lack of time given to each character on screen. As others have pointed out the sheer massiveness of the scale of events and the extensiveness of the timeline means that the movie cannot delve into any particular aspect of the story at any length. The actors do a fine job however and all the sets look authentic the mass rallies organized by Rudi Dutschke and the violent demonstrations between the students and the cops all very early in the film are very effective in depicting the mood and reality of the era. The beating of the students is a harrowing image that leaves nothing for imagination.Speaking of the conflict between authority and rebellion I think that the true strength of this film is precisely in its nonideological and nonpreachy tone. It offers a certain amount of reciprocal faulting between the pro and antiBaaderMeinhofians and it certainly condemns the anticivilian actions of the group but it gives Bruno Ganz a few definite lines that summarize the essence of the conflict  something to the effect that even while condemning you have to understand the real causes of terrorism. This sentiment while hardly new or deep is an important one in a movie that otherwise could have been turned either into a Bonnie and Clyde romance or an exercise in retrospective character assassination. And make no mistake all these people are portrayed in less than flattering light. Still some amount of humanity is allowed to shine through and this is what makes the movie SLIGHTLY more than just another empty gesture in the perpetuation of a historical mythos.It is an entertaining and very well made movie which doesn't offer much depth but in its simplicity and straightforwardness offers material in its pure density and lets the audience make up its own mind... Too bad that it ends so suddenly and unsatisfactorily as it does. That's a shame because the movie could have been great. Now it's only entertaining.".

The film starts with showing people peacefully demonstrating against the Shah of Iran and his wife who were visiting Western Germany in the late 60s on signal supporters of the Shah and the police rush and senselessly beat demonstrators into pulp. The imagery is one that will not soon leave my mind being extremely reminiscent of what happened in the G8 protests at Genoa and Gothenburg about 30 years later. Back to the film the leftist movement is at this time very much against the police state that Western Germany has become. As the hippie 60s obviously didn't help much with turning things around the early 70s  brought on by with the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy the US carrying on their war in Vietnam with Nixon coming into power and the West German government was being accused for merely being a puppet in the hands of imperialist America some people wanted to turn things around without using flowers and kind words. These people were seriously convinced that the word was revolution and used kidnapping bombs and bullets for change. This film is the story of the core of the BaaderMeinhof group and it's close to the best political cinema I've ever seen the direction the acting the script the editing and the music...it's as if the makeup is washed away from how political films usually are leaving the viewer to decide what's right and wrong. It's interesting to see how the BaaderMeinhof group works as the members are increasingly isolated and brainwash each other by simply interacting with their hardcore ideals as the base. Brilliant and highly recommendable of course no matter what your personal political ideas are.".

In my eyes the optimal way to direct this movie would have to treat it like a partly documentary with many original television scenes connected with the presentation of the characters. What I was interested in was whether this movie is able to place the viewer inside the plot whether one could feel the atmosphere of this extreme period of German history and whether the presented scenes are consistent with the documents one had seen in television reports before. The movie has definitely come up to my expectations. The characters are just brilliant. It is some of the best German work of acting I have ever seen every single scenes is so consistent with the picture one has in mind. Almost nothing stays from the line of the real development. The only thing I criticize is the selection of scenes. Maybe the killers are given to much space to call out their misplaced ideology but neither is their behavior justified nor is any sympathy given to them. There doesn't exist any scope for interpretation about who was right and who was wrong. Furthermore a few more words could have been given to the victims of the RAF whose assassinations are presented very precisely.All in all it is a shocking but good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie without any knowledge of the RAF. I wasen't even born when the RAF was active. Still I could follow the story of the movie because even though some figures are vague and get no introduction the most important story lines are explained.The movie follows the beginning top and ending of the first RAFmembers Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof in particular. The rest of the group doesen't get the big introduction Ulrike got but with so many interesting characters the film would get even longer then its 2.5 hours.That is inmediatly the biggest problem with the film it's length. Because of the variety of events and characters Der BaaderMeinhof complex never gets boring but at some point in the movie you start to get irritated by the new events. It would be more wisely if the director had chosen to make a sequel sothat the second RAFmembers get the attention they deserve.So why 8 out of 10 stars? Simple as an actionmovie this is brilliant. The story is good and the movie doesen't tell more than it has to. The biggest achievement however is in my point of view the political statement. It doesen't make it. Der BaaderMeinhof complex tells the story of the RAF but never approves the actions of the group but also doesen't disapprove them. And that is a great achievement.".

Still I could follow the story of the movie because even though some figures are vague and get no introduction the most important story lines are explained.The movie follows the beginning top and ending of the first RAFmembers Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof in particular. The rest of the group doesen't get the big introduction Ulrike got but with so many interesting characters the film would get even longer then its 2.5 hours.That is inmediatly the biggest problem with the film it's length. Because of the variety of events and characters Der BaaderMeinhof complex never gets boring but at some point in the movie you start to get irritated by the new events. It would be more wisely if the director had chosen to make a sequel sothat the second RAFmembers get the attention they deserve.So why 8 out of 10 stars? Simple as an actionmovie this is brilliant. The story is good and the movie doesen't tell more than it has to. The biggest achievement however is in my point of view the political statement. It doesen't make it. Der BaaderMeinhof complex tells the story of the RAF but never approves the actions of the group but also doesen't disapprove them. And that is a great achievement.";

In this case the movie told the story perfectly. Of course not everything happened exactly as it was told but the whole movie was very convincing.

Actors also have been on a very high level.I personally would have liked a bit more information. But yea the movie is already 25 hours long. I understand that they needed to leave out a lot of stuff.

If you know little or nothing about the subject like many younger people this may seem a  cool movie. Just as an action pic you're right.

Also missing are the deeper context of postwar BRD Germany not having come to terms with the Nazi past especially in the situation of many former NSDAP  symp's having high places in society government industry etc. As I remember that was one of the main frustrations in leftist circles  and not only there....

These three plus the police chief played by Bruno Ganz and a young Turk played by Vinzenz Kiefer are the only characters who emerge vividly as personalities. Gudrun's love for Andreas is simply but deftly conveyed through all the wreckage and violence by the way she calls him baby.

Ganz's wily coolheaded police chief seems to have ideas Americans of the last decade are incapable of he says more than once that terrorism won't end till the situations that lead to it are removed. Vietnam the Palestinians and a series of other injustices are presented as context not to mention such Sixties American violence as the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and M.L. King. This is a film rich in political reference  but without much clarification of the group's political motives or their relation to strategy. The original group begins by blowing up a department store and robs three banks in a tenminute period. Robberies bombings and kidnappings are their M.O. and decisions often just seem to flow out of firecracker Andrea Baader's macho screaming fits. When in doubt he usually throws a chair. It's not entirely clear how devilish derringdo morphed into leadership. But what is clear is that the opposition is former Nazis or their sympathizers and the new terrorists committed to preventing fascism from ever returning to Germany are the offspring of parents who were antiNazi all along. The group calls itself RAF the Red Army Faction and Chairman Mao is a guru even if his dicta are only rarely cited.The opening scene of the film is a jawdroppingly complex and violent production number a large street demonstration in which fascist supporters of the Shah of Iran face leftists. The Shah supporters begin a bloody attack on the leftists using the wood poles that held their posters and the police join in bashing leftists one gets shot. Tumult and excitement continue unabated thenceforth in the first half there are few pauses for breath. A notable one comes when Gudrun invites a young rebel just escaped from juvie PeterJrgen Boock Vinzenz Kiefer to strip and join her in the bath and Baader comes in and isn't bothered. PeterJrgen will become a leader of the second or third generation Baader Meinhof who arranges Arab collaboration in the Lufthansa plane hijacking to gain the leaders' release from prison which Baader disavows because it jeopardizes innocent passengers. This is not the first Baader Meinhof contact with Palestinian fighters Baader's earlier ones wind up not being very friendly. We see how it transpires that the German police declare terrorism in Germany to have been safely eliminated only to be proved very wrong when the 1972 Munich Olympics lead to the slaughter of the Israeli team.One question is if you can root out terrorism. Another is whether terrorism accomplishes any positive goal. The film doesn't allow us much time to think about any of this. What it does do and does with obvious accomplishment and at considerable expense is provide vivid images of this violent segment of the period. And it lets viewers judge for themselves neither moralizing nor sympathizing.".

	schema:headline " An extremely good movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Going into see Der Baader Meinhof Komplex I was filled with trepidation. This was a long German film with subtitles by a very serious Director dealing with the potentially tortuous subject of politics the radicalisation of students in the late 1960's and the myriad gangs brigades and groups that came out of that period. Not knowing an awful lot about the German political scene of that time I was worried that I would struggle to understand it all.No worries on that front. It is a tribute to director Uli Edel and writer Bernd Eichinger that the story of the BaaderMeinholf gang was presented cleanly and clearly. I thought that Der Baader Meinhof Komplex was a beautifully constructed visceral movie with note perfect performances from the main leads Moritz Bleibtreu's Andreas Baader  egotistical irresponsible charismatic and let's be honest for a moment a bit of a horse's ass Martina Gedeck's Ulrike Meinhof  a faintly left leaning journalist intelligent thoughtful introspective somewhat seduced by the glamour of the 'movement' and Johanna Wokalek's Gudrun Ensslin  Baader's girlfriend obsessed twinkly eyed dedicated and ruthless. All outstanding.Interestingly the movie does not judge. You see the position of the group and of the authorities that battled them equally. The quality of the movie and of the performances is such that that you do feel a degree of sympathy for the 'terrorists' as their plans fail their members are picked off one by one and their mental state starts to unravel. You feel sympathy despite the fact that they were bombers kidnappers and murderers.I do feel that Der Baader Meinhof Komplex was a tad too long. The second half of the movie dealing with the incarceration of the senior members of the group could possibly have been tighter but I am just being picky. Der Baader Meinhof Komplex was an extremely good movie. I think that it is one of the best of the year.And shame on the two people who left after 5 minutes no doubt distressed by the fact that they had accidentally paid to see a foreign film with  whisper it!  subtitles. The horror! I nearly called out to them that High School Musical 3 was on next door and that maybe they should try that film instead. Very sad. They do not know what they missed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Going into see Der Baader Meinhof Komplex I was filled with trepidation. This was a long German film with subtitles by a very serious Director dealing with the potentially tortuous subject of politics the radicalisation of students in the late 1960's and the myriad gangs brigades and groups that came out of that period. Not knowing an awful lot about the German political scene of that time I was worried that I would struggle to understand it all.No worries on that front. It is a tribute to director Uli Edel and writer Bernd Eichinger that the story of the BaaderMeinholf gang was presented cleanly and clearly. I thought that Der Baader Meinhof Komplex was a beautifully constructed visceral movie with note perfect performances from the main leads Moritz Bleibtreu's Andreas Baader  egotistical irresponsible charismatic and let's be honest for a moment a bit of a horse's ass Martina Gedeck's Ulrike Meinhof  a faintly left leaning journalist intelligent thoughtful introspective somewhat seduced by the glamour of the 'movement' and Johanna Wokalek's Gudrun Ensslin  Baader's girlfriend obsessed twinkly eyed dedicated and ruthless. All outstanding.Interestingly the movie does not judge. You see the position of the group and of the authorities that battled them equally. The quality of the movie and of the performances is such that that you do feel a degree of sympathy for the 'terrorists' as their plans fail their members are picked off one by one and their mental state starts to unravel.

	schema:reviewBody "The Baader Meinhof Complex succeeds in bringing the social upheavals of the late 60searly 70's to life for 21st century viewers in a realistic and urgent way. The Baader Meinhof gang of West Germany was more or less equivalent to the Weather Underground in the USA  primarily students and intellectuals and their hangerson who became frustrated by the failure of the mass protest movements of the late 60's to overthrow the world order. This frustration led them to engage in acts of terrorism meant to provoke the state into increasing repression which in turn was supposed to provoke the population at large to mass revolt. A similar movement existed in 19th century Russia when terrorist bombers impatient with social quiescence took to assassinating prominent officials including Tsar Alexander II. It didn't work and it only killed or injured a lot of innocent people alienated millions more and ultimately reinforced the status quo.This film not only restages the street battles bank robberies and bombings in a manner up to the best Hollywoodaction standards but also reveals the individual psychological complexities of the central gang members as portrayed by some very fine actors. The gang was a combination of downright sociopaths personified by Baader and morally outraged mainstream citizens personified by Meinhof. It was a vast and messy enterprise and director Uli Edel wisely allows the sheer chaos of it to explode across the screen in all of its confusion in order to replicate as much as possible the instability and the passion that characterized these events at the time and to keep the story alive and flowing. In short he crams as many aspects of the story as he can into two and a half hours giving the audience an abundance of notions to explore during and after viewing.".

You have to consider these are the children of WW2 Germany and they got to experience the resurrection of West Germany another economic miracle funded by US tax payers under the Truman Doctrine. So they were living quite well and feeling guilty about everyone in the third world living like dogs. But I have to say it was a bit of an over reaction. But I figure their intensity is just another example of how a younger generation responds to a society crisis and they feared Fascism. But like the late Bobby Fuller sang in a song I fought the law and the law won. The establishment cannot be beat. They have the resources which can easily squish ideology. But this film is a good educational resource. I had heard of the BaaderMeinhoff Gang and the Red Army Faction but knew very little as this film revealed to me. I suggest doing some research about BaaderMeinhoff before seeing this film. It won't spoil it as it may actually make it a little more coherent as the events unfold. This is a keeper for me and I will own the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once every few years Bernd Eichinger feels the need to prove to everybody that he has the biggest dick in the German film industry. In order to do this he refrains from making cheap stupid international movies like Resident Evil and dumb German comedies and makes a big movie that he calls important. After Der Untergang and Das Parfum we now get Der BaaderMeinhof Komplex.One really wonders who this movie was made for. People who don't know anything about the RAF will not understand most of what is going on. People who know some stuff about this will only find the things that they already know and experts on the topic will be horrified about the simplifications and elisions.The movie looks great as it should be expected. It really looks like it is from the era. All technical aspects are wonderful the cinematography the action sound effects. And the actors do an incredible job. Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek stand out in this universally good cast as Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin.Also to be fair it has to be said that the beginning of the movie is really gripping and well done. The viewer gets to understand a lot about the feeling of the time and the intentions of the protagonists are wellexplained.But the whole thing goes downhill after a while. By the time Ulrike Meinhof joins the group and Andreas Baader breaks out of prison we lose focus. Suddenly there are new members in almost every scene and none of them gets introduced properly with the exception of PeterJrgen Boock. Certainly not every character needs a back story but it would have been essential to tell the audience at least how these recruits got to join the group in general.By the time that Meinhof Baader and Ensslin are imprisoned we really don't care about the RAF any more. And this is mainly because we have no idea who these 2nd generation people are. Even people who know about the RAF will wonder who this or that guy in each scene is supposed to be because only few of them are even mentioned by name. The assassinations of von Mirbach Buback and Ponto are just checked off a list to get the story to completion. And the whole Schleyerkidnapping as well as the attack on the Landshut which are supposed to serve as the climax of the movie have terrible timing and leave out so much important information.But also the handling of characters of the 1st generation is done poorly in parts. Raspe is basically absent from the movie until he gets taken in by the police same with Meins whose only purpose in the movie it is to get captured forcefed and then die. Only these three scenes. Nothing more is seen of him! Neither Eichinger nor Edel really cared to explain or teach anything. The whole thing was just planned as a big production to show off 23 of the more wellknown actors working in Germany in one movie. Even the guy who attempts to assassinate Rudi Dutschke gets played by a well known actor Tom Schilling. What this movie would have needed is the kind of epilogue that Eichinger put at the end of der Untergang to show what happened to some characters and also to even explain who these characters were supposed to be.So we only have one more chance to find out. Since the movie is filled with wellknown actors reading the credits might help. No chance here. Except for the main characters no character name is mentioned in the credits only the actors who showed up. To me this is the ultimate proof that Eichinger didn't care about the characters at all all he cared about was the actors he could squish into this movie.There are other things that others will criticize for example the way the victims are turned just into cardboard figures with no purpose other than getting assassinated or the fact that the German government which was very involved especially in the final act is not present at all. I personally do not mind these things too much because I understand that this is not the story the makers wanted to tell.I only criticize the movie for what it is. A nicelooking but unfortunately very hollow and confusing piece of work. Too bad. It was a great chance that was missed here.".

The only drawbacks being banged up for a couple of decades or at the very worst individually picked off by special forces although if you were a male terrorist you had even more of a fighting chance as everyone knew they always shot the women first.At least that's the impression you might take away from The Baader Meinhof Complex during an exchange between a pair of sexy second generation RAF Red Army Faction recruits and a Middle Eastern fixer. We can invade the US Embassy in Kuwait  or there's the possibility we can hijack a Lufthansa plane their agent casually suggests as if he were a matre d' presenting two different restaurant menus to a couple of lovebirds on a dinner date. In the event the RAF picks the plane platter with hostages to go. So although it would be nuts given how the central characters wind up to accuse The Baader Meinhof Complex of glamourising terrorism or playing fast and loose with the facts the film could certainly be mistaken for trading in radical chic dealing as it does with a young hip disproportionately middleclass organisation much given to Bonnie And Clydestyle posturing and gunplay.The filmmakers can also hardly be blamed for the fact that quite a few of Germany's most wanted were ridiculously good looking in real life and they've cast accordingly. If Germany's film directors were in thrall to US counterculture during the 1970s so too were its activists  headline stars of their own imagined movies. That young terrorist strutting down the quaking aisles of the Lufthansa jet in 1977 is modelling a very iconic Che tshirt. While Andreas Baader cofounder of the RAF was no stranger to makeup false eyelashes and tight trousers without underwear the better to show off that 'arsch'. Even a Jordanian training camp is treated like an 1830 holiday with submachine guns.Substitute those guns for guitars and this could almost be the biopic of a rock band from early hits to midperiod mismanagement and fatal fallouts over direction and differences. And naturally everybody chain smokes throughout. Even an emaciated hunger striker valiantly puffs away while dying on his back.Initially it is perhaps more instructive to say what this film is not. It is not some soulsearching blockbuster about good people who do bad things it is no Munich. These wouldbe heroes of the people are pitiless killers spitting scattershot rhetoric as their Heckler  Koch MP5's rain ammunition on those imperialist running dogs and anyone else who gets in the line of fire.Neither is this film any kind of comprehensive field guide to the RAF the sprawling cast often come and go without namechecks introductions or backstories. Momentum not digression is key. Nor after nearly twoandahalfhours of dense history does the film one of the coldest and least sentimental of the German new wave wrap with some tidy poignant resolution it climaxes with an awful spiteful gunshot ringing out in a middle of a forest.Instead The Baader Meinhof Complex based on Stefan Aust's nonfiction study is a brutally honest totally uncompromising and utterly gripping depiction of exactly what happened in the ten years between June 1967  when police shot dead a protester during a state visit to Germany by the Shah of Iran  to October 1977 when abducted industrialist and former Nazi HannsMartin Schleyer was executed in revenge for the suicides of imprisoned RAF leaders Ensslin Baader and JanCarl Raspe.Our escort into the underworld is the leftwing journalist and motheroftwo Ulrike Meinhof Gedeck who goes from reporting the news to making it. Her snap decision to leap from an open window to join Gudrun Ensslin Wokalek and Baader Bleibtreu on the run during a prison break is as significant as Chief Broom's in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Once through that window there is no absolutely no return home. Paranoia madness and suicide follows. Who'd be a terrorist? While the film doesn't flinch from showing precisely what a car bomb does to the human body neither does it shy away from depicting the tedium of drifting from one safe house to the next in the company of angry neurotics.There is not the slightest shred of heroworship or sympathy for these leftwing idealiststurnedneoNazis Baader is portrayed as a reckless idiotic poseur Only a gun makes it fun! he exclaims to a young disciple Ensslin a manipulative tyrant and Meinhof an icy propagandist A man in uniform is a pig and of course it's okay to shoot him. All the cast is superb but Gedeck and Wokalek as the catfighting frump and firebrand are standout.It has its flaws this is a film of two halves and once the architects of the RAF have been incarcerated in Stammheim prison the film's momentum cannot help but be somewhat railroaded. As if to compensate the movement's second generation including the dropdead gorgeous Brigitte Mohnhaupt Uhl ramp up the bloodletting with ever more ferocity until the film finally topples over as if through sheer exhaustion.The soundtrack could also have been chosen with more care what precisely is the significance of Janis Joplin singing Oh Lord won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz over the opening credits aside from the fact it's a German make of car? Meanwhile Bob Dylan's 'Blowin' In The Wind' is an altogether too mimsy lyric to finish this film with after what's preceded it. Surely Dylan's 'My Back Pages' is the most obvious choice  In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teachFearing not I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach.".

As if to compensate the movement's second generation including the dropdead gorgeous Brigitte Mohnhaupt Uhl ramp up the bloodletting with ever more ferocity until the film finally topples over as if through sheer exhaustion.The soundtrack could also have been chosen with more care what precisely is the significance of Janis Joplin singing Oh Lord won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz over the opening credits aside from the fact it's a German make of car? Meanwhile Bob Dylan's 'Blowin' In The Wind' is an altogether too mimsy lyric to finish this film with after what's preceded it. Surely Dylan's 'My Back Pages' is the most obvious choice  In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teachFearing not I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that before this title I have not yet studiedor read any content relating to the RAF in school or otherwise so I can merely comment on the films content itself.The film starts with a protest against the war which is the main element to the rest of the feature. This scene details in an exquisite manner just why these teenagers decided to rebel and protest against the government. They commit bank robberies and bombings for the cause and they are soon seen as terrorists by the government. It is then that it starts to go horrible wrong for the RAF as they are then shot point blank by police and are fighting to remain out of prison.Their plans and thoughts were not intentionally bad there fight against oppression is a compelling one and Uli Edel portrays this magnificently. I had originally been a bit sceptical about this feature but I was gripped throughout. Johanna Wokalek was outstanding as Gudrun Ensslin.I felt the plot was entertaining and well written. The story is portrayed mostly from the terrorists side and is made to make them look like the good guys over the government but that is what I think makes this film. You side with the terrorists and hope that it is there cause that will win.In the end the film portrays how a cause that can be seen as timid has been blown out of proportion and turned into something it was never intended to be. The 2nd and 3rd generation RAF seem to fight for a different cause.There were of course some negative points about this movie. I am going to be typically British and say there was far too much nudity for such a serious portrayal. But it was quite entertaining when the arrogant Baader says Shooting is like fg! at the army camp.The main point of why I would not give this film ten stars is the 2nd and 3rd generation RAF members. Once the prison element has been put into the film it is as if the main point has been lost. Although it is intriguing to see the views of the 2nd generation these characters apart from one are not in it very long so the viewers are not able to relate to the characters.All in all I would say that I cannot wait for this title to be on DVD and will be doing more research into the RAF now. It also makes me quite glad that I did not experience any of this first hand. If you are from the UK then this is one subtitled movie that I would highly recommend watching!".

	schema:headline " A very fast paced political action drama";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie starts out with a real bang. Student protesters shout out anti war slogans behind barricades. They hold signs and shout in German their angry protest of the American involvement of Vietnam. Armed German policemen watch wearily as they ride up and down the street while on horseback. Suddenly a group of short hair men dressed in suits approach the protesters from the other side of the barricades. They take out large wooden sticks and use them as lethal clubs. They aim at the protester's heads and blood gushes out of men's as well as women's heads. The police just look on until some of the protesters get the upper hand on some of the thugs. With guns drawn they definitely take the thugs' side. The sequence dramatically with a student shot in the head dying in his girlfriend's arms. Shortly after that leftist leader Rudi Dutschke played by Sebastian Blomberg gets shot point blank in the head. He actually gets up while his would be assassin gets hunted down and killed by the police. Tightly directed by Uli Edel. cowritten by Uli Edel and Bernd Eichinger produced by Bernd Eichinger based on a book by Stefan Aust this narrative briskly follows the main leaders of the Baader Meinhof Complex. On the whole they are desperate young adults very much involved with hell raising along with making political statements. Interspersed with news footage it's easy to see how very controversial they were at the time. However American media never gave the Red Army Front RAF the attention they received in their own country. After all a German group making antiSemantic statements could not receive much sympathy and must have been very painful within its own borders. Nevertheless the offspring of the Nazi generation accuse West Germany as being a puppet to American imperialism that had forced a Jewish state onto Arab lands. They bomb buildings one whose warning was dismissed and no evacuation issued caused considerable loss of innocent lives. They rob a series of banks to support their cause and leave political slogans along with their ski masks and even make a trip to Egypt. The main leaders are Andreas Baader played by Moritz Bliebtrau Gudrun Ensslin played by Johanna Wokalek and Ulrike Meinhoff played by Martina Gedeck. Images of Baader and Ensslin grace the movie's poster. Baader is very authoritative quick to anger and quite reckless and more often than not he gets his way. The very attractive Ensslin is very much the queen bee of the group and quite dangerous in her own right. Meinhoff is the writer of the group. In fact she leaves her journalist position to join the group. But that decision does have its consequences as her husband leaves her with the children. Original music by Peter Hindethur and Florian Tessloff compliments the tense action very well and there's even the angst anthem the Who's My Generation played as members of the gang shoot off their guns while joyriding. The second half takes a different tone when the leaders are captured masterminded by perhaps the best known German actor Bruno Ganz who plays Horst Herald. The lawman is not entirely unsympathetic to the RAF but knows they are too dangerous to be at large. Recreations of the court scenes do provide some much needed levity to the drama. The courtroom is crowded and the onlookers applaud the disrespect the accused give to the judges. Meanwhile a second generation of RAF emerges and more mischief happens as the proceedings go on The conclusion is not a happy one but after all it is history being dramatized. I did find The Baader Meinhoff Complex quite entertaining the main characters quite fleshed out and though it is 160 minutes it flows quite quickly. I do recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode. It is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer John Mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called Elephant Walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late Tom Wiley right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man. That his son played by Peter Finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon today's Sri Lanka is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.For those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of Miss Taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drivein not on the home TV so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camerawork and scope.".

	schema:reviewBody "Agreeable romanceadventure film in which a British gorgeous woman marries a wealthy colonial owner and go to live in his huge plantation but it happens to be on the path where elephants roam. This romantic adventure movie in soap opera style was lavishly produced by Paramount Pictures with allstarcast  glimmer cinematography and luxurious scenarios . As the young bride named Ruth Wiley Elizabeth Taylor of a rich planter Peter Finch finds herself the only white woman at Elephant Walk tea plantation British Ceylon . In the plantation Dick Carver Dana Andrews works as a righthand man and she finds certain protection  thanks to Dick the tough foreman  then a mutual attraction emerges each other  soon makes him indispensable . The jungle  of course is endangered by some kind of wild life and some dangerous elephants  for this reason she finds herself in a strange atmosphere . Furthermore  a cholera epidemic outbursts  followed by elephants destroying the plantation . There takes places a searing story of sudden love and sudden death in the hot green hell of the Ceylon jungle  being threatened by the hovering  ominous appearance of the hostile elephants . One man and several elephants claimed the land  two men claimed the woman who lived there . This exciting film has emotion  romance  intrigue  exotic landscapes  colonial settings and results to be pretty entertaining . Ceylon's balmy jungles provide the backstage for a triangular torrid love between Elizabeth Taylor  Peter Finch and Dana Andrews  in this postprime William Dieterle effort . Intelligent and engaging script which uses intriguing situations to give us an acceptable movie in a high sense and intimate sensitivity and that kept me entertained for the almost 100 minutes of duration . Elephant walk is an enjoyable adventure movie  a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow  exotic scenarios with rage excessively colorful  big bull elephants  an amazing mansion  a love story  drama and many other things . The movie is very persuasively made  usually rise to a crescendo of emotion and had at the time a remarkable success. Entertaining romanceadventure is visually striking with a spectacular final . I liked everyone in the excellent cast and the male and female actors  especially Elizabeth Taylor  were all very attractive . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching and attractive Elizabeth Taylor who gives one of her best screen acting . Elizabeth wears lush gowns splendidly designed by expert costume designer Edith Head . Although Vivien Leigh was originally cast but her mental illness begun affecting things during filming and so she was replaced by Elizabeth Taylor  many long shots and shots from behind are still of Leigh . Furthermore a thrilling as well as breathtaking climax at the mansion in which the protagonist are besieged by a herd of elephants . This picture bears remarkable resemblance to Escape to Burma 1954 by Allan Dwan that contains a similar jungle scenario Sri Lanka  elephants and known actors as Barbara Stanwyck  Robert Ryan and David Farrar . It also has several points in common with The naked jungle by Byron Haskin regarding a woman  Eleanor Parker  who marries a planter  Charlton Heston  living in jungle until a final tragedy takes place . Elephant walk packs a colorful cinematography print in Technicolor 1.371 and composed for Widescreen presentation by Loyal Griggs considered to be one of the best cameramen of the 40s and 50s . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the classic Franz Waxman . This adventure yarn from the golden age of Hollywood was well directed by William Dieterle as a classic example of dramaromanceadventure of the fifties . Dieterle is a German director who was in Hollywood by 1930s and directing dramas Scarlet down Fog over Frisco Fashions  costumer Hunchback of Notre DameKismetOmar Khayyan and biopics Life of Emile Zola Dr Ehrlich Juarez Madame Curie Reuter that were a revelation at the boxoffice. Rating  6510  better than average . Well worth watching . The picture will appeal to Elizabeth Taylor fans .".

You have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.Meanwhile Elephant Walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to The Letter the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantation.Maltin gives Elephant Walk just two stars and IMDb readers aren't much kinder but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father. Dana Andrews  a favorite in Laura and The Best Year of Our Lives  is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history.".

Something like the TV show DALLAS maybe if a lot more imaginative. But the more interesting aspect is that it's a parable about SPOILER SPOILER! nature taking back her own. Y'see the lovably decadent and endearingly hateful characters in this film are paying an ancestral debt for the originally sinful act whereby the previous generation's patriarch simply HAD in his hubris to build his equivalent of Tara right in the path of what had been the local elephants' rightofway from time immemorial. Typical human behavior I fear but the fact is that elephants are just as territorial as we are and if you cut off their rightofway they will still retain the long memory for which they are so noted. Even if all they can do about it is gather in front of the land y'all stole flap their ears and trunks at you and trumpet their displeasure.And while all this is going on the Liz Taylor and Peter Finch characters are having the fancy marital problems which take up all the attention of IMDb reviewers. The reviewers' attention span is like that of the characters in the film an attitude which is something like who cares they're nothing but a bunch of silly elephants. Indeed one character says with a smirk the natives here believe elephants are people. They call them the Elephant People. Ridiculous idea right? Well not exactly. One otherwise fine day an epidemic ravages the Elephant Walk plantation and as a result there are no native servants beaters in the local jargon there to drive them away for the white masters' benefit. In fact to the Elephant People's delight and mine I must admit NOBODY is there to answer their challenge so they walk on in and reclaim their heritage. No doubt they are at this time singing the elephantese translation of Woody Guthrie's As I was walking that ribbon of highwayI saw a SIGN that said no tresPASSINGBut on the other side it just said nothing.That side was made for you and me. And the invaded mansion catches fire from a downed chandelier burning to the ground. Because no humans are there to protect it. No I'm wrong. There's ONE human there one old native who's been serving Master too long to know what's good for him and too old to be running around helping contain the epidemic. He does wave his arms and shout Go back Elephant People! Go back! and the predictable pachydermal response is is Yeah? Or what? They trample him of course. And praise the Lord they destroy the mansion. This has been long winded but I really wanted everybody to pay attention to what this film is really about. The moral of this story is There comes a moment in the awful providence of God when nature turns the tables on her rapists. A moment when you will realize as the poet said that You'll never get rid of the boomdeboom nomatter whatcha do. And when that happens all the acting talent and the costumes and the lovable decadence in the world won't save the Taylor and Finch characters. Their sizzling love and hate affairs won't amount to a hill of beans.If Tarzan existed this would be his favorite movie.O give me a homewhere the elephants roam... But seriously guys I think this is a pretty good cautionary tale.".

Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. William Dieterle who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.".

Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. William Dieterle who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.";

	schema:headline " Elephant Walk is an ode to Resistance.";
	schema:reviewBody "In Elephant Walkdirected by William Dieterle and set in Ceylon now Sri Lanka the elephants symbolically represent resistance to British colonialism. Viewed from an anticolonial perspective the film becomes a highly charged beautifully made pamphlet against colonial grabbing as practiced by the masters of Elephant Walk British Empire profiteers. To build his fortune Tom Wiley the dead arrogant greedy tyrant colonizer stopped at nothing including cutting off the water supply of the Elephants and collaterally of the native Ceylonese. However usurping wealth tea and using people as virtual slaves resulted as usual in kneejerk resistance to an unjust economic order to environmental spoilage to the rule over the many by a few to a system formatted to make sure the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This resistance is what the elephants represented. Instead of the ignored elephant in the room this picture is about resistance symbolized by elephants that won't be ignored. Elizabeth Taylor portrayed a person born and raised in England who remained oblivious to the true nature of the colonial system. She was like 99 of Brits who like most of us were and remain victims of the class who has declared it has a right to possess the world and its people. Today we call this class Wall Street The Banks The 1. Fortunately in 1972 Ceylon became Sri Lanka and the natives recuperated their land. They may not be any richer today but anything beats being a virtual slave at the hands of British colonial masters one of the greediest most arrogant and dehumanizing groups ever to infest the planet. The movie masterfully depicts the true nature of the moneyhungry economic parasites who were interested in only one thing  making   and willing to do anything to get it. John Wiley the character so excellently portrayed by Peter Finch is more true to life than say The Great Gatsby a romanticized version of a 1 percenter. The more I watch this film the better it gets. Elisabeth Taylor is stunning. Peter Finch is captivating. Dana Andrews is as always excellent. The supporting cast is superb. The direction is masterful. The natural decor is hauntingly luxuriant and the interior sets are memorable. So is there anything wrong with this picture? Only that it remains underrated.".

She spends most of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958 begging an apathetic Paul Newman to sleep with her.  In Suddenly Last Summer 1959 her cousin Sebastian is more interested in the local peasant boys than in her.  In Raintree County 1957 she has to fake a pregnancy in order to get Montgomery Clift to marry her.  In Place In the Sun she loses Clift to the electric chair.  In Night Watch 1974 she discovers that hubby Laurence Harvey is having an affair with another woman.  In Elephant Walk she spends her wedding night alone because her husband played by Peter Finch would rather carouse with his drinking buddies.  I guess being one of the most beautiful women in the world doesn't mean you will be lucky in love  certainly not in Elizabeth Taylor's case either on or off the screen. The film itself is an enjoyably overthetop melodrama with a splendid production a fine score by Franz Waxman and that famous elephant stampede at the end to top it off.  Of course one can't help wondering why Finch's father would insist on building a house right on a spot the elephants have claimed as their own.  Why not say a mile away?".

	schema:reviewBody "ELEPHANT WALK was a thoroughly dull film and I really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film. Considering the money and cast you'd sure expect the film to be a lot better though I also question the odd casting of Dana Andrews as a man who is in love with Elizabeth Taylor. It's not just the age difference but I just can't see the pair as a couple. Perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting Miss Taylor for Vivian Leigh at the last minute due to Miss Leigh's deteriorating mental conditionthough I also have a hard time visualizing Andrews and Leigh as well. In addition for an English woman Miss Taylor doesn't even seem to try using an accent.The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England. Their plan is to return to Finch's tea plantation in Ceylon Sri Lanka and at first it seems like a good life. However there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her. On top of that once back home Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable. Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her. However Taylor isn't yet ready to abandon her marriage. But through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave...when out of the blue Cholera strikes the plantation. So it's up to Andrews Finch and Taylor to work together to save the daythough by this point I really didn't care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you can't understand why Taylor didn't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell.The film isn't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount the film is a sluggish mess. I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasn't integrated well. In one scene for instance Taylor Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green. Then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown! It's clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha. My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake. Despite its budget it's just not a very good or inspired film.By the way could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film? In some scenes particularly at the beginning she's wearing billowy clothes has a doublechin and looks puffy. This isn't a criticismafter all women do get pregnant! But if you look carefully you'll see what I mean.Also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANTa great Taylor film indeed! It's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much.".

And when hunky Dana Andrews enters the picture she just might find a distraction from her new surroundings. . .With Liz and Dana there's lots of eye candy in this movie. A few strongwilled speeches and some romantic scenes don't make it the most memorable film to come out of the 50s but it's worth it if you like goodlooking people up on the screen.".

And when hunky Dana Andrews enters the picture she just might find a distraction from her new surroundings. . .With Liz and Dana there's lots of eye candy in this movie. A few strongwilled speeches and some romantic scenes don't make it the most memorable film to come out of the 50s but it's worth it if you like goodlooking people up on the screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "ELEPHANT WALK's plot is essentially that of Daphne Du Maurier's REBECCA. Elizabeth Taylor plays a new bride plucked from London to be the mistress of an enormous tea plantation in Ceylon modern day Sri Lanka. Her husband Peter Finch blends into his old role as plantation Governor in thrall to his dead father and the influence of his colonialist friends. The nights are spent drinking to excess as Taylor simmers in the bedroom wearing a series of alluring nightgowns to be appreciated by nobody... Nobody that is apart from Dana Andrews's jaded plantation manager destined to be the third point in the film's love triangle. Taylor is a fish out of water in her massive new home the palatial Elephant Walk so called because it was built by Finch's father right in the path of the route the elephants took to reach water. The symbolism here should be clear enough. The elephants want their path back and are stopped in their attempts by Finch's army of retainers until a bout of cholera cuts down their numbers... Finch has a Mrs Danvers style manservant who worships the old Governor as though he's still alive not remembered a little too closely via his ostentatious mausoleum in the garden and his old study which is locked at all times. Finch is fine as the boozy weak willed lead trapped by memories of his father and drinking to forget. Andrews plays the traditionally stolid American male presence but it's Taylor's vehicle and despite being a little miscast she's a bit too forthright to play a demure bride stands out through sheer force of personality. The role was initially Vivien Leigh's and some footage of her can still be seen in several long shots sadly ill health removed her from the project. The film is essentially a potboiler elevated by the Sri Lankan photography the set built for the Elephant Walk 'bungalow' and a good cast also the fact that any movie directed by William Dieterle can never really be boring. But it would have been better with Vivien Leigh the star whose mental health problems removed her from a project that was made to fit around her. In her hands it would have been quite a different and potentially more interesting and definitely more complicated film whereas with Ms Taylor its female presence is played straight and the script's sympathies  which really should lie with Finch's tragic daddy's boy  get lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "This tepid melodrama concerns John Wiley a rich tea planter Peter Finch who brings his new wife Ruth Elizabeth Taylor home to Elephant Walk his plantation in Ceylon. The palatial home was built purposely to block the wild elephants' path to water and they have never forgiven the owners. Ruth finds the adjustment difficult as her loving debonair groom turns into a drunken boorish lout who cares more about entertaining his fellow planters than being with her. Enter the sensitive overseer Dana Andrews who takes a liking to Ruth and there's trouble in paradise.This 1954 movie has exactly the same plot as The Naked Jungle which was also released that year only with elephants instead of army ants. It was only partially filmed on location and those scenes are easy to spot as the colors are intensely bright and vivid with natural light. It's too bad they cut corners and filmed half of the movie indoors in front of stock footage. Going back and forth between real outdoors and fake outdoors is distracting to say the least. Taylor is lovely to look at but she and her costars overact to the point of being silly she's too loud dressing in ridiculous gowns for the jungle and generally acts like a onedimensional shrew. There is no romantic chemistry at all between her and Finch or Andrews both men are wooden caricatures and unconvincing ones at that.The best part of the movie is the finale which has hundreds of elephants storming the mansion taking back their walk. Mercifully this signals the end of a long and overwrought movie which gives the viewer more opportunities to laugh than swoon.".
