Richard BachOne of the most commonly reported aspects of neardeath experiences is the life review the seeing and reexperiencing of major and trivial events of one's life sometimes from the perspective of the other people involved. Most say that the single most important lesson they learned is that the actions we think are trivial and unimportant turn out to be the most important especially ones that involve spontaneous acts of love. While not exactly a life review in After Life by Hirokazu Koreeda a group of recently deceased people are asked to look back at their life and choose only one memory from their life that they want to take with them to eternity. The process compels people to look at their life in its entirety and see what worked and what was missing.Set in a dreary barrackslike way station civil servants meet with those just crossed over to help them choose the experience they want to hold on to. For some the choice is easy for others it is difficult. Those that will not or cannot choose are consigned to work in the substation with the newly deceased until they are ready to move on. The counselors work one on one with each individual telling them that they have three days to make their choice. Once a memory is selected a film crew recreates the memory sets are built and the little touches of sights and sounds are selected until the deceased are satisfied that they are witnessing a perfect recreation of their experience. It is that film that they take with them not the original memory.At first some choose things such as a trip to Disneyland a sexual encounter or a memorable bowl of rice but later gravitate toward experiences that are more meaningful. The center of the film revolves around those who are unable to choose. Ichiro Watanabe Taketoshi Naito is a 70year old management consultant who has led an uneventful life and is challenged to find a memory he thinks is worth preserving for all time. To help him in this process he is allowed to scan through piles of videotapes representing each year of his life. One young man wants to choose a dream instead of an actual event. Another wants to forget his past entirely and an elderly woman is stuck in the mindset of a nineyear old girl.After Life is the story of the caseworkers as well. Takashi Mochizuki Arata has been stuck in limbo because he cannot find any happiness in his twentytwo years until he realizes how his short life deeply affected someone else. His perfect realization also affects a coworker Shiori Erika Oda who has fallen in love with him. After Life is a beautiful and touching film that allows us to reflect on the things that brought us joy in our own life and to recognize that true happiness lies not in outward symbols of success but in giving ourselves to others.".

In any case it challenges us to rethink what it is we really value.Some reviewers complain about the quite ordinary surroundings and poor production values of the movie. I prefer to think of the choice of sets etc as humble and realistic. Could any movie whatever its budget ever possibly do justice to this subject matter?Much of this movie is devoted to explorations of the lives of a number of rather ordinary people trying to identify their most cherished memories. Some reviewers have condemned The Afterlife as boring boring BORING on this account. It all depends on whether other people interest you. If all you want to see is car chases sex explosions cool special effects...avoid this movie. Only it's worth noting that the lives and thoughts of others may help us to better understand ourselves.

	schema:reviewBody "I really loved Koreeda's first feature Maboroshi No Hikari so I had been looking forward very much to seeing Afterlife named Wandafuru raifu in Japanese after Frank Capra's movie It's a wonderful Life during its run in London.At first I noticed that the film is formally very different from its predecessor while Maboroshi No Hikari owes much to the influence of Ozu and especially Hou Hsiaohsien Afterlife draws more on the directors background as a documentary filmmaker. What the two films share however is the theme of memory Note also a theme with Hirokazu Koreeda's documentary work  check out Without Memory about a man suffering of severe amnesia. In Maboroshi No Hikari Yumiko is not able to forget the memory of her dead husband whereas in Afterlife the recently deceased must chose one memory that will accompany them into eternity.I feel that Koreeda handles this entirely hypothetical premise in the best possible way by steering completely clear of the stylistic superficialities with which so many other films about life after death desperately try to make themselves believable. The unspectacular old school building as a setting the ceiling window with its interchangeable templates for the different stages of the moon a character who himself has doubts as to whether this is really the best way of going to the next world and the absence of any religious connotations among other things all serve to keep the focus on the characters and their memories  many of whom are actually real. Apart from tongue in cheek humour the lack of music also prevents oversentimentalization and makes the memories the people recall the more sincere. The nobudget filming of the recollections of the deceased in order to trigger their personal memory toward the end of the movie also illustrates that the director is fully aware of his own limitations and possibilities as a filmmaker. Rather than just trying to create the illusion of some halfbaked version of the hereafter he wants to challenge the viewer to reflect on what would be hisher most important memory  and succeeds in every way.This is a movie that surly can be appreciated by anyone who possesses at least a tiniest inkling of openness and willingness to experience cinema as more than mere entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "Afterlife is without a doubt one of the greatest Japanese films I've ever seen. Visually it is truly stunning. Kore Eda is known for his own obsession with lighting and his skill for casting shadows and beams of white light are second to none. Combined with an innovative creative and enjoyable story that takes on a slightly supernatural docudrama and at the same time is set in a dull down and out halfway house between Earthlife and heavenafterlife. Fascinating scenes take place as the deceased have one week to decide on a single memory from their lifetime that they can keep for all eternity. He also includes elements of documentary with talking head scenes of the deceased talking about their memories. Kore Eda throws around some extremely interesting ideas and themes on life and human emotions for our memories and he genuinely makes you think about what he's said once you've finished watching.This is a film that not everyone would enjoy due to its slow moving pace mood orientated lighting and partly improvised script but it is a creative masterpiece that is definitely worthy of high praise and attention.".

	onyx:emotionText "Afterlife is without a doubt one of the greatest Japanese films I've ever seen. Visually it is truly stunning. Kore Eda is known for his own obsession with lighting and his skill for casting shadows and beams of white light are second to none. Combined with an innovative creative and enjoyable story that takes on a slightly supernatural docudrama and at the same time is set in a dull down and out halfway house between Earthlife and heavenafterlife. Fascinating scenes take place as the deceased have one week to decide on a single memory from their lifetime that they can keep for all eternity. He also includes elements of documentary with talking head scenes of the deceased talking about their memories. Kore Eda throws around some extremely interesting ideas and themes on life and human emotions for our memories and he genuinely makes you think about what he's said once you've finished watching.This is a film that not everyone would enjoy due to its slow moving pace mood orientated lighting and partly improvised script but it is a creative masterpiece that is definitely worthy of high praise and attention.";

	schema:reviewBody "What is the happiest moment of your life? If you had to pick one moment one memory to keep with you and the rest were going to be erased what would it be? This is the central question of Afterlife a film about life memory happiness movie making and only in tangent death. A group of dead people arrive at a dilapidated building where they are told to select a single memory that they will dwell in for all eternity. Heaven as it turns out is only a memory. The film is mostly these people talking directly into the camera documentary style reflecting on what was most important to them.I recently told a friend about this movie who told me it sounded corny and if the film had only been about these people I might agree. I told my friend that I liked the film because while watching it I reflected on my entire life and what happiness had meant to me during it. I was almost shocked and a little saddened by how quickly I came to realize what my moment was like the movie as a whole it leaves a bittersweet taste. My friend told me they didn't think about their life that way and that it would be too depressing to do so. I told her that someone in the movie says that too and what made the movie as a whole so good and not just a clever concept was how honest it was about the complications between notions of a meaningful life nostalgia and personal happiness.The dead have a half a week to choose which memory they want and the rest of the week is spent filming the memories in a sound studio. The screening at the end of the week is to be their moment of ascension. Though silent at first the counselors shooting these memorymovies are not separate from the process they too are dead. Takashi and his trainee Shiori we see handle most of the cases.Afterlife despite its title is not a film about death but about memory and selfreflection. Two characters become problematic early on one an old man who says he cant remember his life clearly enough to choose a specific moment the other a young man who refuses to chose a moment insisting it would be avoiding responsibility for his life and a surrender to empty nostalgia. Takashi becomes interested in the old man's casefor personal reasons we discover later and has the man's life sent to him on videotape so that he may observe and report in a quieter variation on Albert Brook's Defending Your Life a conceptual cousin to Afterlife.Afterlife is about producing films that capture only a single moment and that only have meaning to single person films that will only be screened once but will be remembered literally forever. They are so personal as to be inconsequential to anyone but their intended viewer but I couldn't think of a more meaningful type of film to make both for an audience and their creators. I think this is why many people watch films at times to identify and at others to connect with what is unidentifiable.Russian silent film director Aleksandr Medvedkin used to travel the USSR on a train stopping at random villages and asking the people what their problems issues and concerns were and then asked for their assistance in making a film about just that. Doing this Medvedkin wanted to give cinema to the masses. The world of Afterlife likewise gives cinema to the individual.There are sprinklings of melodrama in the film towards the end but they allow the characters to actually reach important conclusions that the film wouldn't have been able to connect together otherwise. Even if you can't remember your own moment isn't it possible that you are an extra or a main character in someone else's and nothing as dramatic as some old flame pining over you but maybe a moment spent with a friend or a family member. Maybe your parent's happiest moment was when you were born. It's only from an imaginary position like an Afterlife that we have the distance to reflect on such grand feelings intimately and sincerely.Since were not dead this question can be written off as sophomoric or corny our best days may in fact still be ahead. But I wonder if without some prior sense of what is truly beautiful meaningful and warm fuzziness incarnate whether we can know true bliss when we finally see it. This is assuming it's something you can even know when you see it and not something that only occurs with memory. I was once told in a Sunday Sermon happiness is predicated on happenings and events but joy was something internal that had little relation to the outside world. Personally I think real happiness is created when memories generate joy that later events cannot soil or touch.The only objections I could reasonably see are often spoken by the characters themselves particularly the young man who thinks the entire system is flawed what do they do if a baby dies for instance? My own moment and no I will not tell you nor anyone else was actually quite corny in fact it was the first time in my life I realized why a certain kind of sentimentality existed. This movie is sentimental for sure but it's definitely sincere. If we get lucky in this universe and there is an Afterlife we would all be very fortunate to find ourselves in a movie theaters like these with kind hearted counselors to help us grieve for and accept our lives and if there isn't well at least there's still movies like Afterlife things worth seeing things worth talking about and things worth sharing with each other.".

	schema:headline " A story of life death and the power of memory";
	schema:reviewBody "It is probably safe to say that very few films these days know very much about real life. Safer to say that most films these days know even less about the nature of death. A lot of movies about death are more interested in the celestial wallpaper. The afterlife on film is usually a perspective on what Heaven and Hell might look like and those who die are usually more interested in tying up romantic loose ends or returning to unfinished business. Very few films have ever matteroffactly considered the afterlife from the point of view of the traveler who has crossed the threshold to the undiscovered country.Hirokazu Koreeda's Afterlife is almost alone in it's contemplation on the importance of the single moment or moments that shape our humanity. In 1999 Koreeda created this absolutely beautiful examination of the stopover between life and death where the choice of a lifetime must be made What single memory would you carry with you to your eternal reward? The examination is vessled by 22 travelers who for various reasons have died and arrive from a white light to a place that is neither here nor there. They are in a waystation between the end of life and their eternal lodgings. The counselors who work here meet and interview several recently dead people each week. The travelers are tasked with choosing one memory from a lifetime that they will carry over into the eternity that awaits them. Once a memory is selected it will be turned into a film and screened before the patron vanishes with the memory all other memories having been eliminated.But what memory? What single memory is worth an eternity? Carrying the best memory would be heaven while surely carrying the worst would be hell. To that end the travelers find this a difficult task for various reasons. One man discovers that he has no memory that he wishes to carry on. Another discovers that he has too many. One decides that it was her experience on the Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland.We meet these people through interviews while the staff works diligently to create the productions for the films that will be screened. We learn very little about the staff who have apparently chosen to spend eternity at the station helping others select a memory. There is a moment when we come close a connection between one of the patrons and the man who didn't think that he had a memory of this I will leave you to discover. This moment provides one of the most emotional moments in the film and provides him with a reason for choosing the memory most precious to his heart.This is the most profound examination of the nature of humanity that I have ever seen on film. There are no special effects no gimmickry no scenes that are thrown together to hold our interest. This is a movie that very gently reaches out to those lucky enough to be caught up in it's contemplative spell and to be spellbound by it's message The message is that memory is all we have. No matter what financial or possessive objects we have gained in our lives our memories lie at the core of what makes us intelligent beings. It is the thing that connects our learning our maturity and shapes our social connection. It is the core of our being the connection point of our humanity.On the emotional level the film works through contemplation through imagining ourselves as the wayward patrons. The movie sees the selection process as very matter of fact. Koreeada is more interested in the people who have arrived here than in the place to which they have arrived. That spareness allows us to contemplate their process rather than their surroundings.I saw After Life shortly after it's initial release in 1999 and years later it still resonates in my mind. When I am idle staring at the ceiling when sleep refuses to settle my mind I contemplate the question posed by Koreeda's film and to this day I am nowhere near a decision. If I had to choose one memory it might be agony because my number of candidates would go as high as five hundred or if I wrote them down closer to a thousand. For that I feel fortunate fortunate and grateful that my life can contain that kind of contentment. If I am given the kind of task given to the people in After Life it is my hope that whatever I settle on can be turned into a film that is as gentle peaceful and affirming as Koreeda's beautiful work.".

The counselors await for the new week and the next arrivals.I love this idea. It's got great potential. However it feels a little like watching some kind of government bureaucracy. No matter how touching it gets. This has a DMV type of pacing. There is one fun section where they are recreating the memories. It could funnier but I like that section.

After the counselors help the arrivals pick their memories the film crew recreates the memory and the arrivals watch the tape. After watching the tape they disappear into the next stage. The counselors await for the new week and the next arrivals.I love this idea. It's got great potential. However it feels a little like watching some kind of government bureaucracy. No matter how touching it gets. This has a DMV type of pacing. There is one fun section where they are recreating the memories. It could funnier but I like that section. I love this movie idea but two hours is a stretch.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a perfect film for watching on a quiet Sunday morning. It made me reflect on my own life and realize that I would probably be one of the counselors in the afterlife.It was brilliantly written and directed and one of the most innovative stories I have seen on screen. After death you spend a week in a waystation to reflect on your life and take one memory with you. It is not an easy process as I discovered.I was interested in the fact that some people can remember all the way back to the womb. Picking a happy memory before I was an adult is almost impossible for me so I cannot imagine going back that far. Most people remember only to age three or four.I was fascinated with the man who wanted to leave behind some evidence of his existence. One man could not remember any happy memories in his 70 years so he had to sit through video tapes one for each year of his life to help him. It seems that there was a connection with one of the counselors and this played out in an unusual way at the end. Choosing your best memory as the fact that you were someone else's best memory and that you made one person happy.Most of us fall into the category expressed by one man. I had a soso education a soso job a soso marriage and a soso retirement. How do you pick a happy or important memory from that? I also liked one man's response when he picked his memory after lamenting that most of the memories of his life were bad. After being told he would forget all the bad memories he exclaimed That truly is heaven. An unusual film that will be in my memory for a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This small and low budget film creeps up on you like the eventual realisation that the person you truly love is no longer in your life and this film makes you realise that too! It is set in a kind of halfway house between death and the place you go afterwards. A limbo of sorts. Once in this limbo you have a week to choose a single memory that is later recreated in film for you to keep to take with you forever and all the rest of your life vanishes which as one person who we see choose says what a good idea to let your life be largely forgotten. The paradox is of course that as you watch this film memories come out of everywhere passed loves childhood memories first day at school immature early teen moments regrets. That's why this film is difficult not for anything in the film but for what you get out of it and the difficulty you find concentrating on it memories come from everywhere to interrupt the film and take you away from watching it. This is the first film I have ever seen that has been able to do this all the way through. Like some universal filmed diary and I've seen this film twice now and it does every time and the same memories too! And if you've seen this and thought well it was all right I suppose watch it again at a later date and it really does get much much better the second time I can't wait for the third time I see it it'll probably become the best film I have ever seen.But the film itself once you've managed to push yet another of your own memories away long enough to actually concentrate on it is full of little wonderful tiny touches that just resonate in you. One particular scene that gives nothing of the film away is when an old lady who has no real memories chooses the time she used to just sit and watch and feel cherry blossoms brush and fall over her in a park and once this is filmed you can see such joy in her eyes and then later she saves some of the blossoms which she in turn gives in an old plastic bag to the guy who was in charge of her choice so that he can in turn remember the times spent with his three year old daughter which he said earlier reminded him of her. The end is also particularly moving when we learn about one of the other workers there who help people decide what memory to keep with them. He is the star of the film without question his very distant and beautiful screen presence makes the end once you get to know who he is all the more difficult to watch the knowing that he eventually comes to terms with his life enough to be able move on and his very simple filmmemory remains with you for a long time afterwards. This film is very slow to begin but once it grabs you which it eventually will even if like me it took until the second time it stays and makes you wonder long after what memory you would keep. But I guess everyone thinks about that after seeing this. Better make sure that before you die there is something good to choose.".

I like the look of the film  the occasional handheld camera work lends a spontaneous and personal tone to the film that underscores many of the most touching moments.The 'reenactments' of selected memories also struck me as great affectionate allegories for the process of making movies or at least personal movies like this.

	schema:reviewBody "While sporadically fascinating as a foreign art film the movie nonetheless is likely to be of interest only to a specialized audience in the U.S.  It represents a very Japanese version of such films as WHAT DREAMS MAY COME or DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.One of the points of interest is the film's Buddhist Japanese attitude towards death and eternity so different from what most Americans and Europeans think of.  The key plot point of the movie is that everyone spends eternity in endless contemplation of one perfect moment from their lives. This notion differs drastically from the western emphasis on variety as the spice of life  or death.  Compare Wim Wenders' film UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD in which a group of westerners are emotionally and intellectually crippled by having to sort through their inmost thoughts and memories.Our hell is usually depicted as a place where one must carry out pointless repetitive tasks or where one is forced into an obsession with the past as in WHAT DREAMS MAY COME heaven is usually thought of as listening to music living in palaces and socializing with a wide array of friends and loved ones.  The Buddhist heaven suggested by this movie comes all too close to resembling a Sartrian hell in a westerner's eyes.  Thus most American filmgoers would have no idea what the story was hoping to convey by insisting on the choice of a single cherished memory.  Those with an interest in a different perspective may find the film thoughtprovoking.It's less clear what the movie is getting at by suggesting that the afterlife is a place where people must make movies of their lives on limited budgets and with inadequate props.  Perhaps the filmmaker is merely making a joke about filmmaking.  Or perhaps he's trying to suggest that film is the ultimate artistic format most closely tied to people's actual experiences of life.  A little movie magic is all that's necessary to capture the gist of reality even if the technical aspects of production seem cheap and mundane.  Either way the filmmaking references are likely to be lost on mainstream audiences.Even when judged as a Japanese film the movie is successful primarily when it relies on actual documentary interviews with old folks.  Listening to these nonactors trying to describe the best memories of their lives is absolutely fascinating whereas the drama narrated by the film is considerably less engaging.".

The concept is original and poignant and the presentation is such that it allows for viewers to put themselves into the story right alongside the characters and think What memory would I take with me?

I can't argue with that. But I will say that such a dismissal of this movie's content seems to me to indicate a real failure of empathy Are folks so hung up on novelty on the extraordinary that they can't see any beauty at all in a perfectly humdrum life? What about your life or mine? Are the only people worth caring about all fullcolor glossy hundredfoothigh superstars?For me it's not boring or disappointing that say the indecisive gentleman chooses to sit on a park bench for eternity with his wife. Return to his decision in your mind for a moment What is it saying? I think it's a comment not on the afterlife but on just how little will do in the here and now how little we'll wake up for in the morning how absolutely unkillable our hope for ourselves is how abjectly we devote ourselves to enduring our lives even when there's no reward waiting for us. It's saying that any tiny moment no matter how empty it may seem can contain enough to sustain us forever.Can contain enough what? I can't say exactly. Under this movie's quiet surfaces it seems desperately urgent to answer that question Enough what? Yes yes it says this is what your life is made of! Frowning at newspapers and sitting on trains and eating hundreds of breakfasts in silence. This is it! So what does it mean? What is it for? Better make it mean something because no one else can do that for you. Nobody's waiting to buy the film rights to your last fight with your girlfriend father roommate whatever. Nobody cares what your favorite song is. Nobody cares how you feel whenever you walk past that one willow tree where the two of you kissed for the last time.That's the mercilessness at the core of this otherwise very tender and beautiful story You mean nothing. Nobody means anything. You have to look inside yourself and choose to cherish something any damn thing because otherwise you might as well be dead already.I don't know. I'm just running off at the mouth. I'm not going to convince anybody to see this film I don't think. It's an obscure Japanese number and the subtitles are often hard to read white text against snowouch. But for what it's worth After Life will reward your patience. It's sweet and understated and funny and deeply moving. For once you may cry at a movie without resenting it later.".

A significant event splits the initial single thread into three each following a child the precocious Malee making her first amorous exploration Leonard and his struggle with obesity not only his but also of his immediate family and the conflicted Jacob. While the film would classify as a drama there is a good deal of humor to counterbalance the tension that is maintained throughout. The editing is superb in how it moves nimbly among the threads keeping us always interested and curious about what will happen to the characters.

Powerfully and sensitively written by Anthony Cipriano and directed with unrelenting intensity and grace by Michael Cuesta this is a film about youngsters on the brink of adulthood who respond to each other and to events in ways far beyond the scope of most mature adults.Identical twins Rudy and Jacob Carges Conor Donovan in both roles differ in the fact that Jacob has a facial birthmark and feels second fiddle to his twin Rudy a quick tempered lad who eggs on bullies causing the maelstrom that is to follow. Their close friends are Malee Chuang Zoe Weizenbaum the daughter of psychologist Dr. Carla Chuang Annabella Sciorra who remains bruised by a failed marriage to an abusive husband and grossly obese Leonard Fisher Jesse Camacho whose parents Marcia DeBonis and Tom McGowan are equally addicted to junk food. When Rudy challenges two ruffian classmates Michael Fuchs and Martin Campetta the trio's tree house is threatened and is burned as a gesture or revenge  but Rudy happened to be inside the tree house and was burned to death. His parents Linus Roache and Jayne Atkinson are devastated as is Jacob now their only son and one who feels he should have been the twin that died. The family wants revenge and is infuriated when the two lads who caused the tragedy are given only one year of detention.This event sets off changes in the three friends Jacob visits the perpetrators in the detention home unable to see that Rudy's death was an unplanned accident. He threatens the lads and one actually commits suicide in his cell. Jacob gradually becomes friends with the other lad when his security at home is threatened by is parent's adoption of a black son. This new camaraderie results in a plan that leads to a surprising end. In the meanwhile Leonard's injury in the fire leads to his loss of taste and he sees his obesity and that of his entire family as disgusting and commits to changing his life unable to even forcibly gain the same change from his parents  another surprising end. And Malee's desperate need for a father figure and her starting adolescence leads her to become enchanted by one of her mother's patients construction worker Gus Maitland Jeremy Renner in a superb performance and she attempts to seduce the psychologically damaged Gus without success. The manner in which these three youngsters enter the adult world is more than challenging and the results of their response to entering 'maturity' and to the trauma of the death of Rudy is shattering.Cuesta directs these fine actors  there is not a weak one in the cast  with surety and a degree of sense of spontaneity that is truly splendid. This is most assuredly an ensemble performance worthy of awards it is also a series of star turns for Jeremy Renner Annabella Sciorra Conor Donovan Zoe Weizenbaum and Jesse Camacho. This is independent filmmaking at its finest the story is tough the conclusions disturbing and the quality of acting is astounding. First Class work. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is done very well and definitely engaging to watch but perhaps not quite to my taste.This is a movie about a tight group of 4 children  a precocious girl an overweight boy and twin brothers the more outgoing who is killed in an accident. The funeral starts the journey of understanding the lives of the remaining 3  not only how the family deals with the murdered sonbrother but how the overweight boy deals with his obesity and how the young girl deals with her mother and absent father.The heart of the movie really revolves around these near teenagers and as a result the comingofage experiences are highlighted. At times I laughed awkwardly probably out of embarrassment for one of the characters. Nothing wrong with this  in fact it's probably what the director was trying to achieve. I was also pulled into the bizarre logic the brother was going through  through talks with his parents and even more poignant some of the very personal kidtokid conversations. The visual clues and the interactions to parents were all well chosen to create characters that were believable 3dimensional and full of conflict. Kudos to the director and actors on this fine work. In particular the precocious young girl Zoe Weizenbaum was wellcast in a very strong conflicted and convincing performance.Overall  well done. This is one of the best 'preteenangst' movies I've seen in a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "One night I was on the couch looking through my TMN on demand movie selections movies AZ. Looking for good movies to watch on the movie network is tough considering you don't know what ones are goodrecommended and what ones you should entirely stay away from. I watched all of the ones that fit my taste and one night I decided to view the movie Twelve and Holding hardly knowing anything about it. I'm not really a fan of dramas at all the Family Channel Disney pretty much ruined them for me with these lame dramacomedy's such as MVP and cheap independent cartoon type ones. I decided to give it a chance because I wasn't really in the mood for any action or horror or Comedy's like I usually was. As soon as it passed the dramatic scenes about a brother tragically loosing his life to a Molotov cocktail I was absorbed into the fascinating character study and couldn't wait to see what happened next in the tale. Many characters with completely different problems are examined in this story and it ties together nicely with the main plot. Inspiring and heartbreaking moments with truly remarkable wellacted sequences. The actors often seemed way to real to me and instead of feeling like a total wordplay the writing style was original and refreshing. There is a good amount of subplots in this comingofage story and they are studied with wellwritten dialog awkward or funny moments and significant captivating motivational characters. This movie isn't nearly as highly acclaimed as I proposed it was going to be only one nomination? No Oscar nominations? Nothing!? Surely it deserves more observation on a critical side. Consideration understanding the dealing of problems and temptations are pretty much the four key aspects this movie is tackling and trying to make the viewer take into consideration but people aren't giving it a fighting chance. Speaking of characters five strong characters are highlighted in this film. Jeremy Renner who plays Gus a mislead neednosympathy pathetic man who tries to be a clean role model to a little girl Zoe Weizenbaum who happens to be one of the other lead characters playing Malee. Jesse Camacho playing Leonard who has to deal with his overweight family one of the more motivational and inspirational characters of the film. He is also overweight but actually is the one who is trying to take action and loose weight. Conor Donovan another powerful actor from the film plays two characters himself and his much more unapproachable and risktaking brother. Two strong roles too fill and he does the job. This film tops off with one of the most emotionally charged and satisfying endings I've seen in a drama since a long time. Highly recommended.34 Stars".

The film shows us that problems in areas such as violence guns race issues and obesity are no longer limited to adults but play an active part amongst young people as well. The film centers around a group of 12 year old friends and their families. All with different problems which reflect on their parents short comings. The script is very well written and the acting is quite extraordinary throughout the entire film. The only real problem is that the movie feels a little too short but perhaps it's better to quit while ones ahead.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Ostensibly about a group of friends this film tells three separate tales that veer from comedy to tragedy and back again. I'll sketch them in the order of most successful to least.Malee lives with her mom and never sees her dad. She's just started her period and begins to develop a very strong crush on a construction worker who is one of her therapist mother's patients. Her attempts at flirting are both painful and very funny to watch. She's obviously missing a father figure but there's something else stirring as well and she's lonely and looking for adult attention. Zoe Weizenbaum was just a joy to watch beautiful and earnest and lovable and willing to take amazing risks for the film. The director told us to watch out for her as Young Pumpkin in the upcoming Memories of a Geisha.Leonard is an overweight kid from a family where everyone is overweight and he's tired of being the butt of other people's jokes. After a serious accident in which bizarrely he loses his senses of taste and smell he starts eating healthy food and exercising and takes radical action to as he sees it save his mother's life. Played soulfully by Jesse Camacho Leonard is never just comic relief but a hurting little boy who wants to change not only his life but his family's as well.Jacob Conor Donovan and Rudy also played by Conor Donovan are twin brothers who are very different from each other. Rudy is athletic and fearless Jacob withdrawn and shy mostly because of a large birthmark on his face. One night Rudy and Leonard stay overnight in their treehouse after bullies threaten to destroy it. Their plan to stay awake and defend it goes horribly wrong when they doze off and the bullies light it on fire unaware that anyone is inside. Leonard escapes with relatively minor injuries but as noted above the odd side effect that he can no longer smell or taste. But Rudy is killed and his family is devastated. Jacob is racked with guilt for not being with the others on the night of the fire but he's also filled with a desire for revenge. After the two perpetrators are sent away to a juvenile facility for a year Rudy and Jacob's mother expresses her wish that the guilty pair die a sentiment that Jacob stores away in his heart.For a while Jacob goes to the juvenile facility regularly to threaten the two telling them that when they get out he's going to kill them. But after one of the boys commits suicide in custody Jacob softens and even continues to visit the other boy and bring him comic books. As the boy's release looms they make a plan to run away together. Jacob is unhappy at home feeling unwanted due to the arrival of a new adopted child. But his plans lead to even more tragedy.If all this sounds melodramatic it is. And despite the heavy subject matter at times there was a vaguely afterschool special feeling about the film. This last story which in some ways ties the others together carries the most weight but is the least successful. I'm not sure why but it may have something to do with the huge dramatic burden placed on the shoulders of a young actor with little experience. The fact that the film careens through a wide emotional territory like a drunken elephant doesn't help either.In the end the performances of Camacho and Weizenbaum are so winning that I sort of wish they were in a film of their own. As a story of three kids seeking the love of their parents the film is only partially successful. I also wish the kids had been in more scenes together since you don't really get to see why they're friends in the first place.".

These kids and ALL kids are not the innocent 'Beaver Cleavers' most adults think or wish all kids are. I for one remember when I was 12. I did things like these kids did and more. I was sexually active in a same sex relationship with someone older another issue is addressed in the movie and could relate to it even though the relationship portrayed in the movie is heterosexual. It is VERY rare to see ANY reference to adult  adolescent relationships where the adolescent is the sexual aggressor and NOT the adult. It may be an ugly subject but it IS reality.I give this movie an 11 on a scale of 110. I would also like to thank IFC Films for showing new releases on PayPer View so people who don't have access to theaters showing the films can see them.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Mixing the topic of death and adolescents is always difficult to do in a manner that avoids melodrama and in a manner that truly explores raw emotion among the kids and adults. For the most part director Michael Cuesta does succeed in crafting a wellmade believable study of what happens next.The challenge he is faced with is actually going a bit too far sometimes with violence guns sex and independence. The points are made but the story lines are just a tad extreme. The film deals with twin brothers  one a born leader the other a social recluse with a facial birthmark  who are friends with Malee the daughter of a single psychiatrist mom and Leonard a quiet obese boy from a family full of champion overeater. Real life begins for all involved when the popular brother is accidentally killed. Watching the transformation of the other brother to a strongwilled slightly angry bull is frightening. However it is not as frightening as the paths of Malee and Leonard.Malee's storyline involves her crush on a MUCH older construction worker played by Jeremy Renner the bad guy in North Country and Dahmer. Trust me when I tell you that this plot twist will leave you feeling very uncomfortable but it does ends well. Leonard's line creates the most humor but it also serves as a sad commentary on the role families play in childhood obesity. Watching Leonard slowly transform himself and family is again a little over the top.Some familiar faces adorn the cast including Annabella Sciorra as Malee's mom who is miscast as a psychiatrist but she does handle the final scenes very well. Linus Roche Thomas Wayne from Batman Begins plays the grief stricken dad of the twins and in a real surprise Tony Roberts plays a doctor. Yes the Tony Roberts from all of the Woody Allen movies in the 70's. The kids are played well by Conor Donovan twins Jessie Camacho Leonard who looks like a young Paul Sorvino and Zoe Weizenbaum Malee.Overall a pretty well constructed film but would have liked to see a few script changes to prevent a few of the overthetop moments.".

The characters were terrifically drawn showing the way 12 year olds commit acts without considering consequences. They have a goal they do whatever they think is necessary to achieve the goal they do not consider what might happen as a result of the action  this is true to life. Even the parents are seen from the point of view of the kids namely as nonunderstanding grownups not necessarily adversaries but not allies either yet adults in the audience completely understood and related to the actions of the parents.speaking of the audience  it is rare to have a packed audience totally silent as was the preview audience in attendance when I saw the movie. In fact total silence happened many times during the movie as did collective gasps.which begs the question  why do I call it an almost excellent movie? One very important pivotal plot development simply did not ring true for me. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ALERT!!! I did not believe the young girl would steal a gun.This was unfortunate. On the one hand this did not spoil the movie for me and I would highly recommend the movie. On the other hand I wish this particular plot element had not been included. The director and script writer could have found other ways to arrive at the gun's plot element. In fact it would have been more effective to have a different plot element other than the gun which surprised no one in the audience.Otherwise the movie was excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Children we see them grow everyday as individuals and as people looking back at the time you were 12 years old you could only imagine what growth came next. Micheal Cuesta makes this brilliant film into a work of magic of growing up dealing with our emotions and change. And proves yet again why he is probably one of the most brilliant directors in Hollywood today. 12 and holding not only proves this but makes the clear statement.The film starts out as we meet our main characters JacobMaeleeLeonard and Rudy. We see them going day to day in there lives with each there own problems. Maelee has just started puberty and menstruating Leonard is eating so much and gaining weight his family is no better and Twin brothers Rudy and Jacob Jacob in which he hides his face because of the huge birth mark on his face and Rudy who wants to defend his tree house and his brother. But the gang is soon faced with a troublesome occurrence. Two bullies decide to throw Molotov cocktails inside the tree house while Rudy is in there Leonard as well. Leonard manages to escape but Rudy is caught and it takes his life changing the path for each of our characters.Jacob decides to plot revenge against his brothers killers while visiting them at a juvenile prison. Instead he bonds with one of the bullies becoming friends with him which starts impacting his life while his family is changing around him.Leonard who escaped the fire is diagnosed with a disorder one in which he can't smell or taste what he's eating but it leads him on a path to start eating apples and start eating healthier and realize his weight is a problem and he needs to fix it by exercising everyday and even starts looking towards trying to help his family.Maelee takes her emotions she realizes shes attracted to a man twice her age whom she looks pretty for sings songs for. She becomes obsessed with him trying to be with him she doesn't care how old he is only that her heart is telling her she really loves this man who he himself has problems of his own.I won't get into much spoilers here about what happens to the characters as this movie is just a gift to unravel you feel the characters grow each time there story is presented and shown. The writing is top notch as well as the acting. None of the kids overact in there situations but play out there roles as regular kids and when a situation arises they take to there own. Cuesta does a fantastic job to make you care for these characters and see what will happen next and that most likely you will sympathize with a character or even connect to your own. Cuesta is never afraid to walk over the line thats drawn he goes there he crosses it and portrays real people in real situations. If anything 12 and Holding is one of those movies that are is so great and so well done that it will probably be passed up for Oscars. My only quip about the movie is that it leaves you wanting more! You want to see where there situations have led them what will happen to them but i guess thats up to us to figure out as to where or what we think will happen to them or how they will grow. In total this is definitely a movie not be missed.A Defnite 1010 Rent or buy this one to give it a chance.".

	schema:headline " Little Adults";
	schema:reviewBody "Apparently whenever a gun makes it appearance early on in a Michael Cuesta film you can guarantee that somehow it will find its way to the forefront of the action usually culminating in an act of senseless violence. I'm not sure that this depiction is necessarily a good thing especially when the leads in this movie are little more than child actors. I can understand the point  violence always manages to make its way in one form or other into the homes of American families  but for the most this seems to be some perverted version of Judy Blume thrown onto our faces in the form of an intelligent movie.Three stories intertwine stemming from the tragic death of the twin brother of the main character played by Conor Donovan. The first is Conor's he has a birth defect a red smudge on the side of his face that has led him to believe his parents prefer his brother even after he has died. A heated argument between Conor's parents where the mother demands justice be served to the boys who caused her son's death triggers something in Conor that leads him to taunt the boy who is in prison although he later befriends him after seeing him cry. Because really it really was a senseless act that snowballed into tragedy.Tragedy also seems to be looming over Leonard Fisher and Malee Chuang but in different ways. Leonard having barely escaped the fire that killed Conor's brother inside their treehouse has decided to lose weight and pursues his goal with monomaniacal determination. Malee on the other hand falls for a hunky construction worker who is aware of her attraction and passively leads her on as he goes to her mother a psychologistfor therapy. This is where the gun makes its appearance  at his house where Malee breaks in because she wants to get a peek at him. She gets the gun out of his house gives it to Conor forgets about it... and the third act is set.TWELVE AND HOLDING is an uncomfortable movie to watch because of the situation it places Malee. Yet it's brutally honest in addressing adolescent crushes on people they look up to because it's something everyone goes through everyone has had that irresistible attraction to someone older a teacher perhaps and written about it in their diary or blog... Malee decides to act it out instead more than likely not fully aware of what she is doing. But because it's so honest and so true it can become this mobile moment when people may react in a squeamish way. However it's artfully handled  especially when the construction worker Jeremy Renner later confesses how this extremely precarious scene helped him resolve some inner demons to Malee's mother Annabella Sciorra.The other two boys' stories are a little less interesting. Leonard's obsession with losing weight puts him and his mother in a situation that looks exactly like a Rube Goldberg sequence. Conor's while more believable is still less satisfying because his parents like Malee's and Leonards are totally clueless about how to approach him. And it's because of this inability to relate that he finally acts out and I have to say Cuesta has to find other ways not to include the Necessary Gun into the picture. It is possible to tell a risky story without having to incorporate that into the story's message. But... that's my opinion. TWELVE AND HOLDING is better in some ways but still... not quite.".

	onyx:emotionText "Apparently whenever a gun makes it appearance early on in a Michael Cuesta film you can guarantee that somehow it will find its way to the forefront of the action usually culminating in an act of senseless violence. I'm not sure that this depiction is necessarily a good thing especially when the leads in this movie are little more than child actors. I can understand the point  violence always manages to make its way in one form or other into the homes of American families  but for the most this seems to be some perverted version of Judy Blume thrown onto our faces in the form of an intelligent movie.Three stories intertwine stemming from the tragic death of the twin brother of the main character played by Conor Donovan. The first is Conor's he has a birth defect a red smudge on the side of his face that has led him to believe his parents prefer his brother even after he has died. A heated argument between Conor's parents where the mother demands justice be served to the boys who caused her son's death triggers something in Conor that leads him to taunt the boy who is in prison although he later befriends him after seeing him cry. Because really it really was a senseless act that snowballed into tragedy.Tragedy also seems to be looming over Leonard Fisher and Malee Chuang but in different ways. Leonard having barely escaped the fire that killed Conor's brother inside their treehouse has decided to lose weight and pursues his goal with monomaniacal determination. Malee on the other hand falls for a hunky construction worker who is aware of her attraction and passively leads her on as he goes to her mother a psychologistfor therapy. This is where the gun makes its appearance  at his house where Malee breaks in because she wants to get a peek at him. She gets the gun out of his house gives it to Conor forgets about it... and the third act is set.TWELVE AND HOLDING is an uncomfortable movie to watch because of the situation it places Malee. Yet it's brutally honest in addressing adolescent crushes on people they look up to because it's something everyone goes through everyone has had that irresistible attraction to someone older a teacher perhaps and written about it in their diary or blog... Malee decides to act it out instead more than likely not fully aware of what she is doing. But because it's so honest and so true it can become this mobile moment when people may react in a squeamish way. However it's artfully handled  especially when the construction worker Jeremy Renner later confesses how this extremely precarious scene helped him resolve some inner demons to Malee's mother Annabella Sciorra.The other two boys' stories are a little less interesting. Leonard's obsession with losing weight puts him and his mother in a situation that looks exactly like a Rube Goldberg sequence. Conor's while more believable is still less satisfying because his parents like Malee's and Leonards are totally clueless about how to approach him. And it's because of this inability to relate that he finally acts out and I have to say Cuesta has to find other ways not to include the Necessary Gun into the picture. It is possible to tell a risky story without having to incorporate that into the story's message. But... that's my opinion. TWELVE AND HOLDING is better in some ways but still... not quite.";

Perhaps too natural it seems he isn't credited for it anywhere people don't even notice it as acting anymore. I have to say I'm guilty of that too  it wasn't after I went back through the movie to make screen shots that I noticed just how rich his expressions and acting is. His performance of Jacob as troubled and shy boy can hardly be captured with a stillimage the emotions wash over his face  his eyes don't know whether to look at the ground or at the person he's talking to. You have see him acting to believe it. In fact even then  his performance is SO perfect that I would have thought he would just BE like that if he hadn't ALSO played the role of his twin brother Rudy who has a totally different personality. What greater compliment can Conor get then that I wasn't sure if Rudy was played by the SAME actor until after I saw that in the credits at the end of the movie!Moreover although Jacob is supposed to be the 'ugly' one as a result of a defacing birthmark on his face being the cause of his different personality  I hardly even noticed Rudy he wasn't beautiful in my eyes while Jacob is very very beautiful. This can only be the result of Conors acting once again you see his inner beauty while his bratty twin brother spoils his looks with his arrogant behavior.I hope to see a lot more movies from Conor soon!".

Leonard's mother Marcia DeBonis is in denial about her eating habits and rages against her son's attempt to change his. Conflict swirls everywhere and while this makes for some dramatic and powerful moments the confrontations between MaleeGus and Jacob and his brother's killer means that the story is ultimately rather fragmented a series of linked vignettes rather than a satisfying whole.The performances across the board are excellent however. The juvenile cast are ably supported by some of indie film's best players Renner Roache Sciorra and this is a poignant if bloody valentine to the transition from childhood to adolescence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hate to say it guys but I liked this one better.  One was good but this one is so silly so comical at times that I just loved it.  If you're unfamiliar with the format there are 3 short stories featured here.  Up first is a wooden indian that adorns the front of a general store coming to life to kill the goons who gunned down his owners.  Holt McCallany is very strong as the foul mouthed leader of the gang.  And the way he gets his...hoo boy.  Number two has a maneating oil slick? snacking on teens on a wooden raft.  And most people are right when they say it looks like a big hefty bag.  And a moment that will have you rolling and that will give teenage boys ideas and have men remembering fondly when they may have done it is where the surviving guy takes a peek under the surviving girls sweater.  Good to see where this dudes priorities are two of his friends are dead he's nearly been killed and he decides its a good time to look at boobies.  I loved it.  But my absolute favorite of both Creepshow films is the hitchhiker story.  It's so hysterically unrealistic that it still makes me laugh all these years later.  With Lois Chiles mindlosing dialogue and the dead guys constant thanks for the ride lady! I can't imagine a funnier more exciting short story than that.  In a perfect world Tom Wright who played the hitchhiker wouldda been nominated for an Oscar. Also a high five to the campy look of the film with all three films set in the middle of nowhere one at sea one mostly in the woods.  A lot of fun I say though most hated this one.".

If you're unfamiliar with the format there are 3 short stories featured here.  Up first is a wooden indian that adorns the front of a general store coming to life to kill the goons who gunned down his owners.  Holt McCallany is very strong as the foul mouthed leader of the gang.  And the way he gets his...hoo boy.  Number two has a maneating oil slick? snacking on teens on a wooden raft.  And most people are right when they say it looks like a big hefty bag.  And a moment that will have you rolling and that will give teenage boys ideas and have men remembering fondly when they may have done it is where the surviving guy takes a peek under the surviving girls sweater.  Good to see where this dudes priorities are two of his friends are dead he's nearly been killed and he decides its a good time to look at boobies.  I loved it.  But my absolute favorite of both Creepshow films is the hitchhiker story.  It's so hysterically unrealistic that it still makes me laugh all these years later.  With Lois Chiles mindlosing dialogue and the dead guys constant thanks for the ride lady! I can't imagine a funnier more exciting short story than that.  In a perfect world Tom Wright who played the hitchhiker wouldda been nominated for an Oscar. Also a high five to the campy look of the film with all three films set in the middle of nowhere one at sea one mostly in the woods.  A lot of fun I say though most hated this one.";

The tales which I will now rate all have gore fun and scares. The first segment Old Chief Woodenhead is an oldfashion revenge story. It has a slow and mysterious build but with enough action to keep things interesting. Actingwise this episode does okay nothing too great but pretty good. The effects in this episode are a little wooden no pun intended but capture the essence of the menacing but slowmoving monsters of 50s media. The second episode The Raft Again okay acting but nothing great. But the blob monster ranges from looking real enough to looking kinda horrible mostly in the earlier shots. Stephen King was at least somewhat right when he described the monster as an old rug. Despite that this episode still dishes out some good scares and creepy gore. The third installment is the scariest one. Good acting scary scenes and scary gore. In all Creepshow 2 is worthy but not equal to the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "Creepshow 2 was released in 1987 and was directed by George Romero's regular cinematographer Michael Gornick. Gornick who was a late replacement for the original director FX maestro Tiom Savini cut his directorial teeth on several episodes of Laurel's Tales From The Darkside and was a natural choice to make the film. He does a commendable job with what is clearly a modest budget and three stories that are not as engaging gripping and frightening as those available to Romero in his original 1982 film.Only one of the three stories has been previously published the other two being originals devised for the film by Stephen King and scripted by Romero. The first story is called Old Chief Woodenhead and stars Hollywood veterans George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour. It concerns a wooden storefront statue of an old Indian chief that comes to life to avenge the death of two elderly people by a gang of youths. It is the least impressive of the three tales but retains a certain ghoulish charm.The second story is The Raft. Originally published in King's 1985 short story collection Skeleton Crew with a slightly different ending. The segment is about four scantilyclad teenagers who arrive at a deserted lake late one summer for an afternoon swim but find that something thoroughly unpleasant is waiting for them. The special effects are well below par with King himself commenting that the monster in the lake looks something like a dirty old man's raincoat. However this episodes's grim punchline would make The Cryptkeeper himself chuckle with approval.The third and probably best story is The Hitchhiker and stars Louis Moonraker Chiles as a bored rich housewife who regularly enjoys the services of a handsome gigolo. On her way home from such an encounter she accidentally runs over a young Hitchhiker played by stuntman Tom Wright killing him instantly. Terrrified by the consequences of her actions she quickly leaves the scene of the accident. However a few miles down the road she sees the Hitchhiker bloodied and amazingly returned to life limping towards her. To reveal any more would be to dampen this segment's sick delights but I will say that it features a neat cameo by King himself as a foulmouthed truck driver.A fourth story called Pinfall was planned for the movie but later dropped due to the faltering budget. It concerned an overweight band of beerchugging bowlers that are murdered by a rival bowling team and come back from the dead for revenge in true EC style. Its a shame we will never get to see this story but it is very close in theme and structure to both Oldf Chief Woodenhead and The Hitchhiker.All in all Creepshow 2 is worth a look and remains a guilty pleasure of mine that I have enjoyed with alarming regularity over the years. It may not be up to the standards set by the first Creepshow but there are more painful ways to spend an evening. Ask The Hitchhiker...".

	schema:reviewBody "Masters of Horror Stephen King and George A. Romero return to deliver more comic book style thrills in Creepshow 2. With original Creepshow cinematographer Michael Gornick stepping in as director the film is not only slimmer on content three stories instead of five but on budget and starpower as well. That doesn't mean that horror fans aren't in for a heaping serving of campy carnage candy though. In tradition with the original Creepshow is hellbent on making its viewers laugh and squirm in their seats simultaneously.While Gornick is no George A. Romero he certainly brings a touch of style to the film that serves it well. Animated segments aside the look and tone of the original is carried over into its sequel with some surprisingly flashy moments that make one wonder why the director fell off the face of the Earth you know aside from the fact that this flick flopped. The script penned by Romero has its ups and downs with some stories being more effective and more competent than others. Variety however is the key to the film's success. If one thing can be said about this affair it is that it never bores and it certainly goes by quickly enough. In fact some would say the fun ends far too early.The three stories are a mixed bag of creepy and goofy with the first concerning a wooden Indian propped outside of a smalltown general store. When local punks rob its kindly owners the statue comes to life seeking revenge. This bit is rather slow moving and sets the movie off on the wrong foot. Although not terrible by any means it is in sharp contrast to the two that follow. Next up we follow a foursome of guys and gals going for a swim in a secluded lake. Soon they find themselves being feasted upon by what can only be described as an oil slick surrounded by a Hefty bag. Of the three this is probably the strongest with some genuinely creepy moments and terrific special effects. Then to wrap things up we find a woman of questionable morals being stalked on the highway by a drifter she accidentally hit. While his insistence on thanking her for the ride makes him seem harmless enough the woman quickly slips into madness as she tries to rid herself of the passenger to no avail. This is the one segment most likely to induce a few unintentional chuckles for its ridiculously overthetop premise and execution.Overall there's a noticeable drop in quality from the first but the sense of dread and humor is still intact. Creepshow 2 is certainly a worthy sequel with a few moments of brilliance that may have panned out better in feature length films. The Raft in particular would have been a great 80's teen monster movie in the vein of the remake of The Blob that would roll into theaters a year later. Taken for what it is though this sequel is like a bag of Halloween candy  some hits some misses but certainly worth the time regardless.".

	schema:headline " While not as good as the first movie. This sequel was still somewhat creepy. The Show must still go on!";
	schema:reviewBody "While 'Creepshow 2' directed by Michael Gornick is not the scariest movie out there based upon the short stories by author Stephen King. I do have to say this American liveactionanimated horror taken from tales from King's 1985's collection book 'Skeleton Crew' can still give you goosebumps while watching it. Without spoiling too much of the scares like the original horror movie 'Creepshow 2' was supposed to have five short stories adapted from author Stephen King being told during the course of the film. However due to budgetary reasons two of the stories 'Pinfall'  Cat from Hell' were scrapped with the latter being filmed for 1990's 'Tales from the Darkside The Movie'. Instead the movie went with three stories structure with Old Chief Wooden Head' on the helm 'The Raft' as the meat of the story and 'The Hitchhiker' being the climax. While this story structure might sound right to some critics since the first tale is most developed of all the three stories had the longest sequence in the film and on the surface level the most controversial story facade of the three since it deals with Native Americans. I still believe there is still a problem with having it display in the forefront. First off the story about a wooden Indian decor taking revenge on some unlikeable robbers for killing his cigar store owner Mr. Ray Spruce George Kennedy was pretty bland and somewhat boring. It's no 1980 'Shining'. It's just another simple minded revenge story. Nothing really smart or scary about it. I was really hoping for a Golem like complexity feel to the story but it just felt safe  disappointing with the sequence being not really gory with most of the kills being offscreen and the visuals not being challenging. Still I do have to say the acting throughout it was good and the story does leave the audience with a feel good moment even if the action is somewhat cheesy and silly. However it wasn't nothing worth putting as the first sequence in the film. I thought the story would makes more sense for it to be the climax as it allows the audience to leave with a somewhat cheering moment seeing how the other two stories have very obnoxious protagonists. Since the movie didn't do that the rest of the film really leaves a sour taste in the audience mouth. That brings us to 'the Raft' a story about a group of very unlikeable teenagers getting trapped on a floating raft when they discover a carnivorous mysterious blob that looks like an oil slick in the lake surrounding them. Unlike the first story I kinda dig this concept. It reminds me of the isolation horrors genre films like 2016's 'the Shallows' mixed with the style of 1990's 'Tremors'. Just wish it expanded the story not by exposing the origins of the creature but showing the madness of the characters slowly developing while being trapped on the raft like the source material. It really could been a strong environmental  psychological message if it wanted to. Still it not a big deal. The only problem with this sequence story I really had against it was how dumbdown  awful the characters were. Why would one of the character accept to grope another character during a tense moment while being trapped on the raft!? It makes no sense. Another problem with this sequence is the acting. Daniel Beer as Randy AKA Poncho is one of the worst actors I have ever witness in a horror movie. He really does destroy the tone of this sequence. I can't help laughing how bad his reactions were. Yet unlike 'Old Chief Wooden Head' I was not disappointing with the visuals here. While the creature look like a rainout trash bag. It still look somewhat scary. Also the oily deaths were very gruesome and the suspense was equally worth the punch. Even the ending was somewhat clever with the sign and the creature being able to go onto land was a lot better than the generic and clichs story ending we got with 'the Hitchhiker'. This story was by far the most bland of all of the three with the protagonist Annie Lansing Lois Chiles accidentally kills a hitchhiker with her car only to be haunted later by him on her way home. It was hardly scary. The only scary part of the sequence was seeing Stephen King cameo as a truck driver. It's very surreal to see seeing him here seeing how he would end up get run over in 1999 in similar fashion. It almost seem like he wrote his own prophecy of attempted demise with stories such as this and other novels like 1987's 'misery'  1983's 'Christine'. Sadly it was ruin by how silly  unrealistic the driving scenes were and how cheesy the one liners was being spoken. Sadly this sequence was lot more cartoony than the animation sequences featuring a kid fighting off bullies with giant Venus flytraps that were intermixed as prologue interlude  epilogue. Despite that at least the animation sequences were welldrawn. I just wish the postcredit scene wasn't there as it kinda ruins the illusion of the comic book movie with its preachy safe message about not blaming comic books for juvenile delinquency. I guess this was added after parents complain about the first movie being too violent and gory. It just didn't fit. Nevertheless 'Creepshow 2' just didn't performed as well as the first movie. There were far too little thrills and even fewer appeal to intelligence to be a great film. At least it was better than the unofficial sequel 'Creepshow 3' in 2006 which had no involvement from Stephen King or producer George Romero. That film was horrible. In the end while this movie might be below average. I still think it's worth checking out at least once. After all there is no business like show business.".

It was hardly scary. The only scary part of the sequence was seeing Stephen King cameo as a truck driver. It's very surreal to see seeing him here seeing how he would end up get run over in 1999 in similar fashion. It almost seem like he wrote his own prophecy of attempted demise with stories such as this and other novels like 1987's 'misery'  1983's 'Christine'. Sadly it was ruin by how silly  unrealistic the driving scenes were and how cheesy the one liners was being spoken. Sadly this sequence was lot more cartoony than the animation sequences featuring a kid fighting off bullies with giant Venus flytraps that were intermixed as prologue interlude  epilogue. Despite that at least the animation sequences were welldrawn. I just wish the postcredit scene wasn't there as it kinda ruins the illusion of the comic book movie with its preachy safe message about not blaming comic books for juvenile delinquency. I guess this was added after parents complain about the first movie being too violent and gory. It just didn't fit. Nevertheless 'Creepshow 2' just didn't performed as well as the first movie. There were far too little thrills and even fewer appeal to intelligence to be a great film. At least it was better than the unofficial sequel 'Creepshow 3' in 2006 which had no involvement from Stephen King or producer George Romero. That film was horrible. In the end while this movie might be below average. I still think it's worth checking out at least once. After all there is no business like show business.";

However Ben's nephew Sam Holt McCallany unexpectedly arrives with two other punks to steal Ray and he kills the elders. They expect to travel to Hollywood but the Old Chief Wood'nhead will not let them go.This segment is the best one with a heartbreaking and gore tale of justice and revenge.

They swim to a raft that is floating in the middle of the lake but they discover a carnivorous blob in the lake that is hungry.This segment is silly but the conclusion is very funny.

The sequel isn't as good as the 1982 original because it's made cheaper you can tell that by the cinematography and the film is shorter only three segments instead of five and star power is missing. Yet still the film thrills chills and brings justice and revenge style terror that any horror fan will cherish and consider a classic to watch over and over.First story is a good old western justice tale of revenge titled Old Chief WoodenHead which is set in a rural desert small Arizona town. And the theme centered around the town is it's dealing with hard times a bad socially depressed economy and George KennedyAirplane and Cool Hand Luke stars as a generous and do easy storekeeper who's too generous to customers by letting them have items on credit. And yet the only hope that he puts in return and what he lives for is a stature of a wooden Indian outside his store. One day he receives a gift of worthy stone from an Indian man named Ben Whitemoon who says this is payback for his people's debts. Only the episode turns to a violent and tragic end with the store getting robbed and destroyed by modern day punks in search of money so they can flee to Los Angeles to start a new life. After the tragic end it's payback time and justice Indian style with warpaint and all! Overall good segment that was well done and I love the justice and revenge it shows.Next tale is The Raft about a group of weed smoking and sex driven teens that being two males and two females who take a trip to a lake to do some supposed harmless swimming. Only the plans turn to a sinking river type nightmare. Upon entering the lake one by one they notice a slime like chemical spill or substance of some type that seems to travel and move around the lake fast and at ease. One by one each discover the blood sucking nightmare is a sinking reality. Watch as the segment ends it's slick and clever as a no swimming sign is shown hidden behind trees and brush! Last but not least a classic tale The Hitchhiker staring beauty queen Lois Chiles as Annie Lansing a wealthy and attractive and elegant woman who's living in upstate Maine and she's having her fun and entertainment from the services of a male escort. After getting up one night from her affair she finds she's gonna be late and she doesn't want to end up in divorce court! So while speeding back on the interstate when exited onto the I395 Maine ramp she hits a hitchhiker. And it shocks her now it's hit and run. And it's a reality nightmare that will not end as Annie finds this is a highway of terror! Just like in the horror film the villain never dies no matter how many times you kill them. Also look for Stephen King who has a small cameo as a truck driver in this one. Really a good way to end the film.Sure it lacks the star power and budget and length of the original yet the stories are entertaining fun and revenge filled enough for any horror buff to cherish as a classic especially due to the work of King and Romero and the geography settings for this film was nice.".

The original Creepshow was directed by George Romero and the script was authored by Stephen King so its perhaps no surprise that the only truly good great actually segment in this threepart film is the one based on a King story with a script authored by George Romero.In any event the first segment Old Chief Woodenhead is just plain stupid and arguably even a little offensive and I'm no PC monger to be sure. Its just kinda...unpleasant. It isn't scary and it isn't interesting. On a tenscale I give it a 3.The second segment The Raft is the only reason to see this movie frankly. The Raft is an AMAZING short story and this cinematic adaptation is really quite good. I give it a 9.The third segment which I believe is entitled The Hitchhiker or something very similar is OK. I mean it doesn't suck or anything but it feels VERY derivative of some 1960s episodes of The Twilight Zone and otherwise just isn't very memorable or original needless to say. Its...mediocre. I give it a 6 which is somewhat generous and enables me to average out the three ratings as a 6 overall for the film in its entirety.Really the only reason to see this is in order to view The Raft. If you're feeling bored what the Hell watch The Hitchhiker too.

	schema:headline " Creepy But Lacking The Quality Of The First";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd have to say one of the first mistakes of Creepshow 2 is that there are only 3 stories. What was Romero  King thinking? After being served up 5 wholesome stories in the first Creepshow I was excepting a lot more from the sequel. At least 5 or 6 stories would have been perfect. Of course this would have made the budget a little bigger and we can't have that now can we? In any case Creepshow 2 offers 3 stories named Old Chief Woodenhead The Hitchhiker  The Raft.  We start with Old Chief Woodenhead which centers around some punk Indian boys who rob a convenience store owner and kills him. What the boys aren't aware of is the wooden Indian statue outside the store. This thing comes to life to take revenge for the old man. The story is pretty lame. Yes this is fictional horror but this is ridiculous. There's nothing in the story that tells us WHY or HOW this statue comes to life. Did someone sprinkle pixie dust on it? Was it possessed by the old man? What gives?The second story which seems to be everyones favorite is The Raft.This was one of the creepiest tales I've ever seen. Even both versions of the Blob didn't creep me out as much. I think the key element that makes this story work in the music and sound effects. It's extremely creepy and keeps you senses on the edge as you wait to see what happens next. The story focuses on four teenagers who travel way way out to a secluded lake to take a swim onto a bolted raft. The story never says WHY they would travel this far just for a swim in this lake. Apparently is was a favorite place of choice at one time. In the opening scene you seen them driving along a deserted road so you know they aren't no where near any civilization. Once they get there they strip down to their swim suits and head out to the raft unaware of the black stringy oil slick that's moving slowing toward them. This thing is HUGE and I'm curious as to how deep the oil slick travels downward as we are only shown the top of the water. As you can guess this thing is alive and hungry. What happens next is pretty gruesome. Nuff said.The final story is called The Hitchhiker and it's about a prostitute that cheats on her boyfriend and then travels home but accidently hits a Hitchhiker on the way. Not wanting to stop because the boyfriend may find out she's been cheating or she may end up in jail for murder she flees the scene only to encounter the Hitchhiker again and again and again. This story is pretty gruesome as you watch her run the Hitchhiker over and over again. Each times she sees him again all the blood broken bones and disfigurement can be seen It's a bit funny at times as he continues to ask her for a ride every time she drives into him. The story isn't bad but it's nothing special either. The ending it pretty much what you would expect.Overall Creepshow 2 is a good rental. I'd say rent Creepshow  and Creepshow 2 but watch the second one first and then view the much better first one. Will there every be a Creepshow 3? At this point it doesn't look good. Steven King looks like a sick man these days and Romero is working on other projects. Maybe someone else will take the reigns and run with this one. We can only hope.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'd have to say one of the first mistakes of Creepshow 2 is that there are only 3 stories. What was Romero  King thinking? After being served up 5 wholesome stories in the first Creepshow I was excepting a lot more from the sequel. At least 5 or 6 stories would have been perfect. Of course this would have made the budget a little bigger and we can't have that now can we? In any case Creepshow 2 offers 3 stories named Old Chief Woodenhead The Hitchhiker  The Raft.  We start with Old Chief Woodenhead which centers around some punk Indian boys who rob a convenience store owner and kills him. What the boys aren't aware of is the wooden Indian statue outside the store. This thing comes to life to take revenge for the old man. The story is pretty lame. Yes this is fictional horror but this is ridiculous. There's nothing in the story that tells us WHY or HOW this statue comes to life. Did someone sprinkle pixie dust on it? Was it possessed by the old man? What gives?The second story which seems to be everyones favorite is The Raft.This was one of the creepiest tales I've ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "Three stories are featured this time two down from the original which might have been one too long. A cheap animated wraparound surrounds the stories and is a far cry from the original. 'Old Chief Wood'nhead' has an elderly couple Kennedy  Dorothy Lamour running a small town grocery store that is nearly bankrupt like the town. Outside the store is a lifesize wooden Indian statue that comes to life to seek revenge on a gang of idiots who kill the old couple. The second story is 'The Raft' that tells of four teenagers who swim out to a barge in the middle of a lake and get trapped on it because of a black ooze floating in the water. The ooze graphically swallows and devours the group one by one. The final story is 'The Hitchhiker' which features cheating wife Anne Lansing Chiles returning home one night where she runs over a derelict Wright in the road killing him. She panics and leaves the scene battling with her conscience. Soon the dead hitchhiker begins appearing on the road and then everywhere she looks. This terror filled ride home has the hitchhiker attempting revenge on Anne until the very end. The stories are from Stephen King again and George A. Romero wrote the screenplays but directing chores went to Michael Gornick Romero's cinematographer on the original and other Romero films. Gornick does a decent job but the stories just aren't as good this time around. Where the original could have lost a story this one could have added one. The three stories seem one shy of a full load. The cheap wraparound animation and simple sets make you wonder if there were budget issues because the production is surly lacking a big feel. The gore is decent and the stories are certainly watchable if not entirely compelling. As an anthology movie Creepshow 2 can hold its own but compared to the original it is a bit of a letdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 legendary director George Romero directed a horror anthology of short stories based on tales by Stephen King the result was Creepshow and it gave Romero another success among horror fans. Five years later both minds teamed up again with the difference that Romero limited his participation to adapt King's stories leaving the director's chair to fellow Michael Gornick.Creepshow 2 features three stories by Lucille Fletcher and Stephen King in a manner similar to its predecessor. While the result is inferior to the first one it still packs good entertainment and surely will please horror fans due to it's 80s vibe and imaginative stories. With the comic book style so characteristic of its predecessor Creepshow 2 keeps the tone of the previous movie and the host the aptly named Creep is as funny as creepy.The first segment deals with the ancient spirit of an Indian Chief looking for revenge. It has very good special effects but the story is quite typical. The subpar acting doesn't help but it is lovely the rusty old western look it has. A huge improvement is the second segment named The Raft which revolves around a group of friends trapped in a raft by a mysterious creature who lives in a lake. Suspense and horror are the main characteristics of this tale and it easily is the best of the three.However the third segment The Hitchhiker has quickly become a fan favorite due to it's imaginative and unpredictable nature. A woman runs over a hitchhiker in the middle of the night after she runs away from the accident she begins to loose her mind as the killed man seems to return to haunt her. While not as scary as The Raft this segment is very entertaining and really funny.Director Michael Gornick had mastered the genre with his TV series Tales from the Darkside so he was not a bad choice for this film and does the job very well. The three segments are very well constructed particularly the second one which despite being set in a limited space manage to keep the suspense and the tension to the max. The Raft is an amazing display of how the only thing needed for a good movie is imagination.The acting is quite average for the most part but I was really surprised by the cast of The Raft who put out truly believable performances that really transmit the horror of the tale. The special effects are quite good too specially in the last segment. Gerg Nicotero shows why he is now one of the most recognizable names in the makeup department and one of the founders of KNB. His work in the movie is remarkably good.While definitely not a great movie Creepshow 2 is a very entertaining flick that is great to watch with friends. Despite its comic book style it's not a horror movie for kids as it contains a good amount of gore. This is a fine collection of stories that any horror fan would enjoy. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Creepshow 2 is an outstanding horror film. I seen this on Pay Per View when I was either 8 or 9 years old. It is an anthology film with three short stories. The first tale Old Chief Woodenhead is about three trouble makers that commit a horrible crime against a store owner and his wife then pay the price for it from a wooden Indian. This story gave me several nightmares and I even imagined seeing the wooden Indian while I was awake. So for me this was the scariest story of the bunch. The second story The Raft centers around four teenagers who drive out to a lake in the country only to discover that they are NOT alone. Their companion wants to make a meal of them and they must survive its wrath. The third and last segment The Hitchhiker is about a woman who cheats on her husband by sleeping with some guy to get higher up in the work field maybe her boss? I can't remember. She is in bed with him and she is late for work so she drives to work and THIS is where the horror begins She accidentally hits a man who was hitching a ride. Soon after this you will see a guest appearance by Stephen King. Be sure to look out for this. Not only is the woman all shooken up with killing a man not only does she worry about not getting arrested for it but the hitchhiker WILL NOT STAY DOWN. Furthermore he delivers sarcasm with probably the only line quoted from the movie THANKS FOR THE RIDE LADY! as if to say Thanks for the ride lady! Gee all I wanted was a simple ride and you kill me!. The overall movie is wrapped around by a story involving Billy a boy wants the new Creepshow comic very much. He buys Venus Fly Trap seeds which come in handy for the bullies that keep following him around.  Definitely check out this movie. I strongly recommend you buy it. Its a MUST OWN. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved George Romero's CREEPSHOW. I was a fan from the first moment I laid eyes on the trailer. When it was released I was working as a theater manager showing the film and I would pop in to watch moments from the film when time provided. To this day I consider it a classic. Had it not been for the success of the film we might never have seen anthology shows like TALES FROM THE CRYPT MONSTER or Romero's own TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE come about. When I heard back then that CREEPSHOW 2 was being made I was ecstatic. The end result left much to be desired though.Once more we're presented with tales to frighten straight from the comic book pages of Creepshow a homage to the horror fueled comics of the fifties. A wrap around story involving a young boy who loves the comic and is tormented by bullies keeps the film moving. Add to that the Creep in the film this time portrayed by effects artists Tom Savini rather than an animated dummy.The first story has us in a small town out west gasping its last dying breath. General store owners Ray and Martha Spruce George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour provide a helping hand to those in need in the way of store credit even though they could easily retire and live comfortable on their own. When a criminal Indian from the nearby reservation and his gang rob the store killing the pair it seems justice will not be served. But then they never counted on the wooden Indian standing out front.The second story is perhaps the best here based on Stephen King's novella THE RAFT. Two young couples are headed out to the local lake with the intent of swimming out one last time to the floating raft in the middle despite the chilly temps of the water. Fueled by beer and false bravado they swim out completely ignorant of the large patch of something floating on top of the water. That is until they see it engulf a bird floating on top. When one of the girls is taken from the raft and eaten by this glob a standoff follows. The only way to get help is for one of them to reach the shore. But how will they avoid the creature? The final story here is about a woman having an affair who plows down a hitchhiker on her way home. If she reports it or takes the man to the hospital she'll have to explain why she was driving where the accident occurred. Rather than do so she drives off hoping someone else will find him. Except that he continues to pop up more battered and bloody with each appearance always saying Thanks for the ride lady. Will she ever be free of this damaged image? The film ends with an animated piece featuring the aforementioned story of the young boy pursued by bullies on his bicycle. So how does the film hold up? It doesn't come close to the original. That could be in large part because the film went from a high profile studio like Warner Brothers to the low budget line New Horizons Roger Corman's company. It could be because Romero was no longer directing or that King and Romero weren't on set daily to discuss the script they had written. In any case while a decent movie it placed side by side with the original leaves it lacking.And yet there is a legion of fans out there who love this one as well. For them the news that the film was being released on bluray by Arrow Video was a Godsend. Now they could have it in a pristine format to enjoy over and over again. And being an Arrow release you knew that the extras would be better than most and that the version offered would indeed be the best ever found. The film is presented here in a 2k digital restoration with original stereo audio. Other extras include audio commentary from director Michael Gornick moderated by Perry Martin a new interview with Daniel Beer a new interview with Tom Wright and interview with Romero and interview with Savini a featurette with makeup effects artists Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero a featurette on Rick Baker behind the scenes footage trailers and TV spots and a reversible sleeve featuring newly commissioned artwork by Mike Saputo.Fans have already been buying this one up like crazy with special editions that include a collector's booklet fetching top dollar. I'm glad that this version now exists but I doubt I'll watch it over and over again. It is worth watching once and fans will delight that they can have this version on their shelves now.".

	schema:reviewBody "STEPHEN KING  GEORGE ROMERO  CREEPSHOW 2  1987 The film was even funnier because they had mixed up the audios ON THE DVD and they have Castilian twice and French once but no English. At least I could not find it. So I watched it in Castilian with English subtitles. I must say the language then gives a density to the Monstrous Creep that is really striking in all meanings of the word. There is nothing new of course in these stories that we have read probably several times. The three stories are definitely amazing. The first one Old Chief Wood'nhead seems to imply there is among the older Indian generation some decency that the younger generation cannot understand nor respect but the ghosts of the dead can come back to bring justice though a death for a death is not giving life back to the victims of the greed of the younger generation that is going to Hollywood as is well known. They have always dreamed of meeting John Wayne on one of his Indian killing spree. At least they had the intention to go.The second story the Raft is once again about young people two couples who decide to go wild on marijuana and on some forlorn and forgotten paths where signs are overgrown with shrubs and trees and are no longer visible. Vain they are and uninformed they remain and they dare do what is advised not to do on the sign they haven't seen. They end up eaten up by some aquatic monster. Yam! Yam! Says the monster. It only takes one overexcited young man to lead the four of them into the water and to their death. Young people have always been what they used to be and what they will be. Boys will be boys and girls the same.The third story The Hitchhiker is a phenomenally funny story more than frightening. A white rich lady on her way back from an afternoon with a gigolo by the way rather cheap gets berserk at the idea that she will be discovered by her husband because he said he was going to arrive home at 11.30 and she can't make it by that time. Find an explanation if you can. She thus has a problem with a black hitchhiker she turned into a ghost and the ghost haunts her all the way and at the end finally gets even with her. The details are absolutely appetizing. You will be ready for a second helping after licking your fingers clean of the blood of the dead man. Don't forget crime and horror are like pizza the second slice is always better than the first.Enjoy your petits fours and canaps and wash them down with some Bloody Mary.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "Creepshow 2 in the tradition of its predecessor frames a series of shorts as a part of a horror comic book. This offering features three stories one about a wooden Native American statue that comes to life another about a mysterious entity devouring swimmers in a lake and the last about a woman stalked by a hitchhiker she's killed on a lone country road.The original Creepshow was a part of my childhood and a semiclassic of the genre. This followup historically seems to have gotten short shrift in some regards though it's far from a great film and in many ways is an obviously weaker production. The writing of the segments themselves feel less developed and considerably more gimmicky and they are marred by some weak dialogue this is particularly true of the last two. That said each of the three segments do attain a considerable sense of atmosphere that is admirable the first has a wellestablished dusty desert setting the second utilizes an ominous lake to claustrophobic extremes and the last plays on the utter creepiness of driving alone in the country at night. The special effects are also a strong suit here which though dated in some respects are still very elaborate and welldone. The performances are a mixed bunch given the size of the cast ranging from good to very bad but in context the acting is not a major problem.Overall Creepshow 2 is a fun but flawed sequel. Where it fails most is in its individual segments which though they have welldeveloped atmospheres and aesthetics feel conceptually underdeveloped and gimmicky at times. It is not a bad sequel but it does feel considerably less toned than its predecessor however even in spite of this there is undeniable fun to be had. 610.".

OLD CHIEF WOOD'N'HEAD sets up some likable characters and suddenly introduces some unlikable young punks who seem to embody all the 7 deadly sins with their leader caught up in vanity. The Chief sorts them out. THE RAFT has a school jock and nerd going to a lake and getting stoned. There are of course 2 chicks with them. It has possibly the cheapest SFX by way of a black floating blob resembling a garbage bag floating on a lake that eats its prey in mere seconds. Through clever tension it is somehow terrifying and our 4 characters don't have many options as it surrounds their small raft. THE HITCHHIKER is interesting as our main female character talks to herself through this entire story. A necessity of letting us in on her internal dialogue. This woman is cheating on her guy and obviously self absorbed but soon becomes the victim of a relentless hitchhiker that just will not die. Intense music drives this story through the best parts. All up as our hitchhiker says best Thanks for the ride lady!".

	schema:reviewBody "Visage is one of those movies that it's hard to parallel. Some films that particular scenes reminded me of were Matthew Barney's Cremaster 5 Peter Kennedy's Flux Film 37 and Godard's Pierrot Le Fou but Tsai's style really seems to sit away from what everyone else is doing.Visage follows the production of a film maudit directed by Kang a Taiwanese director who has come to Paris. It's definitely a film of fragments the story is hard to follow because it's clear that quite a lot of it occurs between scenes even within scenes action often occurs offshot. As a viewer I felt like an interloper because the camera is often tight in a corner or outside of the room where action occurs. It's as if Tsai wants to shun the viewer to emphasise the distance between a viewervoyeur's comprehension and what is taking place.

	onyx:emotionText "Visage is one of those movies that it's hard to parallel. Some films that particular scenes reminded me of were Matthew Barney's Cremaster 5 Peter Kennedy's Flux Film 37 and Godard's Pierrot Le Fou but Tsai's style really seems to sit away from what everyone else is doing.Visage follows the production of a film maudit directed by Kang a Taiwanese director who has come to Paris. It's definitely a film of fragments the story is hard to follow because it's clear that quite a lot of it occurs between scenes even within scenes action often occurs offshot. As a viewer I felt like an interloper because the camera is often tight in a corner or outside of the room where action occurs. It's as if Tsai wants to shun the viewer to emphasise the distance between a viewervoyeur's comprehension and what is taking place.

	schema:reviewBody "Famed Taiwanese auteur Mingliang Tsai ventures into France to deliver a love poem to the works of Truffaut in the form of an opaque slow flowing visual poem devoid of a conventional story instead harbouring its message of collages of images. The slight frame of the script focuses on the filming of a movie by a foreign director Kangsheng Lee arguably the most proclaimed participant of a quasiplot. Intertwining with him are the cast and crew of the movie with Truffaut's favourite actor Jean Pierre Laud as the lead man Fanny Ardent as the film's producer and Laetitia Casta as the costar.Visage however detaches itself from indulging into a flowing story to tell instead building the entire movie around carefully designed set pieces with jump from image to image. The camera is mostly static peering in from the outside on the actions of the cast as if eavesdropping and voyeuristically capturing the moment. However whatever happens outside these moments is irrelevant forcing the viewer to arduously fill in the dots a task that in the movies taxing runtime may prove too strenuous for most viewers even to the cinephile crowd so in love with the odd and unexpected. The movies is constructed from these captured moving images slow shots with little to no dialogue with moments of musical outbursts when characters lipsync to various songs. Several moments have you especially captivated the highlight being in the beginning sequences when a static camera peers into the director's kitchen and observes his futile attempts to clog a drain finally resigning to the inevitable and resting at his mother's bedside in an awkward quasiincestuous scene. These wackier offbeat scenes manage to liven up the otherwise laborious proceedings but the movie shifts focus slowly to more darker imagery with a sexual culmination in a abattoir as eerily disgusting as it was distasteful. Each such scene of this fragmented movie lasts several minutes thus utterly deflating a casual viewer and even leaving the more auteur crowd grasping at straws to admire. The imagery is at times starkly captivating with certain moments fully worth the watch from a purely aesthetic point of view. Nonetheless the visual side in itself fails to engulf for vast periods of time instead capturing imagination onandoff.The entire movie is also unfortunately a black box which requires all the appropriate background input to deliver any type of understanding to the ongoings. The type of movie where any selfrespecting film critic would never dare say that he failed to understand the references and symbolism thus giving him an intellectual ordeal to paste together the scenes. Thankfully the long scenes offer apt possibilities to contemplate each passing portrait given you don't nod off in the midst. Personally I felt lost in translation even if vast elements struck a cord the overall message remained an enigma not helped by my attention constantly dropping inandout of the movie. As such I can fully understand certain auteurs finding the viewing a hardworked pleasure but overall I hold the firm belief that whereas movies should be challenging they should also not require the audience to strain to just keep awake during the watch. As a medium it needs to be engaging not a painful chore pure artistry and intellectual proficiency is not enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes an image can get you excited to see a film. When looking to fill a hole in a five film day at TIFF my friend and I saw an image that looked both fantastical and intriguing so much so that we blindly said yes we are going to watch Visage. I'm the first person to say that a movie can be loved for visual style alone as I always hold the image as more powerful than the word. Oftentimes I can be distracted by a great composition or frame to the point where I'll give it a pass on the actual plot being driven forward by the imagery. Film is a visceral medium and those artists that realize this fact able to adapt a book or story to be cinematic and not just a rehash of words are usually those I enjoy most. I thought that Mingliang Tsai might become one of these auteurs but while most of the film is stunning to behold I could never get around the laborious runtime or the virtual lack of any story. Supposedly it's about a film crew shooting the Salom myth at the Louvre however until the very end I didn't even know they were at the gallery nor did I know a linear story was occurring. I just thought it was vignette after vignette of grandeur with the cast members being the only constant.Yes there are definite characters throughout Fanny Ardent as the film's producer JeanPierre Laud as the leading man Laetitia Casta as the leading lady and Kangsheng Lee as the director I did know a film was going on just not that it was necessarily a plot point. The beginning started quite nicely actually a static shot of a coffee shop table through a window the conversations of the table offscreen heard musings about a film thrown about. It's a pretty shot that sets the stage for more static camera setups pointing straight and catching the action in front of it. The next sequence has the camera high up in a kitchen filming the sink below. The faucet breaks when turned on and we are treated to about ten to twenty minutes of water being sprayed about alternately contained and made worse with buckets and broken pipes underneath. Definitely a chore to sit through the end result is quite gorgeousa view of the hallway full of water and a fish tank in the foreground juxtaposing the contained water and the liquid running free. But then it all becomes strange again as the culprit of the sink fiasco goes in what I assume is his mother's room putting his hand on her stomach before she takes it and pushes it lower. What happened there I have no idea.So the general idea becomes apparent as odd things occur. For every scene of artistic splendor a view outside a skyscraper watching Ardent through a window covered in reflection at left while the right half of the screen shows cars speeding by on a highway an extended sequence in pitch black darkness illuminated by a single lighter played with by Casta and an unknown man that was in her bathtub there is one that is just a chore to watch Casta blacking out a huge window with tape going around the edges over and over again until covering it up to the center Alister Mathieu Amalric showing up for a random scene in the woods silently engaging in some sort of sexual activity with Lee's director. I really think that you could cull hundreds of still frames for a successful art exhibit unfortunately when you put them together in motion the viewing experience can be painful.Even as an art film which it indeed is success is limited. I would compare it to Matthew Barney's Cremaster series only less outrageous. Whereas that one's laborious shoot intrigues due to the fact that its inhabitants are in grotesque costume or engaging in otherworldly activities begging you to wonder what's going on Visage is too close to a real film making me linger on the question of whether I should be following it normally rather than letting it envelope me. I loved some sequences including the cigarette lighter illumination a couple fun song numbers that are obviously lipsynched to and a final erotic scene maybe? with three women gyrating and disrobing in front of a man lying in a bathtub covered with tomato paste inside a meat locker. One can't forget it as the women look anything but sexy while in that location and the sound of meat hooks and chains clanging makes the whole thing rather jarring. And how can you not be oddly intrigued by the strand of saliva connecting the bathtub man's lips with the main woman's after a kiss stretching further and further out until finally dissolving? Yet even those moments couldn't detract from the others that only found themselves leaving me shaking my head.The characters all play themselves or at least an embodiment of themselves Laud's role is called Antoine after the famous Truffaut series he starred in many years ago. It's an interesting fact that may or may not hold any real relevance to the proceedings. When you have Laud and the director talking about renowned filmmakers and how a little bird Titi embodies them all or the lengthy attempt of Casta going up a ladder in full heavy wardrobe you just start wondering when it will finally be over. I won't say it's without some merit but I also can't recommend it to anyone except an art class looking for inspiration. In that case the class can fastforward and rewind not worrying about the narrative weakly holding it all together but instead focus on the visual construction watching for single frames that have the potential to enrapture attention. It's the only way to get something from what's on the screen.".

	schema:headline " Compassionate declaration of love to women and cinema...";
	schema:reviewBody "French screenwriter and director Bertrand Bonello's fifth feature film which he also wrote scored and coproduced with Kristina Larsen is a French production. It tells the story of numerous prostitutes living and working at a Parisian brothel run by Madame MarieFrance near the end of the 19th century. Most of the women who lives at the mansion get along fine with their customers and one of them is evolving a relationship with a regular customer. Clotilde known as the Jewess shares her dreams with this man and one night after having been away for two weeks he returns to the house of tolerance. Clotilde tells the man of a dream she has had about him and plays along to fulfill his desires but during the session he cut's her with a knife. Following the horrific incident Clotilde is left with a disfigured face loses many of her customers and is given the name the woman who laughs. Subtly and acutely directed by Bertrand Bonello this visually distinct interior period drama which is narrated from the point of view of the prostitutes draws a detailed involving and intimate portrayal of their ritualistic lives at a brothel during the twilight and the dawn of the 20th century in Paris France. With a stringent narrative structure and while depicting several minor studies of character this finely paced somewhat surreal and historic study of prostitution presents a closed world marked by socializing boredom decadence sadness and fantasies where the women shares their experiences with each other and creates a reverent depiction of their strong and private unification. Notable for its brilliant set decoration by Alain Guffroy costume design by Anas Romand and the picturesque cinematography by Jose Deshaies this is a lowkeyed melancholic symbolic darkly romantic and dreamlike tale of a descending utopia. The efficient score by Bertrand Bonello emphasizes the mysterious and poignant atmosphere in this grotesque tangible and fictional chamber piece which is impelled and reinforced by the understated acting performances from a cast consisting of both professional and nonprofessional actors and actresses such as French actress Hafsia Herzi French actress Cline Sallette Italian actress Jasmine Trinca French actress Adle Haenel French actress Esther Garrel French actress screenwriter and director Nomie Lvovsky French actor screenwriter and director Xavier Beauvois and Alice Barnole and Iliana Zabeth in their debut feature film roles. A compassionate declaration of love to women and cinema which was screened in competition at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in 2011 and which gained the Csar Award for Best Costume Design Anas Romand at the 37th Csar Awards in 2012.".

	onyx:emotionText "French screenwriter and director Bertrand Bonello's fifth feature film which he also wrote scored and coproduced with Kristina Larsen is a French production. It tells the story of numerous prostitutes living and working at a Parisian brothel run by Madame MarieFrance near the end of the 19th century. Most of the women who lives at the mansion get along fine with their customers and one of them is evolving a relationship with a regular customer. Clotilde known as the Jewess shares her dreams with this man and one night after having been away for two weeks he returns to the house of tolerance. Clotilde tells the man of a dream she has had about him and plays along to fulfill his desires but during the session he cut's her with a knife. Following the horrific incident Clotilde is left with a disfigured face loses many of her customers and is given the name the woman who laughs. Subtly and acutely directed by Bertrand Bonello this visually distinct interior period drama which is narrated from the point of view of the prostitutes draws a detailed involving and intimate portrayal of their ritualistic lives at a brothel during the twilight and the dawn of the 20th century in Paris France. With a stringent narrative structure and while depicting several minor studies of character this finely paced somewhat surreal and historic study of prostitution presents a closed world marked by socializing boredom decadence sadness and fantasies where the women shares their experiences with each other and creates a reverent depiction of their strong and private unification. Notable for its brilliant set decoration by Alain Guffroy costume design by Anas Romand and the picturesque cinematography by Jose Deshaies this is a lowkeyed melancholic symbolic darkly romantic and dreamlike tale of a descending utopia. The efficient score by Bertrand Bonello emphasizes the mysterious and poignant atmosphere in this grotesque tangible and fictional chamber piece which is impelled and reinforced by the understated acting performances from a cast consisting of both professional and nonprofessional actors and actresses such as French actress Hafsia Herzi French actress Cline Sallette Italian actress Jasmine Trinca French actress Adle Haenel French actress Esther Garrel French actress screenwriter and director Nomie Lvovsky French actor screenwriter and director Xavier Beauvois and Alice Barnole and Iliana Zabeth in their debut feature film roles. A compassionate declaration of love to women and cinema which was screened in competition at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in 2011 and which gained the Csar Award for Best Costume Design Anas Romand at the 37th Csar Awards in 2012.";

The fact that some of the reviewers complain that the film doesn't contextualize the story enough only speaks to our general lack of education about history or the world beyond our own ipods and pads. Only in the 20th century do most women begin to achieve rights and freedoms and at great cost. And that century is only beginning at the end of this film. For that matter the film's endingin contemporary Paris at the historic site of the brothelimplies that those rights and freedoms are easily erased for some.For those who want more action slashing someone's face is apparently not enough this film will disappoint. For anyone who is interested in the history of the era and this aspect of Parisian and European life it's a must see. All the slow scenes in the brothel with gentlemen clients and prostitutes are framed during the same period as the Dreyfus case the beginning of the decline of French power and prestige. This film shows the darker side of much that is revealed in Proust's work which is after all rather dark itself. It is definitely a disturbing film but worth seeing.The women actors works wonderfully together and the production values are impressive.".

	schema:headline " Soso picture of life in a Paris brothel c. 1900";
	schema:reviewBody "House of Tolerance opens with a scene that typifies the film. A gentlemanly client of L'Appollonide the fictional Paris brothel of the 1890s where the film is set declines sex with the exotic and likable Madeleine but requests she instead describe one of her dreams. After she recounts a fantasy of sex with a masked man that ends with her weeping tears of semen he politely asks permission to tie her to the bed. One she's helpless he slashes both her cheeks with a knifeleaving her with a permanently disfiguring grin.In a reallife Paris bordello like Le Chabanais the establishment that inspired L'Appollonide Madeleine would have been turned out. Instead the other prostitutes and its kindly madame hearts of gold all rally to protect her. She becomes the house's cook minds the children and even as The Woman who Laughs continues to attract jaded aesthetes excited by deformity. In one of the film's more Sadeian scenes she stars at an orgy involving aging aristocrats a staff of female servants all nude and a sullen blackgowned dwarf. We see one of the obligatory fortnightly health checks required by the police and the system of paying the women clients buy tokens which the women cash in at the end of the night. Such realism clashes with a Viscontiesque sumptuousness in costumes and decor. The house itself is palatial compared to Le Chabanais or any real brothel and the women more attractive than the habitus of even the most elegant establishment.The film often feels like an anthology shuffling together episodes and individuals associated with the brothel culture and not bothering too much about anachronisms. An idyllic country picnic and skinnydip for the girls evokes the most humanizing of whorehouse stories Maupassant's Le Maison Tellier. A client called only Gustave and content to spend his time in the brothel staring raptly at vaginas suggests Gustave Courbet who painted The Origin of the World a meticulous but faceless depiction of female pudenda. Courbet howeverdied in 1877 well before the period of the film. Bonello is closer to his time period when he shows a girl being bathed in champagne. The thenPrince of Wales Victoria's son and later Edward VII liked to sit around such a bath at Le Chabanais and share the wine with friends. Wine water and secretions mix promiscuously in the film. In an early scene whores and clients share champagne from a gilded chamber pot of what should be Sevres porcelain but resembles anodized aluminum. Meanwhile the girls play a table game using the squirt bulbs normally employed to flush their vaginas. Repeatedly we see women rinsing their mouths after oral sex and washing the sticky residue of wine from their bodies. One woman observes bitterly this place stinks of champagne and sperm. Bonello is at pains to insist on the moral and emotional superiority of the prostitutes over their sentimental selfabsorbed clients  something even the men concede. As one ruefully confesses men have secrets but no mystery. Even Gustave the most compassionate of the regulars sees the women as objects. The complaisant Pauline dresses up for him first in a Japanese kimono then as a blankeyed jerkily moving doll. In a scene reminiscent of Donald Sutherland coupling with a clockwork woman in Fellini Casanova her impersonation of a machine excites Gustave in a way flesh and blood never did. As he penetrates her from behind she stares expressionless at us the audience as if to ask How like you me now my masters? Returning repeatedly to the mutilation of Madeleine adding more graphic detail each time Bonello makes us complicit in her pain. Her endurance and acceptance like that of all the prostitutes is transcendental and appears a kind of martyrdom  an offering to the Apollo for which the house is named. The girl dead of syphilis the opium addict and finally all the women dumped on the streets when the brothel closes down have suffered and died for our sins. The last shot of the film drives home the point. Beside a modern highway the same girls who staffed the L'Appollonide now in miniskirts and hot pants continue to offer sex and salvation to an indifferent male world.".

	schema:reviewBody "No matter the titillating title writerdirector Bertrand Bonello's 'House of Pleasures' doesn't hope to pleasure its audience by pandering to their baser instincts through a flesh parade of its predominantly female cast. Instead Bonello mounts a sombre look at the daily lives and routines of the prostitutes within the walls of the Appolonide an upmarket Paris brothel for middleclass men at the turn of the 19th century. The pace is slow and languid consider this fair warning for less patient viewers but if you allow it the movie will reel you in with its hypnotic charm and leave you wondering about the people behind the world's oldest profession.Filmed with a deliberate dispassion throughout Bonello flits from one character to another never making one the central figure in the movie. Among those we get to recognise are Clotilde Celine Sallette a twelveyear veteran of the trade at just 28 years old who has recently grown increasingly disillusioned and dependent on opium Pauline Iliana Zabeth the youngest at just 16 who enters the trade in a misguided attempt at asserting her own independence and the middleaged Madam Nomie Lvovsky who runs the house faced with foreclosure due to rising rent prices.Yes Appolonide is far from a cocoon for the girls and Bonello places two stark characters as a sobering reminder of that the first in the form of a cheerful girl Julie Jasmine Trinca who discovers one day during a routine medical examination that she has syphilis and the second in Madeleine Alice Barnole who is permanently disfigured when a client Laurent Lacotte she dreams of having a future with ties her to the bed and slashes her from both corners of the mouth. Madeleine is the most blatant Bonello gets at eliciting his audience's empathy for these women and certainly it's hard not to be moved when she is nicknamed 'The Woman Who Laughs' and becomes no more than an object of fascination for others to gawk at.Notwithstanding Madeleine's misfortune there is little to cheer about for any of the other girls trapped with little hope of escaping their circumstance. Though visited by regulars with sweet words and buoyant promises there is little illusion that none of these men are serious about their affections for the ladies they frequent using them as mere vessels to act out their fantasies one girl is made to act like a mechanical doll while another is dressed in a kimono and asked to speak Japanese even though she knows not the language. We know better than to believe their lies and empty promises but who can blame some of the ladies for being optimistic what else after all do they have to live for?Setting most of the film within the four walls of the Appolonide and emphasising the day in and day our rituals of the women within adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie which of course reinforces the cheerless nature of their situation there is also a reference to the conventional wisdom of the day which equates their status to that of criminals by virtue of the size of their heads. The rare scene where the girls have the most fun is a daytime excursion they take to the countryside which unsurprisingly shows them at their most lively and vivacious.And indeed there is very little to cheer or find pleasure in despite the movie's title once one has observed the lives of these women in the Appolonide. The film is also purposefully set at the twilight of the industry in that form and from time to time Bonello hints at the imminent passing of a Parisian cultural icon. His parting shot is that of modernday Paris where prostitutes are standing by the street waiting for some random guy in a car to pick them up. Has society progressed in the past century? As long as there remain women who are stuck in the circumstance as those in the Appolonide the answer quite honestly is a sobering no. www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:headline " Poetic unique sad and haunting film";
	schema:reviewBody "This takes place in a Paris brothel just before and just after the start of the 20th century. While there is a lot of nudity and sex the film is almost always antierotic as it is so clear that the women are less than enthusiastic participants. Interestingly I found the only moments with any erotic charge were moments between the women themselves who support each other in what amounts to indentured servitude. Occasionally we feel the heat of human connection between them in a look a touch and that is far more sensual than anything they share with their clients which is often degrading and occasionally violent. The film is a look at the trap poor women found themselves in when being a prostitute was one of the only ways to make your own money and other professions had just as many drawbacks one woman speaks of giving up being a washerwoman because her lungs were becoming damaged from breathing ammonia all day. But the irony is the 'expenses' of being a well kept prostitute from room and board to perfume are more than the women can take in so they inevitably fall deeper and deeper into debt. Like sharecroppers they soon 'owe their soul to the company store'. This isn't a naturalistic film in the usual sense. It jumps around in time  something we sometimes only realize because we'll see a moment we'd watched earlier happen a second time but in this case from a new perspective or in a new context. It's 'slow' by our usual standards and is less about plot than about captured moments that build to something larger. It also uses anachronistic modern music to great effect. But for all it's intentional artifice there is a feeling of an honest sort of hyperreality here. In the same way a poem can capture the feeling of a sunny day better than a lot of scientific explanation so too does this poetic film capture a complex and sad world in a way that lets you feel a sense of understanding and empathy more than straight forward naturalism might. The filmmaking itself is of a very high order. The cinematography and acting are both first rate and there is a sequence near the end that combined acting images and music to give me chills in the rare way sequences by great filmmakers can sometimes do.

	onyx:emotionText "This takes place in a Paris brothel just before and just after the start of the 20th century. While there is a lot of nudity and sex the film is almost always antierotic as it is so clear that the women are less than enthusiastic participants. Interestingly I found the only moments with any erotic charge were moments between the women themselves who support each other in what amounts to indentured servitude. Occasionally we feel the heat of human connection between them in a look a touch and that is far more sensual than anything they share with their clients which is often degrading and occasionally violent. The film is a look at the trap poor women found themselves in when being a prostitute was one of the only ways to make your own money and other professions had just as many drawbacks one woman speaks of giving up being a washerwoman because her lungs were becoming damaged from breathing ammonia all day. But the irony is the 'expenses' of being a well kept prostitute from room and board to perfume are more than the women can take in so they inevitably fall deeper and deeper into debt. Like sharecroppers they soon 'owe their soul to the company store'. This isn't a naturalistic film in the usual sense. It jumps around in time  something we sometimes only realize because we'll see a moment we'd watched earlier happen a second time but in this case from a new perspective or in a new context. It's 'slow' by our usual standards and is less about plot than about captured moments that build to something larger. It also uses anachronistic modern music to great effect. But for all it's intentional artifice there is a feeling of an honest sort of hyperreality here. In the same way a poem can capture the feeling of a sunny day better than a lot of scientific explanation so too does this poetic film capture a complex and sad world in a way that lets you feel a sense of understanding and empathy more than straight forward naturalism might. The filmmaking itself is of a very high order. The cinematography and acting are both first rate and there is a sequence near the end that combined acting images and music to give me chills in the rare way sequences by great filmmakers can sometimes do. Not every choice works but this is a bold challenging and emotional film. It doesn't tell you what to think it just creates a world invites you inside and allows you to draw your own conclusions. I suspect I will get even more from it on a second viewing.";

It's a hypnotic film of this upper class french brothel in the last months 0f 1899. Some of our beauties are being sold to other brothels others are leaving the business where the remaining are facing a far worse fate when health checks come into play nearing the film's final. The last scene is kind of a teaser showing what brothels are like today. The acting is bloody impressive from all it's lavish sets and wardrobe adds to it's tasty viewing. We even have a sixteen year old starting a virgin one of her first double minded about going with her. He finally does here she ends up losing it in a champagne bath later washing all the icky ailment off. This lass's interview with the madam that has her stripping off totally then letting her hair loose is very hot indeed. We do too have that one dangerous customer it's always the quiet ones who leaves a scarring impression on one of the prostitutes by slitting the corners of her mouth open where she now wears a joker kind of smile 247 and has now resorted to mainly working as a housemaid. Some of the client's requests are as you can guess out of the ordinary one girl pretending to be a robotic doll where a handsome young french man comes up behind her lifts up her dress and you know. At the the start of this somewhat bizarre scene's where he's lying down staring across at her if transfixed somewhat playing the role too is an unforgettable image. The dialogue in subtitle is smart and original. A truly hypnotic movie experience this is one those films that comes along every so often a rare gem a rare treat to the naked eyes. Highly recommended especially for lovers of foreign erotica.".

It's French L'Apollonide with English subtitles.Having researched heavily on this subject for one of my own works I found it to be an eyeopening film. It's an intimate look behind the closed doors of a house of pleasure focusing on the lives of its mistress prostitutes and patrons.It covers such aspects as registering as prostitutes with the Bureau of Morales being indebted to mistresses and unable to leave their employ because of it champagne baths with customers selection parlors global fashions worn by prostitutes opulent client bedrooms and the regulated visits by the physician examining the workers every 15 days for sign of sexually transmitted disease.The movie contains naked women sexually explicit scenes and is not for the prudish or faint of heart. There are scenes of abuse of one of the girls which may be disturbing to viewers. It delves honestly into the reality of life as a French prostitute focusing on the sad and hopeless plight of women in brothels. The particular establishment depicted in this movie catered to aristocrats and rich businessmen much like the Chabanais which was one of the wellknown brothels of its day.The movie is two hours slow moving and not the best flick you'll ever see. Most of the sexual scenes show the men enjoying their paid visits while the women merely go through the motions void of emotion. As troubling as the scenes were I found myself transported into the world I researched and came away shocked at seeing the reality portrayed on screen.Let's face it being a prostitute wasn't glamorous. It was a profession that many poor and unskilled women chose in order to survive. It was a dangerous job where women died of syphilis lived lives with no hope and sold their bodies in order to eat and have housing. It portrayed a society that found pleasure in sex living a way of life where brothels were an acceptable form of male entertainment until they were abolished in the early 20th century.If historical films interest you on all levels I can attest that this one hits the mark in every way. Being a French film it adequately portrays the heyday of legalized prostitution.".

All the womengirls just seemed generally so 'nice' spiritually pure and wellintentioned. The sense of community was idealized and aestheticized to the point where some important more nuanced aspects of reality were lost.The ending was also kind of odd. The girls in the house were highclass courtesans with a mostly affluent customer base. Wasn't that a point Bonello was trying to make? And yet in the end they were paralleled with modernday streetwalkers. It's not like street prostitutes didn't exist back in the day either but the house girls were different. They're highly trained from a young age  not to fulfill just men's physical needs but mental and emotional ones as well. Highroller escorts exist today too and if anything they would probably be more like them today than streetwalkers. It's strange Bonello in the closing scenes decided to upend what he just spent the last 2 hours describing.I think these are two significant flaws of the work.The good The Woman Who Laughs was no doubt the 'center' of the film that was trying very hard to be 'centerless' Flowers of Shanghaiish. Which was not necessarily a bad thing as I found her story to be very interesting and moving. Especially in the scene toward the end when she cried the 'tears of sperm'  extremely imaginative poignant and profound  and reminded me why I started to watch Bonello's films in the first place after watching Tiresia. I think that moment alone is worth the admission.Tiresia was nearly flawless throughout and worked as a whole. I didn't really like The Pornographer or On War. Was it just a fluke a flash of genius? Bonello is still a young director with only a few full features under his belt so I would like to wait and see what else he can do.".

This makes the movie even more misogynist and boring although it is difficult to understand to which audience it was targeted.

	schema:reviewBody "If you absolutely have got to know what life might have been like for prostitutes in Paris during the early 1900s then you've got to see this. For everyone else there's nothing here to see.L'Apollonide is a classy palatial bordello. The prostitutes live and work there. They are under the soft yoke of the madam who sells them everything they need for a hefty price such that they are forever indebted to her and for some reason can't leave. We learn all the boring details of what their life is like their hygiene routines their exams with the physician what they do to pass the time not much. On some days there are a bunch of children there. At night the clients arrive and still little happens as they are happy to just sit around with the prostitutes and stare at each other play board games flirt gossip. One of them brings a panther with him for some reason a panther that doesn't age. When they get down to business it turns out all the clients have kinkyish proclivities.One of the prostitutes who has nightmares and visions actually ends up fulfilling them as one of her clients slashes her cheeks making her unsuitable for regular work. Another ends up with syphilis and dies. We also meet a young girl who decides to join the staff with the blessing of her parents somehow. The life is portrayed as a type of slavery and yet women join it voluntarily as way out? And the panther will deliver justice. The bordello also faces closure eventually. That is about it when it comes to a plot. The writerdirector does his best to avoid telling a story. For instance one of the girls will read the tarot cards to the others to answer questions. She interprets the past the present and when she gets to the future the director cuts to something else. When there is action it is almost filmed in slow motion everybody moves with all the patience in the world in a calculated unnatural way as if the actors are being overdirected.The movie looks pretty good the longest and most commonly repeated scene of the prostitutes sitting around with clients looks like a living still life. Music and sounds are OK until we get near the end when suddenly we get loud anachronistic contemporary music. This movie is 2 hours long but it feels like 20 hours. I had to see it in two sessions.What is the point of the movie one asks oneself after sitting through this sedative? Other than being the writerdirector's prostituteadoration piece I can't think of any. It doesn't glorify prostitution but it doesn't humanize it either. One can't care for any of the prostitutes they all look fairly alike and are not particularly attractive let alone interesting. It doesn't vilify or humanize the clients either. The emotional tone of the movie is entirely flat throughout. One fears there is some brilliant message that one missed but after watching the behindthescenes feature where the director explains himself one can conclude that nothing was missed there isn't anything to this movie. Somewhere hidden behind endless repeated scenes where nothing happens could have been a decent movie about the life and dreams of prostitutes during those Parisian times. But the director isn't interested in telling a story he is obsessed with some images that he repeats in all his movies and that derail what could have been a story. If anything this movie is a remarkable waste of effort funds and talent and a lesson on how not to make a movie.".

A poor sixteenyearold applies and is accepted into the bordello. She's the audience proxy. The other ladies teach her the tricks of the trade. On the whole it might have been written by a French anthropologist. The writerdirector is determined to show us how this system works. I admire LeviStrauss but I could never understand him. I think I understand this movie though. It's just that it's so dull.It might have helped if any of the characters were at all animated but they're not. They're how you say blas. It would also have helped if there were even one girl who was beautiful enough to coagulate your eyeballs. Instead one of the most prominent of the ladies has a nose on her that suggests she should be hovering over a grassy field wings fluttering searching for mice.On the plus side a good deal of attention is paid to period detail. The production crew must have studied ToulouseLautrec with a microscope and it turned out pretty atmospheric. We have the rosy cheeks the scented soap and those endearing black chokers that girls of the period used to wear and that  come to think of it  Natalie Portman wore in Lon The Professional. Whatever happened to black chokers anyway? They were very sexy. Everything seems to be changing for the worse. The old days are gone forever.I'm joking around because I expect I have nothing much more to say about the film. I retired from anthropology some years ago and am fed up with tribal studies.You want to see a decent whorehouse movie? See Pretty Baby also directed by a Frenchman Louis Malle in 1978. The setting is New Orleans in 1917 but it's very French in its approach to whoredom and New Orleans was still rather a French city with monolingual French speakers. Degas visited relatives there. The set design is equally evocative. And it has drama as well as nudity. This one has only nudity.".

Something seen in a much better movie with some visual and spatial similarities Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette.";

	schema:headline " The 40 YearOld Virgin does the deed and then something else";
	schema:reviewBody "In the previews The 40 YearOld Virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't. Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens he falls in love. What's more there's a movie out about it and it's called The 40 Yearold Virgin.The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer Steve Carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches Survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.Now here's the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion. This is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. Sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gaybashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game Mortal Kombat Deception no less  the ultimate testosteronedriven fightfest for guys.As someone who is rapidly approaching 20 collects McFarlane Toys action figures AND has himself never done the deed I found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similarthemed movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40. A bit arrogant I know but would you you is italicized still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of The 40 YearOld Virgin?Of course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise don't ask and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. When it's first discovered Andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David Paul Rudd Jay Romany Malco and Cal Seth Rogen all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman which couldn't be any further from the truth. The truth is Andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for good.David Jay and Cal each embark on a mission to get Andy laid so help them all. But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster as proved by one date with Nicky Leslie Mann who puts Andy through the worst drunkdriving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with Beth Elizabeth Banks the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish Catherine Keener the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that nicelooking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him that is if he can ever do the deed.At last this is the sex romp we've been waiting for. It deals with a very real issue a lot of Lonely Guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture How many of us Lonely Guys want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing we're taught in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he needs to go through body waxing like Andy does which is sidesplitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news articles was in fact real and so was the blood on Carell's shirt afterward.The 40 YearOld Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow and cowritten by himself and Carell which originated as a skit that starred Carell. Carell is sweet and human as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I've ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities can be related to on a fundamental level.The way The 40 YearOld Virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but I'll leave that up to you the viewer to observe. Surely if anyone can go through the things Andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener then it's true It is never too late!1010".

The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty and Will Ferrell Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgendy in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like P.S.. I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However if you're easily offended don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist don't see this movie. And please not matter what even if you think you're one of those hip parents don't take your kids to this movie. Sure you should let your teens go see this movie just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.".

	schema:headline " Breakout film for Carell";
	schema:reviewBody "Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on 'The Daily Show' and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life. Andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night while socializing with his coworkers for the first time Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His coworkers David Paul Rudd Jay Romany Malco and Cal Seth Rogen initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivet to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.".

	schema:headline " a healthy reminder that sex jokes can be well crafted Carrell is genius";
	schema:reviewBody "Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer Wedding Crashers is similar but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of overthetop crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic more rounded than most of the onedimensional or unexplained people in the other. And perhaps it may also depend on how much you identify or just find the lunacy in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show one of my favorite shows on now and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and cowriterdirector Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way even early on as he talks to his action figures while repainting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett also about sexual dysfunction. As the title suggests Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little PeeWee Herman in him the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious a good sign.So his friends among them Paul Rudd Romany Mancoy Seth Rogen all very good comic foils try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl and almost with his own boss Jane Lynch also very funny in the mockumentaries as a explitive buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex one might worry that the plot gear of how is he going to tell her such and such might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact if anything Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot or one or two little stray stories the fellow coworkers have their own relationship problems as well Rudd's being the funniest. The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humorcharm or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship and unlike 'Crashers' there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise. For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity the 'waxing' scene which was done for real by the way and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film the way it comes out at first is a total uproarious surprise. But if you're willing not to get offended by it there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.".

Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a fortyyear old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original charming and very funny. highly recommended.".

You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his comedic air but Carell takes it to another level everything he does is innocent lovable and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of nonstop laughs or 4 hours if you see it twice like I did a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fit the tone of the movie great and you can tell the director knew what he was doing.Filled with sex jokes some nudity and a lot of language this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the Wedding Crashers Anchorman or any movie along those lines you will absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin.".

	schema:headline " The Modern Definition of Serious Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not quite sure if the term serious comedy applies to this movie Im not even sure if this can be applied. On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. Therefore I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as serious comedies.Does The 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild? That is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh a lot plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations.I'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie especially men.The story as the title says it is about Andy a shy silent guy whom collects action figures watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia.Kal is Andy's coworker at SmartTech. He believes Andy to be a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his exgirlfriend whom ran away with another guy. And Jay a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.I'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. So in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh with social commentary than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films.It also includes DVD bonuses which you'll really see from top to bottom.".

	schema:reviewBody "All right here's the deal if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say This movie is hilarious go check it out! and some sweet little old churchgoing lady heads to the theater and has a heartattack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that's what I come to expect from the man Judd Apatow who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down is hilarious but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough despite the raunch there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable admirable character. Sure he's a little weird. After all he has a framed Asia poster more videogames than an Asian kid and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem there's a bit of an it's OK to wait message.But man oh man please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him he just let some of the guys particularly Rogen and Malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the fword or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good idea.There you go  my humble honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.".

Instead I got a smart surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sex.Yes the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional heylookanipple! but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and I was very surprised. Yea it's pretty over the top c'mon it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin! but it's very smartly done.In the end you're really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?".

No wit no charm no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead Carrell is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there.

	schema:reviewBody "I read a number of the reviews and ratings of this dreadful movie before venturing a comment. In fact I checked the ratings on IMDb before I saw the film  a mistake. I would have done better drawing straws. I can't honestly give this movie a single star. The movie uses the lockerroom stereotype of young American men  constantly concerned with sex and willing to employ any means to have it. The range of sexual experience sought is so extremely caricatured that one character finds watching a Mexican not American woman have sex with a horse as boring as making an egg salad sandwich. Men in this film will use any means whatsoever lying cheating drugs and alcohol to satisfy the sexual urge. Homosexuality is shown as just one in the range of sexual options  slightly beyond bestiality. In the pursuit of sex men are portrayed as so dirty and disgusting they are laughable. Degrading people is not humor.Most American men could not identify with any of the characters in this movie. The majority are decent honest and moral. They believe in romantic love in which sex has a natural role despite the guilt and fear connected with sex by religion and the state. The male characters in this movie would be excluded socially by men in the real world.The female characters in the movie are also stereotypes  eve and the serpent. They  unlike the men  are sexually sophisticated experienced and competent. They exist to tempt men for example the female store owner's offer to become fuck buddy of the main character or the bookstore saleswoman?s responsiveness to the star's stupid pickup lines and her autoerotic session as a warm up to a heterosexual event  with him or any other partner. In essence this is a propaganda film. It uses degrading humor and stereotyping to convey lessons based on the biblical interpretations of Jerry Falwell James Dobson Pat Robertson and even George Bush 1. Virginity abstinence before marriage is good  if a bit geeky. 2. Sex outside of marriage is dirty disgusting and gross. 3. Sex is addictive and more and varied experiences are required to satisfy the addiction 4. Homosexuality one of a variety of sexual choices.And of course the final point sex education is simply used to teach sexual alternatives to immoral people who wish to be sexually active  outercourse and oral play ? while avoiding the responsibility of pregnancy and disease. As propaganda the movie appears to be relatively successful it slipped by the majority of your reviewers. As comedy or cinematic art however it is unrepresentative ugly and disgusting.".

Comedy films are supposed to be daring or at least witty not comparable to a comedy made by randomly selected high schoolers. To me this film would have been American Pie 40 if Jim had never gotten laid. I've got nothing against American Pie but the series quickly went down hill.

At best he's competent at what he does and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'comedy Big Fat Liar but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet he or just the studio must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now not to mention with shows backtoback on Thursday nights on NBC Steve Carrel and Tina Fey because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs but where exactly I can't be sure since most of his contributions would appear to come from the superconventional story aspects as my own mother put it I don't know looks like The Out of Towners or that Blind Date movie from the 80's.So yeah basic premise married couple looking for a little change their friends are splitting up go out to 'The City' NYC of course and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're noshows. The Tripplehorns as it turns out have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns and so the Fosters our confused heroes go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this it's by the numbers stuff save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved including good actors playing decenttomediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta.It's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable and they have chemistry together which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters like Mark Wahlberg's VERY shirtless exmilitary guy with all of his hightech equipment or the real Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula is two character to at least semi care about and perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood romcom can be given credit for it has painfully normal characters here nothing too complicated and who are funny in semifunny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.So if you're looking for something masterfully done look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script Date Night deserves a chance. At the least you get to see the two show off their skills in a stripclub scene and did I mention Mark Whalberg doesn't have on a shirt?".

This is the premise for director Shawn Levy's film. The best part? It doesn't matter at all.The reason this film works is not the plot or script but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today Steve Carell and Tina Fey. The two seem to have an exceptional comedic connection that brings out a timing that reminds of the best comedy teams of all time.Sometimes what makes for the funniest comedy is putting normal people into exceptional situations and let them react. Here Carell and Fey are just a typical suburban couple trying to reignite the luster of an all too comfortable marriage. The motivation comes when their friends Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig announce they are splitting. This starts Carell and Fey off on a series of skits that would make Seinfeld proud.The nightmare begins when the couple steals a reservation in a hot new restaurant and assume the identity of what turns out to be a couple of low level thieves. The multitude of skits that follow include supporting work from dirty cops Common and Jimmi Simpson the real reservation holders funny James Franco and Mila Kunis a mob boss Ray Liotta a corrupt city official William Fichtner and a security expert in the eternally shirtless Mark Wahlberg.The approach of the film reminds me of After Hours Adventures in Babysitting and The Out of Towners. Some of the best comedy occurs when the main players aren't tossing out incessant oneliners. Think back to Cary Grant's screwball comedies. He was not a bumbling idiot or a standup comedian walking through life. His characters were reactionary to the oddball situations in which he was placed. That is the approach of Carell and Fey and I hope they pursue future projects together.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Date Night";
	schema:reviewBody "I wonder how many married couples out there can attest to their lifestyle being nothing but revolving around work family and especially kids with the latter just sapping whatever free time they have in their waking hours only to find themselves stuck in a washrinserepeat cycle. The film examines in a comical fashion of course the lifestyle of the typical family with working parents and young children and how there isn't anything known as personal time and having routine becoming the rot in their lives.For the Fosters Phil Steve Carell and Claire Tina Fey such is their married life with spontaneity and energy being sucked so dry even their regular date nights seem like a chore. You know that precious night where you think you can paint the town red with a babysitter looking after the kids and the sad thing being that even that can turn out to be lifeless save for their favourite game played during dinner where they adlib what they think about other diners around them.Which is pretty cool given that the two comedians as the blooper reel played during the end credits showed hammed it up a lot with awesome adlibbing and improvisation that never fail to bring on the laughter. In fact opportunities where they are cut loose and allowed to go really crazy are some of the best parts of the film breathing comedic life into a very simple story of how their well little white lie in order to get a table at a swanky restaurant would turn their date night upside down into a crazy urban adventure filled with thugs cops and well a beefy Mark Wahlberg.If I had a physique similar to Wahlberg's security expert Holbrooke heck I'll strut around topless as well all the time which serves as a running joke about Man's insecurities about the pectorals and abs of another. One of the nicer themes here involves how couples beside spending time together have to emotionally connect and be honest and upfront about their desires and especially fears as well. In between pursuits and comedy director Shawn Levy pauses the pace appropriately to inject some dramatic elements to sneak in a moment or two to examine just that before stepping on the pedal to floor the film to its finale.Like I mentioned it's otherwise a very straightforward film that doesn't try to be more than it can be keeping things simple and to the point with great cameo appearances with the likes of Will.I.Am Mark Ruffalo James Franco and Mila Kunis being those instantly recognizable. Carell and Fey share an excellent chemistry and play off each other's antics really well from wit to the timing of their physical comedy and you'll find yourself rooting for this average normal couple to be going one up against their adversaries in a single nighttime adventure since all they want is to get out of their predicament and back to their home and children like all parents do.Stay until the end of the credits if you didn't have enough of the restaurant scene where Carell and Fey pose as arrogant Eurotrash for additional laughs.".

Except for a few scenes this movie isn't anything innovative but it's still nice to see Steve and Tina play likable characters.The producers of this flick know what they have in these two actors and the movie is enough to give their comedic and acting chops nothing like Steve's nice acting ability in Dan in Real Life a little flexing. With this knowledge I still recommend this movie to those who want to enjoy a little break from the action3Dfilled movies out there now.

	schema:headline " Date Night is a real treat for Tina Fay and Steve Carell fans!";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I start talking about the movie itself I would first like to point out that I am big fans of both of the stars involved with this film. Tina Fay is not only a beautiful woman but probably one of the funniest people in Hollywood. She is an amazing writer and I absolutely adore her show 30 Rock. As for Steve Carell he is one of those actors who I really enjoy watching on the big screen and small screen. I have seen almost everything he has done from Little Miss Sunshine to The 40 Year Old Virgin and he has been really good at most of the roles he has played. With that being said when I saw the trailer for Date Night I was very excited to see what the end result of the film would be. So when the film finally opened in theaters I made my journey to my local multiplex and treat myself to a Date Night. Date Night tells the story of the Fosters who are your typical American family. As part of their normal married routine once a week Phil Steve Carell and Claire Tina Fay go out on a date to a local restaurant. One day after spending a night at their friends house they learn just how mundane and routine marriage can be. After thinking about her own marriage Claire decides she wants to make next week's date night special. She decides to get all dressed up to surprise Phil. When Phil comes home from work and sees Claire dressed to the nines he decides that tonight is the night to switch it up for the better. Claire and Phil venture out to the newest Manhattan restaurant on a Friday night without a reservation. Once they get to the restaurant and get denied a table Phil and Claire pose as the Triplehorns in order to get seated. While eating they get approached by two goons who think they are the Triplehorns. This is where the fun begins as Phil and Claire's simple date night has turned into a night of mistaken identity and running for their lives from crooked cops and the mob. Lots of laughs and catchy one liners ensue...Steve Carell's performance of Phil Foster was hilarious. He plays a combination of his Get Smart character and his 40 Year Old Virgin character in the film. I think what makes me enjoy Steve Carell the most is that he seems like a typical down to earth guy. He is never over the top funny or zany guy like say Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey but just comes off like a normal nice and funny guy. As for Tina Fay well she is great here. I think her oneliners were just the best. I don't know if she adlibbed a lot of them but man she had some great lines. I also feel this role was a bit different from her normal roles which I liked. While you do see her become Liz Lemon here at times you also see a dirtier and different side of Tina Fay here. As for the other roles there are a lot of famous faces who pop up here and there in the film including a funny appearance by Mark Wahlberg James Franco and Mila Kunis just to name a few.Shawn Levy was the man in the director's chair. He is probably best known for directing the Night at the Museum films. I personally have seen most of Shawn Levy's films and have to admit while he isn't a great director he is good at what he does. He is really good at creating fun films whether they are geared towards kids or adults. For the most part I actually enjoy most of the films he directed. I think Mr. Levy knows his limitations and doesn't try to go above and beyond his means which is a good thing. Date Night is probably his best film to date to be fair and if nothing else it's definitely his funniest.Date Night was written by Josh Klausner who was the man responsible for writing the dull and lackluster Shrek the Third. Luckily Mr. Klausner redeemed himself with this film. I thought the dialogue was extremely well written and funny. The situations the two leads were placed in here humorous to say the least. Some of the scenes were just down right hilarious! Without giving too much away the car scene as well as the strip club scene were two of the best in the film. I think after seeing this film now I have more hope for Shrek Ever After which I was originally dreading to see since the last one was almost unwatchable since it was so dull and boring. But I will have to applaud Mr. Klausner here for writing a fun and enjoyable film.Bottom Line MovieManMenzel's final rating for Date Movie is a solid 8 out of 10. I admit I had a big smile on my face when I left the theater. Date Night was one of those movies where I just had a good time watching it. I think if you enjoy the whole actioncomedy genre you will probably get a good kick out of it. If your fans of either Tina Fay or Steve Carell this is definitely a must see for you. I think overall it's a funny little film. It's nothing fresh or original but its definitely something that is brainless fun for 90 mins. Also be sure to stay for the credits as there are a ton of outtakes during and after the credits which are very funny.".

	onyx:emotionText "Before I start talking about the movie itself I would first like to point out that I am big fans of both of the stars involved with this film. Tina Fay is not only a beautiful woman but probably one of the funniest people in Hollywood. She is an amazing writer and I absolutely adore her show 30 Rock. As for Steve Carell he is one of those actors who I really enjoy watching on the big screen and small screen. I have seen almost everything he has done from Little Miss Sunshine to The 40 Year Old Virgin and he has been really good at most of the roles he has played. With that being said when I saw the trailer for Date Night I was very excited to see what the end result of the film would be. So when the film finally opened in theaters I made my journey to my local multiplex and treat myself to a Date Night. Date Night tells the story of the Fosters who are your typical American family. As part of their normal married routine once a week Phil Steve Carell and Claire Tina Fay go out on a date to a local restaurant. One day after spending a night at their friends house they learn just how mundane and routine marriage can be. After thinking about her own marriage Claire decides she wants to make next week's date night special. She decides to get all dressed up to surprise Phil. When Phil comes home from work and sees Claire dressed to the nines he decides that tonight is the night to switch it up for the better. Claire and Phil venture out to the newest Manhattan restaurant on a Friday night without a reservation. Once they get to the restaurant and get denied a table Phil and Claire pose as the Triplehorns in order to get seated. While eating they get approached by two goons who think they are the Triplehorns. This is where the fun begins as Phil and Claire's simple date night has turned into a night of mistaken identity and running for their lives from crooked cops and the mob. Lots of laughs and catchy one liners ensue...Steve Carell's performance of Phil Foster was hilarious. He plays a combination of his Get Smart character and his 40 Year Old Virgin character in the film. I think what makes me enjoy Steve Carell the most is that he seems like a typical down to earth guy. He is never over the top funny or zany guy like say Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey but just comes off like a normal nice and funny guy. As for Tina Fay well she is great here. I think her oneliners were just the best. I don't know if she adlibbed a lot of them but man she had some great lines. I also feel this role was a bit different from her normal roles which I liked. While you do see her become Liz Lemon here at times you also see a dirtier and different side of Tina Fay here. As for the other roles there are a lot of famous faces who pop up here and there in the film including a funny appearance by Mark Wahlberg James Franco and Mila Kunis just to name a few.Shawn Levy was the man in the director's chair. He is probably best known for directing the Night at the Museum films. I personally have seen most of Shawn Levy's films and have to admit while he isn't a great director he is good at what he does. He is really good at creating fun films whether they are geared towards kids or adults. For the most part I actually enjoy most of the films he directed. I think Mr. Levy knows his limitations and doesn't try to go above and beyond his means which is a good thing. Date Night is probably his best film to date to be fair and if nothing else it's definitely his funniest.Date Night was written by Josh Klausner who was the man responsible for writing the dull and lackluster Shrek the Third. Luckily Mr. Klausner redeemed himself with this film. I thought the dialogue was extremely well written and funny. The situations the two leads were placed in here humorous to say the least. Some of the scenes were just down right hilarious! Without giving too much away the car scene as well as the strip club scene were two of the best in the film. I think after seeing this film now I have more hope for Shrek Ever After which I was originally dreading to see since the last one was almost unwatchable since it was so dull and boring.

Oh then back to the serious plot about how they might get killed.The last few Steve Carrell movies have been poor and with The Office seeming rather weak in Season 6 I wonder if his career is faltering.

	schema:headline " A very funny movie with plenty of laughs. Carell and Fey are in top form.";
	schema:reviewBody "I never was a fan of director Shawn Levy's films. Sure Big Fat Liar and the 2006 version of The Pink Panther did get some memorable moments but they weren't THAT rewatchable. A good funny movie is something that you can remember for quite some time and I had a hard time remembering something memorable from Cheaper By The Dozen and Just Married. However Levy isn't a bad director it's just that he needs one good funny movie to really hit it off. No the two Night At The Museum movies don't count. This one does. Date Night thus far is the best movie Levy's directed.By taking two of the funniest comedians today and putting them in a movie tailormade for them is somewhat like a blessing. Date Night is a romantic comedy with a slight detour into the action thriller genre. But it still has many laughs big hearty ones especially from both Carell and Fey. You see both of them play a bored married couple who decides to liven up their love life by going into a posh and extremely snobbishoverbooked restaurant in the Big Apple. So the loving husband desperate to work things out claims or rather steals an unoccupied reservation so that their night together would be romantic and luxurious. Big mistake as they are mistaken for someone else which leads to a night of danger intrigue and excitement.The best thing about the movie are both Carell and Fey and how well both play each other off. Both have excellent chemistry and have memorable moments and lines. Steve Carell is perfect as the deadpan husband Phil while Tina Fey as Claire looks gorgeous and deliver her own brand of jazzy humor. A fine example of their chemistry together is a scene where both of them adlibs many couples in the film. Great stuff. To quote an early Australian reviewer The two surprisingly deliver the emotional reality of a couple even under comedic demands. I loved them in the movie and I hope they do more comedies together.There are jokes throughout the movie both physical and in dialog. A fine example of the physical humor in the film a car chase that is intense as it is ridiculously funny and what is arguably the most hilarious strippole dance I've seen in any movie. That scene had me laughing so much I now have to take cough syrup. There's some memorable lines here too You stole our reservation? What kind of people are you? He turned the gun sideways. It's a killshot! among others. To see these two comedians going through all this in a plot so hilariously Hitchcockian the plot kinda reminds me of North By Northwest is a hoot.Balancing the comedians out are some fine supporting actors in fact you could call the cast an ensemble cast of sorts. Besides Carell and Fey you've got Mark Wahlberg who looks hunky shirtless to Phil's dismay Oscarnominee Taraji P. Henson as a detective trying to put the pieces together Mila Kunis and James Franco in nearly scenestealing scenes as a wild couple who enjoy their love life despite their rowdiness Common and Jimmi Simpson as the two pursuers William Fichtner in a hilarious yet sleazy performance and a villainous role for surprise Ray Liotta.In technical aspects Shawn Levy's direction is brisk and fastpaced and the cinematography and camera work as always by Dean Semler is nothing short of great. The editing is fluid and doesn't ruin the smooth flow of the movie. The script though with some flaws is still pretty well written. Yes I agree the movie is illogical and clichd at some points but then again it's a lighthearted comedy at it's core and for that purpose it got the job done tremendously. Plus at only 90 minutes it's pretty much short and straightforward with it's pace so that you get what you want. Comedic entertainment at it's finest.So overall this is a great romantic comedy to take both your friends andor your other too. It's a very funny and enjoyable movie to watch. It's a jolly good time at the movies and I'm glad I saw it. Hey maybe I'll see it again if I had the chance. This one's a winner.Overall rating 7.510 Very good worth your time and money".

	schema:reviewBody "I missed the Amy PoehlerTina Fey movie of some years ago so I did not want to miss what promised to be another dream team of comedy talents in Date Night. Maybe the mixed reviews of both films should have warned me. Still the idea of droll downtoearth comedians Steve Carrell and Tina Fey in an actionadventure farce seemed inspired. Well they were likable and tried to bring some wit and energy to the movie. But the material let them and the audience down badly.The movie began with some quick scenes at home and with friends meant to show how married life could come to feel boring and meaningless friends suddenly announce their divorce and that they merely feel like excellent roommates. When accountant Carrell tries to break out of the mold with his real estate agent wife Fey on a night out of their New Jersey routines at a trendy Manhattan restaurant the couple ends up taking another couple's reservation. The other couple is involved in blackmail and is being chased by thugs. Mistaking Carrell and Fey for the other couple the thugs abduct them at gunpoint and chase them throughout the rest of the movie. Along the way Carrell and Fey are caught up in loud car chases and quirky meetings and conversations with themselves and others including bigname actors in cameos such as a dim shirtless hunk security expert Mark Wahlberg and a mean mob boss Ray Liotta. We learn that Fey does not light up for Carrell the way she does for the hunk because she is so tired taking care of everyone and everything else day in and day out and just wishes she had some time to herself Fey has a nice line about wanting to enjoy a day that does not somehow depend on how someone else around her is doing. For his part Carrell says he wants his wife to have more confidence in him and let him shoulder more home and family responsibilities. In a hasty contrived anticlimactic ending on a rooftop with everyone pointing guns at each other and the clich of the police helicopter swooping in at the last minute Carrell is made out to be the hero.Parts of the dialogue and scenes with the divorcing friends Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig good in the roles and with Carrell and Fey having a hearttoheart talk had some originality silly fun and emotional truth to them. Fey sometimes shot out an unexpectedly earthy line that was funny and Carrell had some funny moments trying to act and talk tough as did the two of them making up stories mocking other diners in the restaurants with them. The blackmailing couple was humorously offbeat in the fairly short scene in which they appear.But this was far too little to carry a movie even one this short. In fact the material would not even compress well into a good Saturday Night Live skit. The OutofTowners with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn is certainly not one of my favorite movies but it is an insult to compare that fuller livelier film to this one. The closest comparison to Date Night that I can think of in terms of my surprise and disappointment is Dana Carvey's disastrous 2002 film Master of Disguise.Rarely have I seen a movie with as much oncamera talent turn out to be as skimpy and superficial as Date Night. The story was paperthin. Never once did I laugh out loud. There were long stretches of dead time filled with unfunny rambling as when the couple are led in the park by thugs with drawnout and unoriginal cameos especially by Liotta who did not have a single funny line or action and with noisy chase scenes including a car chase that went on and on repetitively endlessly trying to milk supposedly funny lines from a cab driver. Even the scene with Carrell and Fey on a stripper pole lost whatever novelty it had fast and came off as drawnout and forced. The ending in which Carrell supposedly proved himself to his wife fell completely flat without being the least bit clever interesting or believable. Much of the plot and gags felt recycled.There were problems even with Fey and Carrell. Her flat detachment and his nerdy gushing boyishness never came together to make them convincing as a seasoned working suburban couple or gave them much onscreen chemistry or rapport. The supporting characters of the thugs and police were weak especially the allknowing glib policewoman who seemed on to the bad guys from the start sapping any suspense. The bad guys who included some corrupt cops and a sleazy political figure who hung out stoned in strip clubs while promising in public to clean up crime are stock characters with nothing original or interesting about them. The same is true of the unfunny outtakes pasted onto the end credits which as another reviewer said only suggest the cast had a lot more fun making the movie than the audience had watching it.I wanted to like this movie as much as any of the breathlessly enthusiastic reviews on this site. But like other better reviews no matter how much I liked the stars and saw bits and pieces here and there to enjoy there is no way to paper over how disappointing it was.".

This is perhaps the WORST WASTE of talent I have ever witnessed in my 57 years. Tina Fey and Steve Carell are amazing masters of dialog and subtlety yet the writer and director of this movie decided to minimize the dialog and include such things as a ridiculous car chase scene. I am mystified how you could have Tina Fey and Steve Carell on your set and make a bad movie. Before I saw Date Night I seriously would have said that is not possible. Well it is. Steve Carell and Tina Fey need to make another movie but they need to write it and they need a director that is as smart as they are or at least close. Four thumbs down.".

What happened to teams like Monty Python that could make you roll without dropping a single crude word? What happened to great filmwriters who didn't feel they had to push the social envelope all the way to the gutter to get a laugh? Do they not know that the best elements of humor are those that are subtle i.e. those that require the viewer to insert something?

Both are stars of two of the best shows on TV I love Carrell's The Office but I'm not a fan of Fey's 30 Rock and have played their share of memorable characters on the big screen Carrell as a weatherman who can't think in Anchorman and Fey as a teacher in Mean Girls but when they share the screen for Date Night they are ruined by trying to make a weak script funny.Carrell and Fey play the Fosters a boring New Jersey couple. The opening scenes where they introduce the Fosters are lagging and boring. Things should pick up when they go to New York for a fancy dinner and Carrell takes another couple's table leading to series of misadventures for the poor couple. Due to a case of mistaken identity they are caught up in a scheme involving crooked cops and gangsters. Needless to say this barely makes any sense.Usually I'm all for celebrity cameos but Date Night took it too far. Mila Kunis Leighton Meester Mark Wahlberg James Franco William Fitchner and Ray Liotta all make cameos. Wahlberg's cameo is very amusing but the rest are either dumb Fitchner pointless Meester or too brief Kunis Franco and Liotta. Your focus should be on Carrell and Fey but instead you're going star watching for half the movie. The cameo loses its so called sacredness when nearly every bit part is played by an Alister.Overall Date Night could've been hilarious but is brought by its weak script and dumb plot. For your next date night do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to Carrell and Fey's.".

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of a loving closeknit family in the 1970s. The father is obsessed with his love of soccer and for his children which include two grade school sons his high school son and soccer star and high school daughter Gracie. All of his children share his passion for the game. A tragedy occurs and the high school daughter is determined to play with the high school boys' soccer team.This is before title IX and the road to her joining the team is virtually impossible. Everyone is against her that is the male soccerteam players the male soccerteam coaches and her father. And everything is against her. Girls aren't allowed to use the weightlifting room at school and the Board of Education is worried about her safety.First she gives up and behaves badly. Then her love for the game and competition takes over. The only questions that remain are whether she will be given a chance and whether given a chance she is tough enough and good enough.Gracie eventually becomes a role model for young people and especially for girls. She displays courage and spirit and even heroism and she never gives up hope in trying to reach her goals.Gracie's parents are very compelling. Dermot Mulroney and Elizabeth Shue show being good parents is not about money. It is about being good role models and instilling positive values in their children.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of a loving closeknit family in the 1970s.

The cover art for this movie really gives the wrong impression  the sunshine on the box never appears in the actually movie and although this movie is inspiring it manages to do it without the lollipops and flowers that one might expect. This film is more about a family as it copes with tragedy and life in the 70's than it is about soccer which is a good thing! It has enough soccer content for those interested but people who dislike sports movies have nothing to fear either. I will admit there are a few sappy moments in this film but luckily Gracie is no goody two shoes and thus a more complex character. EXTRA BONUS  the sound track is excellent featuring Blondie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gracie is a great family film. Gracie is played beautifully by Carly Shroeder as a girl surround by three soccerplaying brothers Johnny Mike and Dan. The film opens as her brother has her kick a soccer ball barefoot to hit an empty bottle on top of the car. This film is set in South Orange New Jersey in 1978 and is inspired by the events of the Shue family. Elisabeth Shue plays the mom and school nurse at Columbia High School in South Orange which does exist and whose alumni includes the Shues and Zach Braff. South Orange is also an upscale suburb of New York City and Newark New Jersey. At the time of the movie set in 1978 an average dual income working class couple with four children could live comfortably there. South Orange has become an upscale white collar community ever since 1978 to feature celebrity residents like Kelly Bishop and Andre Braugher. Also South Orange is home to Seton Hall University. The film was filmed on location around New Jersey including Maplewood where we see Gracie running on a downtown street. It was a family affair in the filming process including Elisabeth Shue not only as an actress but as an executive producer along with her husband and director Davis Guggenheim. Her brother Andrew Shue plays an assistant soccer coach and history teacher. In real life Andrew played soccer too. Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the father coach and moving man in his profession. At first the family has a star Johnny Bowen but tragedy strikes the family. We see Gracie rebelling against her parents who are already heartbroken with despair over their loss as well. The two younger brothers seem unaffected at least in the movie. Gracie has one best female friend who is afraid of being labeled a lesbian because of her association with Grace. She decides one night to take her brother's spot on the team much to her father's laugh. She is serious but rather than prepare and strive. She rebels dates a boy fails history and plays hooky at Asbury Park with a college boy. Until her father decides that he will coach her to get on the team there are difficulties since she is a girl but she is determined and the film is not entirely predictable. It is a family oriented. It's just in time for Father's Day! The film is somewhat believable and realistic at times. They do their best to maintain the authenticity of the time and playing Bruce Springsteen songs as well. I admire the Shues for their determination in making the film entirely on location in New Jersey keeping with their roots. Stay until the end of the credits you will be interested to see what it has to say. I like this film overall and it's message is that a girl can do it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carly Schroeder has made with this little film perhaps the most purehearted big screen debut I've ever seen. The only other movie I can think of to rival this is Whale Rider and Keisha CastleHughes performance. But I really think Carly has the edge here. It's as if she's plucked a dream out of the ether and made it palpable. It's what the great actresses do and I'm betting this woman could easily outdo every major name out there given the chance. She's instantly likable and she transmits emotions through her face voice and body like she was born to convince you of her champion heart.This is not an easy role. It's quite physical and most women have a deep dislike for exercise and even competition. After all women are like dune buggies men are like Mack trucks. But the truth is soccer can be played and won with finesse and heart though it takes a special sort. Someone who can bring a deft touch to her play just when she should be exhausted and beaten. And there's no question in my mind none of the current crop of starlets would have struggled to do half the job that Carly does here. There are very few camera tricks that only imply physicality in the direction instead it's all there for real in a way that completely blew me away. These people believed in this film and it's paid off big time.No Hollywood is not quite as astute or clever as it thinks it is so Carly's future can't be assured. But if there were ever a promising beginning this is it. This is one beautifully acted and directed movie that I'm very sorry I didn't see when it first came out. I've no idea why it's not rated higher here. With all the ugliness we have to contend with you'd think these armchair critics would be forced to let a breath of fresh air in. I'm guessing they're too far gone. I on the other hand think Carly has created out of an impossibly pure and quite visible heart one of the most memorable and believable female heroines I have ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Gracie' is a movie about a girl who gets on the varsity boys soccer team after her brother Johnny Bowen Jesse Lee Soffer who was the team star dies in a car accident. Based on an experience of the Shue family it has Elizabeth Shue playing Gracie's mother and another Shue Andrew as Coach Clark. Gracie Bowen is played by Carly Schroeder who projects energy and guts as the role requires. Dermot Mulroney is her father Bryan Bowen a former soccer player and a bit of a star in his time himself but with childhood issues that give him some trouble as a parent. He has coached the family boys as if soccer for all of them has always been the only thing while Gracie was protected but overlooked. But the fact that she nails a shot on a bet with bare feet in the opening sequence shows she's got the potential to be a star herself. Her struggle to be accepted at a time when girls didn't play soccer in America this takes place in the late Seventies is a way of moving forward when a kind of opening appears it's also a chance for the family to redeem itself and progressing beyond its grief.'Gracie's' final trajectory leads somewhat implausibly to a predictable final big game triumph but what makes the body of the movie different and good is its focus on trainingthe training moreover of a female athlete and her endless struggle to prove herself. The story is more about the discipline of sport the long hard process of conditioning than the drama of games and wins. Gracie first has to convince her father to coach her despite his not unnatural concern that she isn't tough enough to play against boys. Her mother tells her she must be content as a girl with being second best. She doesn't buy that. Carly Schroeder makes Gracie's passion and conviction appear strong but never forced. Despite the ending this is for once a sports film not so much about the dramatic play and the roar of the crowd as it is about practice practice practice. The training is as close up as we got in Robert Towne's excellent 1982 'Personal Best' which starred Mariel Hemingway and was a landmark for its realistic cinematic treatment of a track and field competitor. Again maybe inevitably the lesbian issue comes up in 'Gracie' as it does more prominently in 'Personal Best.' This time it appears only as a false stereotype but at one point even Gracie's very upfront best friend Jena Julia Garro has doubts while her sometime boyfriend Kyle Rhodes Christopher Shand who wanted her for a long time but seemed hard to trust indeed becomes an enemy at tryout time.The movie's lessons have to do with a family unsure of itself accepting layers of grief but the fresh image is of a young girl who can be a tough and skillful athlete no matter what anybody thinks. Gracie may get some of its depth and particularity from the involvement of the Shue family. It's a family affair in more ways than one. Director Guggenheim is Elizabeth Shue's husband and Carly Schroeder's brother plays Gracie's younger brother Mike. The summer's American family films are rarely as unpretentious but solid as this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the trailers you know this movie is going to be a tearjerker. It did not let down. They did not though dwell on certain subjects forever meaning the story progressed and in doing so kept you locked and wanting to see the rest of it. I was really impressed and shocked to find out the family aspect behind the creating of this movie. The story was just brilliant and I've watched Carly Schroeder grow up on T.V. in Lizzie McGuire. Mean Creek is a movie that showed she can do dramatic and can do something different then Teen Television and this movie sealed the deal. Dermot Mulroney as the father was by far one of the best castings in this film. You saw his give and take and his struggle to either help or be against the obstacles in front of him. Elizabeth Shu can do no wrong. This was a the perfect role and she did not over play it. She really did have the believability of a concerned mother in the 70's. Weighing everything around her. The siblings especially Johnny were casted great as well as Kyle and Peter. They gave such a believability to their roles that you loved and hated them at the right times and you really struggle for Gracie in the since where putting yourself in her shoes and saying well I would have done this but your not Gracie and you have to stick with her and watch her triumph. I recommend this to Anyone and Everyone especially families or just mom's and daughters to watch and enjoy!!".

	schema:headline " A good movie about grief a girl's struggle and yes soccer";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is inspired by and thus LOOSELY based on produceractress Elisabeth Shue's life. So coming from the fact its producers are actual soccer players I wanted to love it. I didn't love it but I did like it.While this movie is a soccer movie in my eyes it is really a movie more about a family  esp. the main character Gracie  dealing with the death of a loved one her brother. It shows how different characters deal or avoid dealing with their grief. Gracie eventually turns to one of the things she used to love to share with her brother  soccer. Soccer is also something that her dad and her brother shared so Gracie and her dad reconnect through the sport.As a drama addressing the challenge of growing up as a female athlete a few decades earlier I give it an 7.510. Some people on this Message Board want to bash it as a manhating message but you have to remember that this movie is NOT trying to represent girls' athletics today  in 2007. It is representing how it was practically 30 years ago when it WAS tough to have an equal shot at sports. They did a decent job.As a drama dealing with death I give it an 810. A lot of the character's grief is portrayed through action not dialogue which worked pretty well. However with so much buildup I was waiting for more of an emotional punch and it didn't quite come full circle.As soccer movie I give it a 710. Given that I love soccer I'm probably harshest on that. I will say the soccer is more realistic than a lot of soccer movies out there. But they definitely take some creative license with the rules of the game. There seems to be a lot of irresponsible coaches and ref's in this movie. The parking lotbacklot soccer seems most realistic to me.If you like soccer OR dramas I recommend this movie.".

It was one of those 'feel good' movies where as a viewer you are just so passionately rooting for the lead character. Carly Schroeder did a wonderful job in her role and was an inspiration. I would highly recommend going to see this movie especially if you are a soccer fan or any sports fan. This is a great family movie so take you children to it you won't regret it!".

I also remembered in Primary 5 I was in the soccer team and Vishnu our striker my friend and I left midfielder did a triangular pass and then Vishnu drove the ball into the goal. I felt great. However I did not really continue to pursue soccer because of one sided talent only.I believe that if there is such thing as true passion anything is possible. With your heart devoted into that thing you can most possibly succeed.Brian Bowen Dermot Mulroney was a soccer player himself he does not put effort in thinking that anyone else can play like he did except for Mike Hunter Schroeder. Not only did her father did not believe in his only daughter he laughed along with the two other younger boys in the family Daniel Bowen Trevor Heins and  he believed that soccer was never needing real teaching because of Mike's talent in soccer. Grace Bowen Carly Schroeder had to put up with all the boys the coaches the rules and the closest person her father.I believe that girls are actually very fit to play any sport. They do not ever feel satisfied with their physical being therefore they will train harder and harder if they really want to achieve their goal. The determination to push is far greater than the relaxed mind of boys who were born to play a rough sport who were already capable of playing these kinds of pushing limits in strength speed and agility.Carly Schroeder played an amazing role as 'Gracie' she loved her brother and they were truly hearttoheart. Her brother also believed that she could do what he could do. Every time a girl will be laughed by her peers and boys for taking on socially suicidal activities. I also loved how Carly played Gracie's different roles bravely. She walked across the tunnel without bothering of the oncoming vehicles she drove illegally tested her physical limits both flirtingnaughty and fitness. Peter Wicker Josh Barclay Caras believed in her throughout the film there was no doubt in his mind that Grace was incapable of beating the boys to the game.Lindsay Bowen Elizabeth Shue played a tremendous role as Grace's mother. She was the school nurse at the school. Moreover she was also the nurse in the family. As a mother she watched over her daughter and never discouraged her of what she would like to pursue in her life. She taught her daughter to always aim high. I believe that she played this amazing role beautifully because she was back at her own grounds when she was younger. She knew how a girl like 'Gracie' would feel so she did not stop 'Gracie' from doing the abnormality. Elizabeth Shue and Andrew Shue directed this film very well.Kyle Rhodes Christopher Shand did not believe that girls can even kick a ball. He has 'expectations' of the girls he dates but until he realizes Gracie is very different he will never reach deep enough to understand her.I went to watch it the first show in the morning today and loved it. I recommend this movie to those who believes in true passion is the key to success no matter how the road bends there is always a way to walk around it.".

There is no girls' soccer at their school so she has to use a title 9 approach and petition the school board to let her even try out. Elizabeth Shue plays the mother Lindsay Bowen.

Coach had seen her practicing free kicks late at night and put her in with the game on the line in OT. Her free kick just missed the mark but she stayed in and eventually used a move her dad had showed her to score and win the game.".

	schema:reviewBody "I booked this film for my local theater during a soccer tournament weekend. Having had good results in the past with Bend it Like Beckham and Goal! I expected good crowds for what I thought was going to be a pretty good movie. This was not the case. This is more a coming of age film than a sports film and is definitely not appropriate for preteens. I was embarrassed to sit in the audience with my 11 year old daughter and watch scenes of teen sex in autos and alleyways. Even though nothing was actually shown the suggestive scenes were graphic enough to prompt me to have a conversation with my daughter about proper dating behavior.Aside from my concerns about the appropriateness of the film for preteens the characters were underdeveloped e.g. no mention or development of the Dad's former soccer star status there were continuity errors such as using the word suck in an era when it was not used and at least one half of the film was a complete downer.

	onyx:emotionText "I booked this film for my local theater during a soccer tournament weekend. Having had good results in the past with Bend it Like Beckham and Goal! I expected good crowds for what I thought was going to be a pretty good movie. This was not the case. This is more a coming of age film than a sports film and is definitely not appropriate for preteens. I was embarrassed to sit in the audience with my 11 year old daughter and watch scenes of teen sex in autos and alleyways. Even though nothing was actually shown the suggestive scenes were graphic enough to prompt me to have a conversation with my daughter about proper dating behavior.Aside from my concerns about the appropriateness of the film for preteens the characters were underdeveloped e.g. no mention or development of the Dad's former soccer star status there were continuity errors such as using the word suck in an era when it was not used and at least one half of the film was a complete downer. So much more could have been done with this story that should have felt triumphant but didn't.";

Although there are moments when I feel the film began to carry a decent storyline but all too often it drags into generic scenes and dry dialog. One big problem was the father character that continually seemed lackluster and unreal. I felt the plot and storyline were both cellophane thin and I was bored time after time with uninteresting characters. This to me was a how to not make a sports movie. I suppose credit should be given for something and with that I'll compliment the credits at the end of this mediocre film for giving it a home spun touch that was worth a nickle. Anyone who rates this higher than a 4 has got to be friend or family. It just doesn't fill the bill as a true and genuine sports flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carly Schroeder. I consider Lizzie McGuire to have some retrograde aspects grit stemming from the blatant vengeance culture approach of Lizzie's family. It was a step towards me considering modern Disney to be highly suspicious but a few years on and I have to find Disney's Lizzie McGuire also Nickelodeon's Zoey 101 still to be head and shoulders better than most other television series for kids that I have on DVD. Carly occasionally appearing as 'Melanoma' a memorable and very beautiful but scary friend of Lizzie's scary little brother.The past two years I have looked to see if Carly had anything else out on disk. I found Firewall which did not appeal to me. Now I have obtained this.This story shows that she can handle a very different role to Melina. Not that all who have commented on this would agree. In this her beauty is usually tamed down but she is trying to head in directions that often feel to be sensible. The people around her have different understandings of sensible. For me this is the power of the story.There is a lot of grit in this story as well. It is based on the 1970's and the males remind me of the males in such as Detroit Rock City alien and really vomit level aggressive cavemen. The football field is not understood as a place with rules of good conduct it is more a battlefield where the opposition are tough and players are tough even to players on their own team who they do not consider to rate good conduct. They are supposed to be tough skilled but tough. This would never be a Dr Spock understanding of manly male? This is nothing like the bits of football or UK rugby league that I used to occasionally go to in the 1960's.It reminds me of the world of battling 'heroes' that I occasionally noticed in sports posters local UK in the 1990's. An alien world. In the UK 1970's I did not notice the violence in people it was there but more a hidden thing silent and deadly.In this lead character Gracie is damaged by the violence it knocks her down for more than half a year. She shows herself as having what it takes to gradually become a survivor. For me that is not the important part of the story what counts more as this being a story that I can find okay on a second or third viewing. It is an okay way to pass the time.Add the soundtrack including the sort of 1970's related music that I can rate as hot.The bird is an American Kestral aka American Sparrowhawk. A young male not European but very common in the USA. The commentaries add detail. These are more real than one's average commentary.".

Gracie would not miss and surely kick all butts coz they just too huge and block our TV and movie screens all the time. While Gracie suddenly jumped in and revealed these Empire's new cloth just too small to cover their Herolook liked but a truly whored holes that slave to their master's money and prowess all time. Most critics under the industry expertise once again disclosed their dumb ass opinion in public eye.70's world was not far way when 60's moms were afraid of their girls' teen pregnancy so they would fall into a wrong man's family prison their whole life in small cells 70's provided them a solution condom and pills. So girls were able to walk into the maledominant world for a benefit of pleasure to serve a masculinedriven society. Rock and drugs served image of young feminism heroin's shadow as a forever makeup that nowadays films keep putting on the face of our young fighters. Boys were dressed in jeansdanced in rock but Gracie was our true Beatle.Beginning of the movie a great sign told in a small scene. When her brother Johnny told her she can do anything she believed she walked a few more steps toward the center of field that filled by young boys she hit the bottle and put her backyard dream and practice into a miracle use. No wonder she loved her brother so much he believed in her and his faith led her into this game that is love.But most critics would not want a simple truth but a fancy lie coz it sells! They call it formula I wonder their critical life is a little bit formulated too! They are just playing along they do two things kiss an ass and kick an ass! Meanwhile they know not what to do with their own cannot hold them but let go to make our world a shity place!After death took her brother.Her dad lived in his beer bottle but our Graciewas strong fierce like her mom said. She claimed her love and was willing to play her brother's game for her brother her dad laughed just like our critics did. But she fought she fought for a game worked hard preparing spoke out aloud to those who distrusted her. To her view it was a dark night! And it still is!A tragic scene in this movie tells us that our household is in vacuum if family members are without faith with each other coz love does not work Her actions when faith is not in the heart a person. When Johnny departed his dad saw his son his boy his image and his dream bearer disappeared so he was drowning in beer a typical 70's dad. And Gracie took a another road of regular rebellious teen she was 15. she quited her soccer dream and played the pickup game on street fooled about with beachboys and drove without permit tried discovering unprotected teen sex but her Dad broke into her off course life. This is a great movie to alarm family parents to strength the girder of a household and a good chance to lead a family to a teen sex and life talk. Let's not cover the things up like our politicians. Is there any good movie of another Hollywood production is simple unique better than this true story movie? Sex Money Violence we've got them in all other films but this is just life story those million dollar writers just cannot frame it.If critics cannot even read a simple passionate film why they deserve anything better?! Their love ones bring them a dish they yell too salty! Without knowing what is really in the dish!Greatness is in the simple things!They say it is lack of speech while Gracie was 15 her Dad a furniture tech mom a nurse what they expect reading a poetry or prose of Frost? or sing a Broadway song?She said Give me the ball she got it. Her will love and faith does not slave to anyone or any concept.Yup her heroism raised rose from her backyard to the boy's training field and when her coach saw her skill and lured her into the game as his wish and told her teammate to fake an injury told her whatever you do don't missMale Coach's way she hit the side post coz her destiny chose her to parade step by step from the stereotype sideline to the ugly violent center field and shined her talent and skill in her magical touch dribble dance and shot a wonderful goalGracie way. She scored a solo run in the eye of fans but her strength faith and love for the game was with her all the way all the way every fight battle and game every step of her way. That moment she was Gracie of herself of her family of her teammates fans and she is Grace of all the girls even to the her critics and boyish men!She is our Grace go Gracie go!".

	schema:headline " So it's thanks to Elisabeth Shue woman soccer exists today?";
	schema:reviewBody "Believe it or not this story is partly based and I think very loosely on the real early life of actress Elisabeth Shue who grew up playing soccer with boys. She herself also plays a role in this movie. There are actually a whole lot of more of her family members involved with this movie in one way or another so you can really call this a Shue movie. Nothing wrong with that of course but it makes it just a bit all the more weird that the message at the end of the movie claims that female soccer in America was not accepted and didn't even exists till there was Gracie or should I say Lizzy Shue. But I don't hold this against the movie. The movie already has enough problems on its own as it is.It's not a bad movie but I still really had tons of problems with it. First one is really its story. All of the drama and emotions feel very forced in and manipulative but even worse is that it's so incredibly formulaic and predictable. So it's a movie about a girl who tries to make it to the boys soccer team at school...jeez you think she will make it or not? But everything else that happens in between is also very predictable. It's really a movie by the numbers which is not necessarily a bad thing if it got done right. And yes the movie still does a lot of things right but its story and storytelling really prevent this movie from standing out in any way.One of the things I also really didn't liked about the story was that it never felt realistic in any way. It was crazy how everybody was against Gracie playing soccer and saying silly stuff like 'grils can't play' or 'she is not good or though enough for the game'. But it was even more silly how all of the characters kept on switching back and forth with their opinions. The one moment someone was being really against the idea while the other he or she is suddenly being very supportive and all for it. But this happens with no apparent reason which was really annoying to be honest.I must say it also didn't helped the movie very much that the acting in this movie was really below par.The story can perhaps be understand and appreciated better if you understand that this movie was supposed to be set in the '70's when girls at schools just had less choice on what to do with their lives and what sports to pick. I say this because it really isn't apparent at all within this movie that it was supposed to be set in the '70's. All you basically see are some old cars but there is very little else to indicate that the story is supposed to be set in the '70's. So bad filmmaking in that regard though this can also be put on its low budget of course.But a more positive thing about this movie is the way the soccer matches are being portrayed. What I liked was that it showed the game as the tough and hard game that it can be and you also don't necessarily have to understand the rules of the game to watch this film. It doesn't ever get into any technical details or tactics which makes this movie accessible to watch for basically everybody.You will perhaps like this movie better if you're a young girl with dreams but to me this movie was just being very average and I think I'm still being very kind to rate this movie still as 'highly' as I do because the more I think about this movie the less I'm starting to like it.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Tripod joins a succession of organisations including Metaphysical ImportExport and the Oceanic Podiatry Group and meets various individuals and groups of men who are trying to adjust themselves to a defeminized world. One man parodies childbirth by continually growing new organs which are removed from his body. Eventually Tripod comes upon a group of paedophiles which is holding a 5 yearold girl and they urge him to mate with her. He senses the presence of Antoine Rouge.";

On the soundtrack you can only hear the narrator strange noises sounds of seacreatures and for some stretches total silence.  Signs of Cronenbergs weird imagination is present throughout the narrative. I especially liked the quite extraordinary concept of creative cancer.The sterile modernistic architecture lends the movie a strangely desolate surreal tone and sets at least my imagination in motion. Its like stepping into another reality something Cronenberg has continued to achieve in the best of his subsequent movies. Its an experimental film but it succeeds in drawing the viewer into the picture not solely with its narrative but with its images and composition. In fact its not unlike what Kubrick did in much larger scope of course with 2001. Recommended for Cronenberg fans and those of you who arent afraid of something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "This line is normally where I put the plot but the plot is unclear to me... a group of people who live in an institution for bizarre venereal diseases perhaps? This film is David Cronenberg's followup to Stereo and aside from a slightly bigger budget and moving from monochrome to color it is clear that his themes have not shifted much if at all. He loves the medical institutions the sterile surroundings of the hospital and the imposing architecture camera shots repeatedly make the building look bigger and the hallways longer than the reality most likely is.He again talks of medical abnormality something he would visit again in Rabid and The Brood and Scanners. The special effects are played down here with a discussion of new organs having few visuals to back up the idea some indecipherable mass in a jar. The film as a whole is really an artistic exploration of minimalism. Most scenes involve characters sitting still for minutes at a time hardly any words are spoken though numerous discomforting sounds are heard. The whole film's plot is drawn out by a voiceover perhaps calling to mind Chris Marker's La Jetee.What differentiates great directors from poor ones is in my opinion the ability to know your limits and to stretch the limits while keeping the budget in mind. Cronenberg fits into this category of greatness. Like early Kubrick The Killing he knows he has no budget but makes up for it with stark contrast and searing images. While this is by no means Cronenberg's best work it is clear to see that given another script and a bigger budget he has the vision. He frames each scene very carefully the camera actually taking in more than is actually there in the process.Your average viewer would watch this and even at the very short 62 minute running time declare it a waste of film. Who wants to watch a bunch of ugly men in a courtyard while a voice talks about venereal disease and the need to impregnate a child? But a film student or scholar may see the film differently. Clearly knowing what we know now about Cronenberg's success makes me biased. But still the germ of directing genius is present here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crimes of the Future 1970 was made a year after Stereo and with a larger budget Cronenberg came out with an even more bizarre film based around sex and human nature. In this film he takes his cold clinical and dark view of the world a step further. A world filled with emotionless people who are devoid of individual thought and repressed beyond imagination. A doctor uses this to his advantage whilst sexually experimenting amongst patients within a mental hospital.This film is kind of hard to describe without giving away to much. But I found it to be comparable somewhat to THX 1138. In many ways you can compare the two. Cronenberg shot this faux documentary style accompanied by narration. The film reminded me of those videos that psychiatrists use when documenting extraordinary cases of psychosis and what not. Maybe that's what he trying to accomplish if he was he succeeded. However some of the scenes in this movie are not for all viewers those easily offended will be turned off by the subject matter.All in all it's a more polished film than Stereo and his filmmaking had matured. Cronenberg also experiments more with sound and editing. The technique he uses gives the viewers the impression that they're under a state of semihypnosis I don't know if they'll appreciate that or not. A interesting experimental film.For fans only.

	schema:reviewBody "Aaron Tripod is studying a patient at a clinic that can emit a chocolate like substance from his body which people become compelled to eat. This occurred after nearly all the woman on earth died from a poisonous cosmetic. After the patient disappears Aaron moves onto another clinic where there are more people of that type being used by doctor for his own purposes and there's a secret lurking in the facility that can change the fate of this outcome.Just like the film before this Stereo Cronenberg comes up with another experimental artfilm that combines his interest in literature and science. Especially that of the human body and sexual chemistry where science tries to manipulate the genetic makeup somehow. On this particular film the style and story's context are very similar to Stereo with most of the cast and crew returning for this project. I actually found this one to be slightly better and one incredibly bizarre trip compared to his previous film. But for this experience you have to be in the right frame of mind that's for sure as this one too goes for an hour but there are many padded scenes with many slow stretches. But for me it didn't seem to drag that much. Again there's no dialogues but there are some odd sound effects worked into the picture that sound like something out of nature bird cries ocean waves and even a sound like someone is blowing bubbles. This gave the film such a real anxiety but at times it did get a bit overbearing. Also you got a fitting narration that's gives out an mildly stimulating outlook and provides at times a coherent plot device. This could be because a plethora of characters spring out and then suddenly disappear which makes the story rather uneven as it changes course quite a bit. The static voice over is not as frequent here but it's the actions and faces that mostly tell the story. Now the look of the film is where Cronenberg was at his best here and the budget was a tad higher for this outing since now this one was shot in colour and production was of high quality with what he had to work with. Great use of composition and lighting while the strong shapes in the background features added a huge imprint. Plus there was always little things going in the foreground that you catch a glimpse of. The film sustains a bare atmosphere which has a emotionless postapocalyptic feel where everything is beyond redemption. The offbeat environment is filled with many surprises and the hypnotic images just flood the screen. The haunting conclusion stages one that's hard to forget. The camerawork here gives the film a third perspective and builds on the groundwork very well. Ronald Mlodzik's performance as Aaron Tripod is rather good and his expresses his actions in a clear and concise way. Cronenberg has come up with an far more accomplished effort on this occasion.This excursion I found strangely fascinating as you can easily see this as a stepping stool for Cronenberg to iron out those creases for future projects. He's obsession on the evolutionary process where sex and disease is controlled by science makes his work so unique. Again just like what I said on Stereo if you're looking for some entertainment look elsewhere. But if you want to see the where the clinical influence and cold style for his most assessable work came from there's no better place to start than here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well my favorite Cronenberg anyway. The dialogue is incredibly detailed with a seemingly pseudoscientific bent which in fact actually makes some sense if you pay attention! Many obscure facets of telepathy research are examined in a very BurroughsBallard style of writing coupled with an intense strangeness to the multiple voiceover narration. This is of course all helped out by the setting in a nightmare nearfuture after a major cosmetics related catastrophe has wiped out most of the female population. The men in the film have by a natural balancing process become more feminine more androgynous. However there is a secret lurking in this research institute a fresh organic young female secret... a secret worth dying for maybe. Truly fantastic experimental cinema that outre' film fans everywhere should at least check out! Note one of the subtly eerie things about this film is the lack of sound other than the voiceover. A recording by the San Franciscobased avantgarde soundtrack group SPOONBENDER 1.1.1 called 'Stereo Telepathy Academy' was released this year. It seems that the group took advantage of the fact that there is no sound in Crimes Of The Future and wrote a score for the film. They performed it live while the film was projected. I have it and have been lining it up to my DVD of Crimes at home! Awesome!".

The protagonist in Crimes of the Future Adrian Tripod is free from all judgment. It is exhilarating and hilarious to watch him respond to his environment. Cronenberg's writing of the voiceover narration is frightfully intelligent and ahead of its time. I believe this short film will gain popularity exponentially in the next ten years with its inclusion on the Fast Company DVD. Ronald Mlodzik's performance is overwhelmingly detailed and his delivery of the narration if it is him has more confidence if not arrogance than anything I've experienced in cinema. Perhaps Alexandra Stewart in Chris Marker's San Soleil can rival or Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange. You must see this!!!".

I think it is more interesting to remember than it is to watch. I view this movie and Stereo the same way. The narration is funny at times and has a very satirical and original style but it is not enough to keep one awake let alone keep ones interest. I think the lack of sound is due to Cronenberg's laziness and lack of desire to do any recording and mixing. Maybe I should give him more credit than that. Maybe it was lack of funds and knowlege.

This counts for postapocalypse since all women have died and the male survivors behave in a dreamlike state making it impossible for the protagonist and us the viewer to read the rationality that motivates their doings as well as in terms of preapocalypse as the ending leaves no doubt that mankind  this sort of mankind  is doomed. Many aspects later to be taken up in other of Cronenbergs films already appear here most prominently the subject of estranged skin diseases  later to become the new flesh. However fans of the latterday Cronenberg may be puzzled by this hardtocrack nut it is very different from what you might expect. It comes as no surprise that critics at the time the booklet mentions stated the young director is unlikely to continue filmmaking. And he did indeed change the direction.

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 2000 I posted three unnecessarily flippant reviews of David Cronenberg films including the two that followed this. But while the Cronenberg of 2000 wasn't a stranger to critical appraisal or even mainstream commercial appeal particularly in the 1980s it was easy to be flippant about a director who was so well known for body horror verging on schlock.Fast forward to 2012 and Cronenberg has managed to completely reinvent himself a late career renaissance as he prepares to enter his 70s. That the director could build a career for thirty years as the master of visceral horror and then completely reinvent himself is an extraordinary feat. That's not to say that his works of the new millennium haven't been sexually aware or even in possession of an asymmetrical prostate but suddenly he's a man of serious critical attention.Which makes it an ideal time to reinvestigate his early back catalogue in particular his first four films. 1966's student film Transfer is a study of mental illness an extremely rare 7 minute student film that to date only 55 people have seen on the IMDb... myself not included. Following this was arguably the most accessible of his first four efforts 1967's 13m student piece From The Drain. So esoteric that there are wholly different plot summaries of it on the net this story of two men in a bathtub is open to interpretation.The first film proper was 1969's Stereo a silent black and white piece with narration lasting a little over an hour. Crimes of the Future follows this trend though adds colour and ambient sound to the mix the minimalism possibly there as a budgetary requirement as much as a need for the avant garde. As films to study they're more than worth anyone's time particularly fans of the director and his work. As entertainments they're largely null and void a future auteur trying out his craft rather than narratives to engage. Five long years passed before Cronenberg got to do another film then averaging a picture every two years or so from 1975's Shivers until the present date. Seeing Shivers again as part of this study I realise I was perhaps too hard on it and it's interesting to see Cronenberg emerge from avant garde director to man behind a serious albeit black humoured narrative. The jump to full audio and speaking parts does make his direction look a little clumsy in places but this was a man honing his craft via experience. The issues with Shivers  the debatable misogyny the crass titillation and suspect subject matter  are actually all present in Crimes of the Future right down a sequence that involves paedophilia... in this case it forms Crimes' denouement. Such story elements are in highly questionable taste even for satirical science fiction and do paint the young Cronenberg out as a man who wanted to shock. However without these early ventures he may never have established a platform for himself as one of the most notable directors of the modern age.".

Among them Aaron Tripod Ronald Mlodzik a researcher coping in the new world now devoid of a moral compass. During his studies he encounters a patient which emits mysterious excretions tasting of chocolate. Once the subject inexplicably disappears Aaron employs himself in another clinic which serves as a compound for individuals with similar bodily substances. There he encounters the changing functions of the new man and its new flesh. All with true Cronenbergesque style...Similar in execution as Stereo with an upgrade from black and white into full colour but still experimentally coping without sound instead inputing odd disjointed sounds and a voiceover to convey the slightly misogynistic story. Rife with motifs featuring in Cronenberg's earlier works like Shivers The Brood or Scanners this artsy feature remains an intriguing expansion of Cronenberg's cinematographic worldview. Despite a larger budget than Stereo and undeniably better technical resolution with some excellent framing of shots Crimes of the Future is comparatively a step further into detrimental watching making novelties like fast forward necessary to survive the viewing.Nonetheless the overall experience remains an excruciating watch as a product of a student filmmaker overawed by his own brilliance but unaware that his supposedly nouvelle experiment in filmmaking is mostly unwatchable drivel. As such the style is almost unbearably selfdefeating making the story drown under the pretentious exposition and ultimate lack of direction. The script may sound cerebral however truthfully strongly undercut by an intellectual overreach but that does not excuse a total detachment from the viewing audience. Ultimately Cronenberg's venture feels overly childish in his introvert drive for novelty. Several scenes do manage to build a vague anxiety with it cold and distant atmosphere especially the layered denouement involving a bout of paedophilia.Best viewed for Cronenberg fanatics with a strong inclination towards understanding his perspective on film and exploring his growth as a filmmaker. Remaining subjects best resolve to focusing on his later works.".

Despite a larger budget than Stereo and undeniably better technical resolution with some excellent framing of shots Crimes of the Future is comparatively a step further into detrimental watching making novelties like fast forward necessary to survive the viewing.Nonetheless the overall experience remains an excruciating watch as a product of a student filmmaker overawed by his own brilliance but unaware that his supposedly nouvelle experiment in filmmaking is mostly unwatchable drivel. As such the style is almost unbearably selfdefeating making the story drown under the pretentious exposition and ultimate lack of direction. The script may sound cerebral however truthfully strongly undercut by an intellectual overreach but that does not excuse a total detachment from the viewing audience. Ultimately Cronenberg's venture feels overly childish in his introvert drive for novelty. Several scenes do manage to build a vague anxiety with it cold and distant atmosphere especially the layered denouement involving a bout of paedophilia.Best viewed for Cronenberg fanatics with a strong inclination towards understanding his perspective on film and exploring his growth as a filmmaker. Remaining subjects best resolve to focusing on his later works.";

Both films are very experimental and I'm going to guess that you could show both of them to a hundred different people and you'd probably get a hundred different explanations of the plot.

	schema:reviewBody "In Stphane Briz's restrained fourth film which he's adapted from a 1996 ric Holder novel a tightlipped mason named Jean Vincent Lindon in an unnamed provincial French town meets his little boy's schoolteacher the Mademoiselle of the title Sandrine Kiberlain and his world subtly changes. He loves his wife AnneMarie Aure Atika who works in a print shop and little Jrmy Arthur Le Houerou but Mademoiselle her name is Vronique but Jean never gets beyond the formal vous with her has a refinement a delicacy. And she plays the violin  classical music that Jean seems unfamiliar with but delighted by.At first Mademoiselle asks Jean at the last minute to fill in and speak to her class and his son's about his work an experience that also gives him great pleasure. Perhaps he enjoys indirectly telling this refined maiden lady who attracts him about his basic satisfying work building houses that are always different and will last as one child asks for your whole life. Then when she asks help with a broken window at her flat he takes a look and then insists on being the one to replace it. Then comes the music. He insists that she play photos and the violin tell him of her former profession.This film has only a hint of sex and no raw physicality but it works with the body with silence and with gesture. Throughout it shows Lindon acting the part by doing hard construction work on screen breaking up paving with a pneumatic drill mounting the window laying bricks of a wall and so on. He even walks like a skilled laborer. AnneMarie is always ironing cooking shopping making lists. Mademoiselle Chambon reads rests places her hand delicately on her neck. Jean tenderly washes the feet of his old father charming veteran JeanMarc Thibault.Finally the teacher plays a recording of chamber music at her place for Jean and as they sit together listening they slowly hold hands embrace and cling together as if at home but afraid to go further. This carefully paced sequence is one of the film's most effective. However many makeout scenes you may have seen this one still feels fresh. Lindon is like a fine mason in his acting slowly patiently laying the bricks of gesture. A silence and a pause can speak volumes.Both Vronique and Jean fight their attraction. And can it go anywhere? But it keeps growing despite gestures in the opposite direction. Jean tells Mademoiselle that her CD's interest him even though he hasn't listened to them yet. She usually changes schools every year but tells him in a key scene that she's been asked to fill in for someone and stay on. But instead of expressing enthusiasm Jean blurts out that his wife is pregnant.This is one anchor to the family one child and another coming. Another is Jean's father. Jean and AnneMarie are planning a big birthday party for the old man at their house with family members coming from all over. Family matters. But Jean shows how far his feelings have gone in another direction  even though we've seen only those restrained moments  when he invites Mademoiselle Chambon to come and play the violin for his father.

At the outset Jrmy poses a homework problem to his parents to find the direct object in a sentence and they haven't a clue but patiently figure out what this means. Biz is great with the children. Arthur Le Houerou as the son is unfailingly alive and natural and his classmates are spontaneous and charming though primed as classes are when they excitedly ask Jean about his work.If there is a weakness to the film it's the danger that the differences of class and culture are pelled out a little too clearly. Lindon is a magnificent actor but as a man with many illustrious relatives and onetime suitor of Princess Caroline of Monaco he is not exactly drawing on personal experience in playing a mason whose father was also a mason. Nonetheless he is for the most part utterly convincing. It's the film itself that plays on broad differences that a screenplay of 90 minutes duration cannot quite adequately delineate. Lindon has a harried careworn but solid quality that fits a working man in need of reawakening. Kiberlain seems held inward decent but tragically needy.

	onyx:emotionText "In Stphane Briz's restrained fourth film which he's adapted from a 1996 ric Holder novel a tightlipped mason named Jean Vincent Lindon in an unnamed provincial French town meets his little boy's schoolteacher the Mademoiselle of the title Sandrine Kiberlain and his world subtly changes. He loves his wife AnneMarie Aure Atika who works in a print shop and little Jrmy Arthur Le Houerou but Mademoiselle her name is Vronique but Jean never gets beyond the formal vous with her has a refinement a delicacy. And she plays the violin  classical music that Jean seems unfamiliar with but delighted by.At first Mademoiselle asks Jean at the last minute to fill in and speak to her class and his son's about his work an experience that also gives him great pleasure. Perhaps he enjoys indirectly telling this refined maiden lady who attracts him about his basic satisfying work building houses that are always different and will last as one child asks for your whole life. Then when she asks help with a broken window at her flat he takes a look and then insists on being the one to replace it. Then comes the music. He insists that she play photos and the violin tell him of her former profession.This film has only a hint of sex and no raw physicality but it works with the body with silence and with gesture. Throughout it shows Lindon acting the part by doing hard construction work on screen breaking up paving with a pneumatic drill mounting the window laying bricks of a wall and so on. He even walks like a skilled laborer. AnneMarie is always ironing cooking shopping making lists. Mademoiselle Chambon reads rests places her hand delicately on her neck. Jean tenderly washes the feet of his old father charming veteran JeanMarc Thibault.Finally the teacher plays a recording of chamber music at her place for Jean and as they sit together listening they slowly hold hands embrace and cling together as if at home but afraid to go further. This carefully paced sequence is one of the film's most effective. However many makeout scenes you may have seen this one still feels fresh. Lindon is like a fine mason in his acting slowly patiently laying the bricks of gesture. A silence and a pause can speak volumes.Both Vronique and Jean fight their attraction. And can it go anywhere? But it keeps growing despite gestures in the opposite direction. Jean tells Mademoiselle that her CD's interest him even though he hasn't listened to them yet. She usually changes schools every year but tells him in a key scene that she's been asked to fill in for someone and stay on. But instead of expressing enthusiasm Jean blurts out that his wife is pregnant.This is one anchor to the family one child and another coming. Another is Jean's father. Jean and AnneMarie are planning a big birthday party for the old man at their house with family members coming from all over. Family matters. But Jean shows how far his feelings have gone in another direction  even though we've seen only those restrained moments  when he invites Mademoiselle Chambon to come and play the violin for his father. It's not certain that his wife has suspected anything but she has noticed that Jean seems bored indifferent irritable. And she might suspect why now.What follows is surprising  agonizingly suspenseful  and quite familiar. We've seen this kind of story before. We've seen these characters before.

Jean Vincent Lindon is a construction worker happily married to AnneMarie Aure Atika and adoring father of young son Jrmy Arthur Le Hourou and loving son of his retired builder father JeanMarc Thibault he spends his hours away from his work tutoring his son with his wife and bathing his father's feet.

The presentation goes well and Vronique hesitantly asks Jean to repair a window in her home. Jean accepts the job AnneMarie thinks it is such a kind gesture that she asks Jean to invite Vronique to lunch. Jean replaces the window for the quietly reserved and anxious Vronique and afterward Jean noticing that Vronique plays the violin requests she play for him a 'tune'. It is obvious that the peripatetic teacher is lonely and it is also obvious that Jean is struck by the fact that a woman of education and musical talent would pay attention to a simple construction worker. In a weak moment the two exchange a kiss and that kiss alters the manner in which each of these two gentle people react to life. The results of this chance encounter play out in the conclusion of the story a story so tender and yet so grounded in the realities of life that it takes the viewer by the heart and doesn't let go. The many varying moments of intimacy whether those moments are between Jean and his son Jean and his father Jean and his wife and Jean with Mademoiselle Chambon are photographed like paintings by cinematographer Antoine Hberl. The entire cast is excellent and the performances by the five leading actors are superb. The musical score consists of original music by Ange Ghinozzi with a generous sampling of music by Sir Edward Elgar and others. This frail bouquet of a film appreciates silence the unspoken word and the natural emotions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. It is a multifaceted treasure. Grady Harp".

This is a film of nuance delicacy wordless communication yearning and sacrifice. Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Kiberlain  still technically married albeit separated  are simply two of the finest actors currently working in France which puts them in heady company. Individually they are superb but working together superb moves up a notch to outstanding. This is a film that definitely cannot be recommended to the Multiplex or cgi crowd as you will search in vain for violence gratuitous sex or even swearing but if you enjoyed Brief Encounter you will love this film in which very little happens a happily married builder with a young son meets the son's school teacher a sensitive lovely spinster who for reasons never explained is unattached. They are drawn together by a gentle imperceptible tide rather than explosive magnetic force and nowhere at no time does either one utter the 'L' word yet it dominates the action. Even knowing and accepting that Lindon is happy in his marriage we still long to see him connect with Kiberlain which is a measure of how powerful their understated acting is.

Mademoiselle Chambon is reminiscent of the films of veteran Eric Roehmer with its languid pace and visual style. Stephane Brize directs in a slow and restrained manner that accentuates the rhythms and banal routine of everyday life for these ordinary people. The film unfolds with lots of silences that build atmosphere and it is filled with a sense of longing. The performances of the two leads are excellent and they bring plenty of emotion and depth to their characters. The fact that Lindon and Kiberlain were once a reallife couple brings a dramatic frisson to their onscreen relationship and there is a great rapport and chemistry between them. Kiberlain apparently also learned to play the violin which lends credibility to a few scenes. Atika is also very good as Jean's wife who suspects that there is something troubling her husband.

At no point do we feel cheated shortchanged nor in the hands of any one who is doing any less than their utmost to tell a taut and engaging story about people at crossroads in their lives.Set in an unspecified French town the locale essentially doubling up as any town or city anywhere in the world we cover Vincent Lindon's Jean and his love interest the titular Mademoiselle Vronique Chambon played by Sandrine Kiberlain.

Away from that the scene additionally acts as a wonderful opener in its designs to wake the audience up to ask them to perhaps join in with the grammatical problem proposed to work it out for themselves  to get the mind working during this brief prelude to what is a riveting and intelligent character piece requiring such an attentive attitude. The boy speaks of how his teacher stood at the front of the class and spoke about what needs to be done in order to solve these problems the sentiment being that his teacher wouldn't have the trouble in solving what everyone else is struggling over. It is this teacher Kiberlain's aforementioned Vronique with whom Jean will come to interact before later loving.Guest lecturing at Jrmy's school in Vronique's class leads on to the visiting of her at home and the said repairing of her window furthermore leading onto Jean requesting to hear her play the violin she owns. That last instance of Vronique plucking up enough courage to play in front of another human being for the first time in a while encapsulates the superb acting throughout Briz's insistence on a static camera shot from medium distances allowing us to fully appreciate just how well Kiberlain does as she sits there and wrestles with the proposal of playing for someone she's known only for about a week. One finds it difficult to recommend the film enough it is so much more than a film fan's wet dream of static camera angles extended takes and the French language a burning and wholly engaging realist drama which ought to take its spot at the top of the tree regarding the best films of recent years.".

But the French seem to get matters of the heart right as in the full length film about longing Mademoiselle Chambon.Jean Vincent Lindon is a builder with an adorable boy and loving wife. Figuratively he has built a satisfying life yet the opening shot is of tearing down specifically a floor but contextually his life. Into this life comes his son's attractive teacher Veronique Chambon all violin playing and the sweetest disposition this side of the Virgin Mary. When he fixes her window he also begins building a relationship hanging around the edges of adultery.The longing comes from multiple shots with no dialogue typically European and specifically French because there is an artistic joy in the languid shots. The actors express their sweet frustration with small movements of their eyes and mouths and the camera stays with them for many seconds longer than the longest American takes.The climax comes when Jean's pregnant wife sees Veronique play violin at his father's birthday and sees Jean's very sympathetic response. The final act has the most action and that's not much and not necessarily what you expected. However it's done with the greatest subtlety as the tortured Jean makes his choices and the patient Veronique sheds just a few tears but meaningful ones so underplayed is her part.It's all quiet and slow just like most of our lives. Director Stephane Brize's love of this love affair and gentle Jean's attachment to his family is apparent from the opening sequence with the family figuring out what a direct object is to the lowkey final trip to the train station.Like Citizen Kane's Bernstein longing for the girl with the parasol Jean will probably never be the same having experienced the tyranny of lyrical love adulterous or not Mademoiselle Chambon.".

	schema:headline " Turgid predictable soaper from France holds few surprises";
	schema:reviewBody "Another overrated French film comes down the pike! This time it's a slow moving little soap opera called Mademoiselle Chambon. Because it's quiet and understated some people might mistake that for something profoundly emotional but in reality the characters are so paper thin in the end we can't possibly care for them.The protagonist is Jean a construction worker played by Vincent Lindon. He falls for Mademoiselle Veronique Chambon a shortterm contract schoolteacher played by Sandrine Kiberlain. Lindon and Kiberlain were married in real life but have subsequently separated. The film begins quite slowly as we are introduced to Jean his wife AnneMarie and their son Jeremy. Veronique is Jeremy's teacher and she invites Jean to answer questions about his job before a class full of inquisitive elementary school students. Veronique then has a paying job for Jean as one of her window shutters is broken so Jean comes over to fix it.You would think that Jean and Veronique have a lot to talk about like any normal people who are just getting to meet each other for the first time. But not so here in 'Mademoiselle Chambon'. One problem is that Jean appears to be depressed over his soulless marriage so that prevents him from opening up. He does take an interest in her violin playing and finally convinces her to play a tune. Veronique offers to lend a bunch of CDs to Jean which feature the piece she has just played for him. Veronique also appears to be suffering from some kind of malaise and we find out little about her except for the fact that she usually only stays for a year or so before moving on to take other teaching jobs in different parts of France.If Jean and Veronique seem a bit sketchy as characters the supporting players have even less to do. AnneMarie has one significant scene where she confronts Jean about being distant and there's also Jean's elderly father who makes a short trip with his son to check out some caskets anticipating his demise in a few years. As for Jeremy his parents are seen helping him with his homework at the beginning of the film.If the characters are paper thin the plot of 'Mademoiselle Chambon' is no different. Basically we're waiting until Jean decides to bed Veronique. He hesitates and at first communicates that he's unable to get physical because his wife has just informed him that she's pregnant with their second child. Veronique decides to give up her teaching job and go back to Paris after she concludes that Jean is tied up at home. She accepts Jean's invitation to play the violin at his father's 80th birthday party which is nice! But raging hormones cannot be contained and sure enough the concupiscent couple ultimately hop in the sack right before the film's climax.In grand soap opera tradition Veronique throws down the gauntlet and tells Jean in substance 'put up or shut up'.

	onyx:emotionText "Another overrated French film comes down the pike! This time it's a slow moving little soap opera called Mademoiselle Chambon. Because it's quiet and understated some people might mistake that for something profoundly emotional but in reality the characters are so paper thin in the end we can't possibly care for them.The protagonist is Jean a construction worker played by Vincent Lindon. He falls for Mademoiselle Veronique Chambon a shortterm contract schoolteacher played by Sandrine Kiberlain. Lindon and Kiberlain were married in real life but have subsequently separated. The film begins quite slowly as we are introduced to Jean his wife AnneMarie and their son Jeremy. Veronique is Jeremy's teacher and she invites Jean to answer questions about his job before a class full of inquisitive elementary school students. Veronique then has a paying job for Jean as one of her window shutters is broken so Jean comes over to fix it.You would think that Jean and Veronique have a lot to talk about like any normal people who are just getting to meet each other for the first time. But not so here in 'Mademoiselle Chambon'. One problem is that Jean appears to be depressed over his soulless marriage so that prevents him from opening up. He does take an interest in her violin playing and finally convinces her to play a tune. Veronique offers to lend a bunch of CDs to Jean which feature the piece she has just played for him. Veronique also appears to be suffering from some kind of malaise and we find out little about her except for the fact that she usually only stays for a year or so before moving on to take other teaching jobs in different parts of France.If Jean and Veronique seem a bit sketchy as characters the supporting players have even less to do. AnneMarie has one significant scene where she confronts Jean about being distant and there's also Jean's elderly father who makes a short trip with his son to check out some caskets anticipating his demise in a few years. As for Jeremy his parents are seen helping him with his homework at the beginning of the film.If the characters are paper thin the plot of 'Mademoiselle Chambon' is no different. Basically we're waiting until Jean decides to bed Veronique. He hesitates and at first communicates that he's unable to get physical because his wife has just informed him that she's pregnant with their second child. Veronique decides to give up her teaching job and go back to Paris after she concludes that Jean is tied up at home. She accepts Jean's invitation to play the violin at his father's 80th birthday party which is nice! But raging hormones cannot be contained and sure enough the concupiscent couple ultimately hop in the sack right before the film's climax.In grand soap opera tradition Veronique throws down the gauntlet and tells Jean in substance 'put up or shut up'. Jean does show up at the train station carrying a bag and it appears he's about to join Veronique as she boards the train but sure enough Jean realizes he has commitments at home and is unable to honor his promise to go to Paris with Veronique.So ends the turgid 'Mademoiselle Chambon'. Don't get me wrong it's a thoroughly watchable film and the acting and cinematography are fine. Nonetheless nothing much happens and when something does it's something we've seen a thousand times before.";

It tells the story about Jean a middleaged construction worker who lives a happy life in France with his wife AnneMarie and their young son. Jean is a good father and husband but his well structured life is shaken the day he is introduced to his son's attractive new teacher Veroniqu Chambon.This subtly and acutely directed French production which draws a humane and compelling portrayal of a family man who encounters love when he least expects it and begins to reconsider his feelings is a finely paced characterdriven and dialogdriven drama which examines themes such as family relations faith comingofage and love while depicting a tangible and internal study of character which shows the sometimes ambiguous nature of life. The fine photography by cinematographer Antoine Hberl the harmonic and naturalistic milieu depictions and the poignant use of sound and light emphasizes the emotionally charged atmosphere in this compassionate and romantic love story which is reinforced by French actor Vincent Lindon and French actresses Sandrine Kiberlaine and Aure Atika's heartfelt acting performances. A rarely moving and beautiful film which gained among other awards the award for Best Writing  Adaptation Stphane Briz and Florence Vignon at the Csar Awards in 2010.".

Unfortunately the director turns it into a tragedy of the weakness of man in the last minutes.The cast does such an excellent job of interpreting perfectly ordinary people that they become believable despite the perfection. Lindon looks talks and moves the part of a mason and Kimberlain is fragile and just old enough to be believable as an upperclass spinster. Their interaction mostly with looks and small gestures is at times painful in its subtlety.The score accompanies the story wonderfully in short it is quite a good film but I just was not in the mood for the fall of man.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the highest compliments I can pay a movie is that after watching it I find it hard to watch other movies. I am a huge movie fan and such films are rare. Mademoiselle Chambon is that kind of a movie. After watching it I couldn't watch any other film so I just watched Mademoiselle Chambon again. Mademoiselle Chambon does the best job of any film I've ever seen at capturing one particular life experience. Some loves make sense and fit neatly into our life narratives. We fall in love with a person because we've had extended contact with that person. We know that he is of an appropriate age social class belief system and occupation. We agree with this person on politics music and food. We have long talks with these rational loves and share life events. Other loves are wildly irrational they're like being overwhelmed by an invisible wind. We look across a crowded room catch the eye of a complete stranger and within moments or hours we know we are as in love as we will ever be. We're not in love because we've had a long conversation with this person and gotten to know them we haven't. We're not in love because we've shared key life events we have not. We don't decide on this type of love. It decides on us. With this love every tiny detail every evanescent nuance silent moments when nothing is said take on thunderous impact her eyes move from the floor to his shoulder her knees swing three inches toward his his lips slightly part. Our hearts pound. We surrender to the full thrust of love all of its physical and spiritual manifestations and yet we know next to nothing concrete about the other person. Perhaps we never see that person again. Perhaps we exchange a few stolen kisses or an afternoon of passion. Perhaps we connect forever perhaps we say a heartwrenching goodbye. Mademoiselle Chambon captures wordless irrational love. Jean Vincent Lindon is a rumpled paunchy middleaged construction worker. He is married to AnneMarie a factory worker. They have one son Jeremy. AnneMarie is hurt on the job and can't pick up Jeremy from school. Jean must go. There he encounters Mademoiselle Veronique Chambon Sandrine Kiberlain Jeremy's teacher. And Jean will never be the same. Jean and AnneMarie have a few other meetings. Not much is said. Not much happens. A passerby carefully observing their encounters would have no idea that he or she was witnessing an event that neither Jean nor Veronique will ever forget. Many slow movies bore me to tears. Mademoiselle Chambon is a slow movie and it never bored me. I came to understand that every line of dialogue every apparently casual scene is a minefield packed with meaning. In the opening scenes Jean reveals his awkward inability to help his son with his homework. This prepares us for the story of an inarticulate construction worker who falls in love with a school teacher. The topic of his son's homework is the direct object  the object acted upon by the noun  or by fate. In a couple of scenes of Veronique's apartment the viewer catches a glimpse of Bernini's statue of a helpless St. Teresa of Avila being pierced with an arrow of passion by a smiling cherub. St. Teresa is very much the direct object of that arrow as are Jean and Veronique. Passion is beautiful and painful life affirming and life threatening. Passion is both sexual and sacred. Jean is shown both tearing down and putting up walls. These walls are metaphorical as well as actual. Three scenes in this movie are as definitive a treatment of their subject matter as any scene in any film. In one a musician plays music with her back to her audience. Before she begins she turns around with a luminous look of vulnerability. In another two people listen to a piece of music. I won't describe the third scene to you because I don't want to give too much of the plot away but if you see the film you'll know what I mean. Mademoiselle Chambon is not perfect. It is underproduced in Dogme95 style. Actors don't wear makeup there's no professional lighting to speak of. Mademoiselle Chambon would have worked better for me with higher production values. I got to know Jean but I was never sure of Veronique. I wanted to like her more than I did to understand her very hard choices better and to respect her choices more. Aure Atika is miscast. I never believed her as a factory worker or as Jean's wife. And the ending struck me as incomplete and unsatisfying. I think the filmmaker wanted to make a movie that would ravish audiences emotionally. That he did. I wanted to have an intellectual understanding of how these events would play out in the future of the characters. I didn't get that from this movie and I left it feeling that a sequel is necessary. Finally of course this film is like the classic David Lean film Brief Encounter starring Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. I think that film gives the viewer more of a sense of the fullness of all the characters and how the events shown during the film will play out in the characters' lives in the future. In short to me Brief Encounter felt more like a complete work of art.".

I think that film gives the viewer more of a sense of the fullness of all the characters and how the events shown during the film will play out in the characters' lives in the future. In short to me Brief Encounter felt more like a complete work of art.";

But before they leave they need a new X.O. and among the choices is Commander Hunter who hasn't seen much action. But the ship's Captain Ramsey OK's him. While on the way there was an incident and Hunter disagreed with how Ramsey handled it it's evident that Ramsey doesn't think much of Hunter because Hunter was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given orders to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order the ship's communications were damaged so the entire message was not received. Ramsey decides to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to reestablish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to the task so they team up to retake control. But Hunter has taken ...";

	schema:headline " Perspective from a real nuclear submariner";
	schema:reviewBody " I wrote a lot more but had to edit cause of the 1000 word limit As a drama Hollywood type sub flick I gave Crimson Tide a 6. But I just watched it on HBO tonight and have to say it is one of the most unrealistic sub movies I've ever seen. I was in the silent service and qualified in submarines. Of course a lot of what I'll write would not bother the casual viewer but the discrepancies details and plot were just too much to overlook. To start with Gene Hackman's dog coming underway with him is a load of Huey and really made me look down on this picture from the beginning. The Chief of Naval Operations himself would not or could not bring a pet on a ship with him. They threw in a few catchy phrases and buzz words but for the most part the terminology used in the control room was made up. Even for an Ohio class boat the set for the movie's submarine was entirely too spacious. The crawl spaces the XO used to sneak into the control room was ludicrous. Submarines do not have anything like that. They are tightly packed with equipment and machinery and simply do not have that kind of space.I still don't understand how the reactor was scrammed and lost propulsion from the torpedo that hit in the stern and caused all that flooding. If anything was damaged that badly it's not getting fixed at sea. This isn't Star Trek. The radio scenario was absolute rubbish as well. There are so many redundant comms systems on board and inside the radio shack no way would one receiver getting fried completely isolate the ship from command authority. The EAMs might have looked good on the screen but the real deal and Sealed Authentication System is so much more complicated it's not even funny. There is literally dozens of yellow pages thick manuals covering nuclear command and control systems and without going into classified details I cannot believe something like this could ever happen on board a US submarine.There is no way people would be aiming guns around like they were in the movie either. On a real submarine which is packed with 3000 pound hydraulics and high pressure air systems 1 bullet could kill everyone in a compartment in which it was discharged. The beginning of the movie with the fire in the galley was a load too. Fires are the biggest threat to ships safety and if they had a fire in real life the CO would immediately surface the ship to fight it. A fire in such an enclosed space would make so much smoke within minutes you couldn't see your hand in front of your face and the ship would have to emergency ventilate. Let alone the nonchalant way they dealt with that one guy dying. And of course no real submarine CO would run a drill 2 minutes after securing from a real fire. If someone was killed in a casualty the CO would be sweating bullets.Tony Soprano making that fat dude drop and do push ups on the bus. Talk about unprofessional. People have an unrealistic view of military discipline. That may happen in boot camp but not in the real fleet. Also that COB was unbelievably fat. No he wouldn't fit on a submarine and they don't even let people that big in the military. Also these SSBN's are on tightly regimented patrol cycles with 2 crews. There are always some on patrol in alert status. The XO and weps wouldn't get paged to get underway. If they were on their offcrew period the other crew blue or gold would have the ship and it would already be at sea. If something goes down you need subs ready to launch already you may not have the luxury of even the time it took the Alabama to get underway.The entire crew wears puppy suits underway officers included. Also you don't salute underway. If the captain walks by you acknowledge him but don't salute. The movie really made enlisted people look dumb imo. They are the experts on the ship's systems. And officers usually are the ones asking the dumb questions. The fight in the crew's mess over the silver surfer was a huge stretch. They give psych tests and such to submariners one of the main goals to weed out people who can't handle stress and are hot heads. Not to say people wouldn't argue but if they were throwing punches they'd have both been written up and in deep .And the last thing was the ending. If anything remotely happened like this in real life you can bet the Commanding Officer who held a loaded gun to an innocents head would be court marshaled and sent to prison. Not just allowed to quietly retire. Also no CO has the pull to just get their XO a command. Less than half of XOs even make the cut and get command. You have to be the creme de la creme to get command of a nuclear submarine and follow a strict career outline. It was an enjoyable movie. But I've read some of the threads about who's side would you be on Hackman's or Washington's and really the whole scenario is just beyond anything that is remotely reasonable! This movie was the Deep Impact of sub flicks. Might as well have said Alabama was going to drill through the bottom of the ocean floor and disturb the earth's core to cause a magnetic flux that would stop the Russian missiles from launching. LOL Bottom line its a decent flick but don't think it is even close to accurate or realistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "As CRIMSON TIDE opens we visit various crew members of the USS Alabama as they bid farewell to their loved ones.  For one man Lt. Cmdr. Ron Hunter Denzel Washington it will be his first time as second in command of a nuclear submarine.  Capt. Frank Ramesy Gene Hackman is in charge and is not shy about letting everyone know.  He is a seasoned veteran as juxtaposed with the young idealistic Hunter.  The early scenes do much to set up the main conflict of the film.  For example when members of the crew discuss Carl Von Clausewitz and his 1832 work Vom Kriege On War the intellectual showdown occurs between Ramesy and Hunter.  This scene not only heightens the tension but also reveals the different philosophies of these two men what they believe in why they are there.  This short scene goes a long way to setting up why each of these characters are so unbending when the crisis presents itself.The Crisis  The ship has been damaged and the EAM contact that has been received is disjointed.  The Russian force who is never very carefully explained is fueling rockets for use against the US.  That's all they know. The captain wants to surface and fire Hunter thinks he's wrong. Factions form but the film does a good job presenting a good argument for both desicions although you get the sense that the film makers lean towards the dove side rather than the hawks.  As tensions mount there are various shifts in power and the crew stands divided.  Every member of the crew watching as the minutes tick by closer and closer to the final moment of truth...Hackman is at the top of his form here as the relentlessly tough Ramesy. When given a good script with room to work there is few better at creating a solid performance.  The looks he gives the way he uses his eyes his speech patterns simply wonderful to watch.  Washington is just as good as Hunter and the showdown between these two men near the end sends sparks flying off the screen.  The rest of the cast is filled out with strong actors Matt Craven George Dzundza pre LOTR's Viggo Mortensen and pre 'Sopranos' James Gandolfini.As is well known the script received various rewrites from Robert Towne the Clausewitz scene Steve Zaillian and Quentin Tarantino the Silver Surfer references the scene where the crew chimes in about other submarine movies.  All these different contributions blends fairly well together. The story is tough and direct and touches on points that heighten the tension.  The photography by Dariusz Wolski DARK CITY THE CROW is tight and atmospheric Hans Zimmer's score pounding and reflective.  The VIP vote however goes to Tony Scott who proves himself with this film.  He knows when to hold shots and doesn't rush the action as he did with TOP GUN he paces the film well and let's his actors work for him.  CRIMSON TIDE is an entertaining and challenging film that along with films like THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and DAS BOOT may set the high water mark forgive the pun for the genre.  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "The suspense is relentless in this believable tense and superbly acted war drama. One of the best modern war movies I have seen Crimson Tide is a story about strained loyalty respect command discipline power and military practice. Hackman and Washington are perfectly cast as an older battlehardened nuclear submarine captain and his younger less experienced but highly educated executive officer caught in a crisis of potentially worldthreatening proportions. Pursued by an enemy submarine the USS Alabama has nuclear warheads aimed and ready to fire as a preemptive strike against a Russian rebel commanding his own nuclear arsenal. The Alabama is commanded to launch and begins preparations but the enemy sub attacks knocking out all communications just as a second command is being received. The nature of that second command and what to do about then becomes the key problem that the Captain and XO have to deal with. Suffice to say they do not agree on how to proceed and the remainder of the film is a struggle between the two men and those who support each in a crippled but still lethal sub with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.What's is amazing about Michael Schiffer's story is its plausibility. The basic scenario upon which the script is based could happen. The cast  all of them  are spectacular and the directing is masterful. Although some of the behavior of the men aboard the Alabama seems improbable at times given the military realities of chain of command and discipline the sheer performance power of this film's cast and production team make it all seem very real and extremely compelling. the characters are HUGE complex and real. More than just a cautionary tale this is a very human drama about who people become under extreme conditions and how they work out problems to reach solutions or fail to do so. If that final sentence sounds cryptic then let it entice you to see the film so you can figure out what I mean for yourself.".

The torpedo attack with the Russian sub was so fastpaced and packed with energy that it makes you bounce in your seat. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington gave awesome performances and their growing tension towards each other is enough to keep the excitement at a consistent high through the last half of the film. I don't appreciate how Hackman's character is regarded by most moviegoers as a mad man. He is just simply a seasoned toughasnails military officer who must assume that the US is in danger and he must stick by the orders that require him to go to drastic measures to protect us. The director did a good job at raising the tension even though the ending was very predictable. The message at the very start of the film set the perfect tone. The entire film is in a way scary by making us wonder if what would happen in a situation like this and how could the military establish proper operating procedures for it. However the message at the end of the film reestablishes some hope. 910 and I love the creative title.".

But anyway during the after texts i felt relief. 1.45 h of submarine command language can take its toll and be pretty indigestible.The only thing that prevents me from putting a solid 8 out of 10 for this effort from Tony Scott are the totally unnecessary racial remarks made by Hackmans character captain Ramsey at the end of the movie. The Lipizzaner dialog could easily have been replaced with something else. It was very irritating and ridiculous simply because if Ramsey had preferences in skin color he wouldn't have chosen a black man as an X.O. in the first place right?The served purpose was of course to help the viewer to take sides in the conflict but the audience had already done that. The audience had already understood that Ramsey associated Hunter with Harvard and military school theory and that he thought of him as a softy. The moment Hunter takes control of the conn the sympathies lies with him.Ramsey with his happy triggerfinger and shoot first ask questions later attitude was the stereotype perhaps needed to push some moral points about the problems with blind obedience and the ever recurring need of critical thought especially amongst men in control of nukes. The audience got it but to make sure the viewers didn't have any sympathies for the old commiehater he must be throwing some racial epithets too. The choice in making characters over explicitly bad is quite common in Hollywood though but more often than not the drama itself suffers from this practice. Characters made more shallow and onedimensional who wants that except the studio bosses? If they dumb it down and keep it within the stereotypes maybe they think it's easier to go break even who knows? But in the same way as the US military can be saved from personnel like Ramsey maybe a well educated middle class one day can save the world from risk reducing studio bosses by demanding a dismantling of the stereotypes we all cherished and consumed for too long.".

	schema:headline " Denzel Washinton's best movie period";
	schema:reviewBody "Crimson Tide is one of my favorites and to me is the best submarine movie ever made. And I don't understand why people say the The Hunt for Red October is THE submarine film. Because to me THFRO was very long and moved at a snail's pace and also the murky underwater action scenes were hard to look at because you could hardly see what was going on.However Crimson Tide is an improvement in my opinion. It's over 2 hours long but its pace moves by so fast that you're not gonna realize it. But if you're looking for tons of explosions and gunfire then this ain't your kind of movie it happens to be more suspenseoriented. Otherwise you can just check out Die Hard Terminator or Aliens for the actionpacked extravaganza that most people want. But I guess the scene in which the subs face off and each are firing the torpedoes at each other could be considered action. And that scene in probably the best part of the entire movie since there is no way anyone could resist the suspense and especially when the sub is sinking and the water pressure is rising and it could compress at any second.Without going on and on too much I'll just give the basic premise of the movie so you won't get too confused. It's been a couple years after the Soviet Union collapsed and now a radical leader and his followers are trying to takeover the Russian government and is threatening to launch nuclear missiles into both the United States and Russia itself if they interfere with him. And the USA sends a submarine with nuclear missiles out to the Pacific Ocean in case the event of when the Russian missiles are launched and they could instantly counterattack. But the two commanding officers clash on whether or not the missiles should be fired since they are debating if Russia is attacking or not. But since they are so far down in sea level they can't communicate to get their orders. At first it may seem uninteresting but you'll realize how much suspense and tension is in here when you see it.As for the acting well what can I say? Denzel Washington has gotta be the greatest method actor in Hollywood right now and Crimson Tide is a prime example. So far in his career he already won an Oscar for Glory and Training Day in which he gave two outstanding performances that will forever be remembered in Hollywood. But his work in Crimson Tide is and I dare say tops both of his Oscarwinning performances. He plays the lead role as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter who is objecting his Captain's orders to attack Russia since it would cause a complete nuclear holocaust with billions of deaths involved.Gene Hackman who is another Hollywood favorite is Captain Frank Ramsey the crazy old guy who will stop at nothing to ensure that World War III between the USA and Russia happens. His character even preferred to have a missile drill happening when the sub had a fire and its safety was endangered and as a result an officer lost his life.Hackman's character represents the way the USA was before in a time of war and they seeked anything to get involved in that war so other countries would fear them. Washington's character symbolizes what the USA is like during the 1990's and they would try to stay as neutral as possible. Also the scene when Denzel and Gene are arguing and shouting over each other about the nukes and before the mutiny happens has gotta be one of the greatest acted scenes ever. And this basically provides the tension that makes Crimson Tide what it is as a film. And the bulk of the movie the question Will they launch or not? goes on. Just watch it and found out.Also the dialogue is among the best I've ever heard and heck I'll say that it even challenges Pulp Fiction as having some of the best lines ever. What's interesting is that Quentin Tarantino provided some of it in here and that's clearly evident. The Silver Surfer reference and the submarine movie trivia are the real punchups here. My favorite line from this is You don't put on a condom unless you're gonna fk!.Crimson Tide is an excellent thriller movie that stands out because of the suspense the tension the acting and the punchy dialogue. Do yourself a favor and forget The Hunt for Red October! Crimson Tide will blow you away!".

Only this limits it to getting a 7 out of 10 in my book.".

However it is intelligent and definitely a cut above the actionthriller stereotype.Superbly acted by the best  never fail actors Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman  they keep the tension at an eerily high peak throughout the film.Who should see this film action movie buffs borderline action lovers who won't build false expectations that there's a lot of deep issues and drama going on here Arty types who are refined enough to appreciate the acting sets and dialogue even if they don't normally like action filmsSuspense plays a large role in the film so once you've seen it you know what's coming and may not wish to see it again someday. Only this limits it to getting a 7 out of 10 in my book.";

	schema:headline " A Post ColdWar Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "How does one make a Cold War thriller now that the Cold War is over? One way of doing this would be simply to make the film as a historical period piece and this was the solution adopted in another submarine drama the more recent K19 The Widowmaker. Political thrillers however are at their most effective when they confront us with a scenario that could happen today or in the near future and lose some of their impact when they deal with something that might have happened but didn't in the past. The Crimson Tide deals essentially with something that might have happened in the sixties or seventies but in order to maintain its immediacy it is set in the nineties with a group of nationalist Russian rebels playing the part that the Soviet government might have played in an earlier film. A similar device was used in Air Force One another political thriller from the midnineties.The action mostly takes place on board an American nuclear submarine the USS Alabama against the background of a revolt in the Russian Far East against the Russian Government. The rebels have seized control of the Vladivostok naval base and are threatening to launch nuclear missiles against America should government forces attempt to retake the area. The American Government are considering launching a preemptive strike against the rebels and the crew of the Alabama await their orders.At the heart of the drama on board the Alabama are two very different officers the submarine's aggressive commander Captain Ramsey and his more cautious liberal secondincommand LieutenantCommander Hunter. After an order is received to launch a strike against the rebels the ship is attacked by a Russian submarine. A second message starts to come in but because communication is lost during the engagement it is incomplete. Hunter believes that the second message may be a recall of the earlier order to launch missiles and refuses to concur with Ramsey's command to launch. When Ramsey orders the crew to proceed without Hunter's concurrence Hunter attempts to take over command of the ship in a plot development reminiscent of The Caine Mutiny.Both Ramsey and Hunter are convinced that they are in the right. Ramsey fears that any delay in launching will leave America vulnerable to a first strike by the rebels. Hunter fears that launching the ship's missiles without waiting for clarification of the second message will lead to fullscale nuclear war. There is however little doubt that the film's sympathies lie with Hunter. Technically he may have been in breach of naval regulations in refusing on the basis of an ambiguous message which lacked the vital confirmation codes to confirm his captain's order but it would be a strange film which made a character who wants to initiate a nuclear exchange more sympathetic than a character who wishes to prevent one.A submarine is a hermetic and claustrophobic environment and makes an excellent setting for a thriller. Director Tony Scott develops the tension very well with some very effective scenes especially the duel between the Alabama and the Russian sub and the scenes where Ramsey and Hunter and their respective supporters among the crew battle one another for control of the ship. We are never allowed to forget that very big issues perhaps nothing less than the future of the world itself are at stake. Both Gene Hackman as Ramsey and Denzel Washington as Hunter play their parts very well bringing out the contrasting characters of the two men. I would agree with the reviewer who complained that the ending with its implausible reconciliation between Ramsey and Hunter was unconvincing but that apart I found this a highly effective edgeofyourseat action thriller. 710".

First of all a mutiny aboard any US Naval vessel particularly a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member. I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed then drummed from the Navy. It is no surprise the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film. Lastly if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.".

	schema:headline " A major disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "As a former ballistic missile submariner I can tell you that this movie bears about as much relation to anything faintly resembling reality as Happy Gilmore does to professional golf  but at least the latter film was pretty funny in an Adam Sandler kind of way. Crimson Tide lacks any sort of comparable redeeming virtue but is purely an adolescent fantasy best suited for those who have never considered actually thinking in the least about the subject matter of what they watch. This was a big disappointment for myself and other submariners who out of some necessity HAVE actually thought about the issues it poses  after all we were the ones who might have actually had to push the button actually it was a trigger in a pistol grip in the middle of the night one night  and were left feeling very much let down by the film's complete failure to deal with them in a mature adult intelligent dramatic context. This is especially true given the tremendous potential of the leading players Gene Hackman as the captain and Denzel Washington as the executive officer always abbreviated in the Navy as X.O.  who on earth who knew Thing One about the Navy  any part of the Navy  would ever refer to him as the exo? and the more thoughtful way the plot begins to develop. But eventually it deteriorates into a farfetched underwater version of a 1950's 'B'grade western shoot'emup totally unworthy of its highpowered acting talent. Hoping for something along the lines of Seven Days in May or The Bedford Incident or even Dr. Strangelove we instead got something utterly vacuous. As one submariner I know recently put itWhen we went to see the movie in the theater it was all I could do to keep from walking out. The premise depicted in the movie was so utterly ridiculous! In my view there were two subliminal messages being conveyed. The first that our deterrent system as it was in those days had too many weaknesses to be reliable. The idea that those in the command structure would circumvent the safety controls and the procedures in place based solely on a some idealistic difference of opinion with the CO was completely foreign to me. Secondly the racial overtones suggested in this movie were something I never witnessed during my 20 year career. It would be very naive of me to say those things didn't exist in other communities within the Navy or in the other services. However the crews of the 4 submarines I served in were all way above that kind of nonsense. The movie in question here didn't offer a true vision of reality but may have been a good Hollywood story. The problem was and is that the general public seems to accept these inaccurate depictions as the gospel truth.If you feel you must see this film I suggest the VHS version in preference to the DVD because it should rent for less and thus you will waste less money.".

Ultimately the stark choice between life and death between fiction and reality can become blurred when cut off from the world inside a deep sea submarine.  How many times has this happened one can only wonder.

It's easy to criticise many technical mistakes in the film and some of the improbabilities but the main points were made and shown well. This film rates just as high as Red October which was of a similar theme but also excellent.  I wonder if Burt Lancaster ever sees these films?

How did this guy get to this position with so much contempt for authority? You receive confirmed orders to launch missiles. You lose radio contact at 550 feet depth. You have a sub trying to blow you up. You cannot launch until 150 feet depth. Why not follow orders and avoid the attack submarine if you are going to be back in radio range well before launch depth? The COB does not arrest the XO when instructed by the Captain however he is more than willing to arrest the Captain when instructed by the XO? This movie seems to have been written by someone who has utter contempt andor lack of understanding of our military. Give me a break The Captain was right for most of the movie. Then to end this thing with you were both right and both wrong?? The Captain recommends the XO get his own boat? I don't get this movie at all.".

Maybe part of the problem is I am former military but this made me stop about 14 of the way through and say What the hell are they doing?I will say this was beautifully filmed the cinematography was superb and the tight quarters and claustrophobic feeling aboard the submarine was portrayed beautifully. The action sequences and the tension were also portrayed very well.But the content of the story was garbage. Nothing like this would ever happen on a nuclear submarine without dire consequences. The Captain of a ship has that position for a reason. He is the Commanding Officer of that ship and that is a powerful and sacred thing. To simply take over command by force because you don't agree with how he's doing things is behavior that used to bring the penalty of death. Basically that's all Washington's character did. Whether he thinks the right thing is being done or not the Captain is the Captain and you cannot pull a stunt like this because you think you can outthink him. This was not a good example of a circumstance when a forcible takeover would be permissible. This was an example of newage selfesteem assertivenesstraining hogwash. With Denzel Washington smoldering and strutting right through the middle of it.Boys will be boys! At the end Hackman and Washington are basically slapped on the hand given a stern talkingto told to not do it again and allowed to go on their merry way. Everybody shakes hands and the world is a better place for it. For crying out loud.........Filmmakers feed us garbage like this because most people honestly don't know any better.

ActingSarrazin can exude an extraordinary amount of emotion through his eyes casting editingwith extremely few slightly weak moments pacing direction cinematography lighting music production design everything it's all amazing. This is a very difficult film to watchwhich is by no means to say that I regret doing so. It is not entertainment nor is it something to escape one's everyday life with. It is brutal and uncompromising a window into an era and an event both of which show humanity at its worst. A masterpiece. I intend to look for other films by Pollack there is no doubt about that... fortunately my fiance has told me that he has done lighter fareI would prefer watching something less bleak than this for the next of his movies I view. This is a very important movie particularly in today's world where reality shows are all over TV. I recommend this to anyone certain that they can sit through it. 810".

Meanness and suffering sells today and apparently it sold back then as well. The M.C. of the dance marathon played wonderfully by Gig Young in one of his last if not the last film performances before the troubled actor murdered his wife and then killed himself creates little narratives and dramas around each of the dancers so that the audience can have their favorites to root for.

Bleak as it is it's also entertaining in a rather morbid way making us feel like we're members of the audience watching this sick spectacle and making it that much harder for us to condemn the film audience without labeling ourselves as hypocrites.Grade A".

	schema:headline " People as Expendable Cattle";
	schema:reviewBody "In this movie's only moment of deadpan black humor a nurse asks Gloria Beatty Jane Fonda after an exhausting dance session that has lasted nearly 1000 hours Can I get you something for your feet? Her response as black as night is How about a saw? Taken out of context her retort would inspire at least a barf of nervous laughter  comic relief mirroring the temporary relief that particular something would give Gloria. But knowing the fury that her character has this dissatisfaction with life in general it wouldn't be a far stretch to see her amputate her feet right off and be done with it as the band plays on and Gig Young herds his cattle into mindless motion for a promise of a little over one grand as a prize. She has nothing she expects nothing  and this is her last exit to a better life.Such is the heroine of Horace McCoy's novel of the same name which appeared in 1935 and told a story so lurid it could not possibly be true that of the horror of dance marathons in which people down on their luck danced for interminable hours with brief rest periods no longer than 15 minutes and all for free food and money. The ultimate price to pay for an era of abundance turned inside out into the belly of the beast the Depression Era was. All the time while Ginger and Fred danced under the stars and brought Hollywood magic to their eyes all false promises. The greater irony is that its plot is set right at the edge of the world the West where dreams have been known to come true especially for aspiring actors looking for their Big Break. That it was written by someone who was himself in the fringes is only fitting some of the more effective stories come from people at the edges of society.In a tone similar to Hubert Selby's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM several characters are caught under the wheels of the American Dream and the need to escape the rampant poverty that had the nation under a vise. Dancing with Gloria are Robert Syverton Michael Sarrazin who seems to have committed a crime which makes this a story told in extensive flashbacks Alice LeBlanc Susannah York who with partner Joel Robert Fields aspired to be a star Ruby Bonnie Bedelia and James Bruce Dern a young married couple expecting their first child and the Sailor Red Buttons a veteran of dance marathons. Rocky Gig Young the emcee holds the ultimate poker card as to who will win this coveted prize and has the morals of a twodollar bill.What neither of them begin to suspect is that there is no light at the end of this tunnel. Rocky the emcee as corrupt as he is is the only one who knows the final outcome and plays the game and each contestant until many of them literally fall dead... or worse become raving lunatics moving for the sake of moving. Like the quick fix that the characters of REQUIEM were hooked on he is just that to these people who soon progress from dancers full of life to zonedout zombies in one horrific shot where we see their reflections through shards of broken glass their eyes staring looking at nothing as they shuffle about in mockdancing. Alice will lose her dreams and turn into a shell of her former self a scene in which she tries to seduce Robert is painful especially when it happens right by a picture of an actress she emulates Jean Harlow. Gloria will become even more bitter and a sense of Hell on Earth will be the dominant feeling once the stakes become higher. And throughout it all the dance.But if the dancing in itself is punishing nothing can account or compare to the two horrifying sequences where all of the contestants must race around the ballroom and avoid at all costs at being the last three couples grounds for elimination. The first of them runs for the entire duration of its ten minutes and is a reverse chariot sequence in BEN HUR instead of chariots there are desperate people  one of them Ruby is seven months pregnant  and instead of a whip we have the emcee.

	onyx:emotionText "In this movie's only moment of deadpan black humor a nurse asks Gloria Beatty Jane Fonda after an exhausting dance session that has lasted nearly 1000 hours Can I get you something for your feet? Her response as black as night is How about a saw? Taken out of context her retort would inspire at least a barf of nervous laughter  comic relief mirroring the temporary relief that particular something would give Gloria. But knowing the fury that her character has this dissatisfaction with life in general it wouldn't be a far stretch to see her amputate her feet right off and be done with it as the band plays on and Gig Young herds his cattle into mindless motion for a promise of a little over one grand as a prize. She has nothing she expects nothing  and this is her last exit to a better life.Such is the heroine of Horace McCoy's novel of the same name which appeared in 1935 and told a story so lurid it could not possibly be true that of the horror of dance marathons in which people down on their luck danced for interminable hours with brief rest periods no longer than 15 minutes and all for free food and money. The ultimate price to pay for an era of abundance turned inside out into the belly of the beast the Depression Era was. All the time while Ginger and Fred danced under the stars and brought Hollywood magic to their eyes all false promises. The greater irony is that its plot is set right at the edge of the world the West where dreams have been known to come true especially for aspiring actors looking for their Big Break. That it was written by someone who was himself in the fringes is only fitting some of the more effective stories come from people at the edges of society.In a tone similar to Hubert Selby's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM several characters are caught under the wheels of the American Dream and the need to escape the rampant poverty that had the nation under a vise. Dancing with Gloria are Robert Syverton Michael Sarrazin who seems to have committed a crime which makes this a story told in extensive flashbacks Alice LeBlanc Susannah York who with partner Joel Robert Fields aspired to be a star Ruby Bonnie Bedelia and James Bruce Dern a young married couple expecting their first child and the Sailor Red Buttons a veteran of dance marathons. Rocky Gig Young the emcee holds the ultimate poker card as to who will win this coveted prize and has the morals of a twodollar bill.What neither of them begin to suspect is that there is no light at the end of this tunnel. Rocky the emcee as corrupt as he is is the only one who knows the final outcome and plays the game and each contestant until many of them literally fall dead... or worse become raving lunatics moving for the sake of moving. Like the quick fix that the characters of REQUIEM were hooked on he is just that to these people who soon progress from dancers full of life to zonedout zombies in one horrific shot where we see their reflections through shards of broken glass their eyes staring looking at nothing as they shuffle about in mockdancing. Alice will lose her dreams and turn into a shell of her former self a scene in which she tries to seduce Robert is painful especially when it happens right by a picture of an actress she emulates Jean Harlow. Gloria will become even more bitter and a sense of Hell on Earth will be the dominant feeling once the stakes become higher. And throughout it all the dance.But if the dancing in itself is punishing nothing can account or compare to the two horrifying sequences where all of the contestants must race around the ballroom and avoid at all costs at being the last three couples grounds for elimination. The first of them runs for the entire duration of its ten minutes and is a reverse chariot sequence in BEN HUR instead of chariots there are desperate people  one of them Ruby is seven months pregnant  and instead of a whip we have the emcee. It is interminable and hits home at just how inhuman this contest is. The second one is even more terrible the unforgettable image of Jane Fonda dragging the Sailor behind her back a symbolic horse trying to remain in the game.THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? comes with a heavy dose of nihilism that would be the tone set throughout the Seventies and in many ways it can be said that Seventies cinema began in 1969 with this and with MIDNIGHT COWBOY both films about the underbelly of society.

According to the DVD extra the set was modeled on the old Aragon Ballroom built in the 1920s on the Lick Pier at Santa Monica California. The onceelegant ballroom had grown seedy by the early 1950s at which time it enjoyed a brief revival as the location of early Lawrence Welk show broadcasts. In the 1960s the Aragon was again revamped under a different name as a shortlived rock concert venue  with appearances by Alice Cooper is his preCooper days and Jim Morrison of the Doors. It was destroyed by fire shortly afterward.Marathon dancing was according to most historians as brutal and exploitive as it is depicted in Horses. It was for that reason that this early 20th century variety of Roman coliseum culture was banned in much of the country by the late 1930s.This movie uses fictitious characters to tell a story that appears to be remarkably accurate from a historical point of view. Jane Fonda's ultracynical sharptongued character Gloria along with ruthless managerpromoter Rocky played by Gig Young contrast perfectly with the eerilyresigned and unpretentious Robert Michael Serrazin. The casting and dialogue are brilliant. The visual effects are haunting.This film is not for everyone. But for those interested in the social pathology that allows human suffering to become a form of amusement the malicious illtreatment of the poor or the harsh realities of the depression era this is multifaceted cinema that can be watched again and again each time yielding new subtleties. It is a morbidly fascinating character study that reflects a truly desperate time.For those watching on DVD it is advisable to see the short background feature before the movie in order to fully appreciate its context.

	schema:reviewBody "THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? This movie stays in the memory partly because it stands out from other mainstream Hollywood products of its time in subject matter the dance marathons of the 20s and 30s and tone pitilessly and harshly negative even the humor is bleak. The message life the marathon is a desperate rat race with a rigged outcome.How certain actors end up with certain roles depends on the crazy complicated game known as Hollywood casting but sometimes even a miscast performer will bring an unexpected something to the table and triumph. Such was the case with Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE written with Claudette Colbert or Gertrude Lawrence in mind and such is the case with Jane Fonda in a role that would have been better suited to someone like Stella Stevens. Fonda overcomes the odds as Gloria the morbidly cynical and impoverished young woman whose brief life has been a series of abuses disappointments and defeats. Even though the actress looks and speaks like a patrician her defiant angry controlled desperation burns through the superficialities. Her performance culminates in an emotional meltdown which she handles with skill. It was her great breakthrough as a screen actress.Another career peak is reached by Gig Young who as the master of ceremonies personifies all the dishonesty cruelty and pathos of the marathon itself. Bonnie Bedelia and Susannah York also score as different kinds of vulnerable innocents. Michael Sarrazin as Fonda's dance partner serves as the passive instrument that allows Fonda to play out her tortured personal drama. His unchanging wounded puppy dog expression speaks for itself.Ironically the musical arrangements by John Green a brilliant and very active composer of early 30's popular songs including Body and Soul sound more like Lawrence Welk than a real thirdrate dance band of the early Depression era. As musical supervisor of this film I wonder if it was Green who anachronistically included songs that hadn't even been written when the story takes place including I Cover the Waterfront 1933 and Easy Come Easy Go 1934 both of which Green composed himself.For some reason the scriptwriter chose to move the story to 1932 from its original placement in 1934 by author Horace McCoy in the novel on which this film is based. At one point an old lady tells Fonda and Sarrazin that they are her favorite dance couple because they're wearing the number 67 which is the year she was born 1867. Later Fonda calculates her age Sixtyfive. Which enables us to figure out that the action is taking place in 1932. In another scene Fonda referring to Bonnie Bedelia quips If she's not pregnant then I'm Nelson Eddy. Eddy didn't become a nationally known name until 1935 when he teamed with Jeanette MacDonald. He didn't even appear in a major motion picture until 1933 DANCING LADY MGM. A woman of 1932 would have been more likely to say Bing Crosby or Rudy Vallee or even Russ Columbo. So one can't help wondering why the screenwriter bothered to move the action backwards by two years.Exhausted couples staggering around a dance floor under a shining spinning ball composed of mirror fragments that reflect off the ceiling walls and floor  a symbol of Earth and the cosmos around it and oppressed humanity on the bottom grimly pressing on. That's the film in a nutshell.".

	schema:reviewBody "They Shoot Horses Don't They? makes such an indelible impression on anyone who sees it that they're never likely to either forget it or mix it up with any other movie they've ever seen. It's rare indeed for any movie to possess this kind of power but the sheer intensity of its story the desperation of its characters and the quality of its cast really do make this film extremely memorable and quite unique.This depressionera drama about the experiences of a group of poverty stricken people who enter a dance marathon at a rundown ballroom on the Santa Monica Pier near L.A. describes the hopes that motivate them and also shows the suffering and humiliation that they experience as they struggle against impossible odds to chase their dreams of a 1500 prize or the fame and fortune that could follow if they get spotted by any of the talent scouts who might be in the audience. The depressing reality however is that the promises of these prizes for different reasons are both a sham and the contestants' endeavours are all in vain.Gloria Beatty Jane Fonda is a wouldbe actress whose experiences have made her very bitter and deeply cynical. She's habitually unpleasant to everybody she encounters but is nevertheless very determined to win the marathon. When her original partner is not allowed to compete for medical reasons she quickly finds herself teamed up with Robert Syverton Michael Sarrazin who's an exfarm boy who just happened to be in the vicinity and hadn't arrived with any intention of competing.Alice LeBlanc Susannah York is another aspiring actress who despite her circumstances takes a great pride in her appearance because she's convinced that she's likely to be recruited by some movie producer who'll spot her obvious talent. Harry Kline Red Buttons is an old sailor who lies about his age to enter the competition and is sure that his extensive experience of taking part in similar marathons will stand him in good stead this time around.Ruby Bonnie Bodelia is a heavily pregnant young woman who together with her husband James Bruce Dern is competing in the hope of winning enough money to help with the expense of having their first baby.The ballroom full of couples who start the marathon are continually urged on by Rocky Gig Young who's the promoter of the event. He periodically hollers Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa to rouse both the competitors and the audience and every week ups the stakes by organising a Derby which is a frantic energy sapping walking race which leads to the last three couples being eliminated on each occasion.What transpires during the marathon illustrates forcibly just how hopeless the lives of the competitors are how futile their attempts to improve their circumstances are and how mercilessly their misfortunes are exploited by Rocky who never misses an opportunity to add to the contestants' humiliation and anguish. All this is done to entertain his audience who derive pleasure from watching the systematic degradation of less fortunate people and also leads to all the dancers losing their dignity and self respect.Gig Young's performance is sensational and made even more remarkable by the fact that his role is so different to those he normally played during his career. He's thoroughly convincing as the sleazy villain of the piece and exceptionally good at conveying his character's callous attitude to the competitors as he cruelly mocks their predicaments. Michael Sarrazin is ideal as the passive Robert who simply allows himself to be swept along by events and almost nonchalantly accepts whatever fate throws at him. Jane Fonda and Susannah York make their characters unforgettable and Red Buttons is marvellous as the determinedly optimistic and energetic old salt.They Shoot Horses Don't They? is a tragic and very human story which despite its depressing subject matter and shocking conclusion is both thought provoking and riveting from start to finish.".

He periodically hollers Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa to rouse both the competitors and the audience and every week ups the stakes by organising a Derby which is a frantic energy sapping walking race which leads to the last three couples being eliminated on each occasion.What transpires during the marathon illustrates forcibly just how hopeless the lives of the competitors are how futile their attempts to improve their circumstances are and how mercilessly their misfortunes are exploited by Rocky who never misses an opportunity to add to the contestants' humiliation and anguish. All this is done to entertain his audience who derive pleasure from watching the systematic degradation of less fortunate people and also leads to all the dancers losing their dignity and self respect.Gig Young's performance is sensational and made even more remarkable by the fact that his role is so different to those he normally played during his career. He's thoroughly convincing as the sleazy villain of the piece and exceptionally good at conveying his character's callous attitude to the competitors as he cruelly mocks their predicaments. Michael Sarrazin is ideal as the passive Robert who simply allows himself to be swept along by events and almost nonchalantly accepts whatever fate throws at him. Jane Fonda and Susannah York make their characters unforgettable and Red Buttons is marvellous as the determinedly optimistic and energetic old salt.They Shoot Horses Don't They? is a tragic and very human story which despite its depressing subject matter and shocking conclusion is both thought provoking and riveting from start to finish.";

I had heard a lot about this film when it was first released and had seen bits and pieces of it in the pastbut I found watching the entire film to be a devastating and shattering experience. I must concur with another poster's comparison to the marathon dance contest participants to today's reality show contestants...there is an air of desperation surrounding these people that is sad and frightening to watch. Some of these people have pinned their entire existence on winning this marathon and you just know everyone can't win. As a matter of fact if memory serves we never find out who won because the film focuses on those losers who have pinned their entire lives on this and don't make it. Jane Fonda should have won the Best Actress Oscar for her Gloria Beatty a strong yet pathetic creature who MUST win this marathon. Michael Sarrazin had the role of his career as Robert the young man who becomes Gloria's partner by fate and becomes drawn into her web of depression and loneliness. Gig Young won an Oscar for his ultraslick turn as the host and promoter of the marathon. Memorable characterizations of other participants in the marathon are offered by Suhsannah York Red Buttons Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern. This film is not for very taste but can be a haunting yet satisfying film experience for those who can handle it. Definitely not for the faint of heart and way ahead of its time. Exceptional direction by Sidney Pollack.".

	schema:headline " Exceptionallly creepy and unsettling depiction of human depravity as spectator sport";
	schema:reviewBody "I had not heard of the era's small scale obsession with human suffering in the form of Dance Marathons. Although some have commented that these were the first reality shows I would argue that nothing has changed in the human psyche from thousands of years earlier when the Roman Colosseum was the outlet for the dark side of the human imagination where food and gore was served up as a circus of demented and tasteless pastimes where for a set period of time you could forget your own travails and feast your senses on the pains of someone else.This disturbing film begins and ends on the same coda that of how a broken animal is shot out of sympathy to put it out of any more misery. You have to see the film to understand what this means and the final scene completes the thought. The tensions that exist for all contestants is underscored by personal anxieties and humiliation. I suspect that you would not appear on the dance floor of a marathon unless you were down on your luck probably very hungry and desperate to feed a family. This is what afflicts most of the contestants. Consider other layers of tension that make your skin crawl. At first when the character Robert appears he denies that he is interested in dancing with anyone and without any chance to give an alternative to why he is there we are left wondering if he really was too embarrassed to admit his needs or was just drifting aimlessly waiting to be drawn into the vortex freak show that was just about ready to start. And drawn into it and his fate he unexpectedly gets pushed. He is matched up as Gloria's dance partner and in her you get a woman whose veins are filled to the brim with acid. A partner like that makes you prefer to sit in the electric chair first. Their most unlikely partnership hinges almost entirely on the smoldering rage that Fonda's character holds on to with Sarrazin's character just about as malleable as silly putty. If his character is portrayed that way in the novel then fine I guess the director had little choice. I found his passivity more confusing and after a while I was hoping that he would show some backbone sorry for the terrible pun.The movie is deeply layered with enough time taken to show how the contestants slowly but surely burn down like candles on their last lights. Especially difficult to watch are the emotionally explosive mental breakdowns of several characters one who looses her mind and screams that she is covered with insects crawling on her. Just as disturbing is the final break down of Alice LeBlanc who now jilted by her long time partner and having had her clothing and makeup taken from her by someone having lost all her props again sorry for the pun imploded and ended up breaking apart in a shower scene. Her painful scream followed by a soft voiced recognition that someone had screamed is almost too much to bear watching. Susanna York was outstanding in her role. Red Buttons is very good as a Sailor from World War one again we wonder why he would have entered such a crazy contest  except that perhaps he was there to show off his strength now past his prime or else because he too was down on his luck.I quite agree the fast walking timed sprinting scenes both of them are hideously played out and in our minds we are wondering who will drop dead first? Will it be the pregnant lady Bonny Bedelia or the sailor or anyone else? This is truly where the humans are turned into horses panting and pushed to their limits in a small scale chariot race and the full crowds cheer them on. It is utterly sickening and it goes on and on.Spoiler major....When Gig Young's character spills the beans about how little the winner will actually get my mouth popped open when he said the words you just look at Jane Fonda's face and you can see her think and do the simple calculation and you realize that she is totally manipulated and demolished and destroyed by the ruthless rules. The utterly soulless Rocky just explains to her that it is just business and he's not out to rip anyone off and he's got all the receipts to prove it. I think of the way the banks foreclosed on thousands of homeowners who could not pay their mortgages during the depression because of a massive economic contraction and huge unemployment and how the bankers would say the same thing it was just business and they have the receipts.If ever there was a more heartless depiction of the dark side of humanity I do not know of a more painful collection of images. The actors are all outstanding in their roles some more developed or limited as the director and script saw fit. I felt that Jane Fonda nailed her role with perfection and she showed that the Fonda family had only outstanding acting talent. The great Al Lewis you will remember him from his hilarious stint on the Munster television show is all understated with hardly a scene he is in where he does not have a small cigar chomped between his teeth. This is not a film that needs to be redone as I think that Pollack has captured what needed to be said and shown. It is truly a horror show but not the type we normally associate with that emotion. The mirror it holds up to our dark side is supposed to make you squirm. Very unsettling but important film.".

The message this movie conveys is the same as the cold pathetic and pessimistic view of life that the existentialist movements being born were spreading around.We all wanted to know who would win. We were unsure who to root for certainly not Jane Fonda's apathetic character. Then who? The washed out wannabe and talentless actress or her egocentric partner the married couple that blind themselves with some sort of a possible lived happily ever after ending? No. None of them could win. All the characters are selfish and blind to reality with hopes of winning something that is ephemeral. Inside the dance floor they are stripped naked of their dignity and humanity. The only character who seems free of this heaviness turns out to be the worst of them encarnating those that permit others to give up.Mr. Pollack very effectively introduces us into a world where life is an unending dance marathon. The struggle in life like the struggle to keep dancing is meaningless and empty a mere movement that seems to go on and on until it crashes to an end. Contestants begin the challenge enthusiastically and motivated because they have a goal a purpose. But we shockingly discover that people compete not against each other as initially believed but with the inevitable pull of gravity to the floor. This is why we're not really surprised at Gloria when she decides to shoot herself once she's outside. Loosing the competition is in fact death and death is more reasonable more real than dancing away through life. Death is the only certainty. Those who don't die dancing will die anyway despite any resistance. In the end they were all cattle lining up to be fattened before being slaughtered an existence void of any meaning. A movie worth watching thanks to Mr. Pollack's brilliant directing and real sober and contained performances all committed to the point the movie wants to make. 710".

Gloria a contagion of existential desolation is the petrified and petrifying chance counterpart of the man with broken dreams as well as a great tragic heroine.

I remember when it first was released and the dancehall theme stayed with me for decades although I didn't see it again until I bought the VHS in 2005.Indeed They Shoot Horses Don't They? is a bleak terrifying depressing BUT truthful portrait of how our society can be brutal toward other people unlike us. If you only watch movies to be happily entertained you missout on how life can also be brutal  in ways one can't predict nor escape. This movie paints a graphic picture as gripping as Once Upon a Time in America of some desperate people at the bottom of the ladder  and also some unfeeling individuals who enjoy seeing others suffer. Horses is CERTAINLY about suffering...I've read every comment posted here so few users could connect the importance of the beautiful only really happy scene in the entire movie of a young boy who is captivated by the power of his horse running freely. When the horse falls and has to be destroyed it is a prediction of how all of the dancers will be destroyed. The young boy just happens to become Robert Michael Sarrazin who is hangingaround the dancehall and is drafted to be Gloria's Jane Fonda dancepartner simply because she doesn't have one. Some of the users even ridicule him for his sweetness the only dancer who has no idea why he's there nor has any reason to be.I agree this movie is MEANT to be a downer  it is a document to show how meanspiritedbutinnocent ordinary people can be. Gloria is determined to win  she is a savvy lady but she does not realize to win is also to lose no matter how close you come to winning. Her merrygoround will never end and she wants off. No matter how anyone feels about Hanoi Jane they cannot deny her role packs a powerful punch and she plays it with stellar skill. Sarrazin is also stellar and underplays his role with intense innocence. Susannah York's Alice role is in the same league. Sailor Red Buttons delivers a brilliant role to demonstrate that older people are just as determined to win. Ruby Bonnie Bedelia is heartbreaking simply because she wants to follow her husband's lead at any cost. AL Lewis Turkey is setdressing but ties weirdness to this alreadystressful story. Rocky Gig Young is the professional user  it's all business honey and is fascinating in his harshly intimidating character. He did deserve his Oscar but Jane got robbed. Mrs Laydon Madge Kennedy knows the whole contest is a scam and nervously watches it unfold before her eyes.What a cast  many not mentioned here  and what a wallop they all deliver. I can't imagine how ANYONE can miss the impact this film delivers nor understand how this characterstudy reveals we all are vulnerable to uncontrollable circumstancesand somehow flawed. The other films produced the same year this movie is filmed and released should be further proof that WHOLE DECADE depicted human frailties. INDEED Syndey Pollack and James Poe deserved Oscars for giving us a good look at ourselves.If you can't sit through this movie you gotta be a coward so watch it and be glad you're not in this situation and lucky life has treated you well.....Bravo! to anyone who had the smallest part it making it.".

The popular dance marathons of the early 1930's most famously done in Atlantic City were a cavalcade of desperate young people trying to survive through the depression. This movie serves as a metaphor for the lost youth of the late 1960's dealing with civil rights and a war in Vietnam they wanted no part of.Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin are just two of the contestants caught up in this hoopla as they struggle to last through the grueling dances sprint races and bad entertainment provided by some of the pathetic people trying to either gain fame or win a sponsor. The faces of all of these contestants show their world weariness especially Fonda's who seems to long for the peace of death. Add in Gig Young as the emceeproducer of the marathon a lecherous man who has no qualms in attempting to rape one of the exhausted dancers Susannah York. He is both equally ruthless and charming as he utilizes every trick in the book to put on a show. Reminding me of the emcee in Cabaret it is no wonder that when Kander and Ebb did their own marathon musical Steel Pier the emceehost of that marathon was a combination of both characters in this and in Cabaret.Depression films of the past fifty years have touched on the many aspects of survival whether through the violence of Bonnie and Clyde or the sleaziness of Ironweed. They Shoot Horses takes on the world of entertainment and adds in some sports plus lots of desperation despair and finally exhaustion towards life itself reminding us that each era has had its share of miserable social moments which looked like the end of civilized society.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I first noticed the credits to this movie it came to my attention that Sydney Pollack was the director of this film... This should come as no surprise to me Sydney Pollack is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood!! He pinpoints reality to an unprecedented succinctness level!! Reality is often times a subtle yet very rude formidability with indisputable facts that will decimate anyone or anything that gets in the way!!The movie They Shoot Horses Don't They depicts a cross section of individuals who masquerade a paper thin veneer of flippancy about them selves. These actions serve as a subterfuge for the fact that they have been mangled by the Depression!! Everybody is at the same place a dance marathon.. By tittle a dance marathon would seemingly suggest a sort of paraded panacea in reality it is a cinematic slaughterhouse!! Such an event cultivates a macabre audience whose voyeuristic amusement is based on witnessing human misery.. The tragic social pitfalls of financial collapse caused by the Great Depression are the culprits to spurring on these dance marathons nevertheless regardless of cause and effect the show must go on!!As the movie lingers on it portrays the desperation and apocalyptic suffering all of the major characters endure... This needless agony is all in the hopes that they will win the grand prize.. The indigence everybody is victimized by sparks a pejorative identification that all involved parties are afflicted with!! All of them are mired in an abyss of despondence and gridlocked by the sorry element of individual demoralization!!The acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal!! Jane Fonda is superb at portraying the disgruntled spawn of economic hardship!! Her witty retorts and justified pathos resonate themselves to a point of insignificant consolation and comfort for her overall situation!! Gig Young is terrific as the dance marathon coordinator he has become callous as a necessary defense mechanism for his basic survival!! Jane Fonda's dance partner Michael Sarrazin must expedite moral imperatives his final dilemma makes him very peccant this is accompanied by a gargantuan ethical conundrum!! That is all I can say without giving away the plot to this movie!! As I previously stated Sydney Pollack does a remarkable job directing this film!! All of the dance marathon victims have become sullen and dejected!! The Depression has evoked a totally effective form of vilification to each and every one of them by making them realize the outcome of their end results!! Heroics would allow people to rise above adversity even the Great Depression!! Reality however dictates that the vast majority of Americans did not fall through the cracks nor did they divide and conquer... the fact is that anonymity and attrition relegated most working class Americans to tragic statistics!! The dreadful circumstances of the Depression cogently asserted that many lives were virtually categorized as utterly valueless!!The talent and powerful story line make this film worth seeing!! Reality is a prevailing quality in a film even if it is difficult to stomach try to remember that and you will probably enjoy this film quite a bit!! Catastrophe has been calculated in this movie to effectuate tragic poignancy to the letter of the law!! The law of the jungle that is!! If one of your favorite hobbies is ruminating the unfortunate truth then you will like this film very much!!!!!".

	schema:headline " PreTV Reality Show and human nature at its ugliest...";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Sidney Pollack's They Shoot Horses Don't They? it is impossible not to think of reality shows and their piles of human souls desperate for success' shortcuts. Indeed whenever there will be depression and desperation such shows will exist. The only difference is that during the Great Depression when Horace McCoy wrote the novel there was no screen between the audience and the contestants a thinner progress than the fact that contrarily to Rome's gladiators contestants didn't kill each other though they seriously jeopardized their physical and mental health.The film centers on a Dance Marathon one of the 30's crazes set in a West Coast ballroom the concept is so vicious that you wonder why sensitive people would go to such extremes. From a 2010's standpoint it makes sense as there's no difference between this and programs like Survivor or Fear Factor and no more between the charismatic Master of Ceremony played by Gig Young and a TV host who displays hypocritical empathy toward contestants while developing new tricks to increase their suffering. Watching Young's Oscarwinning performance we wonder whether we should despise his cynicism or enthusiastically respond to his repeated Yowsa! Young embodies the bittersweet appeal reality TV shows something that is part of human nature to which German language found a word for 'shadenfreude'. When someone falls or fails we're somewhat glad to be in the comfortable viewer's side. We don't like other people's successes but any sight of a human being in a less favorable position is most welcome. That's how depressing a depression is when we can't feel better for our own achievements we do it by proxy by enjoying someone's failure. Regarding the Dance Marathon whoever will win the 1500 dollars prize will be less interesting than the dozens of delightful losers.Take the character Alice played by Susannah York she's a young actress coming with her partner together they expect to catch the eye of a director. Alice is like today's wannabe Cyrus or Kardashian who don't believe in bad publicity and think fame precedes artistic achievement. Later Rocky reveals that he deliberately took her dresses and makeup because she was spoiling the game by not looking messy and exhausted as she was supposed to be. He says about the audience that they just want to see a little misery out there so they can feel a little better maybe. This revelation will come as a shock to Robert Michael Sarrazin an aspiring director who naively thought he was in a contest rather than a show. Like in Ancient Rome those who don't have 'bread and wine' make the 'circus' to the haves. Seriously did he forget he was sponsored? There are also two tragic characters Kline an aging sailor played by wonderful character actor Red Buttons the WWI veteran knows the marathon and teaches a few tricks to Robert. And there's a pregnant Okie farmer's wife played by unrecognizable Bonnie Bedelia she was John McClane's wife in Die Hard and entrusted with more than she can cope with and nor her husband Bruce Dern or the doctors or Rocky think that she might endanger her kid's life or her own. The sight of this little heavyloaded women forced to run that awful tenminute derby is one of the most disturbing sights of the movie along with Kline's death desperately dragged by Gloria Betty Jane Fonda till the finish line.The power of Pollack's directing is to switch from the contestants' perspective to Rocky's and his partner played by Al Lewis. For instance you see the participants groaning at the derby's white lines being painted and then you see the puppet masters of this tragicomedy and you wonder why these people who can leave at any time let their health and sanity being sucked out by these heartless bastards in tuxedos. The reason is simple the two points of view never meet except for Robert and Gloria. And all naturally they leave the show. When Gloria learns that the winner will pay the expenses that's too much to accept she understands that the whole world is like central casting. They got it all rigged before you ever show up. As Gloria Jane Fonda is the soul of the story a perpetually malcontent woman whose participation was the last string on which to hang her faith on life. But while the film is mainly focused on Fonda it starts with flashbacks from Robert's childhood  one involving a beautiful black stallion falling and then mercilessly put out of his misery and then it's punctuated with images of Robert being arrested and interrogated for what seems to be a murder. I thought that accidentally knowing Gloria would die would spoil my enjoyment. As a matter of fact from the title to the poster and the arrest scenes we understand that it's a matter of time before the contest finally get the most of her and makes her death inevitable.This is not depression as an Era or as the disillusioned New Hollywood movies that provided the great unequaled masterpieces of American cinema but plain and bleak 'state of mind' depression. It's like a feeling of psychological claustrophobia in an agoraphobiainducing world too many people and not enough souls to reach or reach yours. The ballroom with all its flashiness and shiny floor is the extraordinary metaphor of this Depression however you define it. And Fonda conveys her sadness so convincingly that we no longer feel sorry for her when Robert pulls the trigger. As he says to the disbelieving cops they shoot horses don't they?. Gloria didn't break her leg though only her spirit and that's something you can't recover from.They Shoot Horses Don't They?is one of the most depressing movies I saw even more because it hasn't lost one ounce of relevance proving that History keeps repeating itself staged by the worst of human nature. What an exhausting depressing haunting and unforgettable movie!".

As the film rolled on I was continually drawing comparisons with the sickening drivel of BIG BROTHER and all its tatty copies with every tawdry 'talent show' and with the excruciatingly embarrassing annual pantomime of 'Red Nose Day.' The very fact that it's done for good causes doesn't excuse it  it makes it all the worse. When Gig Young the sleazy compre of the show looking like a ghastly mixture of Hughie Green Bob Monkhouse and Garner Ted Armstrong helps to pull together one of the overwrought contestants who is having hallucinations Jane Fonda remarks caustically 'I thought you'd have done that in the show  increase the admittance charge.' But Young replies 'No it's too real for them.' Like the difference between EASTENDERS and NIL BY MOUTH between EMMERDALE and THE WAR ZONE. And when one of the contestants loses her dress and makeup Young admits that he did it himself in order to improve the show. Michael Sarrazin naively retorts 'But this is supposed to be a contest not a show.' Young corrects him 'They come to see this in their own misery. Seeing YOUR misery makes them feel happier...' One of the contestants collapses and has to be evicted from the dance floor. Young's announcement could be Davina McCall outside the Big Brother house 'After we've been together all these hours and days it's sorry to have to say goodbye to Shirley...' Gig Young is just superb  he's not simply a corrupt insincere fairground huckster but a fully formed character. Young uses his ageing face to portray a man who's seen it all... and yet found nothing to believe in. He mentions that his father was a phony 'faith healer' when Young was a boy he had to pretend to be miraculously healed when the 'show' was flagging. To prove that nothing has changed watch Rory  Alec's socalled GOD TV when they have one of those 3 or 4hour long 'conferences' of boring 'Christian' music healing and 'anointing in the Spirit.' Al Lewis yes Grandpa from THE MUNSTERS is Young's right hand man. He only says a few words but his looks and mannerisms add to the hardwired atmosphere of cheapness and dishonesty. Michael Sarrazin recently deceased Susannah York ditto Jane Fonda a great actress in her youth  shame about the identikit 'liberal' politics Bruce Dern Red Buttons  you couldn't ask for a better cast but I still think it's Gig Young who steals the show literally as it turns out.Sydney Pollack uses great looming closeups and strange camera angles even the colour of it all looks rather weird and somehow tacky. Slowmotion sections often irritate me think of the terrible 'run toward the funeral' at the end of CAPRICORN ONE  so embarrassing that it almost completely ruins the whole picture  but the use of it in the second 'Dance Derby' to which the contestants are subjected works very well.".

Naturally contestants freak out and get obsessive and generally push their limits and that ultimately is what the movie portrays.I found it a bore. I like Sydney Pollack's approach to movies in general and he's directed some real gems. I can tolerate Jane Fonda too and she is an irritable pushy young woman in this one pretty convincing. There are other characters with similar selfish and increasingly tired attitudes and by half way through you realize that it's a downer movie with nearly everyone snarly and mean and deceptive. By the end with the great climax hinted at a couple times along the way you expect and get the culmination of all that. But it's a pretty linear experience almost entirely shot in the gymnasium serving as a dance hall. The spectators are barely mentioned and there are generally very few. The bands providing the dance music are dull and maybe incorrect for the timesnot only is there an allBlack group which might have been included but one of them is a mixed race group and this isn't a barrier crossed until the late 1930s a decade later. People's attitudes struck me as more 1960s than 1920s with women openly crude and aggressive and maybe this is my own shortcoming I see the aggressive successful women in Reds as more accurate for whatever reason. Mostly there is nothing much happening except a kind of petty competition between two women and with two men half caring and just tagging along. And everyone getting weary. It's a spectacle for sure but imagine watching it for a month? And then squeezing that boredom into a two hour movie narrative one liner with a strained script. Loaded with awards and praise but not here.".

This film is considered one of the best imitators primarily because of its tongueincheek approach and it's deliberately campy writing and casting. Menzies is a hotshot missing persons expert who goes in search of two young hikers who have disappeared. She enlists the aid of hermitlike Dillman who lives near an abandoned government testing facility where the hikers were last suspected to have been. When they come upon a murky tank and believe the bodies could be at the bottom Menzies releases the contents unwittingly unleashing a school of vicious geneticallyaltered piranha onto an unsuspecting river full of camp kids and park revelers. From there it's a race against the clock to get to Dillman's young daughter who is about to enter a camp relay race in the water downstream. The film is deliberately peppered with actors who've made their mark in either horror or suspense films and it makes no pretenses about its lack of originality though it does manage to come up with some despite itself! Dillman sporting an atrocious comeandgo Southern accent and Menzies have a surprisingly decent rapport with each other with a few amusing scenes tossed in amongst all the panic. McCarthy pops up as a terrified scientist who knows his plans have gone awry. Wynn has a cameo as a gruff but likable neighbor of Dillman's. Steele plays an ominous scientist in cahoots with Army colonel Gordon to keep the whole situation under wraps. Bartel is the persnickety camp counselor and Miller is the smarmy amusement park owner both of whom disbelieve that there's any danger. Despite it's minuscule budget and rather homemade effects the film does generate a bit of eyeopening gore and more than a little discomfort as these tiny fish nibble away at anything in the water. If Jaws caused people to avoid the ocean this film could make people think twice about cloudy rivers and lakes! The murkiness of the water only adds to the horror of it all as the bikiniclad tourists and innertubewielding kids can't begin to see what's coming. It's just a sting then a nibble then blood everywhere! Some of the effects are tacky and amusing but there's a certain level of true fear as well. If one likes this genre to begin with it will probably be a pleasure to watch. Others may be less enthralled.".

The writing is perhaps the best part of the film seeing as Corman obviously wanted a real cultish feel and as such the film has so many noticeable  fun and convenient injokes such as a swimmer reading acclaimed novel 'Moby Dick' and lazy workers watching old cartoons involving fish. The thrills are pretty good too seeing as the situation involves genetically enhanced knowledge within the fish. Therefor it is much harder for Dillman and Menzies as they attempt to over power the deadly fish while chasing them down stream a beautiful Texas river.

The piranha themselves don't look too bad and thusly the effects are pretty good for a low budget film such as this.

Yes this film has all the right moves as well as many other to boot! It is comic when needed and when the element of serious conflict is present so is the presence of serious characters. This film was remade in '95 with the most wretched cast and concept ever! And the thought of another remake causes my blood to boil! You cannot recreate an original classic!

	schema:reviewBody "Not many moviemakers do parodies better than Joe Dante  the director who brought us The Howling a werewolf movie parody Gremlins a monster movie parody Innerspace a Fantastic Voyage parody The 'Burbs a neighboursfromhell parody and Piranha a Jaws parody. This 1978 comedyhorror is one of Dante's early movies but despite that he shows an assured touch and gets generously tongueincheek performances from his cast of horror veterans. While the film is never a truly great rival to the awesome Jaws it is a fun and entertaining homage that has much going for it. Easily the strong point of this film is the gruesome makeup provided by whizkid Rob Bottin but more will be said of that later.A couple of teenagers go missing while trekking through the woods. Private eye Maggie McKeown Heather Menzies goes searching for them and discovers a burntout hermit Paul Grogan Bradford Dillman living on the mountainside who offers to help her in her hunt. McKeown and Grogan stumble upon a secluded military research centre where crazed scientist Dr. Hoak Kevin McCarthy is busily conducting experiments to create a strain of piranha fish able to survive in rivers and oceans and always eager to devour anything in their way. The plan is to release these superfish in enemy rivers thereby making the entire river system too dangerous to use. McKeown and Grogan mistakenly release the piranhas into the local river and realise that anyone using the river for recreation  including the bustling summer camp miles downstream  are now in desperate danger. The army is brought in but instead of helping to solve the terrifying situation they seem more concerned with covering up the whole business. In particular General Waxman Bruce Gordon has cause to keep the existence of the piranha secret as he has invested his savings in the summer camp and doesn't want to scare away his paying customers. In a race against time Grogan and McKeown try to release poison into the river to prevent the piranhas from devouring everyone in sight and proceeding to the ocean..Piranha is fastmoving gory fun. It's nice to see Dillman in a heroic leading role after so many years of playing the supporting bad guy in numerous films. Menzies is fine as his partnerinadventure and there are great supporting roles for horror legends like Barbara Steele as a military scientist Dick Miller as a cowboy entertainer and Keenan Wynn as Grogan's doomed buddy who lives at the riverside. As I said earlier Rob Bottin provides some bloody make up effects that make some of the halfeaten victims look pretty yucky. The gently mocking script is by John Sayles and is full of humorous references to earlier books and films along the same theme. The finale in which the holidaymakers fall foul of the piranha fish is packed with blood and guts and should definitely appeal to gorehounds. Even though the film keeps its tongue in its cheek there are still some dumb moments along the way that mar credibility even on this level. For instance Grogan spends much of the closing scenes underwater being attacked by the piranha. earlier in the film we were made to believe that the piranha devoured their victims in literally a few seconds but they seem to make ludicrously hard work of attacking Grogan while he's in the water in fact he surfaces after several minutes in the firing line with just a few bites which seems somewhat fortuitous!! Piranha is enjoyable though and should be well received by genre addicts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even in the late 70's studios were trying to cash in on the Jaws phenomenon and to this date they are still doing it. This is a Roger Corman produced film and he never saw a genre that he didn't exploit. Story is about an insurance investigator named Maggie McKeown Heather Menzies who is trying to locate two lost campers and she runs into an alcoholic hermit in the woods named Paul Grogan Bradford Dillman and she persuades him to give her a ride to a supposedly closed military facility. They look around and Maggie finds the campers gear certifying that they were there. They start to drain the pool to see if they drowned and they're attacked by a man who says not to let the water drain. They knock him unconscious and take him back to Paul's cabin. They tie him up and with the use of a raft they head downstream to the authorities. While on the raft they find out that his name is Dr. Robert Hoak Kevin McCarthy and he has been working for the government undercover and has developed a mutant species of piranha and that they let them out of the pool and into the river! The military comes in and they try to keep Maggie and Paul quiet but they escape and try to stop the piranha from heading downriver and into the ocean. The piranha chew up several people and even little kids swimming at camp. A local businessman named Buck Gardner Dick Miller is opening a resort on the river and even though he knows about the piranha he doesn't delay the grand opening. This was the directorial debut of Joe Dante and even though this was made on a shoestring budget his talent is very evident. Yes the film is silly but the special effects are not that bad and the script was written by John Sayles. The only flaw For me that is is that Dillman and Menzies spend way to much time on that raft. The film does slow down a notch but luckily it's not for that long. There is one truly scary scene and it's where the piranha attack the little kids at camp. The kids really get chomped on and the scene where a pretty counselor is killed is very effective and well made. The opening scene in the film is a direct Jaws ripoff where the two campers go swimming at night and are eaten. Menzies is then seen playing a Jaws video game. Like all Corman films this has many recognizable faces in the cast like Keenan Wynn Barbara Steele Paul Bartel Belinda Balaski Richard Deacon and Sayles himself plays the Army guard that is fooled when Dillman and Menzies escape. Definitely a film that you don't take seriously but this is pretty well made and a must for fans of Corman and horror films.".

Story is about an insurance investigator named Maggie McKeown Heather Menzies who is trying to locate two lost campers and she runs into an alcoholic hermit in the woods named Paul Grogan Bradford Dillman and she persuades him to give her a ride to a supposedly closed military facility. They look around and Maggie finds the campers gear certifying that they were there. They start to drain the pool to see if they drowned and they're attacked by a man who says not to let the water drain. They knock him unconscious and take him back to Paul's cabin. They tie him up and with the use of a raft they head downstream to the authorities. While on the raft they find out that his name is Dr. Robert Hoak Kevin McCarthy and he has been working for the government undercover and has developed a mutant species of piranha and that they let them out of the pool and into the river! The military comes in and they try to keep Maggie and Paul quiet but they escape and try to stop the piranha from heading downriver and into the ocean. The piranha chew up several people and even little kids swimming at camp. A local businessman named Buck Gardner Dick Miller is opening a resort on the river and even though he knows about the piranha he doesn't delay the grand opening. This was the directorial debut of Joe Dante and even though this was made on a shoestring budget his talent is very evident. Yes the film is silly but the special effects are not that bad and the script was written by John Sayles. The only flaw For me that is is that Dillman and Menzies spend way to much time on that raft. The film does slow down a notch but luckily it's not for that long. There is one truly scary scene and it's where the piranha attack the little kids at camp. The kids really get chomped on and the scene where a pretty counselor is killed is very effective and well made. The opening scene in the film is a direct Jaws ripoff where the two campers go swimming at night and are eaten. Menzies is then seen playing a Jaws video game. Like all Corman films this has many recognizable faces in the cast like Keenan Wynn Barbara Steele Paul Bartel Belinda Balaski Richard Deacon and Sayles himself plays the Army guard that is fooled when Dillman and Menzies escape. Definitely a film that you don't take seriously but this is pretty well made and a must for fans of Corman and horror films.";

It wasn't safe to swim in the ocean and now rivers weren't safe. What next pools? This horror classic is fun to watch with friends just for laughs. OK you can see the strings on the piranhas and yes the fins don't move? It is a little unbelievable. Or is it??? Unfortunately this movie is a hard to find which I find very disappointing. I would love to carry this title on DVD and purchase this as a great gag gifts for a few of my friends whom also love classic B movies! I myself highly recommend this movie especially if you enjoy B movies such as Day of the Animals SSSSSS and Alligator. I promise you a good time Just beware of fresh water!".

	schema:headline " Corman classic ripoff.";
	schema:reviewBody "Piranha is a film more selfaware than most of the postScream crap to come out of Hollywood. The film knows it follows a formula. In an early scene we meet the protagonist Maggie playing a Jaws arcade game  acknowledging the film it shamelessly rips off. It knows it packs a clichs punch with its characters as well as showing off that trademark Roger Corman costsaving devices. It knows it carries an obligatory antiwar message as a product of the 1970s. And Piranha brings with it an appropriate sense of humor towards its material.So watching the film I found myself despising the formula it follows however I couldn't help but appreciate how the film never takes itself too seriously. Good thing too because the other protagonist Paul represents one of my greatest character pet peeves  the selfserving social reject SoB who gets talked into tagging along who eventually evolves into something sympathetic. I can barely stomach that character type in this goofy ride I don't think I could endure another character like that in a straight movie. Thank you Joe Dante.Most films will toss out a painfully contrived excuse to get the adventurous Maggie and the hermitwannabe Paul to run through the plot together even though no amount of logic or reason could possibly yield that result but not Piranha. Oh no. It doesn't even bother with an excuse it just defies logic and common sense to put the two together and doesn't ask questions. Thank you John Sayles.Of course I still hated Paul but that's okay. With any luck he'll wind up Piranha bait.Keenan Wynn plays a colorful old man who lives out in the same neck of the woods as the Paul character and he confirms the viewer's suspicion that Piranha opts for less realistic characters in favor of silly caricatures. This prepares the viewer for the big balding camp activities administrator Earl who encourages little kids to overcome their fears by essentially calling them sissies for having said fears. Also the evil Colonel Waxman who is evil solely because he represents the US Government around the same era in history as the Vietnam War. And let's not forget the cocky highway patrol trooper who informs the main characters Don't try nothing 'cause I got my gun right here in my left hand. What I find most amusing about Piranha is the fact that the good guys Maggie and Paul are the two characters most deserving of a crucifixion over the events in the film. These characters waltz into an abandoned Government test facility and start pushing buttons without asking any questions or even attempting to go through the right channels or find out anything about this once topsecret and highly classified test facility. They metaphorically walk into a antique shop blindfolded while swinging a baseball bat and it's the store owner's fault for leaving stuff out. But they said they're reawwy reawwy sowwy and it'll nevah happen again. Is it any wonder that no one believes their word about the river that bypasses the dam? I mean most sane people hesitate to take directions from a guy who just ran full speed face first into a brick a wall.Piranha's story in essence describes two characters who screw up and spend the rest of the film trying to fix it while the narratives desperately tries to lay blame on its villain of the day. In a straight horror flick this would no doubt irritate me however in this caricature jamboree of clichs  it feels right. Especially with Dick Miller playing the corrupt businessman and owner of the aquatic park and Barbara Steele playing a scientist associated with the project that generated the killer piranha  both characters in league with the evil Colonel Waxman thus villains by default. And honestly you can't go wrong with Keenan Wynn Dick Miller and Barbara Steele in a film like this.What about the stars of this film? The piranha's themselves? There's a certain charm to the hyperactive fish going into epileptic convulsions while their teeth shred away at human flesh and of course the foggy silhouettes that stiffly pass by the camera like glorified cardboard cutouts. In other words fun low budget creature effects whose flaws only enhance the viewing experience.Unfortunately the mayhem the Piranhas cause generally falls short to the point of dare I say boredom. The fish begin to bite and the scene degenerates into a mass of extras kicking screaming splashing intercut with convulsing piranhas feasting. The chaos in frame drags on with no arc no climaxes barely any visible progress. At best every now and again Joe Dante offers hints of a mass exodus from the water at such a casual pace that it's difficult to believe these people's lives are at stake.Having said that I must confess that I respect and appreciate one of the climaxes where Joe Dante not only places a child's summer camp in danger but also follows through by having the piranha actually attack the kids. An apparent Hollywood taboo despite the fact we're talking fiction  where's the suspense of children in danger when the viewer knows a mainstream studio won't dare go there? Sad that this parody has more balls than some of its serious horror film brethren.That selfawareness and sense of humor separates Piranha from the pack and saves it from the same bashing that other creature features would receive. However it does not grant Piranha total immunity. While littered with flaws Piranha is not afraid to acknowledge what it is it's not afraid to go against Hollywood taboos and it's not afraid to mock itself. And hey you get a dose of Roger Corman Joe Dante Mark Goldblatt Dick Miller Keenan Wynn and Barbara Steele all in the same package. If that's not worth the price of a rental some popcorn and a few laughs I dunno what is.".

	schema:reviewBody "With all the films that are released on video that try to ride the coat tales of other popular entries in film people forget that early on there really was only one man who did that. That man was Roger Corman a producer who worked at creating cheap films that entertained viewers no matter what the material. Then there's Joe Dante a director who hasn't worked with many theatrical released films but the ones he has made have faithful followings. Dante is another filmmaker that enjoys taking ideas from popular films and turning it on its head. The thing is Dante at least does it with a nonsubtlety attitude and style. Seriously looking at the poster alone tells you that Dante and Corman were borrowing the concept from Steven Spielberg's Jaws 1975.For the most part the film is watchable but there are various elements that don't work. One of those elements is John Sayles' writing. It works well at building tension in how the story plays out but the dialog and backstory to why the piranhas are in a local resort feel flimsy. Turns out a school of piranhas were genetically enhanced to help win the Vietnam war. So in other words radio activity is the problem. It's understood that this comes from a time where it was prevalent but now it no longer is plausible. Using radioactivity as a plot device for a sea creature is no longer usable. It has been exploited since the early 50s era films. Not many of the actors that take part feel like they are that of something new either.Bradford Dillman as a divorced drunk father of one daughter is possibly the most interesting of the bunch. And this guy was the only one to ask to have his character have more depth. So you can imagine what the rest of the characters are like. Next is Heather MenziesUrich who plays a missing persons detective who also looks to find the truth behind the piranha epidemic. She also becomes Dillman's love interest  without little explanation. Okayyyy...see what I mean on character depth? Some of the dialog is silly to hear at times too. Unfortunately these things are big parts to the film that weigh it down because they are essential to telling a good story. Thankfully there are a enough good parts to help make it somewhat enjoyable. For example Dick Miller has a role. And who doesn't like Dick Miller?For one the practical effects are quite convincing to say the least. Phil Tippett's ability to make the piranhas themselves the gore and blood look authentic is important. I mean even if the cast isn't the most convincing the plot device should at least. I do question one scene however. There's a scene where stop motion animation is used and it looked great but it never served a purpose. What was the point? Kudos to using the technique but thumbs down for not giving it meaning. Jaime Anderson's cinematography is good specifically for the underwater scenes. Surely that wasn't the easiest thing to do. The editing by Joe Dante and Mark Goldblatt was competently done too. Specifically for keeping the illusion of the Piranhas looking like actual fish and not puppets. Lastly Pino Donaggio's music was OK. It wasn't great but at least had a theme specifically for the piranhas. That at least is recognizable. It's watchable but not all that exciting at times.It has good practical effects and a borrowed concept from Jaws 1975 that only can be considered flattering. However its story and majority of its characters aren't all that different from other characters in other films.".

	schema:headline " Piranhas Great effort from Joe Dante";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of Joe Dantes work even going so far as to buy every movie has directed. There's something about his style especially the mixture of humor and lighthearted horror elements that always seemed to resonate well with me. Piranhas is a movie I had on my watchlist for quite some time but I was never able to find a copy of it with a good quality. By total accident I found the special edition BluRay Edition of Piranhas. I was exhilarated and bought it immediately.So how well does Dantes second feature film hold up after all these years? Surprisingly well! This has all the good stuff in it that you'd expect from a Roger Corman production. Blood boobs humor fake looking special effects its all there but its all done with a lot of passion! I watched some bonus material of how the piranhas were made and discovered that Phil Tippet now an Oscar winner for his work on movies like Star Wars actually made the pesky little fish rats. I gotta say after watching the bonus stuff I had even more respect for the movie for the sheer fact alone of how much work went into it. No wonder they all involved to Hollywood legends these people are creative forces! Now with all that said its still amateur filmmaking. So don't expect next level Kubrick. The acting is at parts really good especially from Bradford Dillman and at parts really cringe worthy just like it should be. The story is rather simple and I wont bother going into details its just entertaining schlock with some great moments. I was surprised how serious it actually took itself. There were quiet some funny scenes but for the most part its actually pretty dark. All in all this movie really impressed me. I was entertained for the entirety of the film and there never seemed to be a dull moment. The underwater scenes still look great and the gore effect don't disappoint. Give it a try!".

	schema:reviewBody "Piranha is the best example I have seen of precisely how to do a rip off. It may sound like an oxymoron to call a rip off impressive but this is what accurately describes Piranha. Today we have the Asylum a directtoDVD company which gives us socalled mockbusters that completely lack the heart and fun of a film like this. Instead those are merely dull justgoingthroughthemotionstomakeasmallamountofmoney displays of ineptitude.There are several things to strongly commend this movie for like the fact that the lead characters are likable so that you care what happens to them unlike in some horror films the way it is very selfaware and has small tributes to Jaws the campy sound effect of the school of fish the excessive amounts of blood that is shown in a comic manner and how it is genuinely comedic and yet not a pure spoof in the way that films like Scary Movie are. Basically the film comes just close enough to Jaws to be an obvious attempt to cash in on its success and yet also stays just far away enough from Jaws that one isn't bored by a repetition of the same story all over again.I also feel that this film did something well that I don't typically see in creature feature films. And that is that it maintained a good balance between the screen time that the piranha attacks had and that the background story about the people and the origin of the problem had. I say piranha attacks because admittedly the fish themselves are hardly shown closeup at all but it didn't really feel as if I was missing anything by not seeing very much of their fins. Usually the scenes involving the creature itself are short as well as far and few in between while I am bored with all the meaningless dialog a good example of this is Demon of Paradise where I was thinking When do I get to see the monster?. But in this movie I did not have that disappointment. As a matter of fact the scenes where the human characters are talking actually interested me and had me curious what would happen next. It is very rare for me to enjoy these types of scenes.See this movie if you like B movies by all means. However if you aren't a fan of that type of cinema Piranha probably won't convert you. We all have different tastes. I know people who simply don't enjoy a schlocky low budget B movie even if it's great at being what it is. As for me though I'll take this little exploitation film over Jaws because it's just more fun.".

Creature features have a long history of being camp and Joe Dante's film will no doubt be a highlight for fans of the classic movies in this field. Joe Dante has made a lot of cheap but good films and while The Howling remains the best of his oeuvre and the 'best director' awards certainly won't be winging his way soon he's an underrated talent in the horror film industry and Piranha is certainly one of his better films.Joe Dante has put a good cast together for this movie which equally weighs out the camp and action sequences in the movie in the same proportions that the movie itself gives out. Bradford Dillman takes the lead role and while he clearly knows that he's appearing in a camp and very much 'B' standard horror he still gives it his all and makes for a fine protagonist. The highlights among the ensemble are Barbara Steele a regular in horror films with performances in the likes of 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'Black Sunday' and Dick Miller a cult star that Dante would go on to use regularly but found his cult stardom in the Corman classic 'A Bucket of Blood'. The pace of the film is good and while the script shows some holes the plot usually lasts out. It gets a bit hectic towards the end and Dante would have been better served with less carnage and more tension to give the movie a better finale. The effects are pretty much nonexistent as the movie just uses cuts of fish swimming and a bit of fake blood for most of it's shocks. Still this is a very fun movie and one that people who enjoy a good time will enjoy.".

Sayles and Dante put some humour to make it look like a spoof of Jaws but at the same time hoped to make the movie exciting. They never even got close to the cake the film is neither funny nor exciting. From what I know a spoof is supposed to be funny and make us laugh at its target. The jokes bomb 99 of the time and instead of laughing at Jaws I wished I was watching it instead of this garbage. As for the action as far as I can recall an action film involves a little thing we call excitement. This garbage is about as exciting as a Bergman family drama. Dante's first film leaves absolutely no hints  zero  that he would proceed to later make some good films. His directing is unimaginative  spoof or not a direct ripoff of the action sequences from Jaws only boring. The entire action sequence in which the little critters attack a group of children is so badly directed that the kids appear as though they are having a good time and not fighting for their lives! I cannot think of any other movie that left me so cold and unexcited at the prospect of a couple of kids getting massacred. I mean if the viewer doesn't get emotionally involved about kids getting butchered by savage animals then there is something seriously wrong with the movie! Every single character acts like a borderline cretin.The piranhas attack the bad bad military guy with ten times as much viciousness as they do the kids. Apparently the piranhas can differentiate between good and evil and prefer evil flesh. They are meant to be intelligent and understand enough about boats to know how to make them sink and thereby get to the boat's occupants quicker. Real piranhas are of course not that smart they are just fish. However even real piranhas are smarter than a John Sayles script. This Marxist leftwing wannabe intellectual actually makes both the army AND the police the bad guys. The military is so evil that they actually do all that is in their power to prevent potential swimmers getting warned to the extent that it almost appears as though they are doing everything they can to make sure the piranhas kill as many humans as possible! This isn't original. This isn't funny. This isn't quirky. It's imbecilic and annoying an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Barbara Steele is a scientist working for the military who  for no explanation whatsoever  does all that she can to ensure that the piranhas continue their business of slaughter. Of course the whole mutation fiasco was a military experiment to help them win wars blablablabla. This pitiful film isn't a spoof of old Bmovies. It IS a Bmovie. John Sayles is an overrated mediocrity who thrives on his dubious and not very credible image as a Hollywood outsider neither his writing nor his directing is remarkable  only his hip image is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose if I were a genre buff I might have liked PIRANHA better. As it is I started out liking it OK then over the course of the movie found myself liking it less and less then actively disliking it more and more. By the end I was really sorry I had shelled out ten bucks for the DVD. At this point I don't even know if I'll bother to go back and check out the commentary track.Joe Dante is a reasonably talented director John Sayles's screenplay mostly mostly avoids the aggressive stupidity of the average genre Bfilm and most of the male actors are old pros Paul Bartel is terrible to be fair I think that for some reason I don't understand he's actually trying to be terrible. The women of course were hired for their looks and they do fine on that basis.Still it doesn't work for several reasonsIt doesn't come close to transcending the genre clichs. Gee evil military men shortsighted gummint scientists stupid cops greedy businessmen and a pompous and annoying authority figure. Hohum. Look if you do exactly what other movies do in exactly the way they do it your movie isn't transcending the clichs. It's clichd.One exception to the above is that Bartel's annoying authority figure is not as genre convention would dictate a selfserving coward. Indeed in one scene he is actually permitted to display considerable physical courage in saving other people's lives. So never let it be said I'm unwilling to give credit where credit is due.Worse the piranhas kill in patently impossible ways. One character bleeds to death after the piranhas eat the foot which he dangles in the water. The next victim dies when the piranhas pull him out of a boat by his hand. The problem with all this is that when the victim felt the first nip he would yank his hand or foot out of the water and piranhas even evil mutant warmongering gummint piranhas are just not big enough to stop it. This isn't a matter of choice. If you've ever accidentally touched a hot stovetop burner you'll know what I mean. Your hand jumps away from the burner by itself no act of will is involved. It's pure reflex. It might be possible to intentionally place your hand on a burner and leave it there while it sears your flesh off your bones but if you're not expecting the pain you'll pull away.So we are forced to watch characters make literally superhuman efforts to let the piranhas eat them. It just looks stupid no matter what the intentions of the filmmakers were. After this it becomes impossible to take the film seriously on any level. If they wanted to do this kind of thing they should have played it for laughson the other hand given the level of the comic relief in this film hey Cletus those pants hit that cop in the face hyuk hyuk maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTThen the film's first big setpiece mass attack includes toward the beginning a piece of business so stupid that one laughsderisivelyjust at the wrong moment. And it endsin spite of the presence of at least a dozen people in the waterwith only one fatality because the rest of the potential piranha snacks were children and the filmmakers didn't have the guts to waste a kid.

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose if I were a genre buff I might have liked PIRANHA better. As it is I started out liking it OK then over the course of the movie found myself liking it less and less then actively disliking it more and more. By the end I was really sorry I had shelled out ten bucks for the DVD. At this point I don't even know if I'll bother to go back and check out the commentary track.Joe Dante is a reasonably talented director John Sayles's screenplay mostly mostly avoids the aggressive stupidity of the average genre Bfilm and most of the male actors are old pros Paul Bartel is terrible to be fair I think that for some reason I don't understand he's actually trying to be terrible. The women of course were hired for their looks and they do fine on that basis.Still it doesn't work for several reasonsIt doesn't come close to transcending the genre clichs. Gee evil military men shortsighted gummint scientists stupid cops greedy businessmen and a pompous and annoying authority figure. Hohum. Look if you do exactly what other movies do in exactly the way they do it your movie isn't transcending the clichs. It's clichd.One exception to the above is that Bartel's annoying authority figure is not as genre convention would dictate a selfserving coward. Indeed in one scene he is actually permitted to display considerable physical courage in saving other people's lives. So never let it be said I'm unwilling to give credit where credit is due.Worse the piranhas kill in patently impossible ways. One character bleeds to death after the piranhas eat the foot which he dangles in the water. The next victim dies when the piranhas pull him out of a boat by his hand. The problem with all this is that when the victim felt the first nip he would yank his hand or foot out of the water and piranhas even evil mutant warmongering gummint piranhas are just not big enough to stop it. This isn't a matter of choice. If you've ever accidentally touched a hot stovetop burner you'll know what I mean. Your hand jumps away from the burner by itself no act of will is involved. It's pure reflex. It might be possible to intentionally place your hand on a burner and leave it there while it sears your flesh off your bones but if you're not expecting the pain you'll pull away.So we are forced to watch characters make literally superhuman efforts to let the piranhas eat them. It just looks stupid no matter what the intentions of the filmmakers were. After this it becomes impossible to take the film seriously on any level. If they wanted to do this kind of thing they should have played it for laughson the other hand given the level of the comic relief in this film hey Cletus those pants hit that cop in the face hyuk hyuk maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTThen the film's first big setpiece mass attack includes toward the beginning a piece of business so stupid that one laughsderisivelyjust at the wrong moment. And it endsin spite of the presence of at least a dozen people in the waterwith only one fatality because the rest of the potential piranha snacks were children and the filmmakers didn't have the guts to waste a kid. In other words these superfish can pull a grown man off a boat but they can't manage to chomp a few small children who are already immersed in the water. What a world what a world.Of course in the climactic attack the piranhas are able with very little trouble to pull fullgrown adults off of air mattresses and innertubes which makes their failure in the preceding attack look just a little bit silly.And of course there's the basic problem with 99 of horror flicks horror isn't terror.

	schema:reviewBody "Two people stumble across a facility and accidentally release piranhas into a river that leads to a summer resort. Now it's up to them to convince people of the danger coming down the river.This is a great bgrade ripoff right off the back of Jaws success. Though it has a touch of comedy added in it basically making it a sort of spoofthriller. A notable sharp script filled with a lot wit and excellent performances from the leads and amusing parts from the supporting cast make this great entertainment. The piranha designs look alright and at times when it shows them moving all together it looks like cardboard with painted fish on it but the key is that they aren't clearly shown as a group and the film doesn't just centre on the piranhas. The music score is reasonably potent just like that of Jaws but it's definitely not in the same league. The sound of the attack is a sharp highpitch bubbling sound given when they're about to attack.The cinematography is stunning enough both in and out of the water and not forgetting the ravishing scenery along the river. The atmosphere is just brilliant with the suspense and tension to match that of Jaws. Though what director Joe Dante Gremlins 1  2 The Howling and The 'burbs does better than that of Spielberg is that he never let's the pace and story get bogged down. The whole concept of the piranha story is outlandishly overthetop but because of the superb laidback performances and the ingenious screenplay you forget the plot and just enjoy the ride. It's pretty hilarious watching people getting nibbled at first but when you get further into the movie it becomes more effective and a little disturbing when you see a whole a lot of children getting eaten especially when there not that annoying and that's before they even reach the resort. There's one striking scene that's incredibly haunting because the image is perfectly laid out. Bradford Dillman brings a lot depth and humour to his character Paul Grogan and Heather Menzies brings a charming and outgoing temperament to her character Maggie McKeown. The supporting roles Kevin McCarthy is unforgettable as the crazy doctor Dr. Robert Hoak who created and labored the piranhas Dick Millar fits perfectly as the greedy Resort owner Buck Gardner and Barbara Steele as Dr. Mengers Dr Hoaks exwork mate and now working for the army.Just another very good film produced by bgrades finest Roger Corman.45".

	schema:reviewBody "The first of the numerous Joe DanteJohn Sayles collaborations is a wicked tongueincheek horror comedy which uses JAWS as its inspiration but is much more fun than that straightfaced classic. In fact I enjoy PIRANHA so much that I'd rank it as my absolute favourite Joe Dante movie even better than THE HOWLING. An affectionately witty script a fastpaced and actionpacked story a great cast of Bmovie stars and some cheap but imaginative special effects work combine to make this one of the most intelligent Bmovies out there. Being a Dante film this is of special interest to the classic horror buff containing as it does clips of vintage monster flicks THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD turns up here references and injokes and familiar cast faces. Kevin McCarthy in particular has a great role as the misguided but human scientist who helped create the mutant strain of piranha in the first place and he gets to go memorably over the top as per usual.Dante scores points for grabbing the wonderful Barbara Steele for a bit part as a shady female doctor investigating the piranha outbreak Steele is a welcome presence as always and I think I'm right in saying this is her last horror appearance to date unfortunately. Eighteen years after her horror debut in BLACK Sunday and she's still looking great I'm glad to say. Dante regular Dick Miller has a small appearance as the slimy resort manager Buck Gardner but does exceptionally well with the part whilst director Paul Bartel puts in a very Tim Curryish turn as buffoonish summer camp counsellor Dumont. Then there's oldtimer Keenan Wynn as an early unfortunate victim who gets his legs chewed off and Heather Menzies as the feisty female lead. Towering over all of these folk is the one and only Bradford Dillman putting in a humorously serious performance as the alcohol Grogan who ends up becoming the unlikely hero of the movie. Go Brad! PIRANHA the film is unsurprisingly kept afloat through loads of piranha attacks. Dozens of cast members end up getting chewed by the little critters and there's plenty of blood and cheap gore effects to appeal to the horror crowd. The special effects have dated a little but are still lots of fun especially the brief moments of stop motion which pop up on occasion such as to animate the weird fishmen in the doc's lab at the beginning. Dante gets to stage not one but two major panic attacks at the finale in which rivers full of holidaying folk suddenly turn into screaming bloodbaths which prove to be a perfect way to end a hugely entertaining movie. Hearty congratulations to Dante and his crew for creating an underrated comedyhorror classic.".

It's up to boozy grumpy and reclusive backwoodsman Paul Grogan a fine and engaging performance by Bradford Dillman and plucky gogetter skip tracer Maggie McKeown a winningly spunky portrayal by Heather Menzies to stop the finny flesheating fiends before it's too late. Director Joe Dante working from a sharp and witty script by John Sayles who also has a cameo as an army sentry relates the fun story at a nonstop brisk pace adroitly builds a substantial amount of tension stages the piranha attack set pieces with real riproaring aplomb delivers a handy helping of graphic bloodshed and tops the whole thing off with a wickedly amusing sense of blithely selfaware and selfmocking sardonic humor McKeown plays a Jaws video game a bikiniclad babe reads Moby Dick on the beach plus there a few appropriate clips from wacky cartoons and vintage 50's golden oldie vintage creature features playing on various TV screens.

This said the central question of whether she was a saint an inspired lunatic wholly mentally ill or simply a headstrong girl determined to grab her chances while she could is well asked. Many of the comments here assert that Besson makes it clear that the Maid was simply mentally ill yet I read the film as deeply ambivalent about what was going on. Were her visions the hallucinations of a schizophrenic? Were they given by God? What's the difference? More questions are asked Why does an omnipotent omniscient allcompassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? What is the meaning of kingship  to own or to serve? What is the difference between taking the lives of individuals and killing en masse? What's the difference between Christianity and the earthly institutions of that religion? Where does conviction end and fanaticism begin? Jovavich's Jeanne is plagued by the difference between her idea of utter submission to God and the consequences of doing so by doubt over the veracity of her visions and by the gap between her ideals of the divine rights of kings and realpolitik. She is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown  is this a manifestation of her mental illness or of her burning for God? And where's the difference between the two?The film raises more questions than it answers and that's as it should be. It is something of a shame that Besson's film takes liberties with the facts as we understand them though history is more often about our interpretation of events than the events themselves but in terms of raising important questions on the nature of faith it succeeds beyond measure.".

	schema:headline " France's Tragic Teenage Warrior Messiah";
	schema:reviewBody "I found Luc Besson's take on the story of Joan of Arc thoroughly compelling. Like all of Besson's films The Messenger is highly stylized nicely cast and visually powerful. The film is also forgivably anachronistic in terms of language while developing a strong period feel through sets and costume. Joan was of course the deeply religious teenage girl who lead Prince Charles' army to improbable victory over the invading English at Orleans and helped reconsolidate French sovereignty. Joan considered herself God's appointed messenger and France apparently saw her as an avenging angel. Today she is commonly regarded as a schizophrenic. She was canonized in the 1950s 500 years after her death. Regardless of whether God or insanity was the source of her strength power will and incredible courage  there is little ambiguity about her role in the salvation of France nor the fate that awaited her afterward. In general the acting is quite good. Jovovich's muchmaligned performance is actually very good and exactly appropriate for what Besson was trying to do with the film. Comparing Joan of Arc to her other Messianic role as Leelu in the Fifth Element is frankly ridiculous. I believe that the problems people find in Jovovich's performance are problems those same people bring to the film. Malkovich and Dunaway are phenomenal. Tcheky Karyo and Vincent Cassell provide excellent support. Besson strays from what we think we know about the details of Joan's story but only to present the truth of the bigpicture more accurately. His film steadfastly refuses to answer the questions many people will bring to it  Was Joan schizophrenic?  Was she a catholic messiah or divinely inspired prophet?Why is Besson so careful about accurately presenting the ambiguity of the story? I think he wanted to make a moving film but not a film which would unsubtly challenge its audience's beliefs. If you do not believe you will tend to explain Dustin Hoffman's character as a manifestation of Joan's psychological problems. If you do believe you may want to think of him as Satan am angel perhaps both. Thus Besson who is a deeply spiritual person makes a powerful statement about faith through his metanarrative while maintaining an appropriately unevangelical position. He took similar paths in his more uplifting films The Fifth Element and AngelA.Highly recommended for Besson and Jovovich fans. Not a biography  avoid this if you must have the plain facts! Mildly recommended as a piece of historical fiction.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it were not based on a true story Luc Besson's The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile wide. Since it is however a recounting of one of the world's most famous stories of military triumph and personal tragedy the film actually generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those mindboggling historical incredibilities.Joan was of course the deeply devout illiterate peasant girl who spurred on by what she claimed were visions and voices sent directly by God  assuring her and France of a glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army  managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the field despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.   We first see her as a young girl strangely obsessed with religious piety attending confession daily running through the woods in a mad frenzy of ecstasy encountering strange inexplicable visions along the way and eventually being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape and murder of her beloved older sister.  We see the French royalty so driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the brutal British onto their native soil that they lend credence to this child and give in to her demands sending her out to lead the troops into what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories.  But glory is more often than not an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it is gained  and Joan learns tragically that once her original goal of restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved her services are no longer of value and she is allowed to be captured by the English tried by the Catholic Church and burned at the stake by the English government for the crime of witchcraft.Given this fascinating and astonishing series of events it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in interest and insight.  And indeed The Messenger' is perhaps a better film than many of the harsh almost bitter reviews by many critics would indicate.  The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of the tale.  The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill petulant adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is indeed someone all these military strategists would follow. But about midway through the film the screenwriters Andrew Birkin and writerdirector Besson begin to apply some psychological depth to the character.  After a particularly sanguine encounter with the English in which hundreds of decapitated and limbless corpses strew the bloodsoaked ground Joan breaks down in despair over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight.  From then on her actions arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her being  between the righteousness of her pious cause the pacifistic teachings of Christ and her singleminded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her trial she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an obsession for personal glory and power.  We're a long way from the astute psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the story The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc' but The Messenger' does take occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion borne of insanity.  Unfortunately casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as she descends more and more into seeming madness renders much of this otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly familiar face and voice arrive on the scene we are immediately thrust out of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the stake.   Also much of what he utters rings false in the context of the film's era he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.In terms of dialogue historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable Hobson's Choice  should the writers employ language that reflects the reality of the time thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated by today's standards or should the authors resort to the use of more modern vernacular enhancing the immediacy of the story perhaps but also possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of The Messenger' have for the most part taken the latter course leading to moodshattering declarations by the characters such as she's nuts!' and I'm gonna kill that f bitch' along with a barrage of fourletter word expletives with which no contemporary PG13 or Rrated feature could ever do without.Those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence had best be forewarned  the battle scenes though expertly shot and edited register high on the bloodletting scale.Of the performers none matches in quality the exquisite photography art direction or costume design that adorn the film.   Milla Jovovich is at best adequate as Joan rarely giving more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles occurring at the root of her personality.  John Malkovich as the wouldbe French king for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line has his moments but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film to allow him to create a multifaceted performance.  Faye Dunaway brings a cool subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative motherinlaw.The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying mixture of faults and virtues yet because it has such a fascinating story to tell the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.".

The story was already layed out approximately so Luc Besson concentrated on Jeanne herself the person and what she was like and why she did what she did.I have to admit to putting myself in Jeanne's place feeling what she must have been feeling along the way. I think without that it probably would have been a much duller movie although probably entertaining.The battles scenes of which there were many were graphic and brutal. Dismemberments swords and maces swinging lots of pain and death. The ensuing desolation at the end of a battle were weighty and gave a a horrible look at the conditions of the time.My final impressions... Joan of Arc if the portrayals were accurate was a driven young woman deeply religious and deeply confused who was probably at least partially insane. If she were alive today no doubt she would be treated with common drugs and would lead a normal life. I felt very sorry for her and her situation and for the way that she was treated. I know people would argue that there is no need to feel this way because she was clear and sure of her purpose. I don't feel that this was ever the case and she was sure only that she was going crazy if she didn't do something.Movies don't usually move me this way and I'm really amazed.".

Example William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet rereleased in 1996. However one of the greatest tragedies ever told the story of Joan of Arc has just been proven possible to be relateable even with time as its enemy. Luc Besson has created a freshfeeling new version of Joan called The Messenger a historical epic that for better or worse concentrates mostly on visual style and realistic war scenes rather than answering questions we don't already know about the characters in focus here. The historical Joan of Arc was a poor young French woman who believed that there were spiritual signs that ordered her to be a messenger to aid the King of France to victory on the battle field. According to The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc Charles VII married to the bitter Yolande D'Aragon was very grateful of her assistance at the time especially when Joan explained that God has sent her to lead French troops to war with the English and be victorious. The visions seen or imagined by Joan are clearly brought to life here with more effective qualities than ever before in a Joan of Arc picture. They are filmed with many unusual special effects bizarre camera tricks and a beautifully crafted atmosphere of imagery. In use with these elements to the credit of the depicted scenes they do a good job of expressing the spiritual dreamlike moments through Joan with an imaginative feeling of majesty and revealing emotion. The style camera and direction all contribute to making these sequences of the best material in the production.The film was shot in the Czech Republic as well as the country of France. Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast captures the courageous historical time period flawlessly in these locations. The battle scenes may get little off track at times some sequences are meant more for brutality purposes rather than a strong focused narrative story. The actors interpret their characters with a precise energetic edge. Milla Jovovich has the ability to be a believable Joan of Arc but does push the limit on convincing us. Some of the film's efforts are straining toward the idea that Joan was somewhat mentally retardedand Jovovich does a great job presenting that. Other familiar faces found in The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc include John Malkovich as King Charles VII and Faye Dunaway as his spouse Yolande D'Aragon. Also the legendary Dustin Hoffman inhabits a brief but appropriate role as the Grand Inquisitor and Pascal Greggory is The Duke of Alenon.There are scenes in this movie that make the audience stare at the screen in awe but also scenes that make us ask ourselves questions. Although much of the production is spent on developing Joan's character and motives the film still doesn't manage to answer some questions being asked by viewers pondering minds. We never learn if the visions Joan experienced were a calling from God or just a figment of her intellectual imagination. Was Joan really crazy or only near eccentric? Were the physical objects that Joan felt were signs from a higher spirit actually what she thought they were?  An ulterior source could have been Lucifer deceiving the trusting Joan. Or did the French actually triumph in battles because of the spiritual strength accorded by Joan or was luck the element present?  And I personally would have like a little more explanation of the Grand Inquisitor character. The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc is a serious dramatic tragedy and it takes itself as that all of the time. Luc Besson has constructed a movie that is ambitious and inspiring with no room for the compromising or modest. I recommend the picture weather you're a new comer or a veteran to the Joan of Arc mythology.  Even if you already know the story of Joan of Arc like the back of your hand this telling might just surprise you.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are wondering about Luc Besson's vaguely heretical The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc try to imagine a cross between Excalibur and Heaven's Gate. It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess. There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most onesided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems. Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor. Although there are records of both of Joan's trials her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation. What hurts The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in Leon. This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history. And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.But once Milla Jovovich's grownup Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances see The Dummy rather than subtlety and nuance making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama. But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The murderrape in that order a few minutes later confirmed my first impression but for some reason I stayed.Maybe I stayed because I teach classes on film and watch a lot of movies and I am more than willing to give ANY film a fair shot and sometimes two or three.  I wanted this film to succeed.  But it falls down on so many levels that I felt my own calling from God as it were to wage a small battle against it.The reviews published by the San Francisco papers NY Times and Chicago SunTimes Ebert give a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this film even though I think their two stars ratings are quite generous.To summarize my own thoughts on the film I feel that the script doesn't know what story it's trying to tell and Besson and Jovovich seem to have no sense at all for the complexities of Joan's story as it has come down to us.The acting is as overwrought and void of subtlety as any I've seen in a long time.  The only highlights are a couple of performances from supporting characters who unfortunately are shackled by the poor screenplay and Dustin Hoffman's appearance toward the end of the film way too little way too late to save the film.  I felt particularly saddened by the clownish performance John Malkovich gives although I can't help but thinkhope that he was forced to do it by Besson.  I wondered while watching the scene where Joan tells Charles about her revelations whether Malkovich was mocking Jovovich . . . and the whole production for that matter.Everything else you see in the film art direction costume design soundtrack special effects even the look of every single supporting and bit player etc. etc. is as cliche and unimaginative as the screenplay and acting.  It feels as if Besson and Co. sat down and said What is the absolutely most stereotypical image that the average moviegoer who knows nothing about 15thcentury France or Joan of Arc or who has never thought about spiritual things in a meaningful way will expect when he or she sits down to watch this film?

This was completely unnecessary and untrue. While it is fact that Joan's town was raided several times and on one occasion burned by the English Joan of Arc had 2 brothers but no sisters. This alone was enough to ruin the movie for me since Besson proceeds to build a case that all of Joan's actions and her descent into insanity were caused by the horrific death of her sister.Besson also inexplicably created a sinister tormentor for Joan played by Dustine Hoffman. Hoffman's character who continually played the devil's advocate to a clearly insane Joan was just plain annoying confusing and yet another fabrication. Besson's Joan was never seen having the visions of St. Margaret St. Catherine and St. Michael which the real Joan of Arc was reported to have. Instead she saw a twisted and almost demonic Christ figure and the strange Dustin Hoffman character. For Besson to portray a saint and a French national hero in such a manner was purely offensive and in poor taste. Had Besson actually bothered to base his story on historical fact I may have felt differently. If you see this movie regard it only as a work of fiction for it bears little in common with the real Joan of Arc other than her name and that she freed Orleans.".

Poor villagers at the trial in Rouen probably lied and Besson with Jovovich revealed a big historical fraud. One thing that I can't understand is why there are so many people that can call this unbelievable garbage a moving masterpiece. Maybe there is a lot of ignorants who know nothing about the historical reality and maybe they have only a foggy idea about the position of France but despite that I can't believe that somebody could think that French soldiers could follow a lunatic like this.I am very sorry for director Marshall who also planned a movie about Joan but he was probably forced to put off its realization because of this silly emanation that was quicker. The Joan with Leelee Sobieski was certainly better but Leelee simply lacks enough charisma Although otherwise she is a very pretty and sympathetic girl of course.Maybe Besson will soon make a similar biographical movie about Mother Theresa where he will definitively demythicize her as a deviant monster abusing little Indian children.

The historical inaccuracies were abundant such at the disgusting rape of Joan's sister which she in actuality did not have.

Most of the scences with her resembled footage from the Blair Witch Project more than a portrayal of St. Joan of Arc. She has little acting ability and her overdone performance absolutely ruined the movie. I do not feel that someone as strong as Joan and as religiously committed would have continually been on the verge of hysteria almost to the point of having a seizure.I still do not know what compelled me to sit through the whole movie. I have not seen anything this bad since the early 1980's remake of 1984.Had the movie paid more attention to historical data deemphasized those speculated vision scenes and used a legitimate actress  like Leelee Sobieski in the TV miniseries  this movie would have been a great success.This movie portrayed Joan as a confused hysterical psychotic.

	schema:headline " An appalling desecration of one of France's most venerable figures.";
	schema:reviewBody "From what I had heard prior to renting this movie I figured that I would be in for a decent though liberally violent interpretation of Jeanne d'Arc with historical accuracy that would outweigh most if not all of its negative aspects.  But what can I say other than that people don't recognize garbage no matter how far down their throats it is shoved?For this movie to receive any praise at all is ludicrous in itself. Certainly it could be an interesting prospect to examine the life of a supposedlyschizophrenic national figure with more negative connotations than positive but how far is it necessary to go to portray Besson's notion that Jeanne d'Arc may not have been as holy as she has been said to be?  How necessary is it to continually emphasize total pharisaism as opposed to mere pride?  How necessary is it to portray Jeanne's visions as downright satanic and dispense of the saints which had supposedly spoken to her?  And how necessary is it to portray her as a raving psychopath?If one is going to argue for historical accuracy then perhaps they should keep something in mind simply because somebody engages in a battle which in actuality took place it does not make for accuracy  the same goes for an individual performing a certain action or any other occurring event.  In fact this movie appears to guise itself under historical accuracy while it fails to explain any of the events that are taking place at the time. Yes we know that France is divided and that the English are attempting to take over but are we ever introduced to any of the political intricacies or other matters that Jeanne partook in other than those on the battle field? Anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that Jeanne d'Arc's story is not one of war.In addition there is lewd and tasteless humor interspersed throughout the entirety of this movie.  Obviously it was not enough to view the life of Jeanne d'Arc through the eyes of a cynic but through the eyes of a perverse teenageminded director as well.  If you're looking for a modern film on Joan of Arc do yourself a favor and take a look at the TV movie starring Leelee Sobieski.  Despite the fact that it is not historically accurate it is far more intellectual and entertaining than The Messenger will ever be.".

	onyx:emotionText "From what I had heard prior to renting this movie I figured that I would be in for a decent though liberally violent interpretation of Jeanne d'Arc with historical accuracy that would outweigh most if not all of its negative aspects.  But what can I say other than that people don't recognize garbage no matter how far down their throats it is shoved?For this movie to receive any praise at all is ludicrous in itself. Certainly it could be an interesting prospect to examine the life of a supposedlyschizophrenic national figure with more negative connotations than positive but how far is it necessary to go to portray Besson's notion that Jeanne d'Arc may not have been as holy as she has been said to be?  How necessary is it to continually emphasize total pharisaism as opposed to mere pride?  How necessary is it to portray Jeanne's visions as downright satanic and dispense of the saints which had supposedly spoken to her?  And how necessary is it to portray her as a raving psychopath?If one is going to argue for historical accuracy then perhaps they should keep something in mind simply because somebody engages in a battle which in actuality took place it does not make for accuracy  the same goes for an individual performing a certain action or any other occurring event.  In fact this movie appears to guise itself under historical accuracy while it fails to explain any of the events that are taking place at the time. Yes we know that France is divided and that the English are attempting to take over but are we ever introduced to any of the political intricacies or other matters that Jeanne partook in other than those on the battle field? Anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that Jeanne d'Arc's story is not one of war.In addition there is lewd and tasteless humor interspersed throughout the entirety of this movie.  Obviously it was not enough to view the life of Jeanne d'Arc through the eyes of a cynic but through the eyes of a perverse teenageminded director as well.  If you're looking for a modern film on Joan of Arc do yourself a favor and take a look at the TV movie starring Leelee Sobieski.  Despite the fact that it is not historically accurate it is far more intellectual and entertaining than The Messenger will ever be.";

	schema:reviewBody "I know next to nothing about the Joan of Arc story but I've liked Luc Besson's work and the trailer was terrific so I was looking forward to this movie even after the bad reviews.  As might be expected from a Besson film it looked incredible.  The battle scenes were all wellhandled and as the warrior Joan Jovovich was quite convincing.  The rest of the movie was something else again.It seems to me Besson and his cowriter Andrew Birkin were trying to do what Kenneth Branagh did in his version of HAMLET look at the lead character not as an icon but as a normal human being and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context.  Admittedly since I am unfamiliar with this story I am more receptive to this approach than those who hold Joan as an icon but I would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well.  Unfortunately once Besson established which way he wanted to go he seemed unsure of how to get there. Most of the drama is handled on a thirdgrade levelespecially her trial and we never really get into what made Joan tick.  Though the scenes with Dustin Hoffman were involving especially since he was so good they too fell short in explaining Joan.  And Jovovich can't quite access those depths yet.The rest of the cast is okay.  Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are playing types but they play them well enough.  Tchecky KayroI know I'm not spelling that right and Vincent Cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers.  But all in all this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp.".

Although the events occurred in the onset of the movie are simply not factual from the moment she was captured and the cross referencing that took place during the trial are closely based on the actual trial of Joan. Her convictions and faith were questioned through torturing but she had held them all the way through. The subtle portrayal of God himself was conspicuous. Joan was manipulated and ultimately burned at the stake that is God let these things happened to her after she fulfilled his mission. One would think that God should have rewarded her for defeating the English but rather he let her die at the hands of them.But still Joan of Arc carries the message of God with her even after centuries has passed.

As a movie I enjoyed this immensely. This movie gets the people right.Milla Javovich hits it perfectly. She is vulnerable while unstoppable. She is full of doubt but completely certain. And during the trial she can do caged animal with just her eyes. I can't imagine anyone else pulling this off. Milla does unapologetically devote better than anyone since Audrey Hepburn in The Nun's Story.The supporting cast did a stellar job. There are a lot of medieval movies and TV shows and most of them aren't believable because people aren't stern or earnest all the time. Game of Thrones is fun to watch because sometimes people laugh and sometimes they fight. If you ever saw a medieval movie and wondered what the guard standing next to the door does when the camera and the king aren't there this movie has it. Some reviews called that filler but it was fun and humanized the soldiers.I gave it a 10 because it showed people in a way different than other medieval movies.

The movie did peak my interest in how this family addressed issues openly among themselves. They did not try to sweep things under the rugs. Rather they used Sunday dinner as an opportunity to address tough family issues such an infidelity gambling addition and encarceration.The film was also successful at capturing many aspects of a typical 90's AfricanAmerican family. Being half AfricanAmerican I can see traces of my very own family in this film and thought that the script was very true open and honest.".

	schema:headline " Flavorful AfricanAmerican Family Melodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "Appetizing homecooked Sunday dinners save a family in stress in writer  director George Tillman Jr.'s autobiographical movie Soul Food an emotionally satisfying but occasionally saccharine tourdeforce family melodrama. Comparisons with Waiting to Exhale are inevitable but Soul Food shuns a sexist agenda that attributes its many ills to one sex at the expense of the other. Neither men nor women escape the devastating toll of the storyline. An ensemble cast of charismatic performers an entertaining plot that alternates happy moments with tragic episodes and Tillman's imaginative helming gives Soul Food a memorable if sometimes schmaltzy appeal.Eating Sunday dinner at Mother Joe's house constitutes an ageold family tradition for three Chicago Illinois based sisters Teri Vanessa L. Williams of Eraser Maxine Vivica A. Fox of Batman  Robin and Bird Nia Long of Friday. Mother Joe Irma P. Hall of Mo' Money lives to indulge her quarrelsome trio of daughters as much as her adorable grandchildren. Her favorite is Maxine's oldest son Ahmad Brandon Hammond of Mars Attacks. Tillman filters the poignant story of this family from the juvenile perspective of Ahmad.As Soul Food unfolds Bird has just married Lem Mekhi Phifer of Clockers a guy whose criminal record has already cost him his job. As the elder sister Teri acts as the chief financial genius of the family. She has an eye and a heart for dollars. As an affluent attorney Teri has bankrolled her youngest sister Bird in the beauty parlor business. Teri also supervises her mother's estate and manages the family's purse strings in woebegone times. Teri never lets anybody forget her pecuniary sacrifices especially Maxine. Teri's overwrought attitude alienates her younger sister Maxine. Rivals since high school Maxine stole Teri's boyfriend and took him to the altar. While Teri persevered with her college education Maxine dropped out. Her husband Kenny Jeffrey D. Sams of Waiting to Exhale and she started their own family. Two girls and a boy later they have managed to survive on Kenny's bluecollar salary with no ill effects. Teri struggles to make her second marriage a success but her greed and holierthanthou attitude sabotage her wellintentioned efforts. Eventually Teri's attitude jeopardizes her marriage to Miles Michael Beach of White Man's Burden. Although Miles and she are both wellheeled attorneys he has been bitten by the music bug. Miles wants to form a jazz band something Teri holds in utter contempt. She argues that Miles could be earning more money at the barthe legal bar. No matter how much these sisters bicker they always show up for Sunday dinner at Mother Joe's house. No sooner has Tillman set up the plot than he introduces a string of predicaments that starts with Mother Joe's tragic trip to the doctor. It seems that the indestructible matriarch must have a leg removed or she will die. Reluctantly Mother Joe consents to surgery. During the operation she suffers a stroke and slips into a coma. The sisters maintain a vigil at Mother Joe's bedside but their relationship continues to sour. They argue over Mother Joe's hospital bills and the traditional Sunday dinner is the casualty of their rage. Young Ahmad doesn't understand the family fracas. He doesn't understand why Teri and Miles have drifted apart or why Lem has been arrested and jailed for brandishing a firearm in a bar. Ahmad holds his own vigil at his grandmother's beside. If Mother Joe cannot physically reunite the fragmented family then perhaps Ahmad can. The ambitious youngster cooks up a plan that he is certain will bring the family back together for a traditional Sunday dinner. Nothing particularly original distinguishes Soul Food from a hundred or so similar family melodramas. The formulaic Tillman script plunges each character into a soup of despair. Indeed Soul Food would rate as little more than an ethnic potboiler were it not for Tillman's nimble directing. Although the soap opera storyline alternates one sister's plight with another sister's predicament the characters are so believably drawn and the atmosphere so filled with genuine sentiment that the film succeeds in spite of its clichs. At times Soul Food degenerates into plain oldfashioned mush. A subplot involving an elderly antisocial relative named Uncle Pete John M. Watson Sr. of Groundhog Day who hides in his upstairs bedroom is pretty warmedover. Ahmad's plan to reunite a family as suspicious as each of these relatives is seems a little farfetched too. Although Soul Food is a movie about a family some of its content may not be appropriate for all family members especially juveniles. The performances are all marvelous. Each cast member plays a substantial fleshandblood character with hopes and dreams. Hall steals the early scenes as Mother Joe. When one of Lem's curvaceous old flames threatens to disrupt Bird's wedding reception Mother Joe adroitly rescues her soninlaw without stirring up discord. Mother Joe's speech about how one finger accomplished less than a knuckledup fist is one of the movie's rousing highlights. Williams has the plum role as the materialistic sister who always gets the rough end of the stick. As her chief rival Fox is less materialistic and more maternal. Phifer brings credible dimensions to his role as an exconvict who faces the same song and dance from every employer who is afraid to hire him. You don't have to be AfricanAmerican to appreciate Soul Food. Although the movie is aimed at mainstream black audiences the problems that this family confronts are universal to any family. Ultimately the sympathetic characters and the rich atmosphere of loving kindness that permeates the action compensate for the sappy story. Tillman boosts things immensely by rejecting a happilyeverafter ending give the film a significance that it otherwise might lack.".

That family has various attributes some positive some negative all fairly realistic. The boy tells the story of the various relationships and of the importance of family.I'm only going to single out 3 actors here although all do a creditable job. Irma Hall as Mother Joe is wonderful as the central figure of the extended family. Mekhi Phifer is interesting to watch since this was one of his earlier roles.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best movies of the 90's. Although it was a hit at the box office when it came out and received very good reviews it surprisingly received no Oscar nominations and didn't quite mark a revolution in AfricanAmerican filmmaking that many critics predicted. However speaking as a fan of the film ten years later the film did spark a minor revolution that may have indirectly resulted in Tyler Perry's recent success.Also Irma P. Hall should definitely have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in this movie because she truly represented the glue that held the cast together. You could blame racism on the fact that she didn't get nominated but when you consider that this movie came out the same year as such monumentally great films as L.A. Confidential Good Will Hunting As Good As It Gets The Full Monty Donnie Brasco and perhaps most especially Titanic one can understand why Soul Food got a bit lost in the shuffle.However if this movie has one fundamental flaw it is the fact that it was a movie about family and really should have been a family movie. Heck it was one of those movies that really transcended the boundaries of race. What stopped it from being one of those movies was it's R rating.Of course the MPAA really isn't to blame on this one. For one they could have eliminated all but one of the Fwords except perhaps for Vivica A. Fox telling Vanessa L. Williams You are getting on my Fking nerves. I thought that use of the Fword was appropriate enough given the context. For instance I thought Williams' fk the family rant as much as her frustration was significant to that point in the film could have been expressed using other words.Second related to Williams' rant was it necessary for Miles Michael Beach to back Faith Gina Rivera up against a wall and hump her with his buttocks completely exposed? That scene alone was probably the straw that broke the camels back. The scene could have been just as effective not to mention tense if Miles was passionately kissing Faith. The scene that instead remains a permanent fixture in this movie borders on soft core porn. I'm not saying this because I'm a moralist. I'm saying this because this film really would have been a bigger hit if it was not rated R.Otherwise the film was great. The acting was top notch and the story line was very intriguing. I'm predicting that this film will turn out to be the black It's A Wonderful Life. By that I mean that like the Frank Capra classic it will gain much more of a following in the next decade or two. We shall see.".

	schema:reviewBody "SOUL FOOD was a huge deal back in the holiday season of 1997. Everyone was talking about the huge leap AfricanAmericans had taken in getting a nonstereotypical movie about black family values out on the big screen. There would be no shootemup by the corner scenes or baby momma's walking around. Here was a story depicting Middle class black people supporting family values and good ol' family Sunday dinners.Of course earlier in the year we had LOVE JONES a superior film that starred Larenz Tate and Nia Long. That movie didn't sugarcoat as much about relationships as SOUL FOOD did. And still EVE's BAYOU also released around the same time was overlooked even though it staggers high above the rest of the list. Boldly I enjoyed Showtime's version of this film better then the movie.We begin at Bird's wedding played by again the gorgeous Nia Long. Long has seemed to blossom from amateur school girl roles MADE IN America to now the mature and sexy kindred she deserves. Her voluptuous cleavage bursting from her blouse she is peeved her exhusband Mel Jackson has arrived to tamper with her ego and new husband Lem Mekhi Phifer perhaps because Phifer has just been released from prison.There's Maxine played by the talented Vivica A. Fox and her husband. Maxine is pregnant again and her oldest son Ahmad Brandon Hammond tells the audience his story about how the family holds it together. Maxine is stronger and more blunt about everyday situations so as she observes Lem dancing with a stranger she claims 'Let's go beat that ho down'. Not exactly proper etiquette but SOUL FOOD must let out a few 'ghetto' terminologies if it wants to attract its urban audience.Finally there's the rich couple Terry and Miles. Played brilliantly by Vanessa L. Williams and Michael Beach the attorneys with money are of course not happy. He wants a music career. She loathes that Maxine's husband gives her security while she feels her independent sculpture has caused drama no one can understand. Terry is snobby bitter and a workaholic. Her main power hold in the family is that she has the dollars to pay for things like Bird's wedding and beauty shop Maxine's car payments or Big Momma's hospital bills. Speaking of the latter Irma P. Hall delivers a brief but powerful performance as the Queen of the nest who holds it all together. A widow of a gambler she's seen hard times but knows how to work around them. Of course the clich' in the film finds her dying midway through which of course causes more drama amongst the family. Mysterious cousin Gena rolls in with the wind and finds her content with Miles since both like music. After they have a roll in the hay Terry files for divorce and finds even more bitter complaints to have. Meanwhile Bird struggles to find Lem a job when no one will hire him due to his criminal background.While entertaining after 10 years SOUL FOOD seems thin and drawn out. I didn't have as much fun watching it this time around even though I still think the performances are topnotch. Vanessa L. William by far gives the best performance in the film and yet I still wish there was more to Terry Joseph. At least on the show I found solitude with Nicole Ari Parker.".

Everyone was talking about the huge leap AfricanAmericans had taken in getting a nonstereotypical movie about black family values out on the big screen. There would be no shootemup by the corner scenes or baby momma's walking around.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since seeing the trailer earlier this year I had been looking forward to seeing Farsan the latest feature of the LebaneseSwedish director Josef Fares. I have enjoyed all of his films that I have seen so far from the comedic Jalla! Jalla! and Kopps to the more serious Zozo and Farsan doesn't disappoint either.Like many other Fares films Farsan deals with immigrants in Sweden even though the outsider's point of view is much less pronounced this time than in say Zozo. Aziz Jan Fares is a middleaged widower who works in a bicycle store and eagerly waits for the birth of his first grandchild. However his son Sami Hamadi Khemiri and daughterinlaw Amanda Nina Zanjani haven't dared to tell him that she is not really pregnant and that they are actually planning to adopt a child instead. After Sami suggests that his father should find a woman in his life to distract him from the baby issue Aziz starts looking for potential wife candidates with the help of his two colleagues the shy Jrgen Torkel Petersson and the laidback Juan Juan Rodrguez.The film's main charm lies more in the lovable characters and performances than in outlandish situations even though the comedic scenes are very funny at best especially Aziz training Jrgen to be manlier and teaching a lesson to an irate customer skilled in kung fu. The general tone of the film is closer to drama than comedy so a lot of attention is paid to fleshing the supporting characters out in addition to advancing the main storyline. Aziz's colleagues have their own troubles that reflect those of the main characters Juan must learn to let go of his old dying dog much like Aziz must get over the death of his dear deceased wife. In turn Jrgen has to overcome his marital insecurity not unlike Sami who is trying to find the courage to reveal the truth about his future child to his father.The director's own father Jan Fares does an excellent job as the eponymous dad I loved the sense of vulnerability he conveys under his seemingly cheery and selfconfident appearance. Torkel Petersson is more openly comedic as the emasculated Jrgen but also sends melancholic vibes through his role perhaps acting as a symbol of sorts for the meek Swedish man in the increasingly demanding modern society. The storyline of Juan and his old Labrador retriever Dino is the most wistful one and may well bring a tear or two to dog lovers' eyes.By including so many different emotions and details in one 97minute movie Josef Fares has certainly once again succeeded in delivering an enjoyable cinematic experience. I'm surprised to see it having only a mediocre rating on IMDb 5.610 with 657 votes at the time of writing this I don't feel there are too many plot lines or that the Jrgen type of character has already been done too many times in other movies as indicated by some reviews I've read. Personally I urge everyone to see the movie that will hopefully gain attention outside Sweden as well.".

But those of you who have seen quite a few similar kind of movies are most likely to see its shortcomings. The upside to this film is that although not being very good it is at the same time not very bad. And sometimes not bad is good enough. Mainly it serves its purpose and on the upside Jan Fares and Torkel Petersson act splendidly in some of their scenes. And Nina Zanjani looks stunning as always. Maybe a little too much on the Young Celine Dion side in this film but stunning nonetheless. There are some thoughtout moments and decent ideas though too many of them seem cramped within the story and even the good ones rarely lead anywhere. My guess is that they just didn't find the time to finetune the script. Or maybe the didn't care?

The point is if you want an exact version of events read a book on the subject it is very clear you cannot provide a full and 100 accurate account in the amount of time allowed by a film. Once you get over this point I felt that The Path to 911 was a well made drama which covered some very key episodes in the buildup to 911 and had some wonderful acting. The atmosphere of impending doom was beautifully handled and there is no doubt that one is left to dwell on some appalling mistakes made in the handling of terrorism prior to 911. What I find as a Brit remarkable is that so many on here are accusing the programme of rabid right wing bias. I have to say that I completely disagree. Yes the Clinton administration was made to look weak and irresolute but I hardly think that the makers of the programme covered the Bush regime with glory either. The fact that the film ended with the lack of progress made since 911 means it is hardly a proBush piece but at the same time since it was the Clinton administration in power during most of the preceding events it is only natural that it should shoulder its fair share of the blame. So why don't you lot get off your political bandwagons and just agree that the whole thing was one great big screw up not that Britain would have done any better I assure you!".

I never would have expected a TV network to produce something of this quality. What I saw was one of those very rare cases where TV lives up to the potential we once expected but have very rarely seen. Beginning with the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 it relives the events leading up to and including what many of us remember as possibly the worst day of our lives. Most importantly it reveals the hard work done by American intelligence agents and the frustrations they experience as politicians repeatedly find what some would call reasons and most of us would call excuses for not acting. The portrayal of events is first rate with an outstanding cast led by Harvey Keitel as FBI agent and al Qaeda expert John O'Neill and is quite consistent with the reports of the 911 commission and others such as Michael Scheuer.Concerning the politics I think this should be seen as a commentary not on one individual or political party as opposed to another but on how difficult it is to operate in a governmental system that encourages avoiding mistakes that the media and political opponents can use to destroy one's career more than taking needed action for the benefit of our society.".

However despite the excellent production standards there appears to be a flame war going on with people complaining about antiClinton bias while other contend that these people were silent with Mike Moore. Let me remind both sides that this docudrama portrays both sides as failing but that because Clinton was in power over a full eight years obviously there would be a greater focus on that period.But looking away from the political issue what the production showed was that those who operated in defending the United States each were complex characters. Some wanted immediate action while others wanted more time looking at the legal issues while there were other characters Clinton Albright who looked at the wider issues in play. This accurately reflects in my opinion the different nature of people in our world and it reflects accurately the different level of priority given to terrorism but both the Clinton and Bush Administrations over the period from 1993 to September 11 2001.".

To the liberal conspiracy theorist that thinks President Bush was somehow involved in the tragic events of 911 this is truly a bust. The liberal mind set is to ignore facts when they are presented to refute their ideas nomatter how crazy they might be. As an American that lets the facts do the talking this film exposes the ineptitude of the U.S. Government to successfully combat terrorism during the Clinton years.

There is not a lot of controversy there and whether you supported this or not it was intelligible to a certain degree since a US territory had not been attacked since WWII. Many Americans did not see a threat and most were caught offguard on 911.Therefore by depicting the Clinton Administration's political cautiousness to not go on the offensive without precedence especially during a scandal and later a heated election between Gore and Bush was not a political attack on Clinton but a fair assessment of what was happening in Washington at the time. Clinton may have been weak on national security and fearful of creating turmoil in the Middle East but he certainly would have been criticized from the right by putting boots on the ground while campaigning for Gore. This was even acknowledged in the movie.As far as the dialog I'm not sure if anyone involved with this movie had any first or secondhand knowledge of comments made by Secretary Albright or George Tenet or if Barbara Bodine was really that nasty. However I think the general description of where the main players stood was generally accurate and is supported by the 911 report and what facts are known.Overall I think this was a great movie and if anything I hope people realize that the real enemies are the terrorists who are still a threat and will attack if left alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The ruckus raised by Clinton supporters and leftists over this movie has been surprising.In a previous comment IMDb user Ed wrote Regardless of ones political leanings I think it is despicable for 911 to be fictionalized and history rewritten simply for political gain. I'd ask Ed a number of questions How does broadcasting a movie qualify as rewriting history? In your opinion do movies such as Fahrenheit 911 for instance qualify as rewriting history? Have you seen this TV movie read the script read a treatment of the script or had any access to this material prior to the movie's upcoming broadcast? For years the American left has been sympathetic to any artistic expression that offends conservatives or religious people.

	onyx:emotionText "The ruckus raised by Clinton supporters and leftists over this movie has been surprising.In a previous comment IMDb user Ed wrote Regardless of ones political leanings I think it is despicable for 911 to be fictionalized and history rewritten simply for political gain. I'd ask Ed a number of questions How does broadcasting a movie qualify as rewriting history? In your opinion do movies such as Fahrenheit 911 for instance qualify as rewriting history? Have you seen this TV movie read the script read a treatment of the script or had any access to this material prior to the movie's upcoming broadcast? For years the American left has been sympathetic to any artistic expression that offends conservatives or religious people.

From start to finish I was captivated even hesitating to take a bathroom break. The cinematography I think is the best feature offering many creative viewpoints and remarkably convincing recreations of several real events that happened behind closed doors. As for the political controversy surrounding this movie I was surprised to see only minute accusations of fault by the Clinton administration...and any of that was balanced by an equal blame on the Bush administration. If any blame was implied in this movie it was the government in general and not a particular administration or political affiliation. In addition it greatly disappoints me that a movie like Fahrenheit 911 can be critically acclaimed but when ABC releases a movie that is borderline hinting that the Clinton administration shared equal blame with the Bush administration they are threatened with the loss of their broadcasting license. I think both movies have every right to exist regardless of if I agree with them or not. If your going to preach about civil rights freedom of speech and all things of that nature then you better not complain about a movie that represents the practice of those very freedoms. In other words practice what you preach and if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. 'nough said.".

This is just one of many acounts in which the government could have stopped the disaster but acted foolishly. This particular account raises questions about our laws. I think we all agree that every human has a set of rights that should not and can not be violated but why does a foreign KNOWN CRIMINAL have the right for us not to look in his lap top. We are not starving him or torturing him or denying him any rights that every human deserves. But we are going too far when we allow that foreign criminal to not allow us to look through property which could prevent disaster.On another note. The film was WONDERFULLY MADE. The most impressive TV movie I have ever seen. ABC has stepped up the notch for TV films. It wasn't cheesy and in some parts it even held the emotional edge that a film in the theater would carry.It was refreshingly nonpartisan and the message was clear. LAWS NEED TO BE CHANGED. WHAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT DOING TO PROTECT US? HOW SAFE ARE WE? MANY GREAT MEN AND WOMAN DIED TO TRY AND PREVENT 911 The lion of Afghanastan. These messages are not affiliated with any government party. All Americans should watch this and be able to see that it is not pointing blame but trying to pry deeper in to the plague of terrorism.".

It dragged on in several spots.Another note Did anyone notice that a vast majority of the votes are either 1 or 10? A bit of partisanship maybe?

Is the squid a reincarnation of the previous champion and who is the squid's mysterious trainer? How far is the champion willing to go to defend his honor? Will his fianc fall in love with the squid?A delight to watch. The entire cast is having a great time one actor can't keep a smile off his face. The first half hour is brilliant the remainder great fun. Lots of jokes that translate well into English. The fights are silly but not much sillier than your average pro wrestling match. Interestingly the rubber monster suits wrestling in a ring has been done here in the US for quite a while by the crazy performing group Kaiju Big Battel look them up.

	schema:reviewBody "Ridiculous that's the only way to describe this movie. The costumes the fights the whole premise utterly ridiculous. And that's exactly what the filmmakers intended. If the name alone didn't tell you that something is up then you probably don't speak English. Not that any of the people here does either because The Calamari Wrestler is from where else Japan.This is the kind of production that only the Japanese could make. The storyline is actually quite familiar. Mysterious outsider with skills like noone has seen before enters the ring set on winning the championship and the girl of his dreams. Pretty standard except that the wrestler is a giant squid! Yes in the pretitle scene following the championship bout of Japan's premier wrestling league a giant squid appears from nowhere and defeats the new champion.But this isn't just any old piece of Calamari this is Kanichi Iwata former champion who was forced to retire with a terminal illness. Now he's returned to claim his title. He also hopes to reconnect with his former girlfriend Miako who's now dating his rival Koji Taguchi. I don't think I need to tell you how this boygirlsquid love triangle turns out.For the first half of the film everything builds up towards the big rematch to determine who will hold the title belt. The match when it comes features a hilarious twist and it's not over yet. Iwata's spot at the top is now threatened by an even more formidable opponent the utterly merciless Squilla Boxer. Can the Calamari wrestler keep his title with the help of a former foe? And what's up with his promoter? These and many other questions which you may not have will be answered in the riotously funny ending which I admit I had not completely anticipated.Now this may sound like the kind of schlock fest where the writers count on the characters to get laughs because of what they are rather than what they do. You know the kind of thing that seems like a high school play where you'd enjoy it more if you were close friends with the actors. But that's not how this turned out at all. Out of all the approaches the filmmakers could have taken to the humor they chose to do it completely deadpan. Every scene is played entirely strait and I can't imagine how the actors kept from cracking up.Another thing that the filmmakers have done an outstanding job of is parodying the 'sport' of pro wrestling. Every aspect is lampooned here from the outsize egos of the wrestlers to the execs' obsession with ratings and merchandising revenue to the wacky scripted story lines. Considering some of the matches that the WWE has set up in the past few years maybe guys fighting each other while dressed as marine life is the next big thing.The fans don't escape the treatment either. In numerous interviews they come off as hopelessly devoted to their idols in the ring. Especially hilarious is the newscast from the market Iwata frequents in which the shop owners do everything they can to cash in on the buzz surrounding him. At the same time the movie's surprisingly honest about the blood lust that drives many fans. Comparisons with This is Spinal Tap may not be farfetched. The Calamari Wrestler certainly isn't at the same level as that classic mockumentary but it's a highly entertaining comedy in its own right.".

	schema:reviewBody "A reclusive author whose only published novel won the Pulitzer Prize becomes the mentor of an underprivileged and talented sixteenyearold in Finding Forrester' directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Connery and newcomer Rob Brown.  Young Jamal Wallace Brown is a star basketball player in his neighborhood and unbeknownst to his peers also has a gift for writing.  The acceptance he needs from his friends however that need to fit in' is derived from playing ball yet his heart is in his writing. But he knows that within the limited confines of his environs his skill with the written word means next to nothing in regards to his future and he sees basketball as the only viable means of doing anything worthwhile with his life.  That is until one day circumstances bring him into contact with William Forrester Connery and it's an encounter that ultimately changes the direction of his life forever. Working from an intelligent well crafted screenplay by Mike Rich Van Sant establishes the milieu within which the story will unfold with his opening shot  A black youth setting the stage in rap.  It's clever and effective and the contrast between the rap at the beginning and the song at the end not only frames the film but underscores the impact of the story as it succinctly encapsulates the changes in Jamal's life.  As he did with Drugstore Cowboy' and Good Will Hunting' Van Sant successfully captures the essence of a particular culture and how those living within it relate to those apart from it.  It's a study of human nature and the levels of diversity of which our society is comprised and Van Sant does it exceedingly well. As far as performances go Connery makes the most of one of his best roles in years.  Perfectly cast as Forrester he lends an adamant toughness to the character initially then slowly and subtly allows the vulnerability that lies beneath the gruff exterior to surface.  It makes for a wellrounded complete portrayal as we see not only his iconoclastic leanings but the very human and caring side of the man as well.  And it's Connery's superlative performance through which he conveys the complexities of the character so well that illuminates the true depth and multifaceted dimensions of Forrester it is not only memorable but worthy of an Oscar. In his motion picture debut Brown takes the screen by storm a storm that is at once gentle and discerning yet endowed with a strength born of it's own momentum.  With a manner reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in Boyz N the Hood' he has a natural acting ability that commands attention and if his performance here is any indication of his talents which obviously it must be then it is safe to say that the cinematic world has certainly just been enriched by his presence. The supporting cast includes F. Murray Abraham Professor Robert Crawford Anna Paquin Claire Busta Rhymes Terrell April Grace Ms. Joyce Michael Pitt Coleridge and Michael Nouri Dr. Spence.  An uplifting example of deriving hope from hopelessness Finding Forrester' is an entertaining and moving testimony to the resilience and depth of the human spirit.  It's a film that will stay with you long after the screen has gone dark for there is much here to be savored and embraced a film too good to be allowed to let pass you by.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a person who enjoys good movies as well as reading and writing I loved this film and would see it again. Some may accuse it of being formulaic but I feel that there is just enough unexpectedness in it to keep the audience interested.  I would hope that the apparent similarities to the director Gus Van Sant's earlier work Good Will Hunting do not dissuade anyone from seeing the film.  Any similarities are unimportant and do not take away from the fact that this is a good movie which stands alone as a deep film with an good plot. The script is very well written and all of the dialog appears real and natural.  It is a thought provoking drama but it is not depressing or sappy as all too many dramas are.  At the same time it does not give the impression of simply being a feelgood movie. Also although there are several humorous lines in the movie they do not rely on cheap puns or slap stick humor.William Forester once wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book but now is a recluse hiding from his fame who never leaves his bookfilled apartment in the Bronx but spends his time reading and bird watching as well as watching the teenagers of the neighborhood play basketball in the park outside his window.  Jamal Wallace is one of these teenagers.  He hides his love of reading and his brilliant writing skills and chooses instead to gain the acceptance of his peers through his skill at basketball. A prep school has offered Jamal a scholarship because of his high test scores and their need to win a basketball championship.  The two characters meet and Forester becomes a sort of teachermentor but both learn many things from each other.  Symbolism is important in this film and it makes many good points about people how we relate to each other and how we deal with the difficulties of life.The movie stays away from any violence and sex.  It is rated PG13 because of brief strong language and sexual references but even these are few and not over done using only what is necessary to create real characters and setting  a refreshing difference from many films that are now being made. The message of the film is good and moral but it was wonderful to see a serious film staring a young black person that does not hit you over the head with messages of racial tolerance.One of the surprises in the film is the great soundtrack.  It is mostly Jazz songs from Miles Davis and others which seems well suited to the mood of the movie and to the setting another well done part of the film.  The final song a medley of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and What a Wonderful World is great.  I was happy that this movie had refused to do what many recent movies have done in capitalizing on a soundtrack and trying to use or create hit pop songs in a movie.  It also stays away from sappy and unnecessary orchestra music that is often used to try to create emotion in the audience. This movie does not need to resort to tricks like this in order to make you feel for the characters.  Another happy surprise is a cameo from Matt Damon.The acting is wonderful particularly from the experienced Sean Connery playing the title character and from newcomer Robert Brown as Jamal. Even the more minor parts in the film such as Jamal's older brother played by Busta Rhymes and Jamal's friends and teachers are wellacted.  Anna Paquin is well suited for her role as Claire a rich girl from the prep school that Jamal transfers to.  The two seem to make a connection but a romantic subplot is not pursued very far in the film.  I found this a refreshing change and one of the factors that kept the movie from being too predictable as well as much more realistic.  Real life romances do not usually happen the way they often do in films.  A disappointment was the character played by F. Murray Abraham.  Although well acted there is a complete lack of character development and the teacherthatgivesthebrilliantstudentahardtime stereotype is hard to ignore.  Despite this one shortcoming this is an excellent film.As the film ended and the credits began to roll I noticed that no one in the theater got up to leave as is usually the case in theaters.  The audience remained seated until the credits and music had finished and the lights came back on.  It is just that kind of a movie.  I would defiantly recommend it to anyone wishing to see a mature and thoughtprovoking film that is entertaining and enjoyable to watch and will leave you feeling inspired.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard a little about this movie before and entered into watching it merely expecting to see another of Sean Connery's typical Connery performances. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with that he is a very good actor but he always plays himself. Other than that I had no inclination what the story was about so there was surprise from the outset seeing that the movie was starring Busta Rhymes and was set in the Bronx.How surprised I was as this gentle and perfectly paced tale brings together two people who share a common love for writing one is a faded writer who once had success and the other is a new talent who faces so many obstacles in his path to let his talent shine.There are similarities to other films such as Dead Poets Society but what captures the viewer and their imagination is the restraint and the simplicity. There are no great acts or contrived emotionally charged plot twists this is real and it's character driven. You believe in the characters the acting is so natural and understated you are easily drawn into the movie and the characters lives and it's hard to break free. Choices and actions are small compassionate and you can relate them to real life.The relationship between Forrester Connery and Jamal Rob Brown is superbly played with Brown holding back perfectly until the scene where his restraint fails and Connery giving one of the most emotive and complex performances I have ever seen. His performance is simply stunning and totally off of the Connery mould. Watching his face as he struggles with demons long past was extraordinary.Overall the story is very well written and doesn't fail to pull you along with the emotional journey and yet never hit the twee button. You can feel the passion that Connery has for writing and see the complexity of emotions as he wants to help the boy but gets pulled back by hidden problems. Problems which slowly reveal themselves and get shared and dealt with in the most natural of ways again never falling foul of an emotion overload.It's warm uplifting and an inspiring story and I recommend it to anyone. I really can't be vocal enough about the stunning performance by Connery and the matching performance by Brown. Even Rhymes shows that he has talent.".

Van Sant gives Forrester's apartment a dark and dreary look from a color and lighting perspective which is particularly effective.Sean Connery is in top form and continues to make the case for being one of our best and most treasured actors.  He gives a virtuoso performance in this film with a complex and ornery character.  It is a powerful and moving portrayal.  Rob Brown is phenomenal in his first feature film.  He was found in a talent search and made an impressive debut with an extremely mature performance.  With the right scripts he has a good chance of having a bright future.  F.

	schema:headline " Finding meaning in Finding Forrester";
	schema:reviewBody "The mechanics of the movie have been wellreviewed by others.  Yes it could definitely have been a better movie but then again what movie can't you say that about?  In terms of plot and character development what it needed most was another 30 minutes but at two and a quarter hours already most studios would never allow that.  Note that the movie did not seem nearly that long to me. Perhaps the plot and story could have been tighter but it's really a remarkable job for firsttime screenwriter Mike Rich.The acting while not always remarkable was quite good.  Connery brilliantly underplayed Forrester yielding a less dramatic but much more realistic portrayal of the writer.  Rob Brown's portrayal of Jamal was equally reserved yet forceful.  The directing held the two characters in balance well.  The other characters were wellacted though not generally welldeveloped hence much criticism of this movie.Others have compared Finding Forrester to Goodwill Hunting also directed by Gus Van Sant and to Scent of a Woman suggesting that it is just a ripoff of the plot in those two.  If so which I doubt those are two pretty good movies to plagiarize.  The basic concept of Forrester's story first novel wins Pulitzer  what do you do for an encore? has also been done before but I've never seen it done so well and without resorting to The Bottle as an excuse for a wasted life.What's been missed in the reviews I checked was a discussion of who found whom.

	onyx:emotionText "The mechanics of the movie have been wellreviewed by others.  Yes it could definitely have been a better movie but then again what movie can't you say that about?  In terms of plot and character development what it needed most was another 30 minutes but at two and a quarter hours already most studios would never allow that.  Note that the movie did not seem nearly that long to me. Perhaps the plot and story could have been tighter but it's really a remarkable job for firsttime screenwriter Mike Rich.The acting while not always remarkable was quite good.  Connery brilliantly underplayed Forrester yielding a less dramatic but much more realistic portrayal of the writer.  Rob Brown's portrayal of Jamal was equally reserved yet forceful.  The directing held the two characters in balance well.  The other characters were wellacted though not generally welldeveloped hence much criticism of this movie.Others have compared Finding Forrester to Goodwill Hunting also directed by Gus Van Sant and to Scent of a Woman suggesting that it is just a ripoff of the plot in those two.  If so which I doubt those are two pretty good movies to plagiarize.  The basic concept of Forrester's story first novel wins Pulitzer  what do you do for an encore? has also been done before but I've never seen it done so well and without resorting to The Bottle as an excuse for a wasted life.What's been missed in the reviews I checked was a discussion of who found whom.

I've heard many people say that this is just director Gus Van Sant's retread of his oscar winning hit 'Good Will Hunting'. That is the furthest statement from the truth. Eventhough the general idea of two different people bonding is here everything else is as different as it comes.The story is about Jamal WallaceRob Brown making his bigscreen debut an allstar basketball player who's only 16 but has a passion for writing and reading. One night on a bet he breaks into the apartment of a person only known to the neighborhood kids as The Window. But when he's caught Wallace bolts and forgets his backpack. Later he gets his backpack back with all his written material analyzed corrected ect. After revisiting the man Wallace finds out that The Window is none other than reclusive author William ForresterSean Connery who has been hiding for 40 years. They cut a deal that as long as Jamal doesn't tell anybody about William then William must help Jamal with his writing. Over the course of the movie a beautiful bond forms as the two different people become friends and partners. Along the way William helps Jamal deal with his biased english professor Robert CrawfordF. Murray Abraham his new girlfriendAnna Paquin his brotherrapper Busta Rhymes and everyone else in his life.The acting in this film is universally excellent and no matter how it is billed Brown is the real star of this movie. Connery is brilliant but isn't on the screen enough to outshine Brown. Abraham comes off as the perfect nemesis and Busta Rhymes acquits himself rather well. Anna Paquin isn't too bad but she isn't given too much to do. Excellent supporting cast withstanding the best scenes in the film are the one on one interactions between Brown and Connery. I especially loved the Soup questions scene and the Jeopardy scene.Considering this is Van Sant's first film since the terrible 'Psycho' remake he made a few years back he does very well. And surprisingly he generates more tension and suspense in one basketball sequence late in the movie than he did in all of 'Psycho'.Overall this is not only Van Sant's best movie but also the best film all year. And after seeing this movie three weeks after the Academy Awards it makes it all the more shocking that 'Gladiator' won as I can't see how in any way it is better than this great film. Like a great book 'Finding Forrester' gets better every viewing and i'm sure it will stand the test of time. 1010".

Then inexplicably the comment was removed because some unknown user complained about it for some unknown reason. Tightspotkilo appealed to IMDb and they encouraged him to repost it. I am reposting it in his stead. Fair commentary that is less than fawning should NOT be removed because someone disagrees with what it written. Here goes.Good performances by Sean Connery and Rob Brown in the latter's screen debut. Good direction by Gus Van Sant too. But alas not a good movie. The problem is much more fundamental than whether you have a good cast or a good director. The problem is with the story. Some say the story was ripped off from Good Will Hunting and I can see the obvious reasons behind people getting that idea. But I don't agree too much with it. If this story was ripped from anywhere it was ripped from the real life biography of Joyce Maynard when as a young woman still in her late teens she pierced the veil of privacy and famously took up with the notoriously reclusive and fiftysomething writing legend J.D. Salinger who among other things mentored her in her writing. This movie mimics that sequence of events more than it does Good Will Hunting. I might even go so far as to wager that the Maynard experience in some way inspired Mike Rich when he wrote Finding Forrester minus of course the sexual relationship that existed between between Salinger and Maynard. The William Forrester character just oozes too much of J.D. Salinger in so many of the particulars and details of his personality quirks for that to be a coincidence. But as for the story itself when you get right down to the nub of it neither Good Will Hunting nor Joyce Maynard's life story are truly mirrored in Finding Forrester mainly because the sine qua non of the Finding Forrester story what really drives it is the racial contrast between the protagonists and race did not figure in those other comparative examples in any way. Clearly Mike Rich was fully invested in exploiting the racial angle for all it was worth in contriving a feel good story. So we end up with a final product that is very contrived very pat indeed very formulaic in its singleminded quest to blatantly manipulate the emotions of the target audience. And that target audience is surely liberal whites who caught up in the throes of their selfcongratulatory feelgoodism are utterly oblivious as to how unrealistic the story really is.Don't misunderstand me. I don't mind having my emotions manipulated per se. In fact the capacity to evoke emotion is the res of art art's very essence. But that said I don't like in fact resent a concocted effort to manipulate my emotions in a false or phony way. And that's what happens here. There are ways that this story could have been told that would've been real that would've been faithful to the true nature of an inner city urban youth trying to find a way to express himself and to juxtapose it alongside and then inject it into the life of a J.D. Salingertype character. It could have been done with verisimilitude. In fact I can visualize John Updike writing that story. But Mike Rich didn't write it.If you haven't already watch Radio also written by Mike Rich. You will discern a thematic pattern. Rich is fond of pandering to liberal whites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jamal Wallace is a black highschool student living in the Bronx New York. He has a talent for basketball which is popular with his friends and a talent for writing that he tends not to talk up. His test scores bring him to the attention of an exclusive private school with offers of a scholarship starting immediately. Meanwhile he gives in to his friend's challenges and breaks into the flat of a man known as the window because he never leaves his flat but just stares out at the world passing outside. When he is confronted by the man Wallace flees but forgets his bag but it is given back later with all his note book scribbled on and critiqued. He goes back to the flat and tries to get the man to help him further with his writing.Has it been so many years since Good Will Hunting that Van Sant felt the need to remake it with elements changed? And if so did he feel so insecure about doing it that he delivered with such little originality and blandness so that the audience knows just what they are getting and feels comfortable if unimpressed? I guess the answers to both those questions is yes because Finding Forrester is very much a version of Good Will Hunting with the basics kept the same and other bits changed around. Of course this does not mean that it is a bad film because I actually quite enjoyed it although I knew just where it was going and what it was doing from start to finish. In this way it is a bit annoying that director and writer should be so uninterested in doing anything other than trudging out such obvious material.The story although familiar is well enough told though to make it worth seeing. What made it much better for me though were the two genuinely engaging performances in the lead. Given fairly obvious characters to work with I felt that both Brown and Connery took it worked it and made it more than the sum of the words in the script. Brown is impressive by how much seems to be going on behind his eyes and I was more impressed when I learnt that this was his acting debut. Connery is equally as good in a role that he could have slummed off his famous voice and natural presence but instead he works with a vulnerability that is convincing and makes his character and the story so much more interesting. Neither of them can make this a wonderful film but they both do a lot of work to make it an enjoyable and engaging one. Support from Abraham is bythenumbers but effective although his final scene is unconvincing I didn't understand why Paquin bothered or why they bothered to have her character in the story while Rhymes is just what you expect and only looks weak at the end when he is asked to emote.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable film despite the fact that it seems determined to do just what you expect it to do. That said the story is still interesting but what really does the business are the two great performances from Brown and Connery  both as individuals but also together they take the obvious material and make it somehow much more convincing and engaging. Not a great film by any stretch of the imaginative and too derivative to really stick in the mind but does enough to entertain.".

I had a slight recollection of a recommendation from a friend some time ago. In a nutshell we really enjoyed this film. Both main characters are charming and convincing. The story makes you think and is clever. If you liked Good Will Hunting you will probably like this movie too since it has a similar flavor to it. Though the film is 4 years old the story is timeless and worth watching. Enjoy Jimmy".

	onyx:emotionText "September 2004.... While walking through the aisles of Blockbuster in search of films my wife and I may have missed through the years we stumbled on Finding Forrester. I had a slight recollection of a recommendation from a friend some time ago. In a nutshell we really enjoyed this film. Both main characters are charming and convincing. The story makes you think and is clever. If you liked Good Will Hunting you will probably like this movie too since it has a similar flavor to it. Though the film is 4 years old the story is timeless and worth watching. Enjoy Jimmy";

Forrester's main characters stakes are more obvious where I thought in Hunting there were more subtleties.  Van Sant does an effective job at showing the different worlds at stake.  How New York is a Tale of Two Cities.  This is the kind of movie that should be shown in schools.  I believe there is social benefit to be gained. We are also introduced to a new actor that Van Sant discovered.  I think people will be amazed at how he naturally plays the part and opposite Connery's Forrester. I'm sure you will enjoy it just try not to compare it too much.  Though there is an obvious reason when you watch it.".

Do you think that would make it easier or harder to keep?Jamal Wallace played by Rob Brown is a basketball player in the Bronx. When we enter the story he's recently taken academic assessment tests and in contrast to his work in class has scored high enough to gain the attention of the school board. On top of this it is mentioned that Jamal Brown is an exceptional basketball player. One night after a successful game he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant. They discuss among other things a neighborhood resident who is something of an urban legend referred to simply as the window because he never leaves his apartment. A common tradition among the group is for one member to dare another. One of the men dares Jamal to break into the window's apartment and return with something from inside. Jamal enters the apartment and sees a letter opener shaped like a knife but much to his surprise the window catches him yelling loudly and inspiring Jamal to flee. Until his mother makes him aware of the fact he never realized that he left his backpack in the apartment. That's set aside briefly when he meets with an admissions officer from an expensive private school as a result of his test scores. When his mother says they couldn't possibly afford the tuition the school official says that if Jamal were to continue playing basketball with the same skill for his new school that tuition will not be an issue. In the time since Jamal's backpack was unceremoniously dropped from the window's apartment and the notebooks inside all containing creative writing of Jamal's now with editorial comments written with a red pen. Jamal approaches the apartment this time using the front door and asks the window if he would read more of his writing.I truly love this movie. Brown as Jamal Wallace is a character you cannot help but like despite his momentary foray into delinquency. The Window who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. The Window played by Sean Connery is a very sympathetic character and as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better. Until recently I hadn't watched this film for some time. Since watching it again I have no idea why it took me this long. You should see this movie as soon as you can.".

Forrester lives alone dislikes people and makes witty but insightful statements about people and the world the way reclusive writers always do in these kind of films. As luck would have it Wallace just happens to be studying Forrester's book at school and the old boy is able to give him some pointers. But disaster strikes when Wallace humiliates his school tutor F.

In which case you're probably the target audience. It's one of those films where being able to quote random lines from Dickens or Mark Twain is meant to convey great literary ability. Characters supposedly have minutelydetailed recollection of great works of literature despite never apparently picking up a book let alone reading one. The main advantage of Wallace's literary ability seems to be that it increases his pulling power. Maybe we should admire an attempt like this to convince us that literary knowledge is a sure way of picking up girls but I thought the makers had something more serious in mind. This whole film sadly is conducted on a TV movie level which is really no more than it deserves. The plot is mechanical and predictable and the characters aren't even vaguely convincing. Connery can be a good actor but he's given nothing to really work with and the story and character development in Finding Forrester are strictly by the numbers. Save for a star cameo towards the end there really isn't a surprise in the whole film.".

I originally watched this one at the movies with some friends. I left the theatre utterly relieved and having made peace with the fact I someday would forget my ordeal. My friends found the movie good. That amazed me because it just doesn't work. Mr Connery can only play Mr Connery and to be honest that is fine with me. I mean he does it really well. But not even that can make this film bearable. The scene where the distant angry young man enters Connery' apartment and randomly opens up speaking about abandonment and neglect without having even seen Mr Bond. Well that is one way of reaching out. I never figured out what the romance with the highclass poor little rich girl was supposed to establish. Miss Paquin however who in the past managed to get wonderfully human performances out of mutes and ducks can do very little with her costar. In fact one wonders if her better scenes landed on the cutting room floor. One scene which did not land on the cutting room floor was the infamous furtherfarther scene. Since I saw that scene I have started using them wrongly in the hope some angry young man will correct me and i can get a cheap laugh. Even bringing in Matt Damon as a nod to Good Will Hunting could only make the situation worse. It was... sad. Adam Sandler would have been better well funkier at least. I have no farther comment!".

I originally watched this one at the movies with some friends. I left the theatre utterly relieved and having made peace with the fact I someday would forget my ordeal. My friends found the movie good. That amazed me because it just doesn't work. Mr Connery can only play Mr Connery and to be honest that is fine with me. I mean he does it really well. But not even that can make this film bearable. The scene where the distant angry young man enters Connery' apartment and randomly opens up speaking about abandonment and neglect without having even seen Mr Bond. Well that is one way of reaching out. I never figured out what the romance with the highclass poor little rich girl was supposed to establish. Miss Paquin however who in the past managed to get wonderfully human performances out of mutes and ducks can do very little with her costar. In fact one wonders if her better scenes landed on the cutting room floor. One scene which did not land on the cutting room floor was the infamous furtherfarther scene. Since I saw that scene I have started using them wrongly in the hope some angry young man will correct me and i can get a cheap laugh. Even bringing in Matt Damon as a nod to Good Will Hunting could only make the situation worse. It was... sad. Adam Sandler would have been better well funkier at least. I have no farther comment!";

Main character young Jamal Wallace isn't interesting in any way  he is presented to us as being just perfect so perfect that it becomes unrealistic. He plays basketball perfectly he is a role model son incredible natural talent for writing and at age 16 he can quote by heart any novel ever written in English language. His mentor William Forester Sean Connery has spent decades in hiding for no realistic reason whatsoever nor for a reason that one could ever sympathize with or understand as serious. It is painfully obvious that the only reason why producers created his character as such was to have him liberated and inspired by our imperfectionless hero. As was clear from the start Forrester appeared at the end of the movie in a pale imitation of Al Pacino's entrance in defense of his protg in Scent of a Woman. Don't waste your time on this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie a lot when I was a kid. I think I even remember saying to myself that it was one of my favorite inspirational movies. Looking back it was okay. I'll keep it as brief as I can 1. The biggest problem with this movie in my humble opinion is the script. The writing of this movie was heavyhanded and extremely awkward. The dialogue was okay. It wasn't horrible but there were moments that took me out of the movie and made me think about how strange the lines were. In particular the beginning exposition with Jamal and friends sitting in school talking about Forrester was strange. I kept thinking wait people don't say stuff like this. It felt like a weird old guy trying to write urban dialogue while simultaneously characterizing the window. I guess ultimately I'd just say that there was a strange disconnect. Many elements of the movie were hackneyed and sloppy. The love story element was extremely weird to me. I thought that entire relationship between Jamal and Anna Paquin was rushed and not believable. The racism elementsthe changing social circle elements were strange as well. But I don't even think this movie was about race or class really. They just kind of threw in those elements sloppily like afterthoughts. Basically they have Jamal say it's because I'm black isn't it?. That's the extent of racism's role in this movie. To the film's credit at least it didn't hit you over the head with these minor parts. It doesn't sink to the level of a Step Up movie despite having a very similar idea to those pieces of crap. The character arcs were weird too. I can't really put into words how Forrester changed. I have a hard time pinning down exactly what Jamal did for William that cured his fear of the world. It almost feels like Forrester went to defend Jamal just on a whim. Similarly I can't really pin down Jamal's arc. What happened to him? He got better at writing? And...? Then what? I suppose you could force out some idea about beating the system but I don't think that was emphasized enough. 2. Look no one wants to criticize Gus Van Sant. I get it. I didn't think the directing was that bad. He definitely gets points for squeezing out decent performances. This wasn't exactly a complex movie with complicated imagery or anything. One thing sticks out though. When Professor Crawford and co. confront Jamal about plagiarism I couldn't even tell that there was more than one professor in the room. It was just a scene where I couldn't really tell what was going on. Just a note. 3. The acting was alright. Plenty of awkward lines. Plenty of awkward delivery. The head honcho professor was terrible. That scene where he talks to Jamal in Madison Square Garden was noticeably bad. Main actors were okay. I liked Jamal. And Sean Connery. They were fine. Why was Busta Rhymes in this movie? He wasn't bad or anything but I found his part kind of negligible and his appearance distracting. Was it a strange attempt to lend this movie some kind of street cred or urban appeal? His character didn't even do much. The script could have found another way for Forrester to change his mind about helping Jamal. Or they could have had someone else let Jamal and Forrester into Yankee Stadium. I don't know. I'm just confused. 4. The jazz music was okay. It was quaint. At least they didn't blast some rap track in this movie to make it seem racial. 5. In conclusionDon't have a guy who writes sports movies write something that's purportedly deeper. The script was the biggest weak spot of this movie. I kind of think that the writer wanted to do another Radio but failed because there was a little too much going on in this movie. Which was good because it wasn't a horrible oversentimentalized touchy feely turd but it WAS a bit of a clusterfuck. Everything else was decent.".

	schema:headline " A Truly Unforgettable Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Death and what it means is the theme of the haunting and sensuous Ballad of Narayama a Cannes Film Festival Grand prize winner from 1982 by Shohei Imamaura Black Rain The Eel Dr. Akagi. Based on a novel by Shichiro Fukazawa this spellbinding film takes place in a rural mountainous area in northern Japan about one hundred years ago. Because the villager's rice crop is meager and starvation is a chronic threat according to village custom the elderly must go to die on the summit of Mount Narayama when they reach the age of 70. Group survival depends on it and death is accepted as a fact of life in the village. I must admit I had a hard time during the first hour being engaged with this film and sorting out all the characters. I found the graphic depiction of the cruel realities of village life to be ugly and often vulgar. For example one character has sex with a village dog an entire family is buried alive because they have been accused of stealing and two snakes copulate next to a couple's sexual encounter in the woods. As the film progressed however I found it easier to accept how the brutal struggle for survival ensures continuance and selfpreservation.The story concerns Orin Sumiko Sakamota who in her seventieth year must complete all the loose ends in her life before she goes to die. One widowed son must find a new wife another has to sleep with a woman for the first time and the third needs to be taught manners. When Orin realizes it is her time to be taken to Narayama her son Tatsuhei Ken Ogata carries his mother to the mountain on his back in scenes of ethereal beauty reminiscent of Sokurov's Mother and Son.

	onyx:emotionText "Death and what it means is the theme of the haunting and sensuous Ballad of Narayama a Cannes Film Festival Grand prize winner from 1982 by Shohei Imamaura Black Rain The Eel Dr. Akagi. Based on a novel by Shichiro Fukazawa this spellbinding film takes place in a rural mountainous area in northern Japan about one hundred years ago. Because the villager's rice crop is meager and starvation is a chronic threat according to village custom the elderly must go to die on the summit of Mount Narayama when they reach the age of 70. Group survival depends on it and death is accepted as a fact of life in the village. I must admit I had a hard time during the first hour being engaged with this film and sorting out all the characters. I found the graphic depiction of the cruel realities of village life to be ugly and often vulgar. For example one character has sex with a village dog an entire family is buried alive because they have been accused of stealing and two snakes copulate next to a couple's sexual encounter in the woods. As the film progressed however I found it easier to accept how the brutal struggle for survival ensures continuance and selfpreservation.The story concerns Orin Sumiko Sakamota who in her seventieth year must complete all the loose ends in her life before she goes to die. One widowed son must find a new wife another has to sleep with a woman for the first time and the third needs to be taught manners. When Orin realizes it is her time to be taken to Narayama her son Tatsuhei Ken Ogata carries his mother to the mountain on his back in scenes of ethereal beauty reminiscent of Sokurov's Mother and Son. The resistance of Tatsuhei to his mother's death is familiar yet nonetheless deeply moving. At the end of the journey Orin clings to her resolve with tenacity and reconciliation to the inevitable. Sitting on the mountain close to her God she is rewarded by the sudden grace of the silent snow.Watching Ballad of Narayama I was forced to confront my own feelings about the morality of suicide.

What they missed was the core intelligence caring self sacrifice clear thinking and love that enabled that community and by extension the human race to survive such difficult times.This sympathetic portrayal of a family in a rural village is the best of ten films I have seen from Imamura with an epic scale of Akira Kurosawa and all of the subtlety of Ozu.".

If one finds this slow then I'd imagine most foreign films besides Amelie would be offlimits. I have rarely seen a film that forces one to confront such disturbing yet important subjects. In this village where scarcity forces all over 70 to be taken to Narayama mountain to die a 69 year old woman who is still energetic and capable must settle her son's affairs before taking her final journey. Pondering how one would live in a place where for years one would know that at 70 this would happen is one key question. Further what are the final things one must do before dying. Finally the film makes us confront the literal truth of bodily decay and corruption in the scenes at Narayama Mountain.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ballad of Narayama";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not difficult to understand why Ballad of Narayama won the Palme d'Or in 1983. Beautifully filmed and probably just about having a little something for everyone I felt that this was without a doubt the best of the Shohei Imamura movies shown today to commemorate his passing last year and on what would have been a celebration of his birthday should he still be alive today.Like the timeless setting in The Profound Desire of the Gods Imamura's story a reinterpretation of the book Men of Tohoku by Fukuzawa Shichiro takes place ambiguously 100 years ago within a selfsupporting nomad group of villagers atop a mountain where tribal life ritualistic and tightly knit involves a peculiar practice when one reaches the age of 70. There's forceful retirement where the elderly has to ascend Narayama and live out the rest of the days there. The mountain top is the senior citizen's home and everyone dutifully follows this without question.And I'd like to reflect on this particular point before dwelling on the others. Watching Ballad brings to mind the thought of death and how would one decide how to go meet the maker. There's absolutely nothing worse than anticipating the coming of death or to the point of sadism to actually add a catalyst to it. The final 30 minutes is nothing short of powerful where son Tatsuhei Ken Ogata journeys with mother Orin Sumiko Sakamota up the incline. It balances the stoic unspoken bonds one of the conditions in the ascent is to maintain silence of love with the coming of the reaper with every step inching closer to the summit where the gods are set against beautiful mountainous scenery. My words fall short of describing this awesome moment and it's something you just have to see for yourself. And with that comes the point of dying with dignity. If I choose to go that's the way I would prefer too rather than screaming kicking up a fuss and cursing everyone else.The movie follows through this anticipation of the journey with preparation and showcases the life of Orin and her family which is nothing short of entertaining with the many facets thrown in. It's drama comedy and loads of sex in the veins of the 40 Year Old Virgin but these are basically there as Orin tries her best to tie up loose ends and puts in place some continuity within her family members before her time is up. Things like taking an involvement to ensure one of her sons doesn't stay a virgin this bit is just plain hilarious with the way it was developed and with lots of love teaching her daughterinlaw how to provide for the family.It's curious to note that Imamura has plenty of National Geographic like shots of various animals like snakes toads owls and crows and more often than not showing them in various stages of copulation or worse devouring one another. These shots are used as fillers as if to either remind you before or after a scene that when boiled down to basics we are still animals with our primal instincts still very much intact. And if we're left to our own community devices mob justice just like the one in Profound is often very brutal with emotions running high and this particular thread including the cunning involvement of Orin was one that I found quite hard to sit through  the motivation for a daughterinlaw one that she didn't approve of was basically to provide for her own kin but the stark punishment met out in my opinion unforgettable unforgivable and very excessive.Ballad of Naray ama deserves every accolade bestowed upon it and amongst the Imamura movies seen to date this is something that I would recommend without hesitation. Forget the synopsis which made it sound boring the real deal is within the film itself.".

Set in the 19th century in a remote mountain village in the north of the country it tells of the custom according to which when a person reached 70 years old they were taken to the top of Mount Narayama and left there to die.When I saw The Ballade of Narayama back in the 80s I did not know anything about it. There were no commercials the film was not widely released. I think it was only two shows in the theater near our house in Moscow. All we knew that the film was a Cannes Festival winner. Our sons were little then we did not have a babysitter and we bought tickets to two different shows. My husband went first and when he came back I waited for him at the door ready to leave. He looked quiet serious and withdrawn when he returned home. I asked him how the movie was and he said to me to go and see it and then we'd talk...After I came home I did not want to talk I did not know what to say I was overwhelmed  with the unique style of filmmaking that I did not know even existed with the images but also with the very simplicity of the story and with the whole concept of surviving above everything else. Among the most devastating scenes for me was the old woman readily and happily accepting her turn to be taken to Narayma. The woman of perfect health and mind the one who is perhaps the sanest in her family is so tired of this life that she on purpose knocks out one of her teeth just to seem older more fragile helpless and ill and to be taken to the long awaited rest. But before she is taken to Naryama she will take care of her three grown sons' problems.There are many unforgettable scenes in the film both bleak and lifeaffirming.

Subtle this movie isn't! This film is set in a time and place in Japan where life is very very hard and starvation is the norm. To deal with this the lovely people in these mountains have a traditionthat their elderly should go up in the mountains to die when they reach 70 so that they aren't a burden. Additionally infanticide stealing food and all other forms of nastiness abound in this hellish place. But directorwriter Shhei Imamura doesn't stop therethe film also has scenes of bestiality LOTS of sex scenes not the sexy kind either a family being buried alive a woman knocking out her own teeth a guy tossing his father down a mountain and animal abuse! Somehow Imamura seems to have forgotten necrophilia and incest! As far as the symbolism goes Imamura shows innumerable scenes of animals eating each other or copulating. It's VERY obvious he's trying to draw a parallel to say that these people are living like animals...too obvious. Plus call me crazy but I don't want to see all these scenes of animals killing each other or having sex!! Life is too short to watch stuff like this and although The Ballad of Narayama has nice production values the thoroughly unpleasant nature of the film make it hard to recommend to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an odd movie in which scenes of natural predation are pretentiously interspersed between innocuous routine events serving as thematic signposts that attempt to define and legitimize the director's morbid fascination with senseless brutality. The disheveled unkempt often filthy characters never gain our sympathy. Even those who come closest ultimately become immersed in the brutality of the story. The kindly grandmother casually tricks her youngest son's pregnant paramour into spending the night with a thieving family whom she knows are about to be executed by the murderous villagers. Her strongwilled son the only person who briefly displays any palpable sentiment participates in the execution with little concern even for the grandchild that will never be born. The victims aren't merely killed but captured in nets thrown in a hole and buried alive a brutal twist to the supposed necessity of the horrible collective deed. Later the healthy grandmother bashes her front teeth out so she'll look the part when it's her time to go to the mountain. All through the movie this final journey is alluded to as if going off to die on a mountainside up in the clouds a place of ethereal beauty is somehow a sacrifice fraught with spiritual significance. Unfortunately the place where the old people are carried is nothing more than a grotesque stinking bone yard full of broken skeletons and decomposing bodies serviced by a flock of fat greedy crows that pick at the dead and impatiently await their next meal. After hauling his mom up the mountain on a packboard the strong son simply leaves her there because she insists once again that is how it must be. Before leaving he sees his selfish neighbor dropping off his troublesome disabled father kicking the terrified old man over a cliff while yelling Dad go to the mountain! The poor senile old man trussed up in a net goes tumbling down the rocks like a cartwheel bashing his brains out on the way down. This depressing story is supposed to uplift us? This is beautiful? It's a real comment on the emptiness of our times that so many here would even begin to believe that. I'm skeptical of the notion that this film was based on fact. It comes off like an exercise in racist propaganda. I may be wrong but I think it doubtful that even primitive and isolated Japanese peasants were that uncaring and brutal.".

Her strongwilled son the only person who briefly displays any palpable sentiment participates in the execution with little concern even for the grandchild that will never be born. The victims aren't merely killed but captured in nets thrown in a hole and buried alive a brutal twist to the supposed necessity of the horrible collective deed. Later the healthy grandmother bashes her front teeth out so she'll look the part when it's her time to go to the mountain. All through the movie this final journey is alluded to as if going off to die on a mountainside up in the clouds a place of ethereal beauty is somehow a sacrifice fraught with spiritual significance. Unfortunately the place where the old people are carried is nothing more than a grotesque stinking bone yard full of broken skeletons and decomposing bodies serviced by a flock of fat greedy crows that pick at the dead and impatiently await their next meal. After hauling his mom up the mountain on a packboard the strong son simply leaves her there because she insists once again that is how it must be. Before leaving he sees his selfish neighbor dropping off his troublesome disabled father kicking the terrified old man over a cliff while yelling Dad go to the mountain! The poor senile old man trussed up in a net goes tumbling down the rocks like a cartwheel bashing his brains out on the way down. This depressing story is supposed to uplift us? This is beautiful? It's a real comment on the emptiness of our times that so many here would even begin to believe that. I'm skeptical of the notion that this film was based on fact. It comes off like an exercise in racist propaganda. I may be wrong but I think it doubtful that even primitive and isolated Japanese peasants were that uncaring and brutal.";

The Director introduces and nourishes a pretty full range of very fundamental human emotions and life conditions in this cinematic Petri Dish including superstitious behavior and sexual worship.

Cinematography wide screen color and set design are good given that exteriors seem to have been shot entirely on location often in what seems to be five feetor moreof snow. The overlylong opening sequence shot from a helicopter though is a bit shaky. Jumpcut editing can be sloppy with snow banks incredulously appearing in or disappearing from contiguous scenes. Subtitles consist of two information streams at the top of the screen appear thoughtful notes on culture and language while the bottom presents reasonably edited translations of dialog either or both streams can be turned off.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this Japanese film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I read the description of the story and found the title intriguing and I hoped it would deserve four stars out of five critics give it. Basically in a small rural village in 19th century Japan according to tradition once a man or woman reaches the age of 70 they must go through a practise known as ubasute where they will travel to a remote mountain to die of starvation. The story follows 69year old Orin Sumiko Sakamoto and in sound health of course but she knows that a neighbour father had to be dragged up the mountain by his son. Orin resolves to avoid clinging onto life beyond her term and spending a year arranging all her family affairs and the village for when she passes away. These include Orin severely punishing a family who are hoarding food and helping her younger son lose his virginity but in the end she ultimately faces up to tradition and is taken up the mountain. Also starring Ken Ogata as Tatsuhei Tonpei Hidari as Risuke Smelly Aki Takej as Tamayan Shichi Ozawa as Katsuz  Shozo Sansh Shinsui as Zeniya no Tadayan Seiji Kurasaki as Kesakichi and Junko Takada as Matsuyan. The story is interesting with harsh moments with the subjects of rape famine mortality birth and death throughout it all there also cutaways to the natural world with animals ultimately it is about trying to evade the final journey I may have lost track slightly but overall it is a splendid drama. Good!".

It'll be interesting to compare.Imamura's film is as one might expect quite explicit not least because of his naturalistic documentarian eye. This is way too explicit for my taste but on the other hand it successfully captures that certain apprehensiveness that perhaps should be evoked in the face of the kind of deleterious brutality that society is capable of the connivance and all.But first and foremost it all crescendoes to the climatic mountain scenes the most lucid filmmaking in Imamura's oeuvre and absolutely among the most shockingly meaningful moving and unforgettable images ever put to film. There is the pit echoing an earlier Imamura film but it's the mountain that from very early on becomes the leading motif the mundane vs. the sacredtraditional the beastly vs. the elevated spirit life vs. life in death and so on. But Imamura's sly sense of humanity reminds us where we're coming from after we have started descending from the mountain. The counterpoint of what happens Tatsuhei is the dumbstruck witness of this just after we have departed from Orin is genius in its intensity and yes brutality. The contrasting elements of peace and violence dignity and ignobility solemnity and bitter farce are so expertly threaded through that the effect of that one short moment left a deep mark in me. I can't say that for many moments in film no matter how wonderful images I've witnessed. I can see myself visiting that sumptuous ending for years to come.Released on Bluray in Region B by the Masters of Cinema series.".

By tradition when people reach the age of 70 they are carried up the mountain by their oldest son and left their to die. Sumiko Sakamoto starts the film as a 69 yearold woman and the film takes place over the final year of her life. The film ends with the aforementioned trek. The rest of it just shows how these people exist. There is a horrible threat of starvation for everyone there and their entire lives revolve around it. Only the oldest child Ken Ogata in Sakamoto's case is allowed to marry and reproduce. The second child Tonpei Hidari in the main family only exists to help with farm work. Any other male children are generally left to die from exposure as infants. Girl children can be sold to salt merchants if a family so decides. I really like stories about societies that are forced to live in harsh conditions. This film is reminiscent of things like Man of Aran and Kaneto Shindo's The Island. It's quite a bit harsher than those actually. Yet Imamura finds a deep humanity in these people and he weaves a beautiful mosaic of how they exist within the natural world. The world of the film is so vivid that it really draws you in. Kinoshita previously made a film of the same novel in 1958 which I would love to see but Imamura's version is pretty much a perfect movie.".

The film however is extremely funny especially the first 20 minutes because almost half of the footage was taken from Terminator 2 this involves the siege of cyberdyne systems. The same footage was used for the destruction of the building also the part where the T100 fires on the police below who arrive in exactly the same way as in T2. This was hilarious seeming that they were using mp5's in this movie and Arnold was using a minigun in T2 which fires 100s of rounds at a time where an mp5 has a clip of 30 some how the mp5 manages to do the same amount of damage as in t2 yet as in T2 all the policeman were avoided but then later in the film the killing of policeman seems to be a regular occurrence hmmm also the helicopter scene where Sarah Conner was shooting at the t1000 was repeated including someone in the helicopter firing at the van with an UZI. If you had't seen T2 before I suppose you could be mistaken for this film having decent special effects. Anyway if you have nothing to do apart from get intoxicated and laugh at really terrible films I recommend this one highly 110 laugh factor a good 810".

You read that right  the opening sequence of CRITICAL MASS contains lengthy scenes from James Camerons 1991 blockbuster and instantly reminded me of the straight to video film RANGERS that contains umpteen action scenes from other films . Can anyone tell me how legal this is because when RETURN OF THE KING is released Im going to stick the three LORD OF THE RINGS films together and sell it to distributors claiming its my own original work.On its own  ie the bits that werent stolen from TERMINATOR or UNIVERSAL SOLDIER  this movie isnt up to much  its just another of those  Bunch of terrorists hold everyone to ransom  type movies though when a bunch of journalists get blown away the hero saves the one with long hair and firm breasts so youve got to admire his sense of priorities".

You read that right  the opening sequence of CRITICAL MASS contains lengthy scenes from James Camerons 1991 blockbuster and instantly reminded me of the straight to video film RANGERS that contains umpteen action scenes from other films . Can anyone tell me how legal this is because when RETURN OF THE KING is released Im going to stick the three LORD OF THE RINGS films together and sell it to distributors claiming its my own original work.On its own  ie the bits that werent stolen from TERMINATOR or UNIVERSAL SOLDIER  this movie isnt up to much  its just another of those  Bunch of terrorists hold everyone to ransom  type movies though when a bunch of journalists get blown away the hero saves the one with long hair and firm breasts so youve got to admire his sense of priorities";

There's only one problem with the Senator's jaunt  the arrival of a gang of international terrorists led by Samson Kier and his second in command Rand Fralick. They threaten to blow up the plant if their demands aren't met. Naturally that means Jeffers and Janine have to try against all odds to save the day. With no help from Washington our heroes are alone in the face of overwhelming odds. Will they triumph or will all of the sheer stupidity on show reach CRITICAL MASS?Another day another DieHardInA movie. These Die Hard 1988 knockoffs are so common in the DTV world even ones set at nuclear power plants are a cottage industry unto themselves. For a more complete list of them please see our Sudden Death 1995 review. This particular runthrough of the classic Die Hard scenario is probably most similar to Deadly Outbreak 1995 and the Jerry Trimble outing Stranglehold 1994. It even borrows ? the plot device of having a politician visit the facility before it's taken hold of by the baddies. While we're not entirely sure if director Fred Olen Ray saw Stranglehold he's certainly not afraid of borrowing ideas. Or footage. It seemed to be common practice starting in the early 2000's as DTV movies started to go downhill for filmmakers to borrow footage from other movies particularly the bigger setpieces the lower budget versions couldn't afford. It happened in Rangers 2000 it happened in Gale Force 2002 it happened in Extreme Limits 2000 and now it's happening here. Anyone who has seen Terminator 2 1991 or Universal Soldier 1992 will know when those scenes are intermixed with the more recentlyshot stuff. Samson and his fellow baddies even steal their nuclear material from Cyberdyne Systems. Did they have to get permission to use that name? Isn't that copyrighted material? Nevertheless old footage of people shooting guns and blowing up stuff is interpolated with new footage of people shooting guns and blowing up stuff. Think of Fred Olen Ray as a bartender and here he's making a cinematic Shandy. We love Udo Kier or Udo Dirkschneider or anyone named Udo and he does his best but of course he plays the typical Eurotrash baddie with an accent that means he's evil. Just as Christopher Plummer did in Crackerjack 1994 or as pretty much any baddie has in any Die Hard knockoff. So that clich remains unchanged. As has the he's just the security guard! clich modified from Under Siege 1992 and its he's just the chef! line of thinking. Besides Critical Mass's stubborn and outandout refusal to come up with any remotely original ideas the main problem really is that it is repetitive and very very dumb. Halfway through the movie you feel like you've been watching it for four hours because you've seen this type of movie so many times before in your life. It just starts to pile on at about that point. Even the great and mighty Treat Williams can't salvage things. No one's bigger treat fans than us. He's charming likable and a very capable hero. He's even from the great state of Connecticut. But despite all that Critical Mass's monolithic wall of stupidity is just too allencompassing for even Treat to surmount. We were happy to see Lori Loughlin on board and this is certainly a departure from Full House and the other character actors are quite good but come on...ANOTHER DieHardInA? We would say to the filmmakers churning out this crud Give us as viewers a little more credit. Don't you think we're tired of the sameold sameold? Don't you think we can handle something a little more challenging something with a tad bit of originality? Are we really supposed to be going back to the same old slop again and again? On the bright side though the key to Samson's world domination and nuclear supremacy looks like the inanimate carbon rod from that episode of The Simpsons. Sadly despite the actors that are on board who put forth their best Critical Mass is a dud. It's a prime example that DTV was out of its glory days of the 80's and 90's and had entered its period of doldrums.".

For example when the 2 main characters Jeffers Treat Williams and Janine Lori Loughlin are sneaking around the power plant they're talking very loud they're not trying to hide nor are they even acting like they're nervousafraid. The acting is so fake this is also a major directing problem.Overall if you want to see the worst action movie ever made or you have 1.5 hours to kill watch this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In case you don't know 'Critters 3' is best known for being the first ever film to feature Leonardo DiCaprio. Here he plays a kid who is a kid. Then forever after he was destined to play an adult who looks like a kid. But then that's just me being bitter at his seeming inability to age.Anyway if you haven't seen 'Critters 3' then you might want to start with the first two as they're arguably better and well chronology and all that. The Critters are little alien monsters who crashlanded on Earth and generally eat everyone and everything  or rather everyone and everything who isn't one of the lead cast. These baddies tend to only eat people you won't really care about. Or at least they certainly do now! I haven't seen another monsterslasher film where the villains do so little damage to so few people. If the Critters franchise was ever really classed as 'horror' which it wasn't really  it was more only every horror with a spoonful of comedy. Now it really is played out tongueincheek with no real attempts to scare you. The Critters roll and bounce around the place bumping into things and come across more like Mr Bean with bigger teeth than anything that really threatens humankind.Critters 3 is a short film. And for good reason. There really isn't that much in the way of plot to fill it. You get the little monsters brought back from the countryside into a big city. You'd think that with the added number of humanprey this would make a change from the farmcountry the previous two were set in. However the whole film is basically set in one apartment block. And for some reason no one Critter or human ever really seems to make much of a play to leave the building. You could argue that this creates an air of tension and claustrophobia. But it doesn't. It's just a cheap continuation of the franchise.Yes I know I'm being kind of negative. And this is yet another step down for the franchise. But that's not to say that I didn't find some enjoyment in it. The Critters themselves  one again  are the real stars and for all their 'pratfalls' they're still quite fun to watch.If you like your eighties monsterhorror films then you're probably best off sticking to the first one which most people seem to think is best personally I preferred part 2 but anyway.... However if you REALLY like the Critters and want to see more of them you can try this  it's the sort of film where you can surf the net and watch it at the same time and still miss much. Plus did I mention it had babyfaced Leo in it? He's being chased my furballs  c'mon that's got to be worth watching right?".

I haven't seen another monsterslasher film where the villains do so little damage to so few people. If the Critters franchise was ever really classed as 'horror' which it wasn't really  it was more only every horror with a spoonful of comedy. Now it really is played out tongueincheek with no real attempts to scare you. The Critters roll and bounce around the place bumping into things and come across more like Mr Bean with bigger teeth than anything that really threatens humankind.Critters 3 is a short film. And for good reason. There really isn't that much in the way of plot to fill it. You get the little monsters brought back from the countryside into a big city. You'd think that with the added number of humanprey this would make a change from the farmcountry the previous two were set in. However the whole film is basically set in one apartment block. And for some reason no one Critter or human ever really seems to make much of a play to leave the building. You could argue that this creates an air of tension and claustrophobia. But it doesn't. It's just a cheap continuation of the franchise.Yes I know I'm being kind of negative. And this is yet another step down for the franchise. But that's not to say that I didn't find some enjoyment in it. The Critters themselves  one again  are the real stars and for all their 'pratfalls' they're still quite fun to watch.If you like your eighties monsterhorror films then you're probably best off sticking to the first one which most people seem to think is best personally I preferred part 2 but anyway.... However if you REALLY like the Critters and want to see more of them you can try this  it's the sort of film where you can surf the net and watch it at the same time and still miss much. Plus did I mention it had babyfaced Leo in it? He's being chased my furballs  c'mon that's got to be worth watching right?";

There's not much really wrong here with this one and most of that really stems from the fact that there's just a way too long beginning that holds off the creature's appearance until much later than expected here. The trip through the countryside and meeting up with the different residents of the complex aren't all that impressive or exciting efforts throughout here watching this and it really does get this off to a somewhat sluggish beginning. Coupled with the again heavy cheesiness on display these here are the film's few problems that do crop up here that makes for a few small problems but not nearly enough here to hold off the far more impressive and enjoyable amount of fun featured along the way here. Again the film's inherent cheesiness and absolutely goofy creatures at the forefront of the film are a major part of the film's enjoyment as this one manages to get a lot of mileage out of them. The very nature of featuring them in the same exact setup as before with their hairyreptilian appearance and miniature stature that practically devours everything in their path allows for some silly comedy to come from them breaking into the apartment and watching a cooking show on the television set or eating through the entire apartment simply because they're left alone inside being able to contemplate strategy sessions and a plan of attack which manage to get some nice laughs with their cheesy natures all work together into making for some cheesy good times. The fact that there's some thrilling suspense moments as well gives this some even bigger pluses which manages to give this the same sort of feeling that occurred in the original where it gives this it's biggest plus from the encounter in the laundryroom basement the family's first encounter on the hallway leading to their battle to barricade the apartment from the creatures and the different encounters up in the attic where they finally manage to get away from the creatures gives this plenty of thrilling action scenes all built on the idea of the fun goofy creatures still being perceived as a threat with their voracious appetite leading to the fun here. Along with the great manner of bringing them to life here these here manage to make this one a fun and enjoyable addition to the franchise.Rated PG13 Violence and Language.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first two Critters films delivered a winning blend of thrills and humor that was done with a considerable amount of vitality and a certain quirky sensibility. Alas this second sequel to the enjoyable original doesn't offer much in the way of energy or inspiration. The premise is promising enough The Crites terrorize a motley assortment of folks in a rundown Los Angeles apartment building. Unfortunately director Kristine Peterson working from a surprisingly drab and unimaginative script by celebrated horror writer David J. Schow lets the story unfold at a plodding pace and crucially fails to generate much in the way of either tension or momentum. Moreover although there are a few decent comic moments the sequence with the blithely disgusting Crites pigging out in a kitchen is reasonably funny and several cool fanged furball attack set pieces this film is never as dynamic and flatout sidesplitting as it could and should have been. This movie does finally get cooking to a moderate degree in the fairly lively and stirring last third but it's not enough to alleviate the general tedium. The able cast do their best with the mediocre material Aimee Brooks contributes a charming performance as the cute and spunky Annie series regular Don Opper amuses as geeky and klutzy bounty hunter Charlie Katherine Cortez does well as plucky telephone repair woman Marcis a then unknown Leonardo DiCarprio acquits himself passably in his film debut as the likable Josh plus there are sound turns by Diana Bellamy as the excitable Rosalie John Calvin as struggling single dad Clifford William Dennis Hunt as sleazy landlord Mr. Briggs Geoffrey Blake as obnoxious handyman Frank Longo and Frances Bay as sweet old lady Mrs. Menges. Terrence Mann makes a very brief appearance at the sequel setup ending as bounty hunter Ug. A strictly acceptable but overall nothing special timewaster.".

Critters 3 is mostly remembered because Leonardo DiCaprio's involvement long before Titanic or anything else and he actually did a pretty good job to say the least. Also really good seeing the character of Charlie returning for another adventure into helping the kids escape the apartment so he is much like Burt Gummer from the Tremors movies and overall?

These days the Critters sequels particularly this one have been regarded as a bad joke by the actors in it especially Leonardo DiCaprio who made his debut here as an adolescent.Despite the negative publicity Critters 3 is actually not too bad  in fact it is the closest the sequels get to matching the light family friendly fun of the original. The Critters are kept to the shadows for the majority of the film but once the lights go off the real fun begins. Scribe David J.

It is a far cry from the usual output of Schow's bread  butter splatterpunk stories but it is still a fun ride. He  director Kristine Peterson do their best to cater to genre fans without letting the adults feel cheated by having the Critters do their usual thing  having Don Opper's bounty hunter return to blast the Critters yet again. Fellow hunter Terrence Mann also returns but only in the endcredits sequence that follows the film. If there is anything wrong with the film it would be that the film is far too soft for the bodycount to happen but the dogleg twists provide some suspense for the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crites are back for the third time and this time they're terrorizing an apartment building in Topeka Kansas although it really does look like Los Angeles instead of Grovers Bend. This might disappoint some fans but it's not a horrible change. Really what else could've been done in Grovers Bend? I feel the change of setting was a bit refreshing.We're introduced to the main characters Clifford the widowed father Annie the daughter and main protagonist and Johnny the son who adds nothing to the film overall. They're returning from a trip to the Grand Canyon when a flat tire forces them to pull over at a rest stop. There we meet the young Josh his evil stepfather and the likable Charlie who fans will recognize right away as he's the only returning cast member from the first two movies unfortunately. Charlie gives the lowdown on why he's screwing around in the woods to the heroes treating us to a nice trailerlike flashback of the first two movies. As the heroes are called back to their vehicles Charlie gives Johnny a crystal he apparently was given to by some friends obviously referencing Ug  Lee the two bounty hunters he used to travel with that glows green whenever trouble is near which is never truly explained. It sort of sucks because the crystal is a semiinteresting element that comes out of nowhere and then is just left alone. Anyway as we leave the rest stop it's shown that there are a few Crite eggs stuck underneath our heroes' RV.Clifford and his kids make it home to their rundown apartment building introducing us to some characters with wasted potential that spout one liners like they were back in 4th grade  Frank the obnoxious maintenance man Marsha the friend of the heroes Rosalie the overweight woman that doesn't serve much of a purpose like Johnny and the Menges an elderly couple that takes care of Annie and Johnny while Clifford is away. The Crites hatch and break into the basement of the building. The film then gives us this uninteresting subplot with Frank being in cahoots with Josh's stepfather to get the tenants out of the building so it can be turned into a minimall. Soon after Frank is killed by the Crites who've inexplicably grown to adult size in what seems like a couple hours by eating nothing apparently. Oh yeah and in between all the attacks there's another subplot about Annie trying to get Clifford to stop being depressed and spend time with her and Johnny before going out of town on business again but it's just meh so whatever.Rosalie ventures down into the basement next and is promptly attacked by the Crites after they steal her donut. Sadly she isn't killed Annie comes to her rescue. That's one of the things I disliked about this movie  it held back on the killing and was basically a good vs. evil kind of thing because only Frank and Josh's stepfather are killed them two being the only evil characters in the movie. Rosalie and Annie go to Clifford for help and soon are attacked by the Crites. They make it upstairs and encounter Marsha who presumably goes down to investigate Annie's claims of aliens. Anywho Josh and his stepfather Mr. Briggs I forgot his name until just now haha arrive and Briggs is soon killed. Josh is found by Marsha and the two hightail it upstairs as the Crite pursue them.The humans lock themselves in the Menges' room and try to get help. Unfortunately for them and how clich for us the phone lines and electricity were cut by Briggs before he got the axe so they're trapped basically. Mr. Menges comes up with a plan to use the elevator shaft to get around them things so everybody starts climbing into the attic. The Crites soon arrive through the ventilation system under the sink at least that's what it appears to be and an overblown boring kitchen scene commences with them eating just about everything available to them and then farting it out. Blah no thanks. I know a lot find it to be a high point of the film but I've personally seen it far too many times and I'm just about sick of it now sorry.Back to the film itself the humans are now trapped in the attic. Marsha feels the logical way of getting around the Crites  the elevator shaft  isn't very great so she volunteers herself to climb out the side of the building and walk along the phone lines to get to the pay phone and call for help. Yeah I understand her intent but the execution is just stupid. Unsurprisingly she screws up and falls only being saved as her foot is stuck in one of the broken lines and seriously she could have just unhooked her foot and gotten down as it was maybe only a 10ft drop at most. This compels Annie to use the elevator shaft where it leads us to Charlie making his arrival to save her from the Crites. The two go back up to the attic unknowingly followed by the Crites. The Crites attack and are quickly dispatched by Charlie and the Menges. Really they weren't much to speak of when it came down to it. So everybody gets up to the roof but one Crite remains and attacks Johnny so Charlie seemingly sacrifices himself to save him even though he lives in the end anyway. Oh yeah I forgot there was a fire growing in the basement started by a dead Crite. Doesn't matter though since the humans are saved and everybody lives happily ever after.The midcredits scene leads into the boring but much darker fourth film too by the way. Overall it's a fun and campy movie but nothing to be taken seriously. A lot more could've been done with it.".

This film isn't nearly as good as the first two but still has some pretty good critters action and is worth checking out if you're a fan of the franchise.".

This time around there is no Scott Grimes and very little Don Opper the Reggie of the series. Ug Terrence Mann is also reduced to one scene at the very end. What we get in place of our beloved trio of heroes is a very annoying cast and a young Leonardo DiCaprio. The rural setting is also changed. This sequel takes place in the city. And while that seems like a cool change they do not utilize it enough for budgetary reasons I'm sure. Just like Jason didn't quite take Manhattan the Critters are confined to one run down inner city building. This was shot backtoback with Critters 4 which is evident by the cliffhanger to be continued ending. The ending oddly enough is the best and most inventive part of the film. As Charlie is about to blow away the last two Critter eggs he receives word that he must stop because that would be the destruction of their species. Pretty sweet setup for a sequel in my opinion. However this entry could have been avoided.".

	schema:reviewBody "In its very first minute Mutants reminds us that in order to survive the inevitable zombie apocalypse it is best not to get too attached to anyone or anything.And of course the problem is that it is very easy to say that but much harder to put theory into practice. The difficulty with zombies besides the fact that they are the tireless ravenous living dead is that they are monsters with the faces of our loved ones. Random zombies are a problem but one that can be solved with ruthless application of violence. From Romero's Night of the Living Dead to Robert Kirkland's Walking Dead the most difficult zombies haven't been the faceless hordes but the zombies that we knew when they were human our sons daughters parents and lovers.The zombies being offered in Mutants are viral mutants similar to the ones in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later but where Boyle's film gave us a transformation that was almost simultaneous with infection Mutants offers a much crueler plight. It imagines a delay between infection to full viral mutation of about four days. The cruelty of a long and painful transformation in this case strongly reminiscent of Cronenberg's The Fly is that it offers the illusion that a cure is possible. In this case the main character Sonia is a medical professional. It is unclear if she is a doctor or a nurse. Sonia's identity is vested in her belief that any disease can be cured that her infected lover Marco can be saved and she has secrets that help convince her that a cure is possible even likely.This is heresy for zombie affliction afficionados where the only true cure for infection is immediate amputation but by flirting with heresy Mutants asks some compelling questions. In the process it offers an eloquent elegy to the moral quandary of euthanasia.At what point is medical treatment crueler than death? At what point has your loved one become so consumed by disease that all that they were and all that they could be have been replaced by the disease? Where does humanity end and death begin? Bad enough to be faced with those impossible questions but Morlet ups the ante on Sonia by reminding us that the inevitable zombie apocalypse is not just about the zombies it is also about the apocalypse  the end of everything. The end of easy transportation the end of gas the end of warmth the end of light the end of communication the end of parts the end of bullets the end of civility the end of love and the end of trust.The film is not perfect. It uses a but too much of the shockcam technique currently in vogue. There are also a couple of steps in the mutation that make little sense. Mutant zombies losing their hair makes sense but losing their teeth? Really? The reason that the zombie apocalypse is inevitable has everything to do with our voracious and insatiable appetite that will eventually overcome and overwhelm our ability to feed it. The zombie apocalypse is the contrast between the death of our ability to feed the hunger and the dark monstrous face of that hunger lying just behind the mask of civility.David Morel reminds us in Mutants not just of that inevitability but also that when the end comes it will be both painful and beautiful and that the barrier between life and death love and hate civilization and chaos is not a barrier that is crossed in an instant. It is one that is crossed so slowly and the hair the blood the fluids and all the mess of life and living shed in the crossing are so distracting that by the time you know that you have passed the tipping point it is too late to turn back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seriously stop calling this a zombie movie. The hint is in the title! As somebody who follows video games I am lately quite a fan of the DayZ standalone game that is being developed for PC and PS4. 'Mutants' is that one film that such gamers should watch even though it's not a zombie movie.The problem I find these days with lowbudget apocalyptic horror is that not only does it often fail to learn from classic horrors that paved the way for modern cinema  while earning kudos for its own originality  it has too much on its plate for its budget to contend with. It's just not convincing enough in aesthetic story or acting ability.Introducing 'Mutants' I can only point out that not only is it an original story all of its own it has a location all of its own lending a superb setting and it successfully refreshes all the thrills and chills of such classics as The Shining Aliens Evil Dead 28 Days Later and more without being a zombie movie.A terrifying pandemic that turns its victims into raging flesheating mutants leaves two paramedics Marcus and Sonia and a SWAT officer on the run. When a showdown leaves only our paramedics alive one of them injured and infected it is up to Sonia to try to save Marcus while protecting herself and her unborn baby.The pretense being that there is an isolated military base that they must reach they are forced to hide in an abandoned building where Marcus slowly mutates and Sonia loses hope. But then there are possibly worse things out there than the mutants roaming the apocalyptic winter landscape.'Mutants' takes its cue from many classics but 'The Shining' is most definitely the one that really stands out to me. It doesn't try to be that way it simply utilises those codes and conventions and succeeds in its mission as a result.'Mutants' is claustrophobic tense bloody and filled with many edge of your seat moments. The same crew could also have made an awesome 'Left 4 Dead' movie. The special effects are quite grim.My only issue regarding this movie is that the French didn't always translate too well to English. There were also a few letterbox mistakes which were pretty amateur something that doesn't reflect on the movie at all as a whole!".

Finding a place to take refuge Marco gets infected with some contaminated blood and is desperate to find a cue. As the infection takes days to mutate Sonia is in a desperate race against time to help the love of her life and ultimately face up to the possibility that she may lose him.We have all had our fair share of standard ZombieInfected films. Everybody seems to want to be the next George A. Romero and unfortunately its a case of seen one seen them all. Then comes along David Morlet's Mutants. A film about an apocalyptic outbreak with plenty of flesh eating mutants but this film serves so much more of a purpose than others that have come before it. To me the story of the apocalypse was a side story as the real focus was on the controversial use of Euthanasia ... such a debate has been raging over this topic and the subtle way that David Morlet uses this topic was superb. Is it OK to end the life of someone who has no more quality in theirs? Is it OK to put someone to sleep forever? The question is constantly asked throughout the duration of the film and shows the impact and heartbreak that even the thought can produce. The fact that this infection takes days to mutate and not instant gives the viewer a false sense of a positive outcome. It shows that sometimes hope can be cruel and we go along with the two characters as things just go from bad to worse. Combining this strong psychological element with superb isolated cinematography a strong soundtrack above average acting with gore and blood to add this movie stands out as a very unique addition to a very tired sub genre. Highly impressive!".

But even if the movie did as I said hint at some more interesting ideas it didn't go as far as actually explore them.Bottom line In my mind this films keeps oscillating under and above the average line like a leaky boat that you don't know if it will sink or not.

This French effort tries to achieve this through blending the zombie mayhem with a tale of true love. Like Zombie Honeymoon already tried back in 2004 Mutants revolves on a woman who loyally stands by the side of her man even though he's going through several phases of zombification. In a completely desolate and daunt snowy landscape ambulance drivers Marco and Sonia are ambushed by mutants victims of a worldwide virus and Marco gets infected. Sonia who is strangely immune for the virus takes him to an abandoned army facility and tries to delay the impact of the virus as long as possible. Mutants is slightly better than the aforementioned Zombie Honeymoon simply because the atmosphere is much grittier and the situation more hopeless. As a viewer you also grow to care for Sonia a lot more than you would for the averagely stereotypical protagonist in any other random zombie movie and it definitely helps that the gorgeous Hlne de Fougerolles gives away a wonderful performance. Mutants is also a very gruesome and gory flick although without being exploitative. The gratuitous zombie killskillings are kept to a modest amount but the makeup effects are excessively nauseating. That's a positive comment mind you! In all honesty this is a very decent and admirable horror movie yet for some reason I can't be overly enthusiastic about it. The wholesome felt very derivative and mundane definitely not a film I'd bother to see again or even recommend to someone else.".

Mutants is one of such movies. The breathtaking French countryside that serves as a background to a deadly virus that spreads through France that turns its unfortunate victims into unstoppable flesheating mutants but unlike other Zombie movies it differs in that it offers its victims the cruelty of hope  a long slow and painful transformation that can only be truly compared to that of I Zombie The Chronicles of Pain and The Fly to fullblown mutant by means of loss of biological functions and decay  in the most terrible of ways.The story centres around a deadly and terrifying infection that has transformed the majority of people into raging mutants. Marco played by Francis Renaud and Sonia played by Hlne de Fougerolles  who both give wonderful performances are a young couple Sonia is a medical professional and Marco is a paramedic who are both escaping the monsters and trying to fight their way to a military base. Marco himself becomes infected in an attack leaving the pregnant Sonia who must defend herself against one of these mutants  who is also the man she loves. She feels that Marco can be saved and she truly believes that she can cure him of the infection. She is fighting against time...Mutants is claustrophobic atmospheric and has tons of gore and blood often disturbing and sickening with scary looking mutants  but what do you expect from a Zombie flick? There is more to this movie than just blood and gore. The cinematography is stunning. For all its action packed sequences reminiscent of The Walking Dead this is effectively a love story wrapped in a morality tale inside an Zombie movie. It does however share similarities with other movies in this sub genre namely Day of the Dead and 28 Days Later. That being said it is fairly unique to the other movies in that it is psychological in nature ultimately it is a unique inclusion to an exhausted sub genre. It certainly makes my Top Ten Zombie movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "So I think that line above means Run of the mill in french. As this film is exactly that. It's a nice heaping pile of been there done that unfortunately doesn't really excel in any one area that a truly satisfying horror film should.Mutants starts promisingly enough with a nice bloody car crash and then a nice bloody firefight with some nice bloody results. Then the survivors go to this hospital where there is more scenes of bloody stuff. And then there's some more shmucks getting in on the action...blood. But to be a bit more precise there's a cannibalistic infection on the loose and it's transferable by you guessed it blood. A bite does the trick. Anyways we have a heroine as our lead and a bunch of carefree characters causing trouble and of course we have our incredibly Orklike mutants running growling and drooling blood all over the damn place. That's basically it.I like zombieinfectedrabid mutant type flicks I really do. But I also like them to be...what's the word? Fun? Yeah that fits...but that's not the word. Scary? That's good too but that ain't it. Hmmm...entertaining? Yeah that's good. Entertaining. This movie wasn't very entertaining. With a strange combination of using quick cuts and fast pacing during the action and slow plodding shots during any other scene it's comes off a bit...off. The action scenes like I said were bloody and that's basically all this movie has going for it. As the emotional factor was barely there and what was there was clich.On the plus side it's got some nice production values. The blood looks great the Orklike mutants are solid the camera is crisp the scenery is beautiful blah blah blah! Combine all those nice things with a bloody mutant flick with a decent amount of bullets flying around and you got yourself a seemingly cool sounding movie. But with so many of these films out there there's gotta be some sort of hierarchy. Unfortunately for us it doesn't rank that high on the list.If you're expecting anything but a nice lil infected film you're setting yourself up for disappointment. This does not become another solid French outing but instead jumps into the pile of pigs whose snorts sound like they're saying 'you almost had something there buddy'.....yep.".

Pretty basic storyline but this is a monster movie you know.  The Critters or Krites to be precise are while obviously puppets very cool and well done.  The human actors on the other hand...well they are terrible.  The dad his shoulder and leg practically gnawed of by critters remains alert and vigilant even though he's covered in blood.  The boy is average at best.  The bounty hunters are alright.  The best actor is Charlie the drunk.  He pulls off a very good performance.Ok so this movie won't make any headlines or be famous.

The human actors on the other hand...well they are terrible.  The dad his shoulder and leg practically gnawed of by critters remains alert and vigilant even though he's covered in blood.  The boy is average at best.  The bounty hunters are alright.  The best actor is Charlie the drunk.  He pulls off a very good performance.Ok so this movie won't make any headlines or be famous.  But if you are looking for a late night horror movie with a dash or two of humor Critters is a good choice!";

Don't explain a religious experience just luxuriate in the silliness. And to think that it was directed by Stephen Herek who also directed Mr. Holland's Opus as far as I know those were the only two good movies that he ever did.

They'll make you think twice about walking into a basement.It has been told and said that CRITTERS is a copy of the CLASSIC movie Gremlins. Personally I think thats just an excuse because this movie rocks and put some pressure on the Gremlin people.You cant look at this movie as a modern aged and modern special effects man.

	schema:reviewBody "Critters 1986  out of 4 Fun scifi spoof about a Kansas family who finds themselves under attack from small fur balls that can shoot out poisonous darts and have an appetite for flesh. CRITTERS was New Line's reply to GREMLINS and for my money it's the better movie. There's no question that this film was made for a rather small budget but I think it's a perfect example of how the genre can be done right without having to spend a lot of cash on special effects. The film offers up some fun homages to other films some great characters to root for and we're also given some terrific villains who you just love to hate. I think the creatures themselves are certainly the highlight of the picture. Their design really was a work of genius in the way that they can roll to wherever they're going and the darts are just an added goodie. I really loved the way that they looked and there's no question that those teeth are priceless. While the things aren't ever scary I really don't think they need to be because this picture really isn't about being scared but it's about just having fun. It also doesn't hurt that we're given a great family to cheer for along the way. Dee Wallace Stone play the mom Billy Green Bush the dad Scott Grimes the son Nadine Van Der Velde the daughter and M. Emmet Walsh plays the local Sheriff. We also have Billy Zane in a small role as a boyfriend. The performances are also extremely good here including the always reliable Dee Wallace Stone. Grimes makes for a good guy to cheer for as well. The film really doesn't contain any major violence which wasn't the norm for the horror and scifi genre from this period but the creativity here really makes up for that. Director Stephen Herek really does a nice job mixing everything up and he keeps the film moving at a terrific pace. The film has plenty of laughs but best of all is that you can just sit back and have a good time with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film for the first time as a kid on a coach on the way home from a holiday in France. I guess whoever was in charge figured all the kids would be asleep by the time they put this on but I managed to stay awake and watch the lot and Critters became a firm favourite of mine for the next few years. Despite seeing this film and the first two sequels several times as a kid I could pretty much remember nothing about it when it came to watching it this time and despite the fact that Critters is not quite the film I remember it being this is still a fun little eighties crapfest with plenty to recommend it for! The plot focuses on a war in outer space that spills over onto a farm in a small midwestern town. The town unwittingly greet a meteorite that later gives way to a host of nasty furry little creatures with big teeth! Hot on their tails are a pair of intergalactic bounty hunters sent to track down the furballs  but the 'critters' get their first and manage to cause quite a lot of damage before the bounty hunters eventually arrive...Critters is clearly reminiscent of the 1984 hit Gremlins as evidenced by the basics of the plot as well as the focus on humour. The critters themselves are hilarious little creations  thick black hair and a mouth full of teeth but in their own way they're also fairly frightening! Gremlins isn't the only influence on this film  the whole idea of something bad coming from space being followed by something to stop it obviously came from The Terminator and there are a number of other ideas taken from elsewhere  but the film doesn't feel like a bunch of stolen ideas and that is to it's credit. The secluded farmyard setting is also to its credit and again while it's not the most original location for a film like this to take place it works well so that isn't a problem. The cast which includes the likes of M. Emmet Walsh Dee Wallace and Billy Zane all do their jobs well and the action is always exciting enough to ensure that the film remains interesting. I won't say that this is a classic of the genre  but its good fun and I certainly recommend it.".

The inhabitants of a small town don't know what has hit them but aided by a couple of intergalactic bounty hunters they fight back to hopefully rid their homes of the furry maniacal Critters.Watching this is like watching a roll call for every stereotypical character ever put into a creature feature film. Cute kid who could be a hero nice but dim farm hand homely family with guts and verve the sheriff who is just not gonna believe what is happening no matter what evidence is produced and etc. Yet it works because they are homaging past masters they aren't trying to kid anyone that it's a new idea it's good fun that doesn't outstay its welcome.The Critters are great furry balls of fury with a shed load of teeth that are backed up by off the cuff subtitles to enthasize their grumblings. Genre babe Dee Wallace Stone gets to do her stuff whilst M Emett Walsh has fun as sceptical sheriff Harv. It's not a classic genre piece by any stretch of the imagination but it is fun witness a delightful E.T. scene and I for one look forward to part two later in the week. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in space a prison asteroid was going to have a vicious gang of furry basketballshaped razortoothed creatures called Krites until they suddenly escape to Earth so they can eat whatever comes in their way. The Brown family  Billy Green Bush Scott Grimes Dee Wallace Stone Nadine Van Der Valde will have one hell of a night fighting off these hungry hairballs that not even Sheriff Harv  M. Emmet Walsh and lovable drunk Charlie  Don Opper can stop them until a pair of intergalactic shapeshifting bounty hunters named Ug  Terrence Mann and Lee comes to the rescue to kill these things.Funny and entertaining horrorScifi comedy with charm and wit plus a good sense of humor.

	schema:reviewBody "Ah childhood memories I hadn't watched Critters or any of its sequels since I was a young boy and I nearly forgot how incredibly entertaining they are! Along with Night of the Creeps and Killer Klowns from Outer Space Critters definitely is the most successful horrorcomedy of the 80's and it actually even manages to be much better than the blockbuster it obviously borrowed its ideas from namely Joe Dante's Gremlins. The screenplay also uses story elements of innumerable other movies the farmsetting the space prison concept and yet it never really directly rips off any of them which is quite an admirable effort. Hairy little space monsters with funky red eyes and an insatiable appetite escape from their prison transport and land in rural Kansas where they immediately attack farmer Jay Brown's cattle and family. The son of the family tries to reach the nearby village for help but the Critters or Krites as they're called in space make it impossible to get away. Luckily enough there also are two intergalactic bounty hunters with heavy artillery looking for the murderous furballs. The story opens a little slow with an overly extended family portrait of the Browns but once the critters are rolling over the earth and eating their way through the countryside Stephen Herek's film is both funny and actionpacked at the same time. The dialogs are surprisingly witty and contain numerous references towards great SciFi classics. Particularly the bounty hunters are hilarious with one of them impersonating a famous rock star and the other indecisive about what appearance he wants to take on. The sharpteethed Critters are engaging creations made by the endlessly talented Chiodobrothers of the aforementioned Killer Klowns The acting performances are rather forgettable. M. Emmet Walsh is underused as the town's sheriff and Dee Wallace Stone tries to look too much like a teenage scream queen. There are early roles for Billy Zane and Lin Shaye who would only reach their popularitypeak in the 90's. Lightheaded fun for the whole family!".

While the whole concept is a thinlydisguised ripoff of the vastly superior Gremlins 1984 the critters are certainly enjoyable to watch as unlike the gremlins they dispose of people in variously gruesome ways with their razorsharp teeth and their spikes which they project like darts from their back. It's just a shame that the makers decided to crowbar in the alien bounty hunter subplot that not only takes the action away from the critters but gives the film a very silly slapstick edge that reminded me of Suburban Commando 1991.While Spielberg had set the family blockbuster groundwork with Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 and the massively successful E.T. The Extra Terrestrial 1982 depicting the wonder of alien invasion from the view of the family unit Critters seems to be happy enough following this familiar path but giving the film of a more violent edge in one scene a critter bites the head of Brad's E.T. teddy. It is these aspects that work for and against the film giving it a warm familiarity of the line of 'kidfriendly' 80's horrorscifi movies but reminded you that Spielberg did it far far better.

Everything from the music to a metal head rock star being the chosen body double of one of the aliens just screams 80'sgasm. And as someone who while not old enough to appreciate this film at the time it came out I was a baby I definitely love the outright dated nature of it. In fact there is rarely an 80s horror film that I do not absolutely drool over but this one is arguable a cross genre with sci fi horror and comedy.Anyway I gave this one an 8 out of 10 for the brilliant humor execution and of course the 8 is also short for 80s.

Firstly the film is purely a fun one its purpose solely being to blend scifi and comedy as well as horror of course. The Critters themselves are fiendish little bastards and I love them. Some consider them to be a cheap knock off of Gremlins but believe it or not the originality is actually debatable so for what it's worth discrediting the film on that notion is invalid in itself.The concept of bounty hunters coming to earth to kill monsters was pretty cool. The film slowly becomes the hypedup sugardriven child's lame dream come true. For that bit of nostalgia how can I not honor it?

I have a lot to say here but before I begin I'd like to say that if you ever read a review that says this is a ripoff of Gremlins ignore it. Not only is this film way better than Gremlins but it is definitely not a ripoff and I'll explain why. Okay maybe they got the idea slightly from Gremlins but this is very original and the only thing the two films have in common is the little furry monsters that eat people well the Critters do anyway Gremlins is more of a Family movie. Just because Gremlins was made first means nothing. I guess every zombie movie is a rip off of Night of the Living Dead since it was I think the first. Also the Critters are from space and Gremlins doesn't even really have a back story I'm not going into detail.With that out of the way these are the reasons that Critters is an all time favorite of mine and always will be the actors playing the family Billy Green Bush Dee Wallace Stone Nadine Van Der Velde and Scott Grimes are fantastic and actually feel like a real family. I was blown away by their amazing performance and that of every other actor in the film. The story is highly entertaining and very original too nevermind the Gremlins similarities which everyone looks too hard for and consists of eight killer fur balls which look very real I might add who escape an intergalactic prison steal a ship then head to Earth for some tasty human flesh to snack on. But my favorite scenes involve a duo of shape shifting bounty hunters who cause way more destruction than the Critters and have the whole town terrified which is hilarious as I guess all they care about is getting their paycheck. In order to blend in one of them transforms into a rockstar Terrence Mann and the other one changes into three different people including the town drunk Charlie Don Opper who along with Mann stars in all of the Critters films. They show up and destroy a church and a bowling alley looking for the ferocious krites then finally find them at the house of the family in which the film centers around. You'll notice that they only kill one krite ! and leave the whole town in shock with their pointless damage it's still very funny. I could go on and on about this film which I love and own on DVD along with it's three sequels which are still good but don't even compare with this entry that star Opper who eventually becomes the main character and Mann who returns as the alien bounty hunter Ug who is still in the same form for some reason. The directtovideo third film actually isn't very good at all and the fourth film which was filmed back to back with part three and was also released directtovideo is a whole lot better but just really depressing as the whole thing takes place in space in the future. I love these films which will always be some of the greatest low budget movies ever made.".

Douglas Koth is other that I pay a stick because the guy is like a machine whatever that it means. for obvious reasons the director Stephen Herek is the best director in the whole world and deserves a Oscar for sure! because he's better than Steven than George Lucas than Tarantino than Costa gravas than Kubrick and all the directors together! That's it folks...";

	schema:headline " Severely underrated prequel to one of the best TV series ever";
	schema:reviewBody "By the time this film was released critics and TV audiences had already decided its decidedly mediocre boxoffice fate. The usual network attitude toward anything which demands thought and interpretation assured the cancellation of the series in its second season and Lynch's departure from the show's director's chair to begin this film project all but sealed the fate of the show. Unfortunately this same fate determined both the critical and public approach to the film project. TPFWWM is a prequel to the twoseason Twin Peaks saga and sort of answers the question 'how and why did Laura Palmer die?'. Fans of the show mostly knew the answers before they saw this film but to see Laura's life so vividly realized and to see the TV characters cast into such a different more harsh surreal and disturbing light really invigorates the entire TP phenomenon. FWWM actually inspired me to watch the entire series again and as of 2004 I am in the process of watching it again. Fans of the series who found themselves disappointed by the final few episodes of the series because they felt it became too bizarre are likely to find this film more gripping though they will probably end up as unsatisfied as they were at the onset. Those who found the second season thrillingly experimental are likely to be surprised by the subtlety of and dramatic quality of this film. Those like me who approach the film with few tangible expectations might just find themselves compelled disturbed and very entertained. The performances are generally very good but not entirely even. Some TV castmembers given the vastly expanded possibilities of cinema really showed their range and depth. Sheryl Lee MacLachlan Dana Ashbrook and Ray Wise were especially impressive. The cinematography is less powerful than the usual Lynchian vision see Eraserhead Lost Highway for extreme examples and is more in keeping with the TV show's straightforward but moody photographic approach. The overall production values are in fact comparable to those of Mulholland Drive  also originally planned by Lynch as a TV show. Though more subtle than many of Lynch's more extravagant works TPFWWM is very successfully manipulative and powerful. I ardently appreciate Lynch considering him one of cinema and performance's greatest contemporary artists. And I am unashamed to state that I believe this to be among his finest works. Many of Lynch's fans love to write interpretations of Lynch himself as if all of his films are in some way connected beyond the obvious fact that he directed and more often than not scripted them. I do not disagree with this approach but in my opinion any such universalizing comments more or less miss the point. Lynch is one of many director's who view film as an art form not as a craft nor as a vehicle for specific messages and stories. As Lynch has stated repeatedly his films involve a dreamlike reality and often attempt to invoke a dream or nightmare state in viewers. Unlike most however Lynch succeeds in the purity of his art. His films demand interpretation engagement and what's more demand a different and unique interpretation by most who view them. If you are looking for something which can be universally interpreted from TPFWWM as part of this imagined set of Lynchian themes I am not the reviewer to give it look elsewhere. I have too much respect for Lynch's artistry to subject him to my own interpretive explanations. If you are looking for a simple story which will clear up the insanity of Twin Peaks don't bother with FWWM. If you are looking openmindedly for an intense disturbing and well constructed cinematic experience which creates more questions than it answers and retains elements of mystery in a fatalistically driven plot environment you've come to the right place.".

	schema:headline " reflections on the film";
	schema:reviewBody "WARNING  SPOILERS!!Well I've just gotten the FWWM DVD and am finally able to appreciate the film as it was intended to be seen and heard or at least as close as possible outside of a theatre.  It's unbelievable and after watching it a few times I was finally able to understand for myself what Lynch was doing here and he's right  intuition is the key  just pay close attention to what you are seeing and your mind will intuit the rest.  In fact understanding this film was a truly exciting thing for me.  What Lynch is actually doing here is thrilling.  As much as Lynch would and myself as well but... hate to hear someone give what they consider a definitive explanation for the film I thought I would give some ideas about some of the most interesting moments.  Any interpretation is viable of course but this is how I look at it.First the prologue To understand the prologue one must understand something about the nature of the evil in this film.  I see the denizens of the Black Lodge as the physical embodiment of the subconscious.  That's what the Red Room is to me the deepest levels of the subconscious where there is an understanding going on that rational thought won't allow.  For example Laura doesn't want to think that Bob is really her father but deep down she knows or comes to know in the film.  But Bob is really just the evil that men do the darkest side of humanity and he can be inside of anybody.  Since Bob is just a personification of this idea and doesn't literally exist he really can't be caught because eradicating Bob and the other members of the Black Lodge would be eradicating all the pain and suffering in this world and that will never happen.In the prologue Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley come across perhaps the most unhelpful town on the planet.  Much has been made of how this place is purposefully the opposite of Twin Peaks but I don't think that's the point. The unhelpfulness is the result of the town knowing that no matter how many FBI agents are brought in you can't get rid of what killed Theresa Banks you can't get rid of violence.  They treat the two with disdain because they realize the fruitlessness of their search.  Lynch emphasizes the strict use of code Lil and constantly has characters asking what time it is to give an air of precision but nothing gets accomplished.  The electricity reference is simply marking the presence of something bad in the area. So a lot of investigation occurs with nothing being accomplished.  Theresa Banks is dead and will remain so.Perhaps the most obscure point in the film is the sequence with David Bowie. To make this short Cooper's image freezes in the security camera because the members of the Black Lodge have stopped time for a second also apparently causing a rip in whatever fabric divides this world and the Lodge.  This allows Jeffries to breifly crossover apparently while the members of the Lodge are having a meeting.  This bizarre meeting with the grandson Bob etc.  is happening at the same time Jeffries appears in FBI headquarters.  He says it in voiceover  I've been to one of their meetings.  The meeting is to choose another victim.  The Man from Another Place is telling Bob to get more Garmonbozia pain and suffering which takes the form of creamed corn for him.  With this ring I thee wed he says talking about Laura.  Fell a victim says the grandson also talking about her.  The man in the chair with the beard makes a bizarre hand motion as if saying and so it shall be done.  Bob and The Man from Another Place are shown walking through the Red Room on their way out after the meeting to go get Laura.  The meeting over the rip closes and Jeffries goes back to the Lodge.  Keep in mind however that none of this is really literal although you have to talk about it that way in the context of the scene. It's the film's way of saying that something bad is happening again someone else is going to be the victim of violence.  The monkey underneath the mask is sort of like a fetus or like a birth.  They've given birth to this evil which will grow and grow and grow until Laura is murdered and the garmonbozia is given to The Man from Another Place.  After this the murderous thirst is quenched and the monkey reappears indicating that things are once again calm but will once again grow this happens at the end of the film. And of course in the series Madeline dies.Some quicker explanations  Laura talking to Harold saying Fire Walk with Me ME!!  is her talking about her temptation to degrade herself.  He says he wants to be me or he'll kill me.  This is Lynch telling us in an incredibly unique way that the abuse she's had from her father is turning into self abuse.The old lady and the grandson are like the gatekeepers of the Black Lodge allowing one to enter and exit.  In the literal world they are Laura's very first inclinations that Bob may be her father.

She looks out at the stairs  in about two days her mom will come up these stairs to find Luara missing.  She is also in the picture looking out the door meaning she has exited the Black Lodge or her deepest subconscious and is back in the rational world almost.

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING  SPOILERS!!Well I've just gotten the FWWM DVD and am finally able to appreciate the film as it was intended to be seen and heard or at least as close as possible outside of a theatre.  It's unbelievable and after watching it a few times I was finally able to understand for myself what Lynch was doing here and he's right  intuition is the key  just pay close attention to what you are seeing and your mind will intuit the rest.  In fact understanding this film was a truly exciting thing for me.  What Lynch is actually doing here is thrilling.  As much as Lynch would and myself as well but... hate to hear someone give what they consider a definitive explanation for the film I thought I would give some ideas about some of the most interesting moments.  Any interpretation is viable of course but this is how I look at it.First the prologue To understand the prologue one must understand something about the nature of the evil in this film.  I see the denizens of the Black Lodge as the physical embodiment of the subconscious.  That's what the Red Room is to me the deepest levels of the subconscious where there is an understanding going on that rational thought won't allow.  For example Laura doesn't want to think that Bob is really her father but deep down she knows or comes to know in the film.  But Bob is really just the evil that men do the darkest side of humanity and he can be inside of anybody.  Since Bob is just a personification of this idea and doesn't literally exist he really can't be caught because eradicating Bob and the other members of the Black Lodge would be eradicating all the pain and suffering in this world and that will never happen.In the prologue Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley come across perhaps the most unhelpful town on the planet.  Much has been made of how this place is purposefully the opposite of Twin Peaks but I don't think that's the point. The unhelpfulness is the result of the town knowing that no matter how many FBI agents are brought in you can't get rid of what killed Theresa Banks you can't get rid of violence.  They treat the two with disdain because they realize the fruitlessness of their search.  Lynch emphasizes the strict use of code Lil and constantly has characters asking what time it is to give an air of precision but nothing gets accomplished.  The electricity reference is simply marking the presence of something bad in the area. So a lot of investigation occurs with nothing being accomplished.  Theresa Banks is dead and will remain so.Perhaps the most obscure point in the film is the sequence with David Bowie. To make this short Cooper's image freezes in the security camera because the members of the Black Lodge have stopped time for a second also apparently causing a rip in whatever fabric divides this world and the Lodge.  This allows Jeffries to breifly crossover apparently while the members of the Lodge are having a meeting.  This bizarre meeting with the grandson Bob etc.  is happening at the same time Jeffries appears in FBI headquarters.  He says it in voiceover  I've been to one of their meetings.  The meeting is to choose another victim.  The Man from Another Place is telling Bob to get more Garmonbozia pain and suffering which takes the form of creamed corn for him.  With this ring I thee wed he says talking about Laura.  Fell a victim says the grandson also talking about her.  The man in the chair with the beard makes a bizarre hand motion as if saying and so it shall be done.  Bob and The Man from Another Place are shown walking through the Red Room on their way out after the meeting to go get Laura.  The meeting over the rip closes and Jeffries goes back to the Lodge.  Keep in mind however that none of this is really literal although you have to talk about it that way in the context of the scene. It's the film's way of saying that something bad is happening again someone else is going to be the victim of violence.  The monkey underneath the mask is sort of like a fetus or like a birth.  They've given birth to this evil which will grow and grow and grow until Laura is murdered and the garmonbozia is given to The Man from Another Place.  After this the murderous thirst is quenched and the monkey reappears indicating that things are once again calm but will once again grow this happens at the end of the film. And of course in the series Madeline dies.Some quicker explanations  Laura talking to Harold saying Fire Walk with Me ME!!  is her talking about her temptation to degrade herself.  He says he wants to be me or he'll kill me.  This is Lynch telling us in an incredibly unique way that the abuse she's had from her father is turning into self abuse.The old lady and the grandson are like the gatekeepers of the Black Lodge allowing one to enter and exit.  In the literal world they are Laura's very first inclinations that Bob may be her father.  The picture is just saying that she needs to go into her subconscious to find the answer which she does that night.  Don't take the ring says Cooper meaning don't be another victim do something about your situation.  After Annie appears Laura walks toward her door.  On the soundtrack you can hear her mom calling Laura which references the morning after she was murdered and her mom couldn't find her.  She looks out at the stairs  in about two days her mom will come up these stairs to find Luara missing.

	schema:reviewBody "There's no doubt about it Twin Peaks changed the living breathing face and body of television the soul and minds of those who watched it and the attitudes of film and television makers everywhere who watched what was intended to be a 2 hour Telemovie become a phenomenon. A phenomenon that dissected the way television was made and shown to its very core and reassembled it in a fashion that no one had ever witnessed or dreamed of. A phenomenon that would sweep the world Not since JR was shot in Dallas had the entire worldwide viewing public stopped to ask itself a question for one brief shining crystallized moment in 1990 Who Killed Laura Palmer? And so with David Lynch's Fire Walk With Me the question is not Who? But rather Why? This film precedes the TV show these are the last 7 days of Laura Palmer and after watching this film it is pretty apparent why Laura wanted to die she lived in a world out of her grasp and control she was desperately fighting what she was becoming but realized that the forces that were pulling her down were too strong for her to fight against I knew someone like that once and to be quite honest it has changed the way I look at Laura Palmer. The first time I watched this film was in 1992 when it came out on VHS I was 16 or 17 and I hated it. It wasn't Twin Peaks. It was horrible and violent and had none of the cuteness and quirkiness and lovable characters of the TV show and I never watched it again. Watching it almost 15 years on as an adult I understand why I hated it so much when I was a kid. As a 1617 year male I had absolutely no concept or understanding of what it would be like to be Laura Palmer completely unable to relate to her and therefore completely unable to understand or sympathize. Completely unable to understand what it would mean to live in a world where everyone is in love with you and how that would only make you hate yourself more when you hate yourself so much already.This is a really sad movie. It really puts you in to Laura Palmer's world or what's left of it briefly. Maybe too brief but you know maybe I read too much in to films or I get too close too them but this film has changed Twin Peaks for me forever. And it's quite possible that it will do the same for you. Even though she was dead before the opening credits I never realized until watching this film again that Laura was never freed she was always in 'purgatory' if you will always in the Red Room when we saw her or seeing a flashback of her murder during the course of the TV show. Fire Walk With Me gives something to Laura Palmer that she had been denied on television.Release.For the most part this film was not made for the fans nor was it made for the money Lynch made this film for Laura palmer. His love of her is what inspired him to breathe life into her character on the big screen after taking it away on the small. This is his dance first and final with Laura Palmer. It is not ours to be involved with it is ours only to watch the romance between character and director evolve and be burnt too soon. It is ours only to witness not too understand or judge not to ask or question.From the opening shot a television with no reception which is quickly obliterated by an Axe it is quite clear that this ain't no TV show and if the symbolism of the TV being smashed isn't enough to tell you that then the opening scene will. This is the part of Twin Peaks that simply never would have made it to TV. The real Twin Peaks if you will the dark tortured seedy underbelly of a town with too few people and too many secrets the sort of place that exists almost everywhere in the world with the exception of Cicely Alaska.".

'Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me' is brutal stark graphic and horrifyingly disturbing.'Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me' may not be as technically 'polished' as Lynch's other films and the low budget shows but is not bothersome at all.

Someone should give this actress more roles. Ray Wise Moira Kelly Kyle Mclachlan and the rest of the supporting cast are of note.

They are plentiful but I won't give my interpretation as they are best discovered first hand.Many feel that the story is inconsistent but to me it all fits well together. Towards the end it is depressing as the viewer has witnessed all the layers of Laura's agony in detail. It is not a comfortable film to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "If you were not a fan of the Twin Peaks television series you would not want to bother watching this film. Fire Walk with Me pretty much requires the viewer to have already seen every episode of the television show. If you haven't you will be well and truly lost as you watch this film unfold in the bizarre Twin Peaks universe. Assuming you have the requisite working knowledge of all things Twin Peaks heading in you'll at least be able to understand the film. Whether you'll like the film is an iffy proposition at best.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel to the television series which means Laura Palmer is alive. But before we can get to Laura there's a thirtyminute or so prologue a prequel within a prequel? about the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks whom all the Twin Peaks diehards know was the first victim of the killer who would eventually murder Laura. After what any fan of the television show will see as some typical weirdness and not much in the way of resolution the prologue ends and we move forward in time jumping into the final week of Laura Palmer's life. It's nice to see Laura alive for the first time. The television show had already established Laura was not the sweet innocent homecoming queen she seemed but her demons were for the most part only hinted at on TV. In Fire Walk with Me those demons are on full display. Where the television show was subtle the movie is in your face. A little too much in your face some might say as David Lynch takes full advantage of all the opportunities provided by producing an Rrated movie. Certainly nothing is held back here as we watch Laura Palmer spiral downward towards her sad end.In the rather brutal telling of the story of Laura Palmer's final days all the charm of the television series has been lost. For all the terrible things that occurred in the series the show always had that smalltown quirky charm. Not here. For the Twin Peaks fan it's nice to see those familiar characters again. And the film does add a lot to the Laura Palmer story and allows you to get to know her much better. But you may come away wishing you hadn't gotten to know her quite so well. Perhaps some things are better left unspoken and unseen. There were two sides of Laura Palmer and this film shows you much too much of the dark side. There was a lot of good in her watching this film makes it hard to remember that even as you can't help but sympathize with the way she is being taken advantage of and the way she will meet her ultimate fate.If you're a real Twin Peaks fan you really do have to see the movie. There is a lot to like about it. The story is captivating as ever if decidedly less charming in this goaround. And the performances from the cast are mostly very good most notably from Sheryl Lee who finally gets to play a living breathing Laura Palmer after having been introduced to the world dead and wrapped in plastic. And Ray Wise as Laura's father Leland also does fine work in portraying a disturbing and complicated character. We never got to see Leland and Laura interact in the series and their relationship is fascinating to watch. Fascinating and also more than a little creepy as the movie's Leland is a constantly ominous threatening presence. You'll miss Lara Flynn Boyle who for the film has been replaced in the role of Donna by Moira Kelly. Kelly fails to bring the same spark to the character that Boyle did. And while many of the characters from the show return you'll miss those who notably don't. Audrey and Benjamin Horne Sheriff Truman Deputies Andy and Hawk Doc Hayward and Pete Martell and Big Ed...would have been nice to see them and some others one last time if even just briefly. It is nice to have the opportunity to go back to the Twin Peaks universe. Unfortunately it's not quite the universe you remember. This is a much darker sinister and decidedly less enjoyable Twin Peaks. Sometimes you can't go home again.".

But the scenes that show Laura accepting her fate are the most chilling of all here is a girl who under different circumstances would have been a pure and normal individual.

	schema:headline " LYNCHS' DARKEST MOST DISTURBING MOVIE AN OVERLOOKED MASTERPIECE";
	schema:reviewBody "This isn't just the darkest lynch film ever made it is one of the darkest most disturbing films ever committed to celluloid. It tells the tale of the last 7 days of Laura Palmer so it plays as a prequel to the episodic story which told the tale of how her murder was 'a feak accident' described in this film. The films contains some of Lynch's most creative touches to date most notably in a nightclub from hell scene in which the character's dialogue is bareley audible and in a dream sequence which involves a bizarre painting of a wall. Why Lynch fans overlooked this is more bizzare than the film itself as it attains a similar style but does admittedly drop a lot of the characters that gave it it's quirky charm Dale Cooper has merely a walk on cameo no sign of 'damn fine cherry pie' but nonetheless has a sense of bizzare horror and dread and plays out quite similarly as how you'd imagine 'the Exorcist the Adolescent Years. After touches of subtle horror that Lynch has displayed in most of his films this is a return to the 'bizzarly terrifying' sense of dread that Lynch demonstrated with Eraserhead but unlike that film it is very true to form in portraying a slow journey of a downward spiral as seen through the perspective of a confused teenage girl caught up in unfortunate circumstances due to her effortless sensuality and in doing so it is so disturbingly authentic young girls heading towards a similar fate may use it as an effective warning. Criminally underrated.".

The films contains some of Lynch's most creative touches to date most notably in a nightclub from hell scene in which the character's dialogue is bareley audible and in a dream sequence which involves a bizarre painting of a wall. Why Lynch fans overlooked this is more bizzare than the film itself as it attains a similar style but does admittedly drop a lot of the characters that gave it it's quirky charm Dale Cooper has merely a walk on cameo no sign of 'damn fine cherry pie' but nonetheless has a sense of bizzare horror and dread and plays out quite similarly as how you'd imagine 'the Exorcist the Adolescent Years. After touches of subtle horror that Lynch has displayed in most of his films this is a return to the 'bizzarly terrifying' sense of dread that Lynch demonstrated with Eraserhead but unlike that film it is very true to form in portraying a slow journey of a downward spiral as seen through the perspective of a confused teenage girl caught up in unfortunate circumstances due to her effortless sensuality and in doing so it is so disturbingly authentic young girls heading towards a similar fate may use it as an effective warning. Criminally underrated.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you are currently watching Twin Peaks on Showtime and are a little confused then you should watch Fire Walk With Me. As much as I am enjoying some of the new episodes of Twin Peaks it is a little strange!I know people that have never seen the show before are saying one thing What the Hell? I can't blame them because the show seems to be catering to the die hard fans of the show. Most of all it is catering to people that know and remember every character from not only the show but the film Fire Walk With Me. Now I was always a fan of the television show. I was mad that the show had ended with a cliffhanger. I was happy to hear that Fire Walk With Me was coming. A year later when it was released I was shocked that it did not solve the television cliffhanger however I did enjoy the film. I thought it was strange but very good. Fans of the show hated Fire because most the cast from the television show were not featured. It also din't help that the film was too violent for some fans. In the television show it was about Who killed Laura Palmer. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me The film was about why she murdered. I will admit the film is very confusing. The GREEN RING was a new element that was never mentioned in the television show. Also what was really annoying to me was that the murder of Laura slightly differs from what we were told on the television show. In the television show we are told Through Waldo the Bird that Laura kept saying Leo No and that Laura had a poker chip in her stomach. These events are not shown in Fire. The assembly cut of the film was rumored to have run over 5 hours. When the the film was released it ran 135 minutes. Most of all the film did not resolve the cliffhanger from the television show. Before the film was released in the USA it Premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and it was booed. Now I am not sure if they saw a different version of Fire but the film was panned everywhere. This was a shock to David because the pilot to the television show was The Best Reviewed television pilot of all time. Well most fans had herd before Fire's release was that there was many cut scenes that featured the television cast. For years the fans were hoping that those scenes would turn up somewhere. BE it an extended television cut of the film or a special edition on home video. After all in 1984 David Lynch directed the film Dune. A few years later when the film when shown on television it had about an hour of never before seen footage so hopes were high that this would be the case for Fire but that never happened until 2014 when David Lynch finally released the deleted footage. This was 22 years after the film was released. However these scenes were not edited back into the film. David Lynch likes the theatrical cut of Fire so he did not want to tamper with it. However fans did and someone who goes by Q2 made a great edit that included the deleted scenes and in reality it is a better film however it does run 3 12 hours! Best News is that it does solve the cliffhanger from the television show! What is strange is that for a fan edit is that it runs smoother than the theatrical edition. The original theatrical version is shorter but seems longer! Now there is a few scenes that were re edited back in that were not needed. On the plus side the fan edit does improve the viewers vision on the problems that Laura had to face in the last 7 days of her life! If you ever get the chance to see this edit it is worth watching It makes Fire a masterpiece!".

She also seems to get weird visions and nightmares on top of things so her life is pretty complicated and she is a pretty disturbed teenager.

Winner of The Saturn Award for Best Music at The Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Horror Films The Brit Award for Best soundtrack at The Brit Awards and The Independent Spirit Award for Best Original Score. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me has good direction a good script good performances by the entire cast good original music good cinematography and film editing. I have never seen the Twin Peaks television series before but I really wanted to see this film because I figured I wouldn't have had to have seen the TV show seeing as this is a prequel and I also wanted to see the film because I love the films by the film's writerdirector David Lynch. The film is hard to describe in many ways because like so many of David Lynch's films it is very unusual and is sometimes hard to figure out. But I was intrigued by this movie and I liked the character's dialog and the eeriness of the town and the different people who live there. The film is very well crafted and put together and I like how David Lynch was able to put together such an atmospheric and stylish film. Also to write a movie this interesting and off the wall takes the genius of a great writer and director such as David Lynch. I was thoroughly captivated by the film and entertained. I was also fascinated by this wonderfully unique journey into this odd little town with odd little characters and settings. A truly unique film experience and another hit for David Lynch.".

When I found that none of the stores near me had it in stock I decided to pick up the movie instead. In some ways this was good. In some it was bad. Let me explain ...In 1991 Twin Peaks was canceled. Immediately popular director David Lynch who also created and wrote most of the show said that he wasn't finished with the show yet ... and set to work making a movie that would close off the Twin Peaks phenomenon. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me  this film  is the result a 135 minute journey into a realm where insanity and madness reign supreme.Fire Walk With Me is a prequel to Twin Peaks. The first thirty minutes deal with two FBI agents Chester Desmond Chris Isaak and Sam Stanley Kiefer Sutherland who are investigating the murder of a young girl in the small town of Twin Peaks. Just when Desmond seems to have a suspect we fade out and find that we are months later. From there the film follows the events leading up to the mysterious death of Laura Palmer Sheryl Lee which the series focused on. Kyle MacLachlan has some screen time as the series' main character Dale Cooper.This is probably the hardest film to review in the world. First of all let me say that if you aren't a fan of Twin Peaks or of David Lynch you will be lost shortly after the film begins. This movie was created solely for Twin Peaks lovers and if you haven't seen the show the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer is unveiled in this movie.If ever there has been a movie that is pure insanity it is this. Fire Walk With Me is onehundred percent madness. And yet throughout the whole film I was completely mesmerized. And when the movie ended I couldn't speak or do anything for about an hour. This movie truly has an effect on you whether you're a fan of the show or not.The cast is terrific but it's David Lynch and Angelo Baladamenti who steal the show. Lynch is either a madman or a genius  I can't decide between the two. But Baladamenti is certainly a master composer because his score for this film is beautiful.Seeing is believing. That fits perfectly from this film. Perhaps after I watch the show I will better understand this film. Until then I can just say that it the most indescribable frightening mesmerizing and astonishing film I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Twin Peaks was the best thing to happen to television in years. It paved the way for fanfavorites like XFiles and Six Feet Under. Even distant cousins like Buffy the Vampire Slayer owe that surreality and that horroropera continuity to David Lynch's amazing contribution to television. And as much as I enjoyed Lynch's ability to rework the failed TV pilot Mulholland Drive into the very enjoyable film it became I'd still give my left arm for it to have remained on the air for a few seasons. Maybe it's the additional subtlety that Lynch was forced to apply when dealing with the much more touchy medium of TV sponsors only want the type of nudity and swearing that will GUARANTEE better ratings but I think TV's a medium that he excelled in and for that reason the SERIES Twin Peaks will always be better than it's cinematic sibling. Fire Walk With Me is for Twin Peaks fans. No one else will enjoy this movie. No one else will GET this movie. And if you do then you have more surreal and creative tastes than I do. But for all of the PeakFreaks this movie was the last hurrah one more crazy redcurtained dance party for a show that we all felt ended too soon. If you love Lynch if you can quote every stupid line about coffee and cherry pie that falls from Agent Cooper's lips then Fire Walk With Me will remain one of the greatest movies of all time.".

Images sound design and Sheryl Lee's nearmiraculous performance all contribute to something much closer to a Horror Film than the genre with the actual namesake.It seems that many fans of the Twin Peaks TV series were very disappointed with this film. I read over and over how peakies feel the movie lacks the quirky offbeat kinda funny tone of the TV series. Well step back and consider something the central themes of the movie AND the TV show are 1. fatherdaughter incest 2. drug addiction and 3. murder. I guess we're all pretty desensitized what with TV shows like Law and Order and Jerry Bruckheimer movies all purporting to give us action and thrills that are gritty and hardbitten.Lemme tell ya that stuff ain't gritty and hardbitten. Rape victims on TV shows are paperthin stereotypes compared to the Laura Palmer of Fire Walk With Me. Why? Because Lynch shows us the HORROR the inescapable fencedintoacorner hysterical inevitableness of a young girl who can't cope with her father's abuse of her who then turns to drugs and increasingly can't cope with those either and who finally sees the true tragedy of her life before it's even finished playing out. The wings disappear from the picture.What Fire Walk offers in its portrait of evil and abuse is the full gamut of emotions not just fear and anger though there is plenty of that but also aching aching sadness loneliness abandonment. Lynch did a fairly good job of conveying this within the confines of a TV show with commercials remember how the first half hour of the pilot was just people crying? but in the movie he really gets to go town.Incest and drug abuse are absolutely devastating. This movie is absolutely devastating and so touches the truth.".

Fire Walk With Me gives something to Laura Palmer that she had been denied on television. Well it's quite possible that it will do the same for you. Laura was tormented and tortured sexually abused by her father or Bob we never truly know and she was always in 'purgatory' if you will always in the Red Room when we saw her or seeing a flashback of her murder during the course of the TV show. I for one am not entertained or enriched by seeing someone's art film portrayal of psychotic damaged people.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is very difficult to find where I live but after I have fallen in love with the brilliant series and all the other works that David Lynch has done I was really looking forward to watch this prequel that many professionals had heavily criticized. Many people said that the movie didn't have the same charming way of the life in a small and mysterious town many people commented that the characters weren't as intense and believable as in the series and some people regretted that some of the series's characters like Audrey Horne or Harry Truman didn't appear in this movie and that some other main characters like Dale Cooper only had small roles.But I think that those people didn't understand the intention of this movie. It is sure that a movie of two hours and fifteen minutes can't develop the characters as much as a series with almost thirty episodes. It is also sure that this movie is about the last days of Laura Palmer and that's why characters like Audrey Horne have not much to do with this movie as they had no closer connection to the main character. This movie has a faster development than its series it is straight forward and maybe less mysterious.But this movie is intense in every sense of the word. It is frightening has a very dark and desperate atmosphere it is horrifying and it is brilliantly played by Sheryl Lee and we get a true insight of the character of Laura Palmer and her everyday life along side her strange father her weak mother her many different friends and especially boyfriends. This movie shows in a very straight and hard way the wasted life of a beauty that has lost its youth and innocence. This movie is about sex drugs violence crime murder and fear and how to get drowned in a circle of desperation. The scene were Laura and Donna are in the discotheque is one if the most intense moments ever filmed in cinema's history with its strange music weird light effects ugly sex and violence scenes and the feelings that evolve from there. You feel hypnotized and desperate about the characters. The scene where Laura and her father are in their car and surprised by a strange onearmed man is strange disturbing and extremely weird. The scene where Laura meets the strange Bob in her sleeping room is spooky haunting and could create nightmares. The scene where Laura finally faces her destiny is brutal uneasy and pervert. The conclusion and final scene of the movie is the only part where you feel a little bit of piece and hope in a very transcendent and spiritual way.David Lynch plays with your emotions and your wildest dreams and drowns you from one feeling to the other. While watching this movie I was frightened I was almost crying I was disturbed I was delighted and I was absolutely impressed. I never thought that this movie would mess up with the best series in history but this flick is absolutely at the same level even if it is different because of its intensity.But even though this movie is straight and heavy there are still many mysterious details and typical trademarks of the series from time to time like the weird introduction of the case by Gordon Cole and the dancing lady things that only a genius could have invented. The weird scene with David Bowie is also one for the ages and extremely cool. There are also many little hints to discover that concern the fate of other characters of the series for example the scene where a bloody Annie sleeps next to Laura and transmits her a strange message.A sure thing is that this movie is no easy stuff and more scaring than any horror movie I have seen in my life. That's why this movie hasn't been a success for the masses and its very particular style is in fact very charismatic and different from anything you might expect. The point of desperation is that you know what will happen if you have seen the series and that you know that the characters are damned or even lost and the frightening about all of this is that you know that there is no escape and that you don't exactly know how or when it might happen. I really felt with the characters in this movie and this is something that has been developed in the series over several episodes but in this movie I had the same feeling only after a couple of minutes. I have never seen or felt something as intense and strong concerning a movie in my whole life.I always thought that David Lynch's masterpiece concerning a movie is Lost highway but after watching this flick I am no longer sure about it. This is a masterpiece a mysterious weird scaring horror movie with some dramatic elements. This movie doesn't need much blood or gore effects to frighten you it's all about the atmosphere. This movie is so intense that you simply don't have the time to miss Audrey Horne and all the others that I have liked so much throughout the series. That is something brilliant and unexpected that only David Lynch could create and it's a shame but as well typical for the mainstream masses that they didn't accept this style at the time and that there haven't been any more movies about Twin Peaks. At least the legacy found its end on an absolute climax.I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies and has a little sense of genius and is openminded enough to accept the flick's very unique style. It is probably my favourite movie of all times or comes at least quite close to it.".

The fans that had remained through the show's secondseason decline doubtlessly wanted a conclusion to the show's many narrative strands. A feature film could have provided a sense of closure as with future cult TV shows Firefly and Veronica Mars. But of course David Lynch has never been one to give people what they want.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel and one that doesn't really provide any information about Laura Palmer's death that isn't revealed in the first half of the TV series. As such it's inessential even for fans of the show and at times can feel like a rehash of old material especially in the first half hour another quirky detective investigating another murdered young girl.So why watch Fire Walk With Me? Well there are some fun appearances by the likes of David Bowie Kiefer Sutherland and Harry Dean Stanton. But more importantly the film pares down the supernatural tangents and weird townspeople that littered the TV series. Those things had their value but they eventually made the murder of Laura Palmer a half forgotten conceit. As in so many murder mysteries the actual murder victim becomes inessential. In Fire Walk With Me that violence takes centre stage. We see Laura Palmer's world a world of constant sexual violence and her futile attempts to cope by owning the depravity. It's Lynch at his bleakest and it's genuinely unsettling in the way that say the Log Lady is not. Rather than being the story of a strange small town Fire Walk With Me tells the story of Twin Peaks as a story about a girl who is repeatedly raped and eventually murdered and there's absolutely nothing charming about that.It might just be because I was less focused on deciphering the plot but Lynch's style seems heightened in comparison with the TV series and even some of the other movies he made around this time. The story unfolds in a kind of jazzlike alternation between absurdity kitsch and horror. There isn't really a plot but nevertheless I couldn't turn my eyes away. The return to horror makes Fire Walk With Me a worthy companion to the original series and much more worthy of a revisit than some of those season 2 episodes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good film. When David Lynch rereleased his original cut in 1992 there was over an hour of footage that was edited out of the final cut. For years fans were begging to see this footage. Then after 22 years David Lynch did release them. They are refereed to as The Missing Pieces. As nice as it was to see these scenes they were not edited back into the film. I just watched the Q2 fan edit for the first time and it was GREAT!!!It made Fire Walk With ME more complete. I have seen the original version many times and still enjoyed even if it didn't make too much sense! THE Q2 fan edit makes the whole film make sense. The Q2 fan edit reinserts the missing pieces and places them in the order in which they appeared in the screenplay. Also restored is a countdown. It tells you how many days Laura Palmer has left to live. Now upon watching this fan edit you can full understand why David Lynch cut them. However he should have left in all the Theresa Banks Footage. He also she have kept in the David Bowie scenes.The fan edit runs about 3.5 Hours. If your a fan of season 3 of Twin Peaks then you must see the fan edit!".

I know that within the film industry originality and alternative approaches to telling stories are usually praised but this movie is a waste of time. I've seen some other David Lynch movies and there are a few I like particularly Lost Highway. But not only does this movie not make sense it is boring and very dry. Inland Empire was at least crazy enough to keep you watching but this movie starts out for 30 minutes as an FBI investigation and then the remainder of the film is about a high school student. The story never comes back to the FBI investigation or the first missing girl. In all I just feel that this movie was trying too hard to be hipster and out there. It failed miserably in my book.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the words above could be used to describe another Lynch movie  the much applauded Lost Highway 1997 whose plot is inspired in part by Kafka's Die Verwandlung and the wellknown O.J. Simpsoncase  they are as much descriptive of his earlier and less critically acclaimed film Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me 1992.After two fascinating intermezzos namely Industrial Symphony No. 1 1990 and Wild at Heart 1991 David Lynch returns to the ever more surreal and absurd mystery of Twin Peaks 19901991 together with writer Robert Engels. While the TVseries opened to rave reviews and much acclaim audience interest dwindled and critics grew tired during the much debated second season. Leaving no finite answers as to mystery of Laura Palmer's murdercase the series went as far as to finish with a question  in fact a strangely diabolical one How's Annie...? There are perhaps no definite answers either in the prequel Fire Walk With Me however the subjective story of Laura's Persephonylike descent into Hades remains as tantalizing and surreal as ever  at once more impressive and more horrific than that of John Merrick in Lynch's 1980 classic The Elephant Man. To be true the story of Laura's dire straits even resembles that of Fred Madison in aforementioned Lost Highway. And there will never be an ending quite as persuasive  though explicitly violent and misogonistic  as when Laura's strangely picturesque thrashing is underscored by the classical masterpiece Requiem in C Minor.  A final scene not without a certain likeness to the visually explicit misogyny in Blue Velvet 1986 where strongly saturated closeups of Dorothy Valens' bloody teeth make for a scarily scoptofiliac and visceral experience.Two scenes in particular from Fire Walk With Me deserve mentioning as perhaps two of Lynch's most explicitly and vividly subjective sequences ever 1  an almost andobviously intentionally so unintelligible scene in a filthy bar near the AmericanCanadian border where Jacques Renault apparently though never audible to 'us' gives hints as to the murder of Teresa Banks.and 2  an excessively loud noisy scene where Laura and Leland both seated in Leland's car are held back in traffic by a timber truck and an old handicapped couple. The eerie tone slowly turns deafening before erupting in a violent almost abrasive musique concrte  mirroring the abuse of Laura and the beautiful? absurdity of life in an almost Epsteinian fashion.The film has so often fallen victim to misreadings and critical devaluation but in its uncanny and eerily surreal stimmung it should instead be recognised as the very essence of Lynchian. Demanding as it may seem Fire Walk With Me is meant to be experienced and felt as much as it is meant to be intellectually understood.".

Who better to breathe life into the subject than Jerry Zucker the mastermind behind the Naked Gun films and Airplane two of the most hilarious movies I have seen. After years of directing straight dramas Zucker says he is thrilled to be back doing comedy. It's very visual and there are lots of big visual stunts Zucker explains in the film's production notes kind of a James Bond comedy in a way because there are so many sight gags.Good comparisonRace Race is indeed a visual comedy. Its laughaminute attitude works for the creative situations.  The audience does not necessarily laugh at every single joke the movie throws but the humor is timed well. Rat Race also contains a terrific cast and provides enough laughs to be worthy of at least one viewing.   John Cleese stars as the eccentric Las Vegas casino tycoon named Donald Sinclair. He wants to keep his wealthy high stakes gamblers interested in his gambling techniques so he arranges a new quasilegal sporting event for them to bet on a human rat race.Sinclair randomly places six golden coins in several different slot machines. The customer service sends the winners to a large banquet room where the characters learn of a two million dollar jackpot resting in a duffel bag inside a locker within the city of Silver City New Mexicoseven hundred miles away. The fist one there keeps all of the money taxfree. the odds of winning are one and six explains Sinclair. There's only one rule there are no rules!  The players include a vast variety of different characters. There is Vera Baker Whoopi Goldberg who after giving her child up for adoption as a baby has decided to meet her daughter Merrill Lanai Chapman. Owen Temleton Cuba Gooding Jr. an NFL coach who recently blew an important game has come to the sin city to forget his horrendous mistake. Mr. Pollini Rowan Akinson from Bean is an exuberantly cheerful but narcoleptic Italian fellow. Randy Pear Jon Lovitz and his family is vacationing when he slips off to play slots and wins the chance of a lifetime. The Cody brothers Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are first to cause trouble in any crowd. Finally Nick Breckin Meyer a skeptical young lawyerintraining meets a charming young woman Amy Smart and encounters plenty of adventures with her.  Rat Race offers plenty of hit and miss humor. Much of it misses but much of it hits the mark as well. The majority of the humor is physical and exaggerated. Very little offers sharp witty satire on any part of culture. The film says something about greed in a zany sort of way but for the most part this is just a two hour laugh riot nothing more nothing less.However this is a tricky script to write and for the overall result to provide this much effective comic material Andrew Breckman's ingenious script is indeed successful. It's not easy writing a comedy like this and Breckman does indeed run into a few problems in the overcrowded plot. Even more difficult is creating a conclusion for a story like this. No matter how you end it you are certain to displease at least some audience members. Breckman has found a way to have his cake and eat it too. I would never dream of revealing how this race concludes itself but I will say it is not exceedingly satisfying but sure does work over the obvious other possibilities. Rat Race is one of the funniest movies of the year. It's energetic irrelevant and entertaining. You are sure to have a decent time.".

But this is a great time for the whole family.  It includes a star studded cast and the typical comedic gags that we have to expect where one of the Zucker boys is involved.  One of the greatest things about this movie on DVD vs. seeing it at the theater is the outtake section on the DVD.  I am a sucker for outtakes anyway but once you've seen this film and then watch this section it is all the funnier! I also thought this was a great vehicle for certain members of the cast to do show their comedic abilities. Enjoy the film".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the trailer for this movie you're probably thinking it looks hilarious and you've made a mental note that it's one you don't want to miss.  More often than not however the funniest stuff is in the previews and when you see the whole movie it's a letdown.  But I'm here to tell you that is decidedly NOT the case with Rat Race' directed by Jerry Zucker and furthermore make a mental note  This movie is hilarious and one you DO NOT want to miss.  In the tradition of Stanley Kramer's 1963 BIG comedy hit It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' this one is exactly what it is supposed to be Fun yes with a capital F' and Funny with one laugh after another that just keep on acomin'.Las Vegas casino owner Donald Sinclair John Cleese likes to offer his elite customers the high rollers' something they can't get anywhere else in the form of things they can gamble on that are so bizarre you can only imagine.  And the big one he comes up with this time begins with the planting of six lucky tokens in his slot machines.  Those who win the tokens are invited to attend a meeting at which time Sinclair announces that they are to be the lucky participants in a race' of sorts.  In a train station locker in the small town of Silver City New Mexico there is 2000000 waiting for whomever gets to it first.  He passes out six identical keys to the token bearers that will open the locker shouts Go!' and they're off! And Sinclair's high rollers proceed to put down some big bucks on their favorite horse uh dog! uh Well you get the idea...The participants include Nick Breckin Meyer who is pretty much just a regular guy NFL referee Owen Templeton Cuba Gooding Jr. hated by millions because of a recent botched call brothers Duane and Blaine Cody Seth Green Vince Vieluf not the brightest bulbs to begin with and hampered in their communications by Blaine's newly pierced tongue a mother Vera Whoopi Goldberg and the daughter she gave up for adoption and with whom she has just reunited Merrill Lanei Chapman Randy Pear Jon Lovitz who has a hard time making his wife Bev Kathy Najimy and their two kids Kimberly Jillian Marie and Jason Brody Smith understand why he's interrupted their Vegas vacation to drag them off suddenly to New Mexico and last but not least Enrico Pollini Rowan Atkinson a narcoleptic Italian.  It's quite the eclectic bunch and they definitely put on quite a show.During the rush for the gold they encounter a number of people and situations that drive the laugh meter through the roof including  A woman Kathy Bates selling squirrels by the roadside Vera and Merrill a group of Lucy' impersonators on their way to some kind of Lucy convention Owen a Barbie' museum that isn't what it seems and not a great place for the Jewish Pear family to visit an errant cow a hot air balloon and a guy who overhears too much Duane and Blaine a jealous helicopter pilot named Tracy Amy Smart who buzzes her boyfriend's house at a most inopportune time Nick an ambulance driver Zack Wayne Knight who is transporting a human heart for a transplant and suffers something akin to the same fate as that famous cat' due to his curiosity Enrico.  Zucker and writer Andy Breckman pulled out all the stops with this one and the result and there's much much MUCH more than what's mentioned here is some pretty wild stuff.The secret to making this all work is above all to keep it moving and Zucker certainly does that.  He relies heavily on sight gags and slapstick and knows how to set up the schtick for a real payoff which he succeeds at time and again throughout the entire film.  it's all fairly controlled insanity and with a couple of exceptions when Zucker wanders into Jim CarreyFarrelly Brothers territory it's pretty easy to swallow.  Most importantly IT'S FUNNY! with enough different kinds of humor thrown in to satisfy just about any taste.  And that's a rare thing to be said of any comedy and it's a big part of why this one's such a gem.The cast is superb but the highlights have to be Cuba Gooding Jr. who demonstrates a real knack for comedy John Cleese who can make you laugh just by smiling brandishing as he does a spectacular set of teeth and Rowan Atkinson who does some masterful bits of physical comedy the likes of which rivals the best of Peter Sellers and Buster Keaton.  The way he mugs and moves is absolutely hysterical.The supporting cast includes Gloria Allred Herself Dave Thomas Mr. Grisham Dean Cain Shawn Paul Rodriguez Gus Brandy Ledford Vicky Tristin Leffler Pierced Girl and Andrew Kavovit.  One that lives up to it's expectations and more Rat Race' is everything you want it to be a laugh a minute movie that never lets up and one that won't wear your brain out making you think about it too much.  This is pure entertainment that'll lead you down the road to riot make that laugh' riot.  There hasn't been anything quite like this since Jimmy Durante kicked that bucket and started that other bunch of madcaps off looking for The big 'dubayeh'.'  Zucker and his gang really pulled this one off and moreover they did it with style.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen It's a Mad ... etc. World is it four Mads or five? I can never remember so it's not fair to make comparisons  but the changes I know about sound as though they're improvements.  The sum of money in the original film was 350 000 this time it's 2 million which adjusting for inflation is considerably less.  In the original the money was a fifteenyearold buried treasure here it's just money.  An eccentric squillionaire has put it in a locker without explanation.  WE get an explanation of sorts but the racers do not  so there is no romance attached to the prize which means that all of their actions are PURE expressions of greed.  John Cleese is the squillionaire and while his cameo in The World Is Not Enough proved that he could with the right material fail to be funny he and his coterie of wealthy compulsive gamblers are hilarious here.  It's good counterpoint humour since they're actually the least greedy most disinterested people involved in the chase.A criticism levelled at the original was that innocent wellmeaning bystanders got hurt  that it was meant to be a joke when their property was destroyed but the joke wasn't funny.  Rat Race avoids being open to the same charge by making the world an even more venal one.  The ambulancechasing lawyer the live organ courier the quirky roadside squirrelseller the keycutter the garage mechanic the neoNazis the vengeful taxi driver ... all these people have less attractive personalities than any of the racers.  Only a few of them are punished but among them are the only outsiders to be punished at all.  With the exception I'll admit of people we never see like the anonymous owners of cars that are run over in the parking lot.Whoopi Goldberg plays it straight which suits her.  I can't fault the acting anywhere but I do wish that Rowan Atkinson hadn't been cast as the loopy dimwitted Italian I can't see this picture playing in Italy at all.  To be sure he brings the role off and he's the only person who could have done so  but he would have been funnier if he'd been allowed to be more intelligent to have a little more rat cunning hiding beneath the surface.  For half a second he DOES exhibit cunning it's by far his funniest moment.All scenes before the race is announced fall flat.  Timing and motivation just weren't there and I even wondered afterwards if Zucker had handed his establishing scenes to an ungifted underling.  But I don't want to carp at a funny film by saying it could have been funnier.  Things pick up considerably as soon as John Cleese outlines the central premise from then on the film is never less than inventive and even if for some reason you don't find it funny you must admit that those involved at least had the right IDEA about comedy.".

He was the only good reason to watch Seinfeld. Anyway I felt this movie was quite a departure for some actors and a great one for those who have made a movie such as this before. Jon Lovitz was excellent in this film along with Mr. Bean or Rowan Atkinson as he is called by nonMr. Bean fans who must be a sad group of people.

	schema:reviewBody "I always wanted to see Rat Race but I never did don't know why but I thought of it last night while I was renting some movies. I watched it last night and I have to say that I cannot believe that I missed out on this film! I thought that Rat Race is one of the funniest movies I have seen. As silly and outrageous as the humor is I think that's just what I needed to put me in a good mood. The cast in Rat Race is absolutely perfect they couldn't have picked a more comedic cast not only that but they all clicked so well together and made the film just an absolute blast to watch. Not to mention cows are just getting a reputation as the perfect comedic relief just look at not only Rat Race but Twister lol. The story is extremely clever just how far most people would go to get money in their pockets.Donald P. Sinclair is a huge millionaire he's so rich in fact that he and his other rich buddies place the most obscene bets and they've just come up with the most cruel one of all. In a Las Vegas casino several people have won a coin saying that they've won something. Donald has place two million dollars in a locker in Silver City New Mexico. At first the group just laughs at him feeling like they've been scammed but they think about it and decide to just go for it. They all have to travel over two hundred miles while being watched by the rich group is watching them and betting on who is going to win the cash.Rat Race is incredibly clever and just a whole lot of fun to watch. Another great thing about this film is that it puts you in a great mood you gotta love the comedies that can't stop make you laughing out loud. I think my favorite team was without a doubt Seth Green and his brother they were just classic. I loved it when they had to stop all the flights from getting out so that they could have the same head start. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone it's a fun comedy and deserves a better rating on IMDb trust me it really is that funny.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very funny film that often had me in stitches as it's really good fun with a great story and hilarious performances!. All the characters are awesome and I think this film should be higher then 6.3 in in my opinion plus Rowan Atkinson and Cuba Gooding Jr. are simply amazing in this!. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Amy Smart's character gets angry at her boyfriend for cheating on him and she goes psycho on him and Rowan Atkinson's character was really just Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but he was still amazing! plus I loved the scenes him and Wayne Knight had together. The ending was just perfect in my opinion and there are so many hilarious gags to enjoy as well plus Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers. It's very well made and written for the most part and if your not rolling with laughter You'll at least be chuckling plus John Cleese was very good in his role. I loved the scene where they search for the heart that they lost as that was very funny plus I also loved the squirrel segment with Kathy Bates!. This is a very funny film that often had me ins stitches as it's really good fun with a great story and hilarious performances I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Jerry Zucker does a great! job here with excellent camera work cool angles and just keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Breckin Meyer is fantastic in his role he had this easygoing charm that I loved he was also great with Amy Smart this guy is quite underrated in my opinion I loved him here!. Cuba Gooding Jr. is hilarious as the bone headed Ref who cost the Dallas Cowboys the game as he did so many hilarious things he just rocked! especially loved the scene with him and the Lucille Ball imitators on the bus that was a scream!. Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers and stole a lot of the scenes I loved them!. Whoopi Goldberg is OK in her role I'm not really a big fan. Lanei Chapman is good in her role I liked her. Jon Lovitz is surprisingly funny and effective in his role because he usually annoys me. Rowan Atkinson is amazing as always and is amazing here now he is basically just playing Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but it's still very funny he brought a lot of laughs to the film!. John Cleese is good in his role just wished he had more screen time. Amy Smart is very cute and is quite funny in her role especially loved the scene where she went psycho on her boyfriend. Wayne Knight is hilarious as usual I loved him he worked well with Atkinson. Kathy Bates is funny as the Squirrel lady I liked her. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "We Are Family is an official remake of the famous 1998 Hollywood movie Stepmom. The story of the film is just perfect for a Hindi film because that's what Indian audiences like and can relate to. I never understood why bother to remake a film which in itself was not particularly great but the movie certainly lacks the verve of Stepmom and as expected it resorts to sentimentality far more often. I did not expect much from We Are Family and it was just the way I thought it would be. The movie is a melodramatic tearjerker of its sort. It is of course much more realistic in its overall portrayal but there too it had its share of loopholes being a tad too dated and conservative for its time.The film is of course highly predictable but it has its touching moments from time to time despite being generally unconvincing. At first the film was really poorly developed and later on it turned into a very sentimental and emotionally unrestrained tale which is fairly enjoyable and occasionally moving but never particularly memorable. Towards the second half the film has a very familiar Kal Ho Naa Ho feel to it but while the latter was flavoured with great comedy and a witty touch of New York's realism We Are Family sometimes lacks soul. In its favour it can be said that it's focused but at the same time it's a bit too long for the story it tells although not very long per se where Hindi film parameters are concerned.One of the main reasons I decided to go through the film was of course the casting. Kajol leads the film with a heartfelt and natural performance which is compelling and moving. Kareena Kapoor supports really well in a restrained act but at times I felt the story did not dig enough into her character's thoughts dilemmas and fears before she took the decision to do what she did and that's one of the examples of the faulty script. Arjun Rampal is convincing as the caring exhusband. Among the kids they're above average to okay but the cuteasabutton Diya Sonecha was really likable even if not particularly for her acting. She at times reminded me of the adorable little kid playing the younger daughter in Shekhar Kapur's classic Masoom. Many movies have shown films about families in times of trouble and their way of dealing with it together whether it's Terms of Endearment Stepmom or the Indian movies Anuraag Kaash. We Are Family is one of them. I still wonder why it was so necessary to make it and though it generally lacks the power to captivate and stay with you after the show has ended and is lacking in substance it's still a wellacted and generally watchable movie despite its flaws.".

The problem begins in the Second Hour the Screenplay goes for a toss. The culmination in the original was a pure genius. Whereas the culmination of this remake is out of emotions. It doesn't leave the impact as per expectations. Another sore point is its soundtrack by ShankarEshaanLoy. None of the songs are memorable.Production Values as expected from Karan Johar are firstrate. Siddharth Malhotra makes a fine debut as a filmmaker.

He plays his part with control and patience. Kajol is believable as always. Kareena Kapoor is good.

There's not much else to say. I don't think the scenes are written very well and the dialogue is clunky and unrealistic. Plus one never really gets a chance to empathize with these characters because they all seem just so selfish and immature.The songs both aurally and visually are boring and while the performances are adequate they never rise above the rest of the flick.I think perhaps the makers thought we'd be grateful enough having an official desi remake of the type of Hollywood movie we South Asians love one filled with rona dhona.

In fact he is one of the very few actors in Indian film industry who can portray this role The kids were very good especially the eldest girl. Some of her expressions were just WoWWW!!! The youngest girl was so cute she was like a doll in Bumm Bumm Bole also The other child the boy was also good don't know why he did not get that much role as of the other two.Music department not so great I saw many people praising a song Hamesha  Forever I didn't feel anything for the song In fact the other songs like Aankhon Mein Neendein Reham O Karam and Let's Rock were niceA good movie on the whole..".

The youngest girl was so cute she was like a doll in Bumm Bumm Bole also The other child the boy was also good don't know why he did not get that much role as of the other two.Music department not so great I saw many people praising a song Hamesha  Forever I didn't feel anything for the song In fact the other songs like Aankhon Mein Neendein Reham O Karam and Let's Rock were niceA good movie on the whole..";

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched Stepmom several times and sure it made my eyes water but the story wasn't so much about a mother dying as it was a story of two women finding a common bond for the sake of good the kids. The structure of the film flowed very well and was wrapped up in a nice little bow.This version made me cry my eyes out. It was good in that it focused on the kids and the mother helping the children transition to a life without her. The storyline was a bit disjointed in that there seemed to be some flip flopping between the mother feeling territorial.Some other notable differences in my mind are Kajol not using medicinal marijuana! Just kidding although she doesn't but the impact Shreya has on the kids is not depicted and Aman moving back is unfathomable to American audiences but is perhaps more realistic for Bollywood moviegoers. Also I'm not a Julia Roberts fan but her performance as a woman inheriting children was much more compelling than Kareena Kapoor. Maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges I'm just saying. Lastly the music. It didn't seem as if the music was always appropriate for the content of the scene  it was an interesting artistic choice.Overall I enjoyed the film and absolutely LOVE Kajol. Her scenes moved me every time. And Arjun Rampal is much better to look at than Ed Harris. Sorry Ed.".

If Bollywood were to become like Hollywood  then whats the point! The film itself was overall fantastic. The best part about it is that it doesn't sell itself on its music. It sells itself on the story and the superb acting from all the actors. I watched stepmom after watching We Are Family and I was impressed how the bollywood version took it one step further and showed life after Kajols death...whereas in Stepmom it didn't. So who says Hollywood is better than Bollywood? The last 10 minutes were fantastic especially where the children run up to their mother and cry. In those moments nothing needs to be said by the actors its completely said through their expressions.I recommend this film to any bollywood fan.".

	schema:headline " Once again a glossy unmoving  deliberately spiced up film on the subject of terminal illness.";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest offering from the house of Dharma Productions and Karan Johar consolidates two widely known facts about their projects post AGNEEPATH and GUMRAH which came in the early nineties. One that they now make films majorly for the overseas markets and the multiplex viewers with storyplots revolving only around the rich and upper class section of the society. And two that their films necessarily have to be all glossy colour perfect and beautiful having no place for the harsh realities of a normal life.WE ARE FAMILY also exactly follows the same pattern where everything happens so perfectly and nicely within a rich family to such a level that it all becomes completely uninteresting unmoving and pointless. In short the only merit of the movie in my opinion is that this time thankfully it's an Official adaptation of Chris Columbus's STEPMOM 1998featuring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon.But the negatives start right here from its inception as I really couldn't find the reason to adapt an ORIGINAL which was so English in its concept and also not entertaining enough to get inspired from. May be the makers as usual only had the Foreign markets and multiplexes in mind to do so.Anyway being an honest adaptation WE ARE FAMILY starts exactly in the same manner as STEPMOM which in reality becomes utterly confusing for the viewers. Here we have a man still frequently visiting and spending quality time with his three kids and wife even when they have been divorced from the last 3 years.Quite strange! And on top of this he is hugely interested to introduce all the kids to his loving girlfriend for no reason at all because the main plot of terminal illness starts after this initial sequence. Now when the kids are happily living with their mom after 3 years of divorce between their parents then why he is intruding so much in their happy home. At the most he should only visit at regular intervals to meet the kids and that's it. If he is still so much involved with the family then why not accept the mistake and come back to them right away?Moving ahead with this impactless start WE ARE FAMILY goes into the same old mould of Dharma Productions famous flick KAL HO NA HO revolving around the ages old formula of terminal illness of the hero. The only difference here is that instead of a love triangle we have a caring mom in the film who brings her exhusband's girlfriend in her own home as she wishes her to become the mom of their 3 kids after she is gone. Interesting may seem to be on the paper but on the screen it comes out to be utterly unconvincing slow and even boring despite of some good performances by the trio ofPati Patni aur Woh.Debutant director Siddharth P. Malhotra makes a typical Dharma Productions film but minus the Hit music and the much needed entertainment factor. The narration keeps on moving at a constantly slow speed and is only able to impress in the last 5 minutes alone when the story shifts to the future mode where all the 3 kids have grown up to become 3 good looking youngsters. Moreover all the comic scenes in the film seem to be deliberately added upon to somehow spice up the proceedings and provide few relief moments to the viewers. As a result the end product is not able to hold your interest throughout its two hours of duration.Though equipped with two most sought after names in the Industry Sidhharth fails to extract some energetic stuff from the duo and you simply miss the fire in their scenes together. In simple words Yes Kajol and Kareena are there on the screen once again but they are not able to deliver what was being expected from them by their viewers. Individually Kajol is excellent and Kareena is impressive. But together the script does not give them anything to excel upon. Kajol's transformation from a healthy lady to a dying patient remains one of the few good things in the movie and the talented lady once again proves that she can easily rise above a not so fine script too.Kareena displays her acting skills particularly in the second half but her character is not anything different from what she has already done before. Besides I also couldn't understand why the director tried to portray her as a vamp in the first half. The Original flick never showed Julia Roberts in a bad light in any of its scenes right from the start and that's where the Indianised treatment of the second lady fails completely.Arjun Rampal as the confused father is fine and the three kids put up an honest show with their sincere performances. But unfortunately the film has nothing in particular for the kids coming to the theaters with their parents. The other major letdown in the film is its uninspiring music shockingly coming from the multitalented ShankerEhsaanLoy. The soundtrack is a big disaster with the main song even having few resembling notes with Tere Hai Zameen Tera Aasman from THE BURNING TRAIN. Further the Cinematography had to be eyecatching since the whole film is set in the foreign locations and also has many glossy backdrops related to the fashion world.So overall WE ARE FAMILY falls flat in absence of anything exceptional or new to convey to its audience. But you can try it only if you are interested in its honest performances and cast.".

More than a decade ago when I first saw 'Stepmom' I knew Bollywood was going to copy this. 'Am only surprised it took them this long.'We Are Family' is pretty much a melodramatic tearjerker. The scenes that were directly copied from 'Stepmom' were quite laughable. I preferred the more original sequences like when Maya and Shreya go shopping with Aaliyah Shreya chooses a dress for Aaliyah who is thrilled while Maya feels some resentment.'We Are Family' has the look of a typical Yashraj film. It's shot in Australia. Really why couldn't they have made the movie in India? Are the makers really that ashamed of their own country? The movie not surprisingly revolves around very rich people. The story is told in a melodramatic and sugarcoated fashion. The sets are quite lavish. Cinematography is flat and music is horrendous. The 'Jailhouse Rock' remake is one of the worst songs and the way it was visualized made me cringe.It's good to see Kajol not pair up with someone who's not a Khan or a Devgan. Her pairing with Arjun Rampal was quite refreshing and both actors have good chemistry. However Rampal is underused as the film is more about Shreya and Maya. Kareena Kapoor tries his best but she's completely overshadowed by Kajol. 'We Are Family' belongs to Kajol who yet again delivers an excellent performance. If there is anything watchable about 'We Are Family' then it's her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director William Wyler and star Laurence Olivier bring to life the atmosphere and most important characters of a classic novel in Wuthering Heights.  While necessarily omitting much of the material for cinematic purposes and having a slightly different emphasis the film version will still be appreciated by those who enjoy classic stories.The Emily Bront novel on which the film is based is one of the greatest books of its kind.  It is far deeper than any film version could be so for this movie only a portion of the story is used and several characters are omitted.  The movie also has more of a melodramatic feel than did the novel. It does retain the flashbackstyle of narrative which works just as well in the film as it did in the book.The story opens with a weary traveler meeting up with a nowaging hostile and excitable Heathcliff Olivier after the main action of the story is in the past.  Unsettled by this strange man the traveler is told Heathcliff's story by the housekeeper Ellen Flora Robson.  This begins with Heathcliff's childhood and goes through his relations with the Earnshaw family and the Linton family.  The heart of the story is his troubled romance with Catherine Earnshaw Merle Oberon whom he has known since being taken in by her family as a child.  This relationship in turn leads to conflicts with most of the other characters and affects the lives of everyone involved in profound ways.Olivier memorably portrays this difficult character and helps the audience feel his longing and restlessness.  Oberon is also ideal as Catherine  a mercurial character who is both a complement and a contrast to Heathcliff. The other main strength of the film is its realization of the main settings which are almost as important to the story as the characters are oncefine but now gloomy and declining Wuthering Heights the pleasant but vapid Thrushcross Grange home of the Linton family and especially the wild mysterious Yorkshire moors the only place where Heathcliff and Cathy are ever really happy.  These settings are all effectively created and photographed and provide an appropriate background to the events and tensions in the characters' lives.The result is a movie that while lacking the complexity of the novel is a satisfying realization of the most important aspects of the book and which effectively brings the audience into the lives and hearts of the characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a classic film buff I had the chance of being introduced to this film by chance one late evening when it was being aired on TCM.  I fell in love with the movie and when I was told that it would be required reading over the summer I was ridiculously happy.  As many have noted the 1939 adaptation of Wuthering Heights is more or less merely the first volume of Emily Bronte's beautifully and powerfully written classic  focusing less on the detail of Heathcliff's wrath post Cathy's death but moreso on the sheer complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship the scenes at Penniston Crag of them among the moors and heather are not in the book because Bronte had to stick to Ellen's point of view  it was nice that we could finally have an indepth look at the tumultuous relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff.  While characters are omitted Frances Hareton Linton and the baby Catherine it still retains much of the very nature of the novel.  If you will recall many parts of Gone With The Wind were changed and characters removed in the process of transferring Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece into a screen epic.  After all this is Hollywood. The cinematography is divine very much worth its Oscar perfectly capturing the very essence of the bleak chilling haunting Yorkshire Moors that Bronte described in her book.  Laurence Olivier is in my opinion a very fine Heathcliff.  Indeed in the book his nature is more animalistic and devilish but Olivier superbly exhibits what Heathcliff is all about  dark brooding and terribly bitter.  Even at our first introduction to him we know by the tone of his voice that something is very very wrong with this man and that something is very very off in that household.  Olivier expresses Heathcliff's wildness and devilishness through his voice stance and through his facial gestures rather than so much in other physical ways. Merle Oberon is remarkable as Cathy  a much more dark and exoctic beauty than Isabella whose good looks are very wholesome and pure perhaps to match the darkness of the gypsy stableboy Heathcliff and capturing the duality of personality that is Catherine Earnshaw  part of her wanting to love a wild evil wicked stable boy... the other part longing to be part of a higher society.  Particularly coming to mind is her scene in the kitchen with Ellen and that marvelously disturbing death scene  her eyes wild.  I do wish they would have left in the part of the book where she refuses to eat and begins hallucinating  Oberon could have performed it so well. Also to be noted are the stunning performances of David Niven and Gerladine Fitzgerald as the longsuffering Edgar and Isabella Linton respectively their lives made miserable by Cathy's selfishness vanity and greed to be part of a higher way of living and by Heathcliff's undying love for Catherine and his course of revenge and destruction.  Flora Robson is also wonderful as Ellen Dean narrator of the whole sordid story.Someone mentioned that this film by focusing on the love story and by the ending I suppose tried to say that Heathcliff and Catherine were perfect for each other and could have eventually found true love.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  I believe what director William Wyler was trying to say here was that Heathcliff and Catherine were not good people.  Cathy was right when she said that she and Heathcliff's souls were made of the same basic fiber  they were both greedy and selfish he wanted her passion for him to be as deep as his passion for her and she wanted and if he couldn't have it no one else deserved to have it and God forbid those around him feel any kind of love compassion or humanity and she didn't even really know what she wanted except to be part of the upper crust and to rise above what she had lived through when Hindley became master of their house and because of that their love could have never meant anything BUT tragedy. They could never have found happiness together because they were not happy people.  But they could find love in death  because in death they could be what they really were all along  children mere children forced to grow up all too quickly with the death of the man who cared deeply for them thus forcing Hindley to become head of the household.  There would be no Hindley in death.  And as children they were good together  as children Cathy wicked as she was at times as a youngster could restore hopes of prosperity to Heathcliff's dark bitter soul.  They were as children more or less all one another had.  And so they could go on as children without a care happily picking heather and being King and Queen on the moors. You've GOT to see this movie.".

Mr. Olivier was at the pinnacle of his career. He responds well to Mr. Wyler's direction. His Heathcliff shows a mean streak but over all Olivier gives an impressive performance.David Niven is excellent as Edgar Linton the man who wins Cathy's heart with his kindness.

The young and beautiful Geraldine Fitzgerald makes a brilliant Isabella.The rest of the players are equally wonderful Donald Crisp Hugh Willimas Leo G. Carroll Cecil Kellaway made contributions to the movie.Ultimately this film is a love story doomed from the beginning.

	schema:headline " Olivier is Heathcliff";
	schema:reviewBody "Two of the most complex characters in all English literature are Hamlet and Heathcliff. Is it any wonder that one of the most capable English actors of them all should play both on celluloid? There is no better movie Hamlet than Olivier's. He also gives the definitive Heathcliff movie portrayal. Neither Hamlet nor Heathcliff are saints or sinners. Both are somewhere between heaven and hell. Both have dark indistinct hues as part of their aura. Heathcliff's Ophelia is Cathy played to perfection by the wonderful Merle Oberon. Added to the immense acting talents of the two leads is the matching shadowy cinematography of Gregg Toland. Mix well and serve with just the right touches by master director William Wyler and you have a film that for once is almost as good as the literary masterpiece on which it is based. The only element missing is part of the story left out for several reasons one being brevity. Few can argue that the best part of Gone With The Wind is the first half. Following the burning of Atlanta the film becomes much more melodramatic and sentimental. This does not happen to Wuthering Heights. The almost perfect country household in 19th century England is disrupted by the entrance of an interloper a street urchin picked up by Cathy's dogooder father. He is called Heathcliff no last name. From the very beginning he is a disturbed and fanciful child attempting to ride away and disappear on the wild moor. Also from the start there is a bond between Cathy and Heathcliff just as there is resentment and loathing from Cathy's profligate brother Hindley. When the father dies Heathcliff is turned into a lowly stable boy by Hindley. Cathy and Heathcliff find a secret castle where they create their own isolated paradise. This cliff hideaway continues to be their haven for the rest of their lives. Heathcliff ultimately runs away to America and only returns when Cathy marries someone else to spite him. Eventually he spites her by gaining ownership of Wuthering Heights and then marrying Cathy's sisterinlaw. What sounds rather simple in outline is one of the most complex relationships in literature created by one of the greatest literary minds of the ages Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights the movie is one of the pivotal films of the 1930's and one of Hollywood's finest pictures ever.".

Although it stops at chapter seventeen and the ending is seen as a bit trite by some it's a brilliantly enacted finely mounted production with beautiful photography and authentic period detail setwise.  Merle Oberon is wellcast as the selfish vain and rather shallow Cathy. What makes her character so intriguing and interesting is that no matter what happens to her materially she has an undying love for the gypsyblooded heathen named Heathcliff.  Laurence Olivier never a great success in films prior to this gives a brutally honest account of everything Bronte's Heathcliff should be proud bold vengeful  darkly brooding a tortured soul in general.  Wyler's guiding hand is patent throughout it was Olivier himself who gave credit to the meticulous director in teaching him the particular ropes of screen acting it shows! Ladylike Isabella is wellplayed by the Irish Geraldine Page while Ellen the longsuffering servant is played sympathetically by the fine character actress Flora Robson. David Niven ideally cast as the milquetoasty Edgar Linton actually had a clause in his contract which freed him from having to do crying scenes!

	schema:reviewBody "If it weren't for Gregg Toland there would be no CITIZEN KANE or THE LITTLE FOXES. With his unique acute textured treatments of light and shadow which transcend well beyond the black and white media he creates palpable tableaux in which characters meet interact and pave the way for these timeless stories. Needless to say he is the true star of William Wyler's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. In bringing such attention to detail Emily Bronte's classic novel becomes a living breathing creation drenched in the Gothic atmosphere that was its very raison d'etre. A rare thing indeed.The story is wellknown. A traveller named Lockwood comes upon this dark house and is given shelter and care by the housekeeper Ellen Dean. During his stay there she discloses the tragic events which have taken place in Wuthering Heights. It so happens that the place was owned by a Mr. Earnshaw who brought a young gypsy boy Heathcliff to the house to live with his family comprised of his son and daughter Hindley and Catherine. While Hindley takes an immediate dislike to Heathcliff Catherine reacts as a friend and both form a fateful bond that turns into an explosive untamed love which is tied to the moors itself. However she is slated to marry Edgar Linton and cannot see herself wed to Heathcliff who leaves Wuthering Heights. Later on he returns now a wealthy man buys the Heights from Hindley marries Edgar's sister Isabella and systematically ruins both his his wife's and Catherine's lives.Wyler's adaptation of the novel stops midway from the entire story and decides to focus on the first generation. In doing so I think it somehow dilutes the fact that love can conquer time but even so it's a minor complaint. Laurence Olivier is Heathcliff from head to toe. Merle Oberon falters a bit  while full of the dark looks that Catherine most likely is thought of she lacks some life within her. Vivien Leigh would have brought much needed rebelliousness and emotional gravitas to the role. Understated but effective is Geraldine Fitzgerald who was Oscar nominated for her performance as Isabella. The last scene featuring Cathy and Heathcliff reunited walking hand in hand across the moors is the one terrible spot  hokey and lame. Even so this is the adaptation that time has considered to be the closest to the novel in essence as subsequent versions have been made all with varying results.".

	schema:reviewBody "A number of years ago a mystery novel was published that has as it's secret the discovery of the complete manuscript of a second novel by Emily Bronte. Unfortunately nothing like that has ever surfaced so we are stuck with only one book penned by her. If that one book was THE PROFESSOR or SHIRLEY Charlotte's two least good novels Emily would long ago have been forgotten and we would see more interest in her younger sister Anne. But Emily left us WUTHERING HEIGHTS. It is rare for a writer to turn out such a stunning masterpiece only once and never write anything again.JANE EYRE is a well structured organized novel and it has passions revealed. As I have mentioned elsewhere it is a novel where the heroine was in a lowly position and dared to love her employer something shocking in 1847. But WUTHERING HEIGHTS has a similar story but with more symbolic raw power. Here it is not a female servant loving her master but a male of gypsy heritage who loves and is loved by the daughter of his patron. But the patron dies and his jealous son treats the gypsy as the lowliest of servants. How the gypsy boy finds his love seemingly rejected and how he eventually lives only for revenge against those he feels wronged him becomes the meat of the plot here. And all the sturm und drang is played out against the wild moors with their hints of sexual freedom.It was powerful stuff in 1847 Victorian England and it remains really powerful today. If Bronte could not write anything else due to her early death this novel still enshrined her among the great novelists.The only element of the plot that is lost is Hindley's family. He has a wife briefly in the novel that is how he has a son named Hareton that Heathcliff torments in his revenge. The wife named Frances dies soon after giving birth. No mention of her nor of Hareton and young Cathy and Heathcliff's son by Isabelle called Linton. Possibly like the streamlining of the 1944 JANE EYRE by dropping the Rivers from the story this was just as well.Olivier had the Byronic good looks of a dark saturnine type that fit the part of the tormented devilish Heathcliff. And Merle Oberon who had already appeared opposite Olivier in THE DIVORCE OF LADY X was given her best part as the confused doomed Cathy she loves Heathcliff as she tells Nellie  Flora Robson but she has a willingness to take up with Edgar David Niven because he is civilized and caring when she is injured and she thinks Heathcliff deserted her. Niven really had his first meaty dramatic role as Edgar and Geraldine Fitzgerald was quite good as the sadly disillusioned Isabel who loved not wisely but too well.The stark cinematography by Gregg Toland and direction by William Wyler makes this the best film made of any of the Bronte novels to date.".

Some of us still mourn that his thenwife Vivien Leigh wasn't granted her wish to be cast as Catherine but Merle Oberon is nonetheless excellent her Catherine isn't quite likable but then she isn't supposed to be.  Instead of sugarcoating the story as Hollywood is so wont to do the filmmakers give us Cathy and Heathcliff as they should be ruthless selfish destructive and fascinating.  The only major drawback is the saccharine musical score which tries to make this wild haunting story into a candybox romance.  Fortunately all the other elements resist this tendency.  Even though the film only covers half the novel you'll find it satisfying and unforgettable.".

Instead of sugarcoating the story as Hollywood is so wont to do the filmmakers give us Cathy and Heathcliff as they should be ruthless selfish destructive and fascinating.  The only major drawback is the saccharine musical score which tries to make this wild haunting story into a candybox romance.  Fortunately all the other elements resist this tendency.  Even though the film only covers half the novel you'll find it satisfying and unforgettable.";

	schema:reviewBody "While a lot has been removed from the original Emily Bronte book what has been transfered into the lavishly beautiful original film version has made it a classic that holds up like very few other films do. Released in the most classic film year ever this shines above every other film in my book even more outstanding than the two most remembered films of 1939 Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.Merle Oberon is the wild sweet Cathy a pampered rich girl from the Moors who is loved by many but loves only one. Laurence Olivier is her childhood companion Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by her late father then tossed to the stables by her cruel older brother. As the years go by Cathy and Heathcliff's affection turns into love one that no boundaries can cross. Even when he goes away to America to make his fortune he's not far from her thoughts. She marries a locally prominent man Edgar Linton played with gentility by David Niven and out of spite the returning Heathcliff marries Edgar's lovestarved sister Isabelle Geraldine Fitzgerald in a truly tender performance that is downright tragic. Sick with jealousy and hatred towards what he has done simply to hurt her Cathy regresses from life hanging on by a balance.Everything about this film is truly outstanding from the breathtaking photography and glorious musical score to the art direction editing and yes even the screenplay which took simply the choice bits of elements from the original book. William Wyler directs with panache and every performance is filled with subtleties that can't be denied after repeat viewings. Merle Oberon sadly overlooked for an Oscar Nomination gives the greatest performance of her career showing that beyond being an exotic beauty she was also highly underrated. Every essence of Cathy is explored and even in her most spoiled and selfish moments you can't help but love her. Olivier is perfectly brooding the aches within him so deep over a love he knows he can't have on earth taking over his own tortured soul. The supporting players are all outstanding and special honors must go to the wise and winning performance of Flora Robson as Wuthering Heights' longtime housekeeper who seems to die herself as the climax approaches and tragedy has erupted. Hence her return to her original home which has decayed while the Lintons remained bright and elegant. Donald Crisp is wise and compassionate yet stern as the local doctor Hugh Williams straight out of a Dickens novel as the cruel brother who decays along with Wuthering Heights Leo G. Carroll as the loyal butler and Cecil Humphreys as the kind man who took the waif Heathcliff in originally.So purists can get off their high horse and simply accept what the writers chose to include for a lengthy film which never seems to be as long as it is. If the classic novels of all time were filmed exactly as written they would have to be at least 3 hours long which is why BBC and PBS and the occasional American networks eventually did many of them as MiniSeries.".

Besides it rains all the time so best to be in the house even if mansions represent the confining space of class and class privilege. That's the trouble. Cathy is 'to the manor born' as they say. Thus she's really torn between the wild outdoors and the comforts of ballrooms and servants. Then there's the enigmatic Heathcliffe a dark wildsouled type guy perfectly at home in those bleak rolling hills. He was a street ragamuffin before Cathy's elderly father adopted him into the manor as a stable boy. But he and a young Cathy manage to bond despite the class difference a bond that eventually blossoms into true love. But that true love only breaks to the surface in the wild outdoors where a common humanity replaces artificial social distinctions. If only Cathy could find the will to break free of the leisure class.What a great visual experience the bw expertly coordinated with the settings. When the two lovers approach the rocky crag there's almost a feeling of an outdoor altar calling to them amidst the brooding hills. It's such a perfect visual contrast to the highkey ballrooms and parlors of the Lintons. The Lintons however are not to be despised despite their airs and privileges. In fact they are very real victims of Cathy's suppressed feelings and Heathcliffe's cold calculations. As it turns out there is no spectral salvation for them. As a result the love being portrayed here is a kind of mad love one that brings tragedy to all concerned. Thus there's a reason those moors brood in dark fashion while the movie itself remains the best of the many makes and remakes.".

	schema:headline " Heathcliff And Kathy";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I wrote this review I talked to someone else who also had done a review of this film here. Young Heathcliff is brought to the Yorkshire moors by Cecil Kellaway who was the father of Merle Oberon and Hugh Williams. He seemed to be dropped into the Earnshaw family without any rhyme or reason. Kellaway finds the scruffy kid on the streets of Liverpool and brings him back to the family estate in Yorkshire. I asked if in fact Emily Bronte wrote more of this than what we saw. The answer was no. That in itself was curious because the version we see here was quite condensed from the original story.Still enough of Wuthering Heights survives on the screen to tell Emily Bronte's tale of lost love that cannot be because of class distinction. Merle Oberon is a beautiful and fetching Kathy who grows up with scruffy young Heathcliff and she becomes his soulmate. Yet class being what it was and to some extent still is she can't andor won't marry him. He's just the stableboy and her brother is jealous of him and his presence.One piece of snobbery becomes too much and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff leaves as he promised for good to make fame and fortune. That was a common theme in English literature used by Dickens among others as well as Emily Bronte here. It was an indirect attack on the class system of Europe let alone the United Kingdom. The opportunities are in the new world and the colonies. Olivier comes back but the love and tender feelings he did possess for Oberon are replaced by a brooding vengeance seeking man. He successfully humbles the people that snubbed him but at a terrible cost to his psyche.Laurence Oliver came back to America after a previous visit to Hollywood where he didn't set the world on fire. His trip was almost an afterthought his wife Vivien Leigh was to be Scarlett O'Hara so he signed to do Wuthering Heights at the same time under Sam Goldwyn with William Wyler directing. Though he may have been inpatient with William Wyler's deliberate style of moviemaking he credited Wyler with being the first director who really taught him the difference between acting for the stage and for the screen. Olivier got the first of his Oscar nominations for Best Actor and he was up for that award with Clark Gable for Gone With the Wind James Stewart for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Mickey Rooney for Babes in Arms. They all went down to Robert Donat in Goodbye Mr. Chips.Wuthering Heights took one Oscar home best black and white cinematography for Gregg Toland. Geraldine Fitzgerald got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress as the woman on the neighboring estate who develops a Statue of Liberty size torch for Olivier who can't see her for beans but marries her anyway in some twisted act of revenge against her brother played by David Niven who married Oberon. Oscar nominations went to the film for Best Picture and to William Wyler for Best Director and several other technical nominations went to the film as well.David Niven liked working with Olivier Oberon and the rest but he hated his part of Edgar Linton. He felt it had no depth to him but it was a typical David Niven part full of surface charm and little else.Over 60 years later Wuthering Heights is still a film for lovers of all ages. We all hope in the next world that Olivier and Oberon have a better life and start on an equal plane.".

Yes it is not exactly the best version of Emily Bronte's novel. It is not the most reasonable for contemporary public. But in obvious sense it is ...perfect. For something who escapes to a clear definition. It is the performance of Flora Robson or the too sweet music or the loo of Laurence Olivier or the feel to be only a precise resume. That is not important. Clear remains just the emotion when you see it again. Not exactly as a show. But as the meeting with the essence of one of the most admirable modern novels.".

And for a long time I saw Vivien Leigh as the ideal Cathy Lindon. But  after decades I understand than the work of Merle Oberon is more than inspired. Yes it is not exactly the best version of Emily Bronte's novel. It is not the most reasonable for contemporary public. But in obvious sense it is ...perfect. For something who escapes to a clear definition. It is the performance of Flora Robson or the too sweet music or the loo of Laurence Olivier or the feel to be only a precise resume. That is not important. Clear remains just the emotion when you see it again. Not exactly as a show. But as the meeting with the essence of one of the most admirable modern novels.";

	schema:reviewBody "I still think this is the best adaptation of Bronte's novel out of the gozillion remakes out there. This one has so much intensity and heart. The performances are just incredible. The music is incredible. The cinematography is absolutely magical! And of course the direction is first rate.I won't recap the story since many here have already done that but I will tell you that this version is heads  shoulders above the rest. Movies do imitate life and in parallel to that imitation this movie is filled with moments that are absolutely unforgettable. This is due to the actors everyone in this movie is first rate. All the supporting roles Geraldine Fitzgerald Donald Crisp Leo Carroll Flora Robson David Niven are all seamlessly committed to their roles in a way that makes watching them vicariously enjoyable. Even the children that play the leads in their youth are incredibly good!The leads played by Oberon  Olivier are so well matched you'd believe they were really in love. They have a chemistry and an intensity that makes you believe in them. After all this story is one which does require some suspension of disbelief but the artistry of Oberon  Olivier make it easy and quite frankly unnoticeable. One of my favorite things that no remake can compete with is the score by Alfred Newman. His light and joyful children's theme and the brooding themes are so organic and seem come from the action in the film. But probably the most memorable is Cathy's theme. It defines the love of Cathy in the movie in musical terms. It is as they say the language of the soul in this movie.The beautiful cinematography by Gregg Toland is absolutely RADIANT. Despite a dark story full of longing angst and pain his radiant cinematography illuminates the faces of the actors in a way that is almost supernatural. In fact the scene where Cathy turns to Ellen and says Ellen I AM Heathcliff! with the lightening in the background actually does seem almost supernatural! In the scene with the ball the skin of the actors seems to reflect light in a way that is bewitching and fascinating. The jewels the ladies where look more like they're under a jeweler's light than just things hanging off the necks of actresses. Somehow his cinematography has a clean crispness that I've seen in very few black  white movies. I have to say his work in this movie is another reason I prefer this to any version in color. William Wyler's direction is spoton as well. He tells the story as much with the choices of camera angles as the screenwriter. Each frame is composed in such an artistic way yet not in a way that you notice. I have noticed due to repeated viewings but the fact is this movie comes off as almost voyeuristic. We watch almost as if we were eavesdropping on the lives of these people. Like any great movie it pulls you in  holds you. While I realize having read the book myself that this isn't the most complete adaptation it is the one that moves me the most. That's part of why we go to the movies to feel  and as someone once said in a movie to know we're not alone. 5 out of 4 stars!!!!!!! ".

This is a morbid and sleazy story about a group of sick and sadomasochistic people with the accent on two repulsive selfish persons who by their selfishness stupidity and immaturity destroy lives not only for themselves but to everyone else around them and pretty much intentionally. And after all the crap they put us through I should feel sad for them?! The last scene should be romantic happysad end?! Ew!

	schema:reviewBody "The relationship between literature and cinema has mostly been an antagonistic one  look how up in arms Lord of the Rings purists got about Peter Jackson's films. The antagonism runs doubly deep when the source novel is an untouchable classic. Gone with the Wind will always be a better known as a film than a book and noone really cares how faithful an adaptation it was. However Wuthering Heights like Lord of the Rings will always be a bigger novel than a picture and therefore it's bound to be picked at.Nevertheless contrary to my fellow IMDb commentwriter Ted G's statement Books are from Mars films are from Venus the two media have more in common than meets the eye. Both are capable of absolutely drawing your attention to what is necessary. For example books will have a detailed description of an object or a person films will have closeups. Books will tell you what a character sees films will have a pointofview shot. Both can instantly change focus and show you something different with a new paragraph or a cut. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is that films are meant to be enjoyed in a single sitting books are not. For this reason cinema adaptations of novels are almost always truncated.Hecht and MacArthur's screenplay happens to be a particularly fine example of truncation without watering down. It reduces Bronte's story to its barest bones but rather than simply cutting nonessential scenes or shortening scenes which would make it seem bitty and hurried it condenses phases of the story into single scenes or sequences. Hindley's domination of Heathcliff Heathcliff and Cathy's continued romance and their trespass on the Lynton estate are events which unfold gradually in the novel but here they are turned into a series of consecutive events taking place on the same day each dovetailing into the next. No screen time is wasted on dozens of small scenes  each idea and each plot turn is succinctly presented and the whole thing still has flow.A slightly older and far more hostile rivalry is that between cinema and theatre. And in spite of the similarity that both are storytelling through acting performance the way they present story is very different. Unlike films and books stage productions have far less choice in how they show a scene. The angle you get varies depending on whereabouts in the audience you sit. There are no closeups no long shots no cuts that instantly take you to a new place or time. This is not to write theatre off as a storytelling medium just to highlight the different way in which it has to do its job.Of course Wuthering Heights is not well known as stage play although it has been done but there is relevance to this particular version. The way actors must perform on the stage is different to how they can perform on the screen. On stage your voice and movement must be just as perceptible to those in the back seats as to those in the front row. Cinema on the other hand can make a whisper loud or home you in on the tiniest gesture. Laurence Olivier credits Wuthering Heights as the picture which taught him to act for the screen and it was director William Wyler who brought him to come down to earth.A story goes that Wyler invited him round for dinner one evening after a particularly tense week of filming. Making reference to Olivier's belief that Shakespeare could never work on screen because the shot is too big for the cannon Wyler told Olivier to drop his stagesnobbery saying there is nothing cinema cannot do so long as it is done properly. This little speech tells you a lot about Wyler as a director. He was not an egotist but he believed totally in cinema. His pictures are not overloaded with showy technique but he uses simple and subtle cinematic methods to show the actors to the greatest benefit of the performance and the story.Here's an example from the opening scenes. In the book the first few chapters are narrated from Lockwood's perspective  it isn't important to flesh him out as a character he merely has to exist so that the story can be seen through his eyes. In the picture Wyler doesn't allow us to focus too much on his face but really forces us to take notice of Laurence Olivier. When Olivier turfs Lockwood out of Cathy's room the camera is behind Lockwood''s shoulder  we don't need to see his reaction but we must become totally absorbed in Olivier's performance. You couldn't do that on a stage. To adapt a book into film you may need to change the structure but you can still preserve the same focuses on character and action. To adapt a play into a film you could keep every line of every scene intact but you would need to rethink the way the scenes are shown potentially a more drastic change.I've just got room for a couple of honourable mentions. First is Greg Toland's cinematography. In those atmospheric opening scenes he perfectly shrouds the outlying areas of the screen in darkness making the house appear confined and squalid. We later see some of the best blackandwhite outdoor photography of any picture. Second is Geraldine Fitzgerald's performance as Isabella. She is largely forgotten today and she didn't have a particularly prolific motion picture career but she was very good. Her finest moment is her argument with Cathy. Watch as Merle Oberon slaps her in the face  there is absolutely no break in the intensity of her performance.By the way Ted if you read this I enjoy your comments and I'm sure we would agree on a lot of things. Still books are from earth films are from earth and the gulf isn't all that wide.".

Laurence Olivier credits Wuthering Heights as the picture which taught him to act for the screen and it was director William Wyler who brought him to come down to earth.A story goes that Wyler invited him round for dinner one evening after a particularly tense week of filming. Making reference to Olivier's belief that Shakespeare could never work on screen because the shot is too big for the cannon Wyler told Olivier to drop his stagesnobbery saying there is nothing cinema cannot do so long as it is done properly. This little speech tells you a lot about Wyler as a director. He was not an egotist but he believed totally in cinema. His pictures are not overloaded with showy technique but he uses simple and subtle cinematic methods to show the actors to the greatest benefit of the performance and the story.Here's an example from the opening scenes. In the book the first few chapters are narrated from Lockwood's perspective  it isn't important to flesh him out as a character he merely has to exist so that the story can be seen through his eyes. In the picture Wyler doesn't allow us to focus too much on his face but really forces us to take notice of Laurence Olivier. When Olivier turfs Lockwood out of Cathy's room the camera is behind Lockwood''s shoulder  we don't need to see his reaction but we must become totally absorbed in Olivier's performance. You couldn't do that on a stage. To adapt a book into film you may need to change the structure but you can still preserve the same focuses on character and action. To adapt a play into a film you could keep every line of every scene intact but you would need to rethink the way the scenes are shown potentially a more drastic change.I've just got room for a couple of honourable mentions. First is Greg Toland's cinematography. In those atmospheric opening scenes he perfectly shrouds the outlying areas of the screen in darkness making the house appear confined and squalid. We later see some of the best blackandwhite outdoor photography of any picture. Second is Geraldine Fitzgerald's performance as Isabella. She is largely forgotten today and she didn't have a particularly prolific motion picture career but she was very good. Her finest moment is her argument with Cathy. Watch as Merle Oberon slaps her in the face  there is absolutely no break in the intensity of her performance.By the way Ted if you read this I enjoy your comments and I'm sure we would agree on a lot of things. Still books are from earth films are from earth and the gulf isn't all that wide.";

Quite possibly.The film was in part conceived as a vehicle for Christopher Lee to get away from his Hammer roles and give him a chance to demonstrate that yes he could actually act. Perversely however the film is in many ways homage to the films produced by the Hammer studio and is at the same time their antithesis.Although Lee's Lord Summerisle was certainly a stronger character than his Hammer caricatures and was suitably sincere and sinister it was left to Edward Woodward's bumbling pious Highland Police Sergeant to carry the film.The rest of the cast are not as strong as the two central characters. Famously it was always suggested that Britt Ekland's voice was overdubbed for the entire film. Robin Hardy has now denied that stating that only her singing was dubbed. Even if the other actors' performances fail to match those of Woodward and Lee somehow it doesn't detract from the film.Almost as famous as The Wicker Man itself are the stories surrounding the film. The version first released was almost completely butchered from an original almost grandiose cut of 102 minutes to a more concise 87. Christopher Lee has always maintained that this was a crime against the greatest piece of art with which he had ever been involved. The original negatives were then accidentally thrown out!When a fuller version finally surfaced in 2001 Lee's contentions were at least in part proved. The film was overall improved and save for a couple of points of rather clumsy editing the flashbacks Edward Woodward has as the penny drops spring to mind and the pointless scenes before the flight to the island it ran more smoothly and made more sense.The film's greatest asset comes through in whichever version you actually see. The eerie sinister atmosphere never fails to be conveyed. Somehow the fictitious Scottish island setting of Summerisle which could so easily turn twee at any moment steers clear of the territory occupied by Brigadoon or the now happily deceased BBC TV drama 'Monarch of the Glen'.The setting's remoteness which could have been its worst enemy is actually its greatest ally.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film however is the way that it steadfastly refuses to fit precisely into any genre. It is all at once a horror a thriller and even a musical! Unbelievably these things come together and fit into the film.The music in The Wicker Man is unique always adding just the right tone of eeriness or bawdiness to proceedings. A strange mix of elements including traditional folk music it's as innovative and interesting as the soundtracks to Blade Runner or The Virgin Suicides. The opening title sequence to the tune of Corn Rigs succeeds in transporting you with the plane over the remote coastal peninsulas and out into the Irish Sea towards Summerisle.My only criticism of the film and I really am nitpicking here is the way it goes about establishing Sergeant Howie's Christianity. I can't conceive of the Howie character adhering to any religion other than one of the obscure forms of Presbyterian Protestantism practised in parts of the Highlands of Scotland. These scenes contain an apparent reverence for the sacraments that appears more Catholic in nature. This distinction in religious backgrounds is important to understanding Howie's attitudes. Nevertheless I am truly nitpicking when I make this criticism!But what ultimately makes this film is its ending. Without giving the game away for those who have not yet seen the film it is inevitable and yet wholly unexpected when it finally comes.The Wicker Man would be a classic of its genre  if it had a genre. Instead it has to be ranked as a classic film.".

However the entire population of the island including the girl's own mother Irene Summers denies that such a girl ever existed and as the righteous Howie investigates further he learns the terrifying truth of Summerisle. Famed for an exceptional yet short performance from the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle The Wicker Man' is a textbook example of how to create a virtually seamless horrorthriller. Director Robin Hardy at one point thought this lowbudget movie would never be made as he was forced to work with a very small budget a short shooting schedule and a studio on the verge of bankruptcy that was in fact declared bankrupt just a few short months after filming was completed. However The Wicker Man' was made and nowadays is accepted as one of the finest horrorthrillers of alltime despite not receiving the praise it so deserved back in the Seventies. The Wicker Man' was brilliantly written by Anthony Shaffer who chose to add very subtle clues as to what would happen that are made more apparent on further viewings. With the added advantage of obvious research into the pagan rituals The Wicker Man' sought to portray the movie is left with a chilling feel of realism. An enchanting soundtrack is blended marvellously into The Wicker Man' which seems to lull the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the constant foreboding feeling created by the intricate plot and top notch acting there is a certain playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it difficult to actually envisage any evil events occuring. One could be forgiven for wondering on a first viewing just where this bizarre little movie is going but the story has a quality about it that can grab the viewer and keep their interest all the way to the bitter and awfully haunting ending. The final scene as the credits roll is an image that is now engrained on my mind with all its emptiness and despair. As the curtain falls on this performance so to speak it becomes hard not to question the events leading up to the end and the humanity of these islanders. In some ways The Wicker Man' is an unsettling history lesson that makes itself seem all too real. Edward Woodward gives a tremendous performance as the increasingly baffled Sgt. Howie. He played his character convincingly and Howie's eventual realisation of what is going on around him is portrayed so well that it adds more realism to the movie. Woodward was able to take a character that may be a figure of loathing in another type of horror movie and make the audience feel empathy towards him. The strong religious beliefs within Howie thoroughly clash with the freeloving pagan society which adds humour and distress at the same time. However as mentioned before Christopher Lee somehow stole the show playing the relatively small part of Lord Summerisle. His magnificent onscreen presence seems so powerful that one forgets that he is only in the movie for a short amount of time. Added to this great mix was Britt Ekland as Willow the beautiful landlord's daughter. Her seductive nude dance though a double was apparently used in parts was one of the most erotic moments in horror and helped to contribute further realism to the movie. The scenes featuring the clashing characters of Howie and Willow are both amusing and tense making for some interesting character interaction. The Wicker Man' is undoubtedly a cult classic of the horror genre which I recommend to all fans of horrorthrillers. Visually pleasing with some superb acting and direction as well as a fine screenplay. My rating for The Wicker Man'  910.".

A classic of its kind it deserves the rerelease it will probably never get.Superficially a mystery thriller this intelligent and well researched story delves into the beliefs and rituals of Ancient Britain its folk mythologies and music and reveals some of the unsettling fears that lie at their root.  Set on a remote Scottish Island and giving the appearance of being a Whisky Galore Local Hero type community there is yet something offcentre about the townspeople that Edward Woodward as Sergeant Howie has come to investigate.  The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent commanding Lord of the Isle gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall.  He is perfect in the role.The story unfolds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby as the dogged Howie gets led all over town up one blind alley and down another.  Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on but we don't heed them.  Until it's too late.  Too late to walk away.The standard video version runs for 85 minutes cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence.  A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes.  The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.However whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film.  See it yourself and you too will have many meetings with 'The Wicker Man' in your dreams in the dark where you cannot escape.".

The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent commanding Lord of the Isle gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall.  He is perfect in the role.The story unfolds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby as the dogged Howie gets led all over town up one blind alley and down another.  Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on but we don't heed them.  Until it's too late.  Too late to walk away.The standard video version runs for 85 minutes cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence.  A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes.  The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.However whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film.  See it yourself and you too will have many meetings with 'The Wicker Man' in your dreams in the dark where you cannot escape.";

The May Day Festival is a throwback to pagan rites of a thousand years ago a bit of which continues today in Morris dancing and are a highlight of this film. The bizarre procession to the sea to offer sacrifices to the sea gods and sun god is historically accurate and sets up a surprise ending not to be forgotten.Woodward is splendid as the pompous officer who clings to his religion. Lee is terrific as the eccentric lord. Cilento is a hoot as the teacher. Britt Ekland is the landlord's daughter Willow and Ingrid Pitt is the librarian. Blending folk and Enyalike music by Paul Giovanni director Robin Hardy creates a bawdy pagan world in the midst of the 20th century. The Celtic symbolism Nuada the Sun God is beautiful and helps set the tone.A visual treat with great music this film really gives the viewer something to think about. Highly recommended.".

There's a cover up to the girls whereabouts by the entire community and he finds himself equally appalled by their freeliving lifestyle...simple pleasures which include drinkin' singin' swingin' sex...and pagan human sacrifice. The title refers to a giant wooden idol necessary for climactic May Day ceremony.THE WICKER MAN opens fairly slowly and some complain it has too many musical numbers but after the first pub scene it becomes suspenseful creepy without a stitch of violence and brilliantly atmospheric creating a seemingly authentic and unusual society not dependent on standard moral or religious codes. It's safe to say that the strong and unflinching religious subject matter in this film carries with it the potential to infuriate Christians and Catholics. It's also extremely ironic that this same closeminded worldview is perfectly reflected in the bullheaded lead character and also helps to seal his fate. Not that the pagans in this film aren't equally unwavering in their beliefs but the power of in numbers philosophy rings true here. Imagine a small place in this world NOT adversely affected by standard organized religion and you get the gist of Summerisle.If you want gore you won't find any here. If you can't go into this film with an open mind you simply won't appreciate what it has to offer. And if you are looking for a standard horror film you may be disappointed or you may be like me and be pleasantly surprised. The ending is simultaneously chilling and oddly amusing. Both Woodward and Christopher Lee with great hair as Lord Summerisle are excellent in their roles.Much censored over the years try to avoid any version running under 94 minutes. Score 9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " The most original and haunting British horror movie EVER. Fascinating chilling and utterly unique.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been fascinated by 'The Wicker Man' ever since I first saw it on TV in the late 1970s. I was very young then and probably didn't completely understand it but I knew immediately that it was a very special movie unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Twenty five years and literally thousands of movies later I think even more highly of it especially now that I'm able to see the cut available on the 30th Anniversary DVD which is over fifteen minutes longer than the version I already own on video. And yes 'The Wicker Man' is still unlike any other movie I've ever seen. I think this is mainly down to the brilliant script by Anthony Shaffer who also wrote 'Sleuth' and Hitchcock's 'Frenzy'. There hasn't been anything made remotely like it since.  I think it's the greatest British horror movie ever made but the description horror only gives you half the story. It's also a thriller a mystery a Christian morality tale and in a weird way a musical. Christopher Lee regards it as the best movie he's ever been involved with and describes it as one of the three or four greatest movies ever made in Britain and I agree with him. Lee is very good in the movie as the enigmatic Lord Summerisle but Edward Woodward is the real star. Woodward is best know for his TV work as either 'Callan' or 'The Equalizer' depending what generation you're from but he's superb as the deeply religious Sgt. Howie. Apparently Peter Cushing was initially suggested for the role as was Michael York but I really can't imagine either of then being half as good as Woodward is. The supporting cast are all superb  Diane Cilento as the school teacher famous mime Lindsay Kemp as the publican and especially Britt Ekland as the publican's daughter Willow. Ekland's seduction dance scene is the second most famous scene in the movie. She claims her speaking voice was dubbed throughout  director Robin Hardy disputes this though her singing voice certainly was and she used a ahem butt double. I also get a kick out of Aubrey Morris' graveyard scene. Morris is a great Brit character actor and was also in 'A Clockwork Orange' Hammer's 'Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' and sci fi trash classic 'Lifeforce'. Another Hammer alumni Ingrid Pitt 'The Vampire Lovers' 'Countess Dracula' etc. is also in the cast as a librarian but sadly in underused. Still I'm glad she was involved. Inexplicably some people seem to hate this movie. I can't for the life of me understand why. It's utterly brilliant utterly unique and I never tire of watching it. If you've never seen it before I envy you! It's a cliche but believe me you have never seen anything like it before!".

When he gets there it seems no one has ever heard of her...and most say she never existed. He continues to search and the mystery gets deeper and deeper leading up to a very disturbing conclusion.I saw this during it's theatrical reissue in 1980it was the cut 88 minute version. I was disappointed. It was advertised as a horror film and the edited version leaves gaping plot holes. I just saw the extended version on the DVD and loved it!For one thing as I said it is NOT a horror film. I went in expecting that and didn't get it. It's actually a thriller with strong religious and sexual overtures. There's WAY too much to get into about the religious views in this film and the sexual element is STRONG! There's a whole circle of nude young women dancing around a fire and an exceptional sequence in which a very erotic song is sung by a nude Britt Ekland. The mystery itself is fascinating but I really got caught up in the religious and social aspects presented in this film. Credit writer Anthony Shaffer for his script.Also the acting is great on all counts. Woodward deserves credit for playing such an unlikable characterand STILL getting you to sympathize with him! Also Hammer stars Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt whose part is brutally reduced in the short version are just great! For one thing it's interesting to see them playing fairly normal people instead of vampires and they give out excellent performances. Lee especially is enjoying himselfhe did the film for free! To this day he said it's his best moviehe's right.An excellent haunting thriller but it might be too much for some people. There's next to no blood or violence but I do know some people who just found the ending a bit too much to handle. Still it's a definite mustsee.A deserved cult classic.".

I think this gives the film its unique feel and is the reason I love watching it.  The ending is a surprise the first time you see the film but it still shocks after many viewings too.  I don't agree with the comments on here about the music it is just another of the quirks that gives the film atmosphere.  'Willow's Song' is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written and has been recently recorded by 'The Doves.' And yes that is my favourite scene in the movie.  Britt can dance outside my door anytime.  Mmmmm.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drawn to a small Scottish Island by a letter pleading for help in finding a kidnapped girl Sergeant Neil Howie realises that things are very different from life on the mainland.  He begins to suspect that Rowan's disappearance may be part of a ritual to appease the nature gods worshipped on the island.Well known now as one of the best British horror cult movies one critic called it the Citizen Kane of British horror' this film still stands today as new generations discover it's ending and fall in love with that.  Sadly most people know the ending before they have actually seen the film which in my mind greatly takes away from the film's impact.  For that reason I will make no mention of the ending's detail suffice to say that it works very well and actually raises the rest of the film.The main body of the film sees Howie hunting for the missing girl and finding that things are not as simply as he originally thinks.  The film comes across as a sort of spiritual musical for the most part and doesn't really bring out the tension or suspicions until near the end.  The downside of this is that parts of the film appear slightly dull or meandering.  I did get a little tired with the overuse of naturalist religious images but I accept that they were necessary for the story to be built.The cast are very good.  Lee was happy to do a film that brought him away from the camp Hammer horror mould into which he had been set.  His Lord Summerisle is an image of cold religious zealotry  terrifying in his portrayal of evil as part of the right thing'.  Woodward is also cast against type as he was a harder man in much of his work rather than a pure upright type.  Ekland is good but is dubbed the whole way through the film to give her a Scottish accent in place of her own distinctive Swedish one. Of the cast it is Lee and Woodard who carry the film  their scenes together work well and they also carry the opposing moral weights of the story.Overall this is a film that has had a reputation built on it's ending and for that it is well deserved.  However for the majority of the film the pacing is a little off and I felt that the songs slowed the film down too much.  Overall the film works due to it's setup and payoff however it's delivery as a total film is not as good as it's reputation would have you believe.".

And regardless of the number of times I've seen The Wicker Man that final scene has lost none of its power. The images of Sergeant Howie being led off to face his destiny are some of the best I've seen in any movie. It's the kind of moment that you don't easily forget. As I said it's powerful stuff.I just checked to see who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1971. Don't misunderstand because Gene Hackman is good in The French Connection but there are very few performances that I feel compare with Edward Woodward in The Wicker Man. People in movies like The Wicker Man don't generally get recognized for awards but they should. It's a fantastic performance. Every moment whether it's what I call The Seduction of Sgt. Howie to The Indignation of Sgt. Howie to The Martyrdom of Sgt. Howie Woodward expresses more emotion and conveys more feeling than most actors are capable of. Whether you like the character or not it would be difficult to deny how effective Woodward is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers...Anyone reading the various posts on the comments page can read the plot so I won't bother with that...Instead what I have to note about people's views on The Wicker Man in general as well as on IMDb is that the film is so easily misunderstood. At face value I can understand that people are disappointed with what they presumably expected to be a straight horror film. However this film is the best kind of film... a 'grower' one that the more you delve into it and learn about it sucks you in and enthralls you more and more. It's true that the film suffered many set backs during both production and postproduction for instance attempting to shoot a film about the may day festival in the middle of Autumn  a lot of the tree blossoms in the film had to be 'stuck on' but it's this which gives it that unfulfilled potential and quirky charm that allows it a cult status. The script is brilliant and the acting Britt Ekland aside is valiant especially considering most of the locals were indeed actual untrained locals. It really is Christopher Lee's best role he delights in mocking his own previous roles whilst delivering an all together more sophisticated performance than in any of those hammer horror parts.In fact The Wicker Man is mislabeled as a 'horror' film it's unclassifiable why people are so obsessed with trying to classify it I have no idea... its more like a play than a film really but then what would you expect from the writer of Sleuth?What really gets me however about the film which so many people seem to miss or choose to miss is that its a perfect satire of the time it was made. Depending on which side of the fence they fall people seem to disagree upon whether the islanders are the good guys or Sgt. Howie is whether it is a film celebrating Christianity or paganism. Truth is and the point is its neither.The early seventies post summer of love hippy revolution etc. was a time of increased freedom of thought and action all over the world especially in the USA and Europe. More and more people at this time were rejecting Christianity and I guess what you could call 'orthodox' religion. The seventies saw a significant rise in the number of people dabbling in what they would call Pagan spirituality although I'm sure true pagans would complain that they were merely following a trend and had no true belief at all as a opposed to that of God. Personally I'm an agnostic and do not like to judge any followers of any kind of faith but this whole film is a well constructed diatribe about the follies of any kind of organised worship. The whole movie is peppered with endless similarities between the pagan worship and that of Christianity. Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle is constantly pointing these out to Edward Woodward. It's Howie's closed mindedness and complete rejection of the Islanders right to a different faith that leads to his doom however as he learns from Lord Summerisle himself the only reason the pagans worship so on the island is because his late great grandfather used it as a way of controlling the workers that first lived there. The reason for the bountiful fruit crops growing on Summerisle is down to volcanic soil on the island the pagan religion was merely carried on as a kind of tradition. At the end SPOILER WARNING... Howie shouts something along the lines of to SummerisleWhat will happen if the crops fail again this year? They'll have to use the next best sacrifice and only the Lord of Summerisle himself will do...pointing out that Summerisle's lie will end up with his own demise. The point of view of the film is that rejecting one faith and merely replacing it with a closed minded fanaticism of another however different makes you just as chained and no gives you no more freedom of thought or action.The screenplay is wonderful detailed and purposefully leaves you at odds as to who's side you should be on. As in life it's not a clear cut affair. Still amazing film and I personally wouldn't want it to be perfect because discovering it laughing along with it and at it and being chilled by is all part of its charm.".

Whats the chances of that ? and as said how would the islanders know in the first place ?  It also ignores other logical things like wont Sgt Howie be missed if hes sacraficed ? and is it fair to assume the police will investigate the contents of an anonymous letter ? It also seems to ignore police procedure . Wouldnt CID lead the investigation for a missing child  and dont policemen travel in pairs ? Its rather a clever idea of a character being killed because theyre a virgin but not if its to the detriment of the rest of the story Theres other things that annoyed me . If this is a totally isolated Scottish island untouched by modern society then the inhabitants will be Celts  but are their pagan based ideals truly Celtic ? Doesnt the English West country have may poles ? If so then surely people from the West country cant have anything in common with these islanders who have a different cultural background ? The philosophy seen here is more new ageism than Celtic so is there any point of setting it on a remote Scottish island ? Its also obvious that this has been happening for years . Does that mean theyve been writing to police stations on the mainland for years and the cops have been sending them virgins ? I cant escape from this ridiculous premise no matter how hard I try I dont know if its the fault of the production or if channel 4 used a bad print but everything on screen seems very cheap and badly edited as the camera jumps around from scene to scene . The sound editing is very poor but listening to the songs I cant say Im complaining and I feel I should point out to anyone thinking of hiring Britt Ekland that if theyre using a stand in can they please use someone who has a vague passing resemblance to her  you know someone with blonde hair might be start . I know Christopher Lee said pre LORD OF THE RINGS that this is the best movie he ever appeared in  but can anyone name me a good film starring Lee where he doesnt use the words  Gandalf  or  Mordor  ?THE WICKER MAN gets two out of ten".

I'm bewildered as to how anyone can like this movie. I'm even more confused as to how anyone can see the original as being all that different from the remake. The only differences I can see are worse acting worse cinematography forgivable due to the era slower development and lots of unnecessary singing and naked women. Not that I'm complaining about the naked women.Like the remake the resolution had nothing to do with the story leading up to it. It's a formula for nonsense. Surprise everything we've been showing you up until now meant nothing. Here's the real story which we'll tell you in the last 20 minutes of the movie. Sorry to make you sit through the rest but we had nothing better to do and hopefully you didn't either. Similarly we hope you didn't invest too much thought in the useless clues we provided to the mystery that wasn't there. If this film deserves any credit at all it's for an underlying metaphor that puts the viewer in the very same emotional state as the main character. The viewer suffers the same frustration the main character feels only my feeling was because the movie dragged on for so long asking more and more intriguing questions and culminating in a climax that didn't answer any of them since of course there was in actuality nothing to answer. It was just an act a way of tricking the main character and the audience into visiting a strange place that neither of us should ever have wasted our time with. When the villagers were all laughing as the man burned I felt like I was the man getting laughed at by the movie for being deceived. And now it's too late. We're both in pain him for being on fire and me for having invested my time and thought in this movie both begging pathetically for salvation from our respective unsolvable conundrums. Perhaps that metaphor itself was the point of the movie and if that's the case then it has succeeded in annoying me. If there was some other point then I seem to have missed it.".

Sorry to make you sit through the rest but we had nothing better to do and hopefully you didn't either. Similarly we hope you didn't invest too much thought in the useless clues we provided to the mystery that wasn't there. If this film deserves any credit at all it's for an underlying metaphor that puts the viewer in the very same emotional state as the main character. The viewer suffers the same frustration the main character feels only my feeling was because the movie dragged on for so long asking more and more intriguing questions and culminating in a climax that didn't answer any of them since of course there was in actuality nothing to answer. It was just an act a way of tricking the main character and the audience into visiting a strange place that neither of us should ever have wasted our time with. When the villagers were all laughing as the man burned I felt like I was the man getting laughed at by the movie for being deceived. And now it's too late. We're both in pain him for being on fire and me for having invested my time and thought in this movie both begging pathetically for salvation from our respective unsolvable conundrums. Perhaps that metaphor itself was the point of the movie and if that's the case then it has succeeded in annoying me. If there was some other point then I seem to have missed it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although The Wicker Man is sometimes classified as a horror film it starts off like a standard police detective drama. Neil Howie a sergeant with the West Highland Constabulary arrives on Summerisle a small Hebridean island to investigate the case of a young girl named Rowan Morrison who has been reported as missing. To his surprise however the local people prove to be unhelpful to him in his search either evading his questions or deliberately misleading him. An even greater surprise to Howie is the discovery he makes about the religious beliefs of the locals. They have abandoned Christianity and encouraged by Lord Summerisle the local laird adopted a form of paganism. Howie starts to suspect that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice to the island's pagan gods.The film raises some interesting philosophical issues about the nature of religious belief. Howie is a devout Christian and is shocked by the paganism of the islanders. He is shocked partly by their open attitude to sex which conflicts with his own puritanical views but mostly by their callousness about human life. Although the film was made in the hippy era of the early seventies with its growing interest in alternative forms of religion it is not a celebration of paganism. The faith of the islanders is not a benign natureworship but rather a cruel superstitious mechanistic fertility cult devoid of any genuine spirituality.The view one takes of the religious issues raised by the film will probably depend upon one's own religious views and also upon how one sees the ambiguous character of Howie. On the one hand he comes across as deeply unsympathetic narrowminded dogmatic and priggish. On the other he is the only representative we see not only of law and order but also of decency and morality. He may be a prig but he is also the only character in the film who objects to human sacrifice on moral grounds. It seems to me that two quite different interpretations of the film are possible. On the one hand it could be seen as a humanist critique of religion. On this reading Howie's Christianity could be seen as merely a watereddown variety of the islanders' fierce paganism more socially respectable but no more rational. When Howie challenges him about his beliefs Lord Summerisle retorts with some sharp comments about the Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth.On the other hand it would be possible to see this as a Christian film an exemplification of Chesterton's dictum that when men cease to believe in God they will not believe in nothing they will believe in anything. Summerisle and his followers do not merely reject Christianity they also reject the entire rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment. They believe that human sacrifice will ensure the success of their harvests and that illnesses can be cured by placing a toad in the sufferer's mouth. Howie stands not only for orthodox theology but also for orthodox science. Religion and science are sometimes portrayed as being in conflict but it can also be argued that science has had a beneficent effect upon religion by removing material affairs such as the cure of the sick and the fertility of the soil from the hands of priests and shamans and entrusting them to doctors and agronomists it has freed contemporary Christianity from these concerns and enabled it to concentrate more on spiritual matters.I normally like films that tackle weighty themes and ask difficult questions without necessarily providing easy answers so I am disappointed that I did not like The Wicker Man more. It seems unfortunate that so many versions exist I have seen two on British television both different from one another and neither the full director's cut. I will therefore reserve my comments on the direction until I have seen the definitive version but neither of the versions I have seen flowed easily. The famous ending is genuinely shocking as Goya said the sleep of reason produces monsters but what leads up to it does not always tell the story with any fluency.The acting was too often wooden and lifeless. In the case of Edward Woodward as Howie this was presumably deliberate as his character is supposed to be a stiff formal individual who finds it difficult to show emotion but none of the other characters seemed any more animated. Christopher Lee as Summerisle had too much of the urbane British gentleman about him and not enough of the religious fanatic. The worst contribution came from Britt Ekland who wandered through the film as though she did not know what she was doing in it. Come to that I wasn't sure what she was doing either. A body double was used for her dance scene her singing voice was dubbed and according to some accounts her speaking voice was too apparently because she could not manage a convincing Scottish accent. She was presumably only hired because the filmmakers thought that to have a glamorous international star in the castlist would be good for the takings at the boxoffice.Despite these weaknesses the film is often thoughtprovoking and there is enough of interest to make it worth watching. 610".

This could turn out to be a good thing because my original feeling for it was what the hell was all the fuss about and after finding out that yes I had seen the original uncut version my confusion deepened.Well it's been eight months or so since then and the thing's crept into my consciousness. Repeated viewings have had exactly the same effect they had with Argento's masterpiece Suspiria to witviewing 1 what the hell was all the fuss about? viewing 2 I can see where there are some points made and subtexts in this film that would greatly appeal to the people who held this thing up in such high regard to me and Ed Woodward and Chris Lee are very fine actors and Britt Ekland unclothed is always worthwhile but it's still kind of forgive the pun wooden. viewing 3 My god this is a profound film. viewing 4 Why hasn't the rest of the world clued into how great this is? Probably because it was so badly mangled in its original release that it left a bad taste in the mouths of many from what I've been told.This film was the directorial debut of Robin Hardy who has since gone on to direct only one other film and a few episodes of a TV series read mysterious shadowy figure. It was the brainchild of Anthony Shaffer a name that should be well known to all film buffs Frenzy Sleuth Death on the Nile Sommersby et al.. It stars Edward Woodward already a veteran TV actor by the early seventies as the uptight Sergeant Howie a Scottish constable who decides to investigate an anonymous tipoff that a thirteenyearold girl named Rowan Morrison has been abducted on a small island famous for its apples. Howie's nemesis Lord Summerisle Christopher Lee looking surprisingly young given that he was over fifty when he played this role flits in and out of the film dropping hints that all is not perhaps as it seems but offering all the help he can given that Howie doesn't seem to understand that police procedure doesn't have to go by the book. After all you can only offer someone so much help if he doesn't see where you're going with it.Yes there are a lot of things about this film on the surface that could have been done better. It was obviously made on a shoestring budget that didn't have room for a Steadicam or topquality film. Unfortunately that leads to unconscious links about other things in the film that are supposed to look primitive the islanders' costumes for the Mayday celebration for example and the firsttime viewer tends to knock the film for things that should be praised because of it.As for the content of the film itself the acting is as one would expect from names like Woodward Lee and Ekland easily above average. The plot moves along quite effortlessly and the underlying subtext while strongly presented never gets in the way of a bangup mystery and while the ending becomes somewhat obvious about twothirds of the way through the film by then you've realized that the resolution to the mystery isn't what this film is about at all and you or at least I become willing to cut Shaffer and Hardy a lot of slack. The scenery and no you dirtyminded little nappers I'm not talking about Britt Ekland's infamous naked dance is breathtaking from the opening credits panning over Howie's district to the very end. But you're saying all of these things are true about many other films that have probably been forgotten thirty years after they were made. True. And what keeps The Wicker Man firmly entrenched in the heads of so many I'd warrant is the gorgeous and profoundly influential soundtrack to this film. The main theme which is untitled but for years I've heard it referred to as The Wicker Man Song Sneaker Pimps released a version of it in 1997 with the title How Do is rapidly becoming one of the world's most covered songs and all the songs in the film are extremely well executed. Also in the mysterious shadowy figure vein composer Paul Giovanni never scored another film. I've no idea whether these songs were written especially for the film or whether they're traditional and I can't find a single Internet resource capable of telling me but this film is worth buying simply for the music. The rest will come to you. Trust me on this. Christopher Lee who holds the record of having been in more films than anyone else ever! considers The Wicker Man his finest work. I haven't seen everything Christopher Lee's ever been in I'm not sure there's a living soul aside from Lee himself who has! but I'd have to agree with him based on what I've seen. Once The Wicker Man has you it has you for life.  12Note the film has presently been verified in release in three versions 87 minutes 95 minutes and 102 minutes with the 102 minute version considered the uncut version which is selling for close to 100 in many places. Don't believe the hype I got mine for 12 on ebay. It is rumored that a full version of the film which runs 122 minutes DOES exist somewhere and has never been released.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a distinct air of menace flowing throughout The Wicker Man a distinct feeling of unwelcome and unkind put across in the most brilliant of manners because everyone acts so nicely. Then there is the awful feeling you get at certain points when you realise the character of Sergeant Howie Woodward is in actual fact a policeman and what might happen if he hadn't been. The Wicker Man is really a mere exercise in suspense on the surface but I think it toys with other more political ideas during the core of the film before substituting everything and just focussing very briefly on the religious aspects it raises.For Sergeant Howie he is bordering on the ultimate fishoutofwater. Howie may be British and may well still be in Britain but that does not exclude him from the fishoutofwater treatment that other film characters get when they are in that respective situation see Doyle in 'French Connection II' and Neo in 'The Matrix' among many other examples. Howie is a man of pride a man with ideas discipline and rules and regulations he likes to stand by. He is a thorough man and this is partly his downfall since it is this case that is so difficult it sees him assigned to it. Howie is on a remote Scottish isle investigating a disappearance of a young girl but while remaining within the boundaries of his own world his own language and even his own country Howie will find the going difficult and complicated due to several unsuspecting and eerie things.Firstly the location of the island is important because it obviously resembles a sort of detachment from the mainland or indeed the rest of the world. There is special care taken to tell the audience as well as Howie that the mainland is a good week or so away by boat. So within this isolated utopia for the locals develops a subculture a world in which people are people but methods of teaching governing and religion are very different. This can be read into as some sort of political statement by the writer of the film  perhaps he is bringing to attention the level of policing in Britain for the time? There is no suspicion from Howie at all in the film but I noticed very quickly there was no police station nor was there any feeling that rules were apparent. The whole island was governed by a mysterious never seen man and look at what situation the island locals were in in terms of mentality.So if this island is a society without law and order without a stone wall ruling on the most basic humane regulations is the writer trying to bring to our attention the dangers of lack of authority in our own country? But The Wicker Man is not entirely an ambiguous text revolving around statements on our own world and society. It is a chilling and haunting horror film that predominantly falls into the 'Gothic' typecast due to its minute details on screen. There is a distinct ritualistic tone to the film and it is one that is fetishised. Several years earlier Christopher Lee himself starred in the highly fetishised 'Dracula'. Here shots of naked people sitting on grave stones and people having sex in graveyards maybe to merely gross the 1973 audience out or to just make us aware that this is indeed going to be different are included and add an ever present layer of disturbance but also one of ambiguity  why is it that people here do these things? To combine sex with a place of death can be linked with the film's overall theme. The man in the scene around the maypole sings a song about evolution and reproduction and generally about a certain circle of life. From here it is only obvious that the act of reproduction sex to produce new life would take place in a location in which you bury the dead. Life goes on it seems.Then there is that extra evidence to suggest this is one of the great Gothic horrors. How may of the cast are actually playing themselves? There are the people in the public house and the elderly folk by the harbour. This gives off its own air of disturbance in the sense they might be playing themselves and what with the commentary on society as a whole the two seem to bind together all the too nicely. Then there is the attention to faces early on. The chocolates in the baker's window have faces on them and the close up of the pub sign has a face on it. There is also the excessive wearing of masks later on as identity is toyed and revealed but generally kept ambiguous. Is this the future of the society circa 1973? Do we know what we believe in terms of religion? And where we are going in the future? What about the schools and the policing? Will this be the sad reality of a nation gone mad if these things are cut back on? I think these are the sorts of questions the writers are raising by making a film like this and it must've been all the more disturbing in 1973.So if The Wicker Man succeeds as a statement then it certainly succeeds as a piece of Gothic horror. It mixes in the uncanny with the surreal and it carries a distinct atmosphere of dread all throughout. There is ambiguity all over the place but I especially liked the attention to the film's music is it diegetic or not? Sometimes it is and others it isn't but it's such a headtrip of a soundtrack that it's difficult to notice most of the time. This surely one of the better British films ever made.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is a distinct air of menace flowing throughout The Wicker Man a distinct feeling of unwelcome and unkind put across in the most brilliant of manners because everyone acts so nicely. Then there is the awful feeling you get at certain points when you realise the character of Sergeant Howie Woodward is in actual fact a policeman and what might happen if he hadn't been. The Wicker Man is really a mere exercise in suspense on the surface but I think it toys with other more political ideas during the core of the film before substituting everything and just focussing very briefly on the religious aspects it raises.For Sergeant Howie he is bordering on the ultimate fishoutofwater. Howie may be British and may well still be in Britain but that does not exclude him from the fishoutofwater treatment that other film characters get when they are in that respective situation see Doyle in 'French Connection II' and Neo in 'The Matrix' among many other examples. Howie is a man of pride a man with ideas discipline and rules and regulations he likes to stand by. He is a thorough man and this is partly his downfall since it is this case that is so difficult it sees him assigned to it. Howie is on a remote Scottish isle investigating a disappearance of a young girl but while remaining within the boundaries of his own world his own language and even his own country Howie will find the going difficult and complicated due to several unsuspecting and eerie things.Firstly the location of the island is important because it obviously resembles a sort of detachment from the mainland or indeed the rest of the world. There is special care taken to tell the audience as well as Howie that the mainland is a good week or so away by boat. So within this isolated utopia for the locals develops a subculture a world in which people are people but methods of teaching governing and religion are very different. This can be read into as some sort of political statement by the writer of the film  perhaps he is bringing to attention the level of policing in Britain for the time? There is no suspicion from Howie at all in the film but I noticed very quickly there was no police station nor was there any feeling that rules were apparent. The whole island was governed by a mysterious never seen man and look at what situation the island locals were in in terms of mentality.So if this island is a society without law and order without a stone wall ruling on the most basic humane regulations is the writer trying to bring to our attention the dangers of lack of authority in our own country? But The Wicker Man is not entirely an ambiguous text revolving around statements on our own world and society. It is a chilling and haunting horror film that predominantly falls into the 'Gothic' typecast due to its minute details on screen. There is a distinct ritualistic tone to the film and it is one that is fetishised. Several years earlier Christopher Lee himself starred in the highly fetishised 'Dracula'.

It's secondary  and to be blunt not that great. Basically this movie serves as an ad for Irwin's The Crocodile Hunter TV series and most of it is shot as if he were taping the show as he fights crocs and plays with various and sundry poisonous and dangerous animals in his usual animated way. You have to give the guy credit  he's got his part down pat!There's a simple way of knowing whether you'll like this movie or not. If you like The Crocodile Hunter you'll like the movie. If you don't you won't. See how simple that is! I like The Crocodile Hunter and I think Irwin is quite hilarious. Strangely though for all the fun and laughs involved here the movie seemed to go on longer than its allotted 90 minutes. Perhaps Irwin is better in half hour segments. After that he may begin to get a bit overwhelming. But it is fun. I'd give it a 710 knowing full well that this movie will get its share of bashers as well.".

For a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just aren't good actors not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.The movie had quite some potential I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was brilliant! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still I must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.Watching this movie felt like a waste of time. Still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on TV on a rainy afternoon. It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.The movie had quite some potential I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was brilliant! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still I must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.Watching this movie felt like a waste of time. Still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on TV on a rainy afternoon. It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

I was expecting that Steve playing himself would be encountering situations not found on his TV show and his reaction to these events would provide the comedy. Nope the first half of the movie plays for the most part like an expanded episode of his show.The second half of the movie is an improvement though not by much. There are some attempts at that kind of situation humor though for some reason it only comes across as mildly amusing at the most. Oh the plot? Well just like the first half of the movie there is barely ANYTHING that can be called a plot including the ending which is a real cheat.As bad as the movie is none of it is Steve's fault he was clearly up to anything the production told him to do. It's too bad that pretty much all the movie gave him to perform was dreck.".

The storyline might not be that great but hey Steve didn't got famous for his movies but his show. You'll hear a lot crikey and ain't it a beauty   some of Steves famous one liners  during the movie in his funny Australian accent. This alone is a reason to watch this movie.

The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints So enjoy this diversion for what it is  a halfbaked movie featuring a fullon legend.

	schema:reviewBody "When a secret US satellite strays out of orbit it automatically selfdestructs. A topsecret beacon is ejected with the explosion and ends up somewhere in Australia where unbeknownst to the authorities it is swallowed by a big mean crocodile. While the US mobilises a small team of men to recover the beacon at any costs on the ground in Australia is Steve Irwin and his good lady wife are in the outback looking at the less loved outback animals. When they get a call about a crocodile terrorising an area they go in to capture it and move it to a less populated river system. However what they don't know is that the crocodile has this secret cargo that will put the Irwin's on a collision course with the US agents.I've seen bits of Irwin's TV show once or twice but have never really watched more than that or cared to but the sheer silliness of this film made me think it was worth a look. Needless to say I was wrong because all I found here was the same sort of stuff that I've not been bothered enough to watch when it has been on regularly on TV. The plot is very basic and was not even used that well suffice to say that it is the weakest frame I've ever seen and for the first half of the film it bares no relation to the Irwin's and only makes up the odd sort scene here and there. Instead what we get is lots of Steve Irwin messing around with snakes lizards etc which is hardly enough to be worth going to the cinema for but if you like the TV show then you'll find more of the same here. I quite enjoyed these parts of it albeit I could have easily had the film be 60 minutes long rather than 90 mainly because of Steve.I know that some people find him annoying and I couldn't watch him do the same stuff every week but he does have a certain charm even if he is silly and hammy with all his lines. His handling of animals is impressive and the film does produce a hatful of scenes that do nothing for the narrative but are still riveting. Terri is less impressive and more wooden but then she fits in with the rest of the support cast in that vein as folk like Wenham Szubanski Hulme Young and others could all easily have been replaced by blocks of wood without the film suffering that much although Beahen was cute.Overall this is a solid enough film for kids with a nice message about conservation that is delivered without the usual smugness that such things have. Beyond kids I suppose it will do for fans of Irwin because it captures his act and his charm really well but you do have to wonder why anyone would pay to see this film when it is essentially what you can see on his TV show for free. I quite enjoyed it although to be honest I'd rather have just watched the short version on his show than this film.".

The animal scenes were live and unpredictable like the Irwins' TV show. When a snake or spider or croc jumped at our hero my wife jumped too.The conservation theme is pretty heavy throughout the Irwins' subplot but since they were just doing their thing it was fine. Besides people need constant reminders of how badly we are screwing up our planet. The only thing that bugged me was what always bugs me about documentaries  where is the cameraman they keep talking to? Where does he sit? How does he get around? Anyway minor quibble.The whole movie reminded me of The Gods Must Be Crazy but with more polish. If you are an Irwin fan you will like this movie.

The late Steve Irwin stars as himself in 'The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course' which was marketed as his 'first bigscreen adventure' really that would've been Dr. Dolittle 2 but whatever.Anyway a US satellite explodes and a beacon from the satellite lands in Australia. But a croc swallows the beacon! So the CIA sends two agents to retrieve the beacon because apparently in the wrong hands it will change the world's axis of power whatever the hell that means. Meanwhile Steve is filming a documentary with his wife and things go awry when she and Steve mistake the agents as poachers who they think want to make boots bags and belts! out of the poor croc.It's not rocket science it's not genius but you need to appreciate it for what it is a fun movie. Plus I like the Crocodile Hunter.34.".

Expert crocodile hunter Steve Irwin is recruited to save said crocodile after an Australian cattle rancher has vowed to destroy it for the crimes it has committed upon her cattle. Meanwhile U.S. officials have sent in an elite team of agents to collect the elusive black box. Will the poachers be able to save the lost evidence before Steve and Terri can save the Croc from inhumane treatment on behalf of the U.S. Government? Only time and of course a few harrowing adventures through the outback will tell! If you love snakes government conspiracy tarantulas and international intrigue then you will love this movie. Steve and Terri are in their element bringing passion education and excitement to the big screen. Brilliant storytelling really brings this tale of danger and bravery together.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie can best be described as a Hollywoodlike film crossed with a mockumentary. The silly plot revolves around a satellite beacon that a crocodile in Australia swallows and which some CIA agents are trying to recover and Steve Irwin the Crocodile Hunter of Discovery Channel fame unknowingly picks up.While the story is fictional Steve's handling of certain very dangerous animals is obviously quite real there is plenty of suspense and a few scares. Whenever not exercising his quick reflexes he manages to educate well about these creatures. Note unfortunately I don't get to see the Discovery Channel and hence I don't get to see his show so I have nothing to compare this with although I suspect it's not too different from how he does it on the show.In addition to camera behavior the filmmakers also use the device of showing the dramatic scenes in a typical 2.351 aspect ratio while letterboxing the mockumentary scenes to about 169. While interesting the effect is not really convincing since in many places there is some impossibly undocumentarylike camera behavior e.g. on the boat then elsewhere looking at the boat with no camera especially once the two worlds collide. Also Steve and Terri occasionally act as if there are no cameras around while other times Steve will speak to a documentary camera that probably wouldn't be there in real life the other characters always seem to be oblivious to being in a documentary.It's all in good fun though. Well OK handling snakes and spiders and crocodiles isn't exactly fun and is only for professionals like Irwin but the rest is fun. And of course a little educational particularly about conservation. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone interested in wildlife or Steve Irwin or just looking for a fun movie.".

He gets in and really interferes with nature but it's supposedly for the good of the animals themselves. With Irwin dead now it's disappointing for the animals if his efforts were actually beneficial. Irwin's career made him many millions of dollars and instead of doing what other multimillionaires do like buying a sports car he drives an oldlooking Landcruiser he put that money into buying land so that developers and poachers can't touch the animals. This practical and pragmatic approach is a fresh change to the usual alltalknoaction that characterizes most academic environmentalists nowadays.

I think the only reason some of the more extreme comments being made about this movie are made is because the Crocodile Hunter has such a strong reputation.";

Still if its clean fun enjoyable entertainment you're looking for Dundee in LA serves the purpose well and is satisfying for the family or younger ones.

Its a story again about a fish out of water scenario but he pulls it off with astonishing bliss. Its been over a decade since we were graced with the comedy of Crocodile Dundee II but the magic and love and simplicity of the character is still apparent in Paul's portrayal of Dundee. I'm so glad Linda Kozlowski reprises her role as the sexy Sue Charlton as well. Movies forget the aspect of characters and story nowadays and focus on hype special effects and epicness. I'm so glad there are still movies I can shed a tear to simply because of its kindness simplicity and downtoearth quality of its characters that I grew up with. Crocodile Dundee is Los Angeles is a wonderful finale for anyone who loves the first two. Paul Hogan did the world a wonderful thing when he created the character so why not come back around by one final wonderful installment. At least check it out....".

This film is wonderfully different than both of them and uniquely funny and endearing all on its own. Yes Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee is still the samestill sweetly naive. Why critics feel the need to rip the character up for that just goes to show how jaded our society has become when people can't appreciate and embrace a quality like that in a film character. I for one love that my children can sit and watch a character who is moral who is loving and attentive to his wife and child who seeks out new things and learns from them and for the most part who sees the good in people.

One idea very rarely can work twice but third time it's simply too much. So if you like the first two Crocodile Dundee movies most likely you will enjoy this little movie or at least you'll tolerate it. The story was a bit primitive can anybody explain to me what's going on with screenwriters? but young Serge Cockburn had brought a bit of fresh magic to the movie though overall acting was pretty average.It is also obviously that now it is much harder to surprise or entertain anyone with wild Aussies. Despite that this sequel had enough funny moments and jokes including one very surprising cameo appearance. In my opinion the third Mick Dundee movie is slightly above average not annoying light comedy. At least it is not worse to be honest it is much better in my opinion than Crocodile Hunter movie that had been released next year after this sequel.My grade 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Mick Dundee Is Back!";
	schema:reviewBody "In general life can be a most trying proposition even in the best of times and simply negotiating the daily grind can be exasperating for even the most resilient among us.  And that's why it's so refreshing to find respite from the drama of daytoday living a safe haven if you will even if it's only for a couple of hours or so at the movies which is just what you get with the lighthearted comedy Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles' directed by Simon Wincer.  In this third installment of the Dundee' series once again starring Paul Hogan as the famed and fearless crocodile hunter Mick Dundee we find Mick his significant other Sue Charleton Linda Kozlowski and their fourthgrade son Mikey Serge Cockburn living in a small hamlet population 20 in Australia on the cusp of the Outback.  When the editor of Sue's father's West Coast office of his newspaper in America dies suddenly Mr. Charleton asks his journalist daughter to fill in for a few weeks until he can find a permanent replacement.  So it's off to Los Angeles for Mick Sue and Mikey where Sue quickly finds herself involved with the investigation of a shady new movie studio while Mick gets work there as an extra on their latest production. There's also plenty of time for Mick and Mikey to explore the terrain of the big city which is new territory for Mikey but for Mick already a veteran of a trip to New York it becomes just one g'day after another mate. Which is really what this film is all about.  And it works.It's light fare from the outset and Wincer does a good job of keeping it all on track and presenting the material in just the right way.  It's casual fun and a lot of laughs and though there's a lot of sightgags and physical humor it's never overblown or slapstick which keeps the rhythm of the film intact and makes the humor flow quite naturally.  In short Wincer has the formula down for what works here and he never attempts to make this film anything other than what it is which makes it easy for the audience to just go with it and enjoy the proceedings.Hogan has a charismatic screen presence and as Mick he's so laid back that you feel relaxed just watching him.  He makes his character real and the way he underreacts to just about any given situation makes the story refreshingly and readily accessible.  Watching this movie is kind of like spending some time with an old friend it's a fun and pleasant experience and makes you glad you got together after all these years.  Like the film itself Hogan never attempts to make Mick anything other than what he is which is a guy who happens to hunt crocodiles for a living.  And that's an aspect he could easily have tried to play upon approaching it from the perspective that this is a rather odd' occupation compared to the average guy on the street.  But he doesn't take that route opting instead to make Mick just another average guy on the street like the clerk at the store or the mailman.  And it lends credibility to the character as well as the story inasmuch as the plot is fairly insignificant in light of the fact that this movie is really about the characters and the way they interact as opposed to what the storyline is.  It's good work by Hogan who has created a character who is so likable and real while Hogan the actor in retrospect is destined to be under appreciated for it.  It's one of those instances in which it's too hard to separate the actor from the character which in essence is a tribute to the quality of Hogan's performance.After being absent from the big screen for some six years it's good to see Linda Kozlowski back reprising her role of Sue Charlton.  As an actor she is talented has an extremely natural screen presence and is absolutely gorgeous it's a shame she hasn't made more than a half dozen movies or so since Dundee II' in 1988.  Her role here is fairly straightforward but she plays it so well and with such facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily and too often overlooked.  And she plays well opposite Hogan but then she should they're married in real life.  She's a gifted actor and hopefully we'll see much more of her in the near future her continued presence would be a real asset to the cinematic community.Serge Cockburn meanwhile does a good turn as Mikey he's a likable youngster with a natural talent that was a definite asset to this film. Also helping to sell the movie is Alec Wilson as Jacko Mick's friend from Australia who follows him to L.A. to join in the fray and who adds some laughs along the way.The supporting cast includes Jere Burns Rothman Jonathan Banks Milos Aida Turturro Jean Paul Rodriguez Diego Kaitlin Hopkins Miss Mathis Gerry Skilton Nugget and Steve Rackman Donk.  An entertaining uplifting comedy Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles' is well crafted and delivered and will make you feel good and put a smile on your face.  There won't be any Oscars here but it doesn't matter this is a film that makes life a little brighter for awhile anyway and that's not such a bad deal in the grand scheme of things.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

To most kids my children's ages Hogan is better known as a spokesman for Subaru station wagons than as an actor. However he is a wonderful comic actor fully deserving of vehicles such as this. The yokel amongthesophisticates plot is timeless ranging from Buster Keaton's Elmer character through the Bowery Boys Ma and Pa Kettle Jerry Lewis Jim Varney etc. Hogan is working in that classic tradition and his skills as a physical comedian his superb comic timing and his loveable persona will make this film a favorite on cable TV and as a video rental for decades to come. There were no dazzling special effects nothing shocking no social or political agendajust wellperformed funny family comedy. The only flaw if it can be called that in the film was that Paul Rodriguez's character was not given enough screen time. I could imagine those two making a great screen pair. Maybe in the next film Mick Dundee could call on his old friend from the movie business the character played by Rodriguez to help him out of some jam. With that large Aussie sidekick who accompanied Dundee in the second half of the film the name escapes meplaying off both Hogan and Rodriguez you'd have a great combination! Think about it Paul Hogan and Lance Hool! I'll pay to bring my family to Crocodile Dundee 4 when it comes out. We had an 8 year old with us viewing the film and she loved it so I'd guess that the film should be acceptable to children 6 or over and there's nothing really offensive in it if you have to take children younger than that. With this and SPY KIDS coming out in the same month it's been a good season for family films.".

How is that funny?Mike Tyson's cameo was pointless and unfunny. The Mick Mike and Mikey gag is not funny.And the whole Lethal Agent thing just bored me. The whole movie just bores me.

This movie didn't have the plotstructure as the first one which would probably hint as to why it was no where near as successful. It was good to see Dundee Hogan in a different venue other then the played out scene of New York. It was also good to see Hogan in another theatre release since he really hadn't appeared in one since he starred with Elijah Wood in 1996's Flipper. Another person I was happy to see again was Sue's character played by Hogan's reallife wife Linda Kozlowski. Even after 13 years she is still a very beautiful and attractive woman. With the release of this I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Hogan tried to stay in the spotlight again by releasing a sequel to another one his movies. Lightning Jack 2 or maybe even a Flipper 2. That would be entertaining. Nevertheless Paul Hogan remains my favorite Aussie actor.".

The Australian outback's Mick Dundee is surely one of the cinematic world's most charismatic characters and amusing adventurers. Here he's back in a sequel that's every bit as fun as the original tale.The previous movie begins in Australia and then moves to New York. By contrast as this film opens Mick is settled in New York with his beautiful journalistic girlfriend Sue Charlton. However Sue's ex husband is murdered in Colombia after taking pictures of a drug cartel's dealings. He has sent these photos to Sue resulting in her being kidnapped by Rico and the other drug hoodlums. Mick must come to her rescue and the pair then head for safety to HIS terrain Down Under naturally pursued by the gangsters.As in the original there's plenty of fun in the sequel. Mick's assault on the drug kingpin Rico's house assisted by a likable but very amateur young gang makes for some pretty entertaining scenes. Once Down Under it's non stop pranks cooked up by Mick as he  his 'sheila' traipse around his own bush 'estate' with the urban villains hot on their trail and often vice versa!. Suffice it to say some of Mick's crazy antics almost make you feel sorry for the bad guys! Sue Charlton played by actress Linda Kozlowzki always looks lovely and perfectly groomed whatever the bush conditions! Once again the chemistry between her and Mick sizzles throughout the tale. Mick's bumbling but totally endearing sidekick Wally is back and there's also a couple of amusing aboriginal characters. As for Mick himself actor Paul Hogan he still has the same charm and affability as in the original. This time he's really having the time of his life with the villains. Don't listen to the naysayers it's a highly entertaining yarn. The next sequel Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles is definitely watchable...I can never resist Mick...though not quite up to the same standard.".

	schema:headline " Not as Fun as the Original but Still Worthwhile 710";
	schema:reviewBody "If you saw the original this one will seem like a visit with an old friend that being the likable Mick Crocodile' Dundee.  This time around there's not as much whimsy' to it though and as things get a bit more heavyhanded Mick finds himself in some rather murky waters as the story unfolds.  Still the appeal of the character and the easy intrinsic humor at the heart of the film is enough to make Crocodile Dundee II' directed by John Cornell a satisfying cinematic experience.As the film opens Mick Paul Hogan is happily ensconced in New York City with his ladyfriend journalist Sue Charlton Linda Kozlowski and life is good.  Mick however tired of just laying about has decided it's time to seek gainful employment and sets out to do just that.  His job search gets put on hold though when Sue's exhusband Bob Tanner Dennis Boutsikaris a journalist currently covering a story in South America sends some photographs he's taken the subject of which is of a particularly serious and sensitive nature to Sue and something else arrives along with the them  Trouble.  Trouble as in the man in the pictures is one Rico' Hechter Ubarry a big time drug dealer who is more than a little concerned about the compromising position these particular photos will undoubtedly put him in.  He will stop at nothing to get them and he has the muscle' to do it.  But there's one small item Rico hasn't factored in to his agenda and his plan of attack.  And his name is Mick Dundee.  Written by Paul Hogan and his son Brett Hogan this film suffers the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' syndrome in that like the Indy' film it is a sequel to a hugely successful original and takes that same turn' toward the dark side.  And in the case of this film it's even more noticeable inasmuch as this is a comedy rather than a pure actionadventure movie and let's face it it's tough to find a light comedic touch in a film that deals with a kidnapping killings and drug dealers.  Still just as Spielberg did with the Indy' sequel Hogan pulls it off and he does it with a winning smile and bit of sleightofhand.As the great Steve Allen would say All seriousness aside folks'  And in a nutshell that's the trick Hogan Hogan and Cornell use to make this offering a viable commodity.  Taken out of context the story alone is serious stuff more conducive to a Traffic' Blow' or Scarface' than a Crocodile Dundee' movie.  But therein is the rub the filmmakers here take a lighthearted approach to a serious issue being careful however not to discount or be dismissive of it but rather by toning down the results' of the violence while infusing it with humor and some genuinely engaging characters and presenting it all in a way that is palatable to a wide audience.  Cornell like Peter Faiman who directed Crocodile Dundee' is destined to be the forgotten man of this project and for the same reasons.  Cornell takes the wheel of the ship here takes his audience on a cruise then deposits them safely back on shore where most will agree it was a trip worth taking.  But in the end there is nothing about it that identifies Cornell nothing with his signature' on it.  And like Faiman he only directed one other film Almost an Angel' in 1990 also starring Hogan and Kozlowski which was mediocre at best.  So there's simply nothing to reference him.  He may have been the captain of the ship and he did a good job technically speaking but he kept himself in the wheelhouse too long to be noticed.Hogan meanwhile was taking center stage in the lounge successfully reprising his role as everyones favorite Aussie.'  Without question no matter what Paul Hogan does for the rest of his career this is the character moviegoers everywhere will forever associate him with and for good reason.  Quite simply Mick Dundee is just such a likable bloke.  And it's a theme that runs throughout the entire series everybody likes him no matter where he goes or who he meets he makes them feel as if they've known him all their lives.  He's amiable good looking charismatic and has an entirely nonjudgmental matteroffact way of dealing with people and situations that provides a refreshing perspective on the human condition. That's what makes this character so memorable and there's no getting around it  Just as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock' regardless of whatever else he ever does Hogan will always be Crocodile Dundee.  Because he IS Mick Dundee.Also in fine form for this second go round is the beautiful Linda Kozlowski returning to the role she created in the original Sue Charlton. And as in the first one it's the on screen chemistry between Kozlowski and Hogan that really sells it whether it's in the Australian outback or on the streets of New York City they find the magic and it comes through to the audience loud and clear.  This isn't of course the kind of stuff that wins Oscars but her performance is honest and convincing and Kozlowski has a screen presence that is altogether natural and real all of which makes the relationship between Sue and Mick all the more believable.Also turning in noteworthy performances are John Meillon returning as Mick's friend and business associate Walter Reilly Charles Dutton as the street wise Leroy and Ubarry who makes Rico the bad guy you love to hate. The supporting cast includes Juan Fernandez Miguel Kenneth Welsh Brannigan Ernie Dingo Charlie Luis Guzman Jose Jace Alexander Rat and Steve Rackman Donk.  An entertaining film but not nearly as fun' as the original the Indy' syndrome again Crocodile Dundee II' is nevertheless a worthy addition to the series as it puts you together with one of the screen's most unforgettable characters Crocodile' Dundee. 710.".

The main problem with this movie is that it isn't as funny as the first film. The second installment has a more serious tone to it thanks in part to a plot involving drug lords presuing our heroes. The laughs seem to come in few and far between which wasn't the case with the original. Still there's lots to like here. Hogan is fine as he was in the first film as is Kozlowski.

The Australian Outback Superman with Gday on his cape.  Another fun exciting and entertaining movie you can watch again and again.  I would have liked another sequel but the odds are against it.";

Its basically an adventure movie and is pretty good taken as such. I just wish they could have got a little more comedy in there too.

	schema:reviewBody "After his great success with Crocodile Dundee Paul Hogan seemed to be on top of the world. For anyone in that position as Tim Rice reminded us in the lyrics to Evita the most important question is Where do you go from here? For any filmmaker in the Eighties who had just had a success there was an obvious answer to that question you made a sequel. This was the golden age of the sequel any successful film was liable to be followed up not just by a single sequel but by a whole series of them. This became something of a joke comedians used to speculate whether we would see a Superman VII a Rocky X or a Friday the 13th Part 13. Such longrunning series became known as franchises a name which emphasised the commerciality of the enterprise as though making a film was the same as running a McDonald's restaurant.There was however a problem with Crocodile Dundee. The original film although it also contained elements of satire was essentially a romantic comedy. This is a type of film particularly difficult to follow up with a sequel because falling in love is generally speaking something that most couples only do once. The Philadelphia Postscript? Lunch at Tiffany's? The Postgraduate? The Second Time Harry Met Sally? A Fifth Wedding and Another Funeral? Just a few of the followups to classic romcoms that never got made. This being the Eighties however a sequel to Crocodile Dundee was unavoidable but Paul Hogan obviously recognised the problem as Crocodile Dundee II was made in a quite different style to the original being an adventure comedy rather than a romantic comedy.At the beginning of the film Mick Dundee is living in New York with his girlfriend Sue. Sue's exhusband Bob is working as an investigative journalist in Colombia helping to expose the local involvement in the drug trade. Unfortunately his cover is blown and he is murdered by the traffickers but not before he has mailed Sue a roll of film incriminating Luis Rico one of the wealthiest and most powerful dealers. Rico kidnaps Sue in an attempt to recover the evidence Mick manages to free her from Rico's mansion with the aid of a local street gang. The scene then shifts to Australia. This reverses the pattern of the first film which starts in Australia and then moves to America. Mick has taken Sue back to his home town of Walkabout Creek in the Northern Territory thinking she will be safer there. Rico however tracks them down and Mick and Sue disappear into the bush with the drug dealer and his gang in pursuit. Mick must use his skills as a tracker and his knowledge of the outback in order to outwit the villains.The film does not come close to achieving the success of its predecessor because although some of the elements Hogan's largerthanlife comic character the beauty of Linda Kozlowski as Sue Mick's bumbling timid friend Walt that made the original film such a success are present others are not. The first film succeeded largely because of a combination of romance and satire. Not only is the element of romance played down in the sequel but much of the satire is also lacking. Most of the humour in the original arose from Mick's innocent reactions to the unfamiliar ways of the big city. In the sequel he has been living in New York for some time and is consequently more streetsmart and less funny. There are some amusing scenes such as the one in which he prevents a suicide from throwing himself off a highrise building but not many.The scenes of adventure in the bush never generate much excitement. Mick's knowledge of bushcraft and aboriginal lore are so superior to those of pursuers that we never experience any anxiety on his behalf or doubt that he will triumph over them. The original Crocodile Dundee was in my view the first great Australian screen comedy. The sequel although it is amiable and entertaining enough is definitely not the second. 610".

Such longrunning series became known as franchises a name which emphasised the commerciality of the enterprise as though making a film was the same as running a McDonald's restaurant.There was however a problem with Crocodile Dundee. The original film although it also contained elements of satire was essentially a romantic comedy. This is a type of film particularly difficult to follow up with a sequel because falling in love is generally speaking something that most couples only do once. The Philadelphia Postscript? Lunch at Tiffany's? The Postgraduate? The Second Time Harry Met Sally? A Fifth Wedding and Another Funeral? Just a few of the followups to classic romcoms that never got made. This being the Eighties however a sequel to Crocodile Dundee was unavoidable but Paul Hogan obviously recognised the problem as Crocodile Dundee II was made in a quite different style to the original being an adventure comedy rather than a romantic comedy.At the beginning of the film Mick Dundee is living in New York with his girlfriend Sue. Sue's exhusband Bob is working as an investigative journalist in Colombia helping to expose the local involvement in the drug trade. Unfortunately his cover is blown and he is murdered by the traffickers but not before he has mailed Sue a roll of film incriminating Luis Rico one of the wealthiest and most powerful dealers. Rico kidnaps Sue in an attempt to recover the evidence Mick manages to free her from Rico's mansion with the aid of a local street gang. The scene then shifts to Australia. This reverses the pattern of the first film which starts in Australia and then moves to America. Mick has taken Sue back to his home town of Walkabout Creek in the Northern Territory thinking she will be safer there. Rico however tracks them down and Mick and Sue disappear into the bush with the drug dealer and his gang in pursuit. Mick must use his skills as a tracker and his knowledge of the outback in order to outwit the villains.The film does not come close to achieving the success of its predecessor because although some of the elements Hogan's largerthanlife comic character the beauty of Linda Kozlowski as Sue Mick's bumbling timid friend Walt that made the original film such a success are present others are not. The first film succeeded largely because of a combination of romance and satire. Not only is the element of romance played down in the sequel but much of the satire is also lacking. Most of the humour in the original arose from Mick's innocent reactions to the unfamiliar ways of the big city. In the sequel he has been living in New York for some time and is consequently more streetsmart and less funny. There are some amusing scenes such as the one in which he prevents a suicide from throwing himself off a highrise building but not many.The scenes of adventure in the bush never generate much excitement. Mick's knowledge of bushcraft and aboriginal lore are so superior to those of pursuers that we never experience any anxiety on his behalf or doubt that he will triumph over them. The original Crocodile Dundee was in my view the first great Australian screen comedy. The sequel although it is amiable and entertaining enough is definitely not the second. 610";

One thing I want to say though regardless of anything is that I think every school choir should show this movie!  I'm in the choir at my school and unfortunately we have very little spirit and most people in it don't care very much.  I'm going to recommend that we show this movie to my choir teacher.  It may not help but it can't hurt.  I recommend every choir see this one just to show that a choir can dance and have fun while singing.  At least show the ending if nothing else!  Ok there's my two cents!  Everyone needs to see the movie at least for the music and to have a good time!I give this movie a 9.510!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I truly enjoyed the original Sister Act. Perhaps it is my religious upbringing but the sight of the nuns being coached by Whoopi Goldberg to integrate dowop and Motown into their choir music never fails to tickle my funny bone. So it was with great pleasure that I looked forward to the sequel. Unfortunately there is nary a laugh to be found. The original mined the material of watching the unlikely combination of a sassy Las Vegas wannabe singer inspire the zany cloistered nuns to irreverence. The sequel brings Goldberg back to the fold in a highly unlikely development and in place of the singing nuns we get...singing teens in another stale 'let's put on a show and save the day' scenario. Wow! How original and clever! This story was threadbare in 1930 and there is nothing funny about the kids in question. In fact they are about as funny as an amputation. Overlooking the fact that there is literally no credible reason for the Goldberg character to leave behind being a Las Vegas headliner to help at a floundering inner city school one could easily see some comedy being mined from Goldberg tackling the disrespectful teens. Instead she plays straight man to a gaggle of unfunny kids. There are no classic Whoopi moments and she looks terribly bored. Also why is she required to go undercover to teach these kids and keep her real identity from the male members of the teaching staff? It makes no sense. Nor does the fact that the world in this film seems to have undergone collective amnesia. Despite her character being on the cover of magazines and having entertained the pope in a media event not only do none of the teens recognize her but neither do any of the adults nor the male contingencies of the teaching staff. The film does come briefly to life when the nuns from the first film do a cameo number but the main returnees such as Maggie Smith I hope she was paid well Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena are irrelevant. Even worse when the lamebrained singing competition caps the film you know the show is in trouble when ALL of the competitors seem better than the group you are supposed to be rooting for to win. A total mess akin to having dental surgery without Novacaine.".

Yeah the nuns are still good guys but don't fool yourself there's a lot of secular bias in this script. Nobody in here including all the Catholics takes Christianity with an seriousness. Hey if Hollywood takes it as a joke it wants everyone to do the same. That seems to be the message of this movie.Also as in many sequels they took a part of something that worked and then overdid it the second time. In this case it's Kathy Nijimy's role. She was cute and bubbly in a minor role in the original got recognized for her performance and now has much bigger part. Unfortunately they overdid all that giggling to the point where the woman is downright annoying.".

Friendly Deloris back and has to teach music to a bunch of students in their parochial college which is fated for closure . She creates a choir to participate in the state championship . A group of stereotypical botcher monks Barnard Hughes  Michael Jeter and a greedy administrator James Coburn attempt to detain them . However one of the girls Lauryn Hill  who is the most talented of the team  is banned to sing by her mummy Sheryl Lee Ralph . Los Angeles lounge singer donning nun's habit and organizing the convent choir formed by sympathetic nuns who steal best laughs and including a spectacular as well as amusing concert .This entertaining film with some genuinely funny moments follows the formula about a fish out water . Motormouth and kind Whoopi Goldberg is pretty well as the vaudeville star become unexpected nun  she is a complete show . Whoopi Goldberg was very unhappy making the first film and made this sequel only after Disney decided to finance her dream project Sarafina! . Good performances from agreeable nuns  Wendy Makkenna  Kathy Najimy  the veteran Mary Wickes and excellent Maggie Smith who disapproves modern methods . Fine support cast  being this the first movie for Lauryn Hill Ryan Toby and Jennifer Love Hewitt . And Whoopi Goldberg's daughter Alex Martin appears in this movie as one of the classroom children . The musical numbers in 'Diana Ross and the Supremes style' magical choreography and songs are catchy and done with gusto . The movie is amusing and entertaining with enjoyable set pieces but don't let it make you expect too much . Welldone musical score with swinging tunes by Marc Shaiman and Miles Goodman  including colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood . The film is geared directly toward Whoopi Goldberg fans and young viewers . The motion picture was professionally directed by Bill Duke . Bill is a known and prestigious secondary actor  usual in villain roles as Commando 1985 and especially as one of Schwarzenegger's jungle commandos in Depredator 1987. After cutting his directorial teeth on the small screen  Duke directed his first feature film with the crime drama  Rage in Harlem 1991. This was followed by another impressive crime film Deep cover 1992 then made this comedy sequel  Sister Act 2 1993. Duke has since continued to divide his time between appearing both in front of the camera and behind it  and remains a dynamic stimulating and creative talent in Hollywood.".

This sequel features Whoopi Goldberg becoming a teacher. The film is mostly brought down by all the clichs. We get the contest that they need to save the school. We get the outcast girl who helps them in the end. It's just nothing interesting. I will admit that it's nice to have such a charismatic person like Whoopi Goldberg back in her role. Comedy sequels are in fact rarely good. Well I personally loved 22 Jump Street. The songs are also pretty good. It's just something you can skip. ".

This movie is just a great family movie. Great music! Great Acting! Great Movie! Whoopi has really outdone her self with this one. I absolutely love this movie! With the combination of Whoopi Goldberg Lauryn Hill Ryan Toby Kathy Najimy and Maggie Smith and JenniferLove Hewitt. This just an awesome movie. With all the hilarious parts and great songs from the first original but just better. I strongly recommend this family classic to your own private collection.

	schema:headline " Sister Act 2";
	schema:reviewBody "The musicfilled 1992 comedy hit Sister Act was a positive surprise both financially and qualitywise but that does not mean the inevitable sequel would be any good of course. Directed by Bill Duke Sister Act 2 Back in the Habit tries to introduce a few new elements into the familiar premise some of them successful others not.Some time after the events of the first movie Deloris Van Cartier still played by Whoopi Goldberg has returned to lounge singing and headlines a popular show in Las Vegas. When her old friends from the nun convent pay her a visit and ask her to help them with their work at a financially struggling high school she cannot let them down and agrees to become the school's new music teacher. The students are unruly the administrator Mr. Crisp James Coburn is uptight and the school is under risk of being closed down but luckily Deloris a.k.a. Sister Mary Clarence knows that the power of music is never to be underestimated.The movie starts energetically with one of Deloris' Vegas performances that catchily recounts the events of the previous movie. It is also pleasant to see that Wendy Makkena Kathy Najimy and Maggie Smith return in the roles of Deloris' fellow nuns and that this time there are also monks present among the school's staff. Contrary to the first movie that dealt more with the other nuns this time the comedy is for the most part based on Deloris' interaction with her new rebellious students who prefer freestyle rapping to gospel choirs. I wonder if rap music had more of a novelty value in mainstream entertainment in 1993 than it does in 2011 because seeing it now I was left hoping for more actual songs instead of brief sessions of verbal rhyme battles and tough talking.During the latter half the music finally gets going and we hear fun songs like the funky Get Up Offa That Thing  Dancing in the Street and the final choir performances Joyful Joyful near the end. The end credit version of Ain't No Mountain High Enough performed by various cast members all together belongs among the most entertaining moments of the film as well. However the movie is not really a musical and should also be judged by merits other than the soundtrack. On this front it is not very successful in my opinion. The plot is extremely predictable the noisy kids are annoying and the funniest characters like the eccentric monks are not paid enough attention. Fans of Lauryn Hill will surely be interested in her breakthrough performance as a young discouraged singer Rita Watson but I was not too big a fan of the ballads she sings here. More cheery songs like the first movie's Shout are what Sister Act 2 would have needed.Setting the plot in a school makes sure the story does not repeat the first movie's ideas too obviously but I wish they had used the different environment for something less predictable than just another tale of a new teacher cleaning up a rundown school by inspiring troubled kids to believe in themselves. I guess that if you absolutely loved the first movie there is no reason why you would not like the sequel too at least moderately but generally speaking I do not think Sister Act 2 is very good film. It seriously lacks the will to deviate from the tried and true patterns of comedy conventions and failed to make me laugh or even smile unlike the original film that featured better songs and antagonists. You might as well save your time and watch the music clips on YouTube or something the rest is pretty skippable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a lay student of these times I was naturally interested in this movie and to a great extent I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable but what happened to the Battle of Marston Moor? Was history wrong and the battle never fought? Cromwell was depicted as the over all commander of the New Model Army i.e the Roundheads at the battle of Naseby. He wasn't Sir Thomas Fairfax was. Cromwell was the commander of the cavalry.The Civil War was not a conflict over religion although it played it's part. It was about the divine right of kings against the governance of by and for the people i.e. Rex v Parliament. Divided loyalties and opinions were split right across the board.The capital charges of treason brought against the king was to my mind not altogether trumped up and had some validity. However it was of course a show trial and to bring it about the laws had to be changed rapidly. There was no edict at the time that allowed anyone to put a monarch on trial. Issac Dorislaus a Dutch lawyer came to the rescue of Parliament. He wrote an order that would enable it to set up the court. This order was based on an old Roman law which stated that a military body in this case the Parliamentary forces could legally overthrow a tyrant. Naturally Charles I did not agree either to this law or that he was a tyrant. He was still the King still the Head of State and as such above the law. He could do as he wished and was answerable only to God. For him it was an unfortunate way of looking at things.The casting of this movie was extremely well thought out but with one exception. Cromwell himself. I'm not criticising Richard Harris in any way. He played the role superbly but Cromwell was a short stocky man not tall and athletically built. Neither I'm sure did he have a Irish accent. Also he had some extremely noticeable warts on his face which Richard Harris did not. Had the makeup artists gone on vacation? To his credit Richard overcame this miscasting and acquitted the characterisation of the brusque complex and religiously enigmatic Oliver Cromwell with great fervour and passion and I doubt if anyone else could have done it any better.On the subject of accents I wonder whether or not the Scottish accent adopted by Alec Guinness was apt. As Charles I left Scotland at the age of 4 and lived in England until his death surely he would have cultivated an English one? True he had a Scottish tutor but I'm still left to wonder. Perhaps someone could set me right.Just as a byline I find it curious that Richard Harris being an Irishman accepted the part. In the greater part of Ireland the very name of Oliver Cromwell is loathed and reviled and for good reason so it says much for Harris's devotion to the acting profession that he actually did. Being a musician I was highly amused at seeing and hearing bugles played on horseback during a 17th century battle reminiscent of the US 7th cavalry. Such instruments weren't developed to such an advanced stage until late into the following century the 18th.As another reviewer has noted Cromwell was certainly not one of the Five Members who were to be removed from the House and arrested. These were John Pym John Hampden Denzil Holles Sir Arthur Haselrig and William Strode. A sixth man Lord Mandeville the future Earl of Manchester was also to be taken.There are quite a few more historical mistakes and omissions on which other reviewers have remarked and I don't intend to repeat them. But in defence of the producers it must be said that The English Civil War was a momentous stage in British perhaps even world history and to illustrate it all in a couple of hours is impossible. Much as Shakespeare when writing Henry V managed on a small stage to capture the flavour of Agincourt and events leading up to it so this production coped well with a similar task on film. Therefore if certain liberties were taken and artistic licence used I think they can in this case be excused. Should it have encouraged one student to scuttle towards the history books or now websites to learn more about the whole period then I would say it was a job well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cromwell was an ambitious undertaking for Director Ken Hughes and his two stars Richard Harris and Alec Guinness. He managed to capture the spirit of that part of the 17th century even if he didn't get all his facts right.Like the many tellings of the story of Mary Tudor and Mary Stuart which have them in climatic meeting we have Oliver Cromwell and Mary Stuart's grandson Charles I meeting not once but several times. They too never met but the story demands it.In point of fact Oliver Cromwell was a minor figure in the war between the Crown and Parliament until the Parliamentary Army lost a series of battles and looked like they were going down for the count. It was at that point that Cromwell emerged as a military leader. It turned out that this previously obscure member of Parliament who had no previous military training had a natural genius for warmaking. He turned that army around and eventually Parliament won. Cromwell could have been George Washington at this point and retired to the farm but he used his prestige and not as reluctantly as this film shows to make himself the military dictator of Great Britain with the title of Lord Protector. The experience of Cromwell's reign scarred the English body politic for generations and to a large degree the American one as well. The whole struggle over which interpretation of Christianity would hold sway was something all of the ancestors of the American founding fathers had to deal with. That's when the idea came to them to have no established religion in America. Cromwell's large standing Ironsides Army enforcing his dictatorship led to a positive mania about no standing armies no quartering of troops and even the right to bear arms. All this because of a collective memory of the Lord Protector.Richard Harris is a lean and mean Cromwell who keeps saying he just wants to go back to the farm but somehow winds up grabbing for more power. Alec Guinness is the perfect conception of that luckless monarch Charles I. Please note the relationship between Guinness and Queen Henrietta Marie played by Dorothy Tutin. Two things should be remembered there. First Henrietta Marie is the sister of Louis XIV of France a monarch with considerable more power than Charles has. Note how Tutin is constantly berating Guinness for not standing up to the Parliament. He does and see where it gets him. Secondly Charles I is one of the very few English monarchs with no royal paramours. He and the Queen were actually in love and he knew her advice was from the heart if it proved disastrous.Please note a couple of other good performances Timothy Dalton as Prince Ruppert of the Rhine Charles's nephew from Germany who actually was a whole lot smarter than he's shown here. And Robert Morley as the Earl of Manchester one of Cromwell's rivals in the Parliamentary camp.Oliver Cromwell died in 1558 quite suddenly and within two years the Stuart Monarchy was restored under Charles II oldest son of Charles I and Henrietta Marie. The collapse of the Protectorate is a subject that English historians have some raging debates over. It was very much like the collapse of the Soviet Union in our time. The collapse of the Protectorate and the Restoration of the Stuarts was filmed in Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s The Exile and really needs an up to date treatment.Cromwell as a film is magnificently photographed and directed and actually won an Oscar for costume design. But the flaws in the story line are too many and don't use this film as Cliff's notes kids.".

And it is not just the fact that I have studied the period in depth that makes such glaring inaccuracies asCromwell being named as one of the Five Members he wasn't.Cromwell even being present at Edgehill let alone rescuing the day. Neither are true. At the same time the arrangement between the officers of the opposing side which was so crucial to the film never happened and at the end of the day the Royalists did not actually win the battle. It was a draw. Okay I can live with some details being slightly wrong but the outcome of the entire engagement...?Why miss out the most bloody viscious and many would say crucial battle of the war? At least at Marston Moor Cromwell was actually there.Naseby too was grossly misrepresented a Cromwell did not command the parliamentary forces Fairfax did and b in reality the Royalist force was just over half the size of that of parliament hardly the stunning victory of a smaller force led by Cromwell as portrayed in the film.The Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant both sides were Protestant and to be technical both were mostly heartily opposed to Charles' Laudianism a kind of mixture of the two. However in 1970 some scholarship did maintain this so this mistake can perhaps be understood.These are just some of the many nitpicking points that seem to preclude the idea that Cromwell provides an excellent history lesson. However Appocalypse Now and The Thin Red Line are both examples of historically inaccurate but still highly effective and powerful films. How come Cromwell fails on this count? Well on the one hand neither of these more recent films even claim to portray real people Cromwell does and therefore its stubborn disregard of the truth cannot be ignored. Then on the other hand if the film attempts to be more than just a reasonably nice looking swashbuckler which it does and to really look into the character of its protagonists then surely its case is harmed by these shocking errors. For example how can the film attempt to portray Cromwell as a man made by his times rather than the other way around when it suggests that he was a significant player from the start. Before the outbreak of Civil War Cromwell had made just one vaguely significant speech in parliament. He was never contacted by Pym before the call of Parliament and there was no question of him ever leading the armies of Parliament until the retirement of Fairfax on the eve of the curiously unmentioned Second Civil War. Indeed he did not become official leader of the country until 1653. His rise to power was a great surprise to him and his countrymen.Finally why miss out Ireland completely from the equation when surely there is no more interesting aspect to the man's character than his opinions on religion?Cromwell deserves a more accurate cinematic perspective and surely half of the problem is that this film attempts to cram the ten most monumental years of British history into three hours.Definately a could do better.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film ultimately fails as an historical drama. It has some pretty good elements. The production values of the costumes scenes etc. are overall quite good. Guinness is great as Charles he looks a lot like him and he does a good job at conveying the king's tyrannical autocratic stance his conviction in his belief that he's right his nobility to the end and the fact that while he usually ended up taking bad positions or doing the wrong things he did so not entirely for bad reasons at least in his own mind for he was sure that he was right. The film also makes some modicum of effort at showing Cromwell's more troubling qualities too making him out to be the noble hero but not entirely covering up his transformation into ruthless hypocritical dictator.However the film has equally strong bad points. It tends to drag at many points and frequently gives the impression of being an overly drawnout stage production that fails to be fully convincing. More serious though is the problem that although presenting itself as historical it plays fast and loose with history. It does not fully explain the causes of the Civil War or the differences of viewpoints within each side especially the Parliamentarians not all of whom were fighting for the same reasons. It portrays the Royalist forces as the flashy wellequipped and stronger element when in reality the Parliament forces were not only much more numerous but usually much better equipped as well after all it was not a war of ragtag grassroots rebels trying to topple the government each side represented in part one branch of the government and Parliament not the king was the body that held the purse strings. In addition the Royalists often did quite well in battle despite their inferior forces. It clearly makes Cromwell out to be too important from the start rather than being one of the key leaders in the beginning he really started out as a military commander and simply rose to prominence over time. Finally Cromwell despite some of his autocratic tendency coming through is still shown to be too much the reluctant noble hero and the film only hints at his other face one which in short order made him none too popular in England let alone Ireland. Needless to say nothing is mentioned of his willingness to shed the blood of Royalists and Catholics or to destroy historic architecture that conflicted with his Puritan views.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is to be admitted that Oliver Cromwell a.k.a. THE LORD PROTECTOR Old NOLL was a great figure in British history. But Cromwell was a flawed hero. He did rebel against his liege king Charles I and voted for his monarch's execution. He also truncated Parliament when he found it impeded his own reforms. His treatment of Irish Catholics while typical of the ruthless massacres of religious opponents in the period of the Thirty Years War 1618  1648 is still a stain against his fame. Still in the period that he was the dominant figure 1644  1658 he rebuilt the British army and navy restored Britain to major power status and actually did one act of surprising religious toleration  he allowed the Jews to return to England in 1655 a reform that Charles II decided not to undue when he was restored to the throne five years later.Such a career deserves a careful movie. CROMWELL is not that film. It does do well in showing King Charles I Alec Guinness as a untrustworthy individual though one driven to such actions because of his need to maintain his rights as monarch. It does make one serious howler regarding Charles I and his trial for treason. Charles may have been a liar and betrayer at times  but Sir Edward Hyde who was a leading supporter of his and would be a statesman in his son's reign and the fatherinlaw of the future James II did not testify at Charles's trial as a witness for the prosecution. Such glaring errors are frequent in the movie for example Prince Rupert was not dismissed so callously by his uncle King Charles  Rupert was a very fine cavalry leader and would remain a fixture in English society when Charles II was restored. The subtle acting of Guinness is not matched by Harris who rants and raves throughout the film  even in the closing moments talking about his intentions to create better schools and laws. Charles and Cromwell are two fascinating characters and both deserve a better film than this as the sole film about the English Civil Wars except for Vincent Price's THE CONQUEROR WORM to come out.".

The stuttering Scot who believes in the divine right of Kings. A man who looks upon Parliament as a challenge to his authority over the people and a head of a protestant state wrestling with his own strong catholic leanings and sympathies.Richard Harris is outstanding and brilliant but portrays Cromwell as someone he most certainly wasn't. As an Irishman it amazes me what ever persuaded him to take on the role. With Cromwell being the most hated Englishman in Irish history I was surprised he didn't portray him as an evil oppressor and murderer complete with handlebar moustache tophat and cape accompanied by Hammond organs and loud hissing sounds from the audience. Instead Harris' Cromwell is so nice and decent honourable and just that by movies end he would have been welcomed at any dining table in County Cork.Cromwell's belief was that Parliament runs the country and the people run the Parliament reminder for Tony Blair!!! The system we have today. However during his time as head of a republic state he seemed to have forgot this and went his own way on nearly everything despite what the people wanted remind you of anyone Tony Blair!!!So again inaccuracies rain on what is on the whole a very good parade.The battle scenes also fail to excite as they are not filmed on the dramatic scale needed to have done them justice. In fact sometimes they are reminisent of Monty Python's reenactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbour by the Batley Townswomen's Guild. Watch this film and enjoy it as I did but I beg of you don't use it as a basis for a factual thesis in your History Degree...you will fail big time.".

Richard Harris as Cromwell makes a decent effort although I do feel he makes too much of a theatrical job with the role with far too much posturing selfsmugness and above all shouting....I can understand his unhappiness at the Royalists encroachment of the Common People's liberties and I can understand him fully remonstrating his feelings in the House of Commons but Harris seems to shout in nearly every scene. So much so that by the end of the movie he is struggling for breath.Conversely Alec Guiness's Charles I is far more intelligently done. Underplayed yet convincing  too some extents we feel more sympathetic to his plight. After all he has a rather scheming Cathloic French Queen the Catholic Church and a lot of other distractions to occupy his mind and usurp his powers.The battle scenes are convincing but don't carry the same kind of savagery than the more prosaic Braveheart. But the supporting characters do a good job and add a more rounded feel from Harris' turgid performance.The directing blows hot  cold sometimes the story drifts  meanders before pulling back into sharp focus while the choreography is sweeping  rich in content. The musical score however seems tacky  amateurish lacking any depth in conjunction with what's going on in the film.However for all its faults and historical inaccuracies we do get a slightly better insight into a rather grim  dark chapter in England's turbulent history.Cromwell is a good film but should be taken with a large pinch of salt as far as retelling history is concerned.".

Especially when one compares it to Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers made only three years later large parts of this film feel inescapably stagebound much like the historical epics that were regularly churned out during the early 1950s at the beginning of Cinemascope i.e. The Robe. Yet the battle scenes and crowd scenes are impressive in their pageantry and are about the only times in this movie where things seem to come alive. The cinematography is pretty nice and Alec Guinness's performance as King Charles is remarkable in its subtlety and complexity. But Richard Harris' performance as Cromwell verges on camp and he provides many unintentional chuckles as he chews the scenery and spits it out again with a vengeance. One wonders why they didn't just get Chuck Heston for the role. Get your stinking paws off of me you DAMNED DIRTY KING!! But maybe he just wasn't available. So here we have a grandstanding Dick Harris in what should perhaps be called Planet of the Roundheads. The major problem is that there are really no characters with the sole exception of King Charles that are interesting. Virtually everyone in this movie can be described with one adjective. Cromwell is righteous the Queen is scheming Prince Rupert is foppish Fairfax is moderate etc. etc. It's impossible to care about any of these cardboard cutouts in fancy dress and after a while I was beginning to wish one of those Diggers would go postal and mow down the principal players with the 17th century equivalent of a Glock. The music is particularly obnoxious too a Carmina Burana ripoff complete with a chorus bellowing out at intervals REJOICE! REJOICE! And I'm not even going to touch the subject of the director's highly questionable decision to canonize someone like Oliver Cromwell whose character might be charitably called complex. I'm not even Irish but my stomach was lurching at those many moments when Richard Harris was staring nobly off into the distance while that damn chorus screeched away in the background like it was the umpteenth millionth remake of Quo Vadis.However with all this said it's impossible for me to hate this movie. It tries... so... hard! The final result is dubious to say the least but at least the project's ambition is commendable and rather touching in a way. Cromwell is a noble experiment which rather like Cromwell's Commonwealth itself ends ultimately in failure. But hey on the bright side at least there's Alec Guinness!".

Alec Guiness is amazing as Charles he's obviously researched the role well with his Scottish tinge in his voice and stutter.....although a bit of bow leggedness wouldn't go amiss as Charles suffered from Ricketts as a child.The film does have some nice small historical references like Essex taking his coffin into battle and the prayer that Cromwell says before Edgehill although this was actually said by a Royalist captain. Another inaccuracy that really riles me ooh god i am sad I've noticed is that Cromwell didn't single handedly train the NMA and he certainly was not the Supreme Commander of the Parlimentary forces this was Sir Thomas Fairfax.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason the English cinema seems to prefer the sixteenth century to the seventeenth. There have been numerous films about the Tudor dynasty most recently Elizabeth The Golden Age and The Other Boleyn Girl but fewer about their Stuart successors apart from Restoration romps and bodicerippers like Forever Amber or Stage Beauty which generally feature a walkon part for Charles II.Cromwell is one of the few exceptions. As the title suggests it is based on the life of Oliver Cromwell and concentrates on the 1640s the decade during which Cromwell rose from a modest Huntingdonshire country squire to commander of the Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and played a leading role in the deposition and execution of King Charles I. It has less to say about Cromwell's rule as Lord Protector of Great Britain and Ireland in the 1650s.The film has been criticised for its historical inaccuracies. This sort of thing can normally be put down to a lack of adequate research and the film does indeed contain a few mistakes of this type. Cromwell's son Oliver junior was not killed at the Battle of Naseby but died of natural causes and the Earl of Essex and the Earl of Manchester are shown as sitting in the House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. In most cases however inaccuracies which might appear to be careless errors are really deliberate distortions made to fit in with the film's underlying agenda which is to whitewash Cromwell's character and to present him as a hero of democracy.In the period leading up to the Civil War Cromwell's prominence in the opposition to Charles I is exaggerated. In a meeting which never took place he is shown as telling the King that England should be a democracy and he is incorrectly numbered among the five members of Parliament whom Charles attempts to arrest.During the war itself the film depicts Cromwell as singlehandedly transforming the Parliamentary Army after a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Edgehill from a disorganised rabble into an effective fighting force and as a military genius whose tactics are responsible for the defeat of a numerically superior Royalist force at the Battle of Naseby. In fact Edgehill was an indecisive battle rather than an outright Royalist victory if Charles had won as decisively as he is shown doing here the war would probably have been over very quickly and at Naseby it was the defeated Royalists not the victorious Roundheads who were outnumbered. The film omits the Battle of Marston Moor arguably a more decisive turningpoint than Naseby possibly because Cromwell was not in overall command of the Parliamentary armies on that occasions. The commanders in that battle were Sir Thomas Fairfax and Manchester neither of whom are shown in a good light in the film. To emphasise Cromwell's piety the famous prayer of the Royalist Sir Jacob Astley at Edgehill is put into his mouth.The main reason why the film does not concentrate too much on Cromwell's record after 1649 is that that record will not bear too much scrutiny if one regards him as a hero. Although one view of history has traditionally seen the Roundheads as fighting for parliamentary democracy Cromwell made himself dictator of Britain by force of arms succeeded where Charles had failed in ruling without Parliament and had himself proclaimed Lord Protector monarch in all but name. Had his son Richard who briefly and ineffectually succeeded him been a man of the same ruthless stamp Britain might today be a Hereditary Protectorate under the House of Cromwell. The greatest stain on Cromwell's memory the brutal subjugation of Ireland which cost several hundreds of thousands of lives is totally ignored. The film gives the impression that he spent the years in question 164953 living peacefully on his farm in Huntingdon.As a costume drama the film is not a bad one and succeeds in bringing seventeenthcentury England to life. Richard Harris is not particularly good in the title role especially as he is not always successful in concealing his Irish accent. Given Cromwell's antipathy to and persecution of the Irish it seemed ironic to have him played by an Irishman. There is however an excellent performance from Alec Guinness as Charles I who is treated more objectively than are his political opponents. There is no attempt to blacken Charles' character although there are a couple of inaccuracies. Charles did not treat his nephew Prince Rupert as shabbily as he is shown doing here and his trusted adviser Sir Edward Hyde did not testify against him at his trial. Had Hyde done so he would doubtless have been executed at the Restoration instead of becoming Charles II's chief minister. Guinness plays Charles as a man who beneath his outward dignity and firm belief in the Divine Right of Kings is nervous hesitant and selfdoubting something indicated by a stammer. One senses from Guinness' portrayal that although Charles was a bad king he may not have been a bad man.Some have seen a film which praises a republican rebel as revolutionary but in fact hagiography of Cromwell is far from something new. The film's politics fall broadly within the Whig tradition which saw English history in terms of a steady progression towards the triumph of liberty and Protestantism two concepts which for the Whigs were practically indistinguishable and the Civil War as a vital step in this process. The film also shows the influence of Thomas Carlyle who regarded Cromwell as one of the heroes of history and eulogised him in his Heroes and HeroWorship. By 1970 however this approach to history was starting to look outdated and Carlyle's idea of heroworship hopelessly naive. If the charismatic dictators of the twentieth century have taught us anything it is to beware of the strong man on the white horse. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "In the next paragraphs I will give two separate reviewone for INTELLIGENT people and one for the DUMB. You can decide for yourself which you prefer or combine the two to get a decent overall view of the film. But first I should point out that I am a history teacher and know a decent amount about the Lord Protector and the English Civil Warso I really do have some idea what I am talking about when it comes to this movie.FOR INTELLIGENT PEOPLE and PSEUDOINTELLECTUAL SNOBS like Frasier CraneConsidering that there is practically no mention of the English Civil War in films this film is about your best bet to get a decent though very flawed overview of this important period in English history.First the production values are generally excellent. While the cinematography is lovely and it looks like a rather expensivelooking film it is sometimes cheapened by a lousy sound track. All the religiousthemed music gets annoying very fastmuch like the chanting you hear in THE OMEN. Second let's discuss the acting. At times it is pretty lousywith poor performances by both Richard Harris and Timothy Daltonas well as the rather wooden performances by the supporting cast aside from Alec Guinness.Harris does his best imitation of Captain Kirk as he bellows and overacts and then barely whispers his lines. I half expected him to yell out KHAN!!!!! a couple times in the film see STAR TREK II for more info. I also was reminded of Dave Thomas' very funny imitation of Harris on SCTV. While he was decent as Dumbledore he never underplayed ANYTHING. Here in this film he just seemed at times like he needed his meds. Plus who was the total idiot that thought an Irishman should play Cromwell??!! They looked nothing alike and to this day Cromwell is seen by the Irish as the AntiChrist! How can the most antiIrish man of the last millennium be portrayed by an Irish actor? It's just wrong.As for Timothy Dalton I laughed at his campy performance throughout the film as he played a character more reminiscent of Liberace than a cavalry officer. And I was left totally confusedwas he supposed to be a gay fop who went into battle with his Bichon Frise or was he supposed to be a great cavalry leader? The film couldn't seem to decide which. How this guy later went on to be James Bond is beyond me...but that is more a discussion for the IMDb discussion boards.As mentioned above most of the other actors are rather wooden and undeveloped. However Alec Guinness does probably the best job of anyone in the movie since he is a marvelous actor and had a somewhat fleshedout rolethough the character of Charles I was REALLY REALLY REALLY sketchy in the film. The movie made him appear pretty sympathetic whereas in reality he was much more complicated and rather unlikable. I think his reallife supporters followed him NOT because he was a good king but because they implicitly believed ALL kings are ordained by God and MUST be followed.And this brings me to the biggest problem with the film. The English Civil War and the reign of the Lord Protector Cromwell was just way too much for a single film. At the least it should have been broken into several movies or a protracted miniseries. Or the scope of the film should have been much more limited. Instead the many battles appeared to be only a couplewhereas in reality the king lost and was forced to capitulate several timesonly to organize ANOTHER army and restart the war again. The king was only killed after it appeared that there was no other way to stop these warsthough Royalists may balk at my simplified assessment. Considering I am a bloody American it's easy to understand how I tend to favor any action limiting the power of kings.Also the entire reign of Cromwell as the Lord Protector was summed up in a very simplistic epilogue tacked on to the very end of the film. You COULD assume that either Cromwell was a great and benevolent leader or you could assume his reign was pointless since after his death the Stuart kings regained the throneboth are only partial truths.However if you look at this film NOT as true history but an amalgamation of facts into a basically true overview it is excellent and much closer to the truth than films such as BRAVEHEART or oldtime Hollywood historicals such as THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. The facts are generally true with many exceptions pointed out by astute reviewers on IMDb and the overall tone of the film is quite rousing and accurate. Look at it as more of a CLIFFNOTES or CLASSIC COMICS account of English history and you realize it does succeed quite well. And considering it's all we really have on film from this era it's at least an excellently produced film and worth watching. I strongly recommend it for teens as such an overview. Plus it's not boring and keeps your interest.Now for the review for DUMB peoplethere is some killing but keeping up with what's happening is really tough. So try not to fall asleep during the long speechifying scenes or just have a friend wake you when it gets good after all NO movie worth watching lasts more than 90 minutes. Hold on and grit your teeth and eventually something cool will happen such as a battle or the king getting his head lopped off. It's not terribly funny and there are no boobs so it isn't strongly recommendedbut enough killing to at least make it better than Shakespeare. Plus after you tell people you saw this movie they'll have some newfound respect for you.".

	schema:headline " Cromwell overburdened but film an enjoyable spectacle overall";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the middle years of the 17th century. The English constitution lies in an uncertain state and a legal mess. Our then Stuart King Charles I has walked on a parliamentaryset tightrope for 10 years in abstinence of holding parliaments and by levying unpopular taxes on the people of England. Religious disputes lie in an undercurrent of powershifting scenarios and Charles is unwavering in his belief of divine ordinance from God. And so emerges Cromwell to heroically salvage the kingdom from Charles and endless civil war in this film portrayed mostly as Cromwell the Glorious Cromwell the brilliant and Cromwell the resolute. Richard Harris does a suitable job as each of these Cromwells. The script and film may have benefited from emphasising more on Cromwell's humbler background and strengthening his case by developing his unwilling character early on. Instead the film's Cromwell is placed as a prominent MP in the Long Parliament and is one of the impeached during the royal retaliation to the Grand Remonstrance which we see in the relatively early stages of the film. I thought this was historically inaccurate and an error to champion Cromwell the politician before championing Cromwell the military leader which is how he saw himself and how he probably should have ultimately been portrayed. This would have aided the film later on when we finally see him as the reluctant politician towards the end waiving the opportunity to be King Oliver I and in one of Harris's finer moments showing Cromwell's humbler side and his yearning for a republic no longer roughshod by a tyrannical King.The most engaging scene in the film however is Charles I's public execution. Many historians wax lyrical about Charles' finest hour being the preceding one before his death and thus his martyrdom in speech and performance was made exclusive from his somewhat arguably grander political failings. Alec Guinness is superb in portraying Charles the unwavering Martyr showing courage and wonderfully saying 'I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown'. This scene is perhaps the most spookily accurate one of the film as you sense the paradox in allegiances that many people must have been feeling in the lead in to this scene.All in all a film worth seeing and engaging enough wonderful battle scenes in the middle worth a mention. The ardent historian may fidget in their seat over Cromwell's script and image but the less concerned will enjoy Harris's Cromwell and Guiness's Charles to the extent that by the end of the film they will ponder as to whose side they would have joined if they lived in England in the 1640s. And in this sense the film achieves the spirit of the times.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN HISTORICAL INACCURACIES A couple of years ago a poll here in jolly old England placed Oliver Cromwell our one time Lord High Protector and all round lover of the Irish Countryside tenth in a list of 'Great Britons'. Cromers not known for his sense of humour during the prolonged period of civil war an epoch that he never referred to as a trilogy of bloody purging though that would have been terrific might have nevertheless enjoyed the irony that he'd been beaten by amongst others a ardent Royalist and er a member of the Royal Family though thankfully deceased. Thats gratitude for you! Indeed we've forgotten some of the efforts made by the man the Irish call 'that little s' to reform the country among more egalitarian lines a axe being incredibly useful in that respect. Never fear though Richard Harris is here! In Cromwell a curiously lonesome attempt at fashioning an epic based on the former dictator's life an Irishman no less tries to get to grips with an historically tricky individual and though producing something about as accurate as a Disney animated musical nows there's a movie I'd pay to see buffers the screen with enough off the scale table thumping gusto to really deliver the goods in cinematic terms. First time viewers hoping to find out more about English History should read a book instead  Christopher Hill is my recommendation if your interested for fans of bombast and battle though you've come to the right place. Perhaps aware of the fact that he's playing a man loathed by his own countrymen a genuinely insane Richard Harris goes to the event horizon of ham and dares to steer a course through. His performance is nonsense but sublimely entertaining. Contrast his by GOD!s and long exquisitely delivered long speeches with Alec Guinness'turn as the illfated Charles I. Guinness plays it straight and not without a degree of dignified restraint making the King a deluded by human bit of executioners fodder. The two styles are so different as to be distracting in fact you haven't seen anything like it since Shatner and Stewart had a chat in Star Trek Generations. Good as the King is though here as then he's blown away by Harris' titular histrionics. He may look like he's auditioning for a Shakespeare Parody but who cares when its this much fun to watch. Add the scope afforded by some good looking sets a good battle scene and some nice supporting performances not least by Timothy Dalton who's almost as good here as he was in Flash Gordon a decade later and you've got a very stirring two and a half hours on your hands. Fans of civil war may wonder what happened to the not unimportant battle of Marston Moor absent here so how Parliament won the first war is a bit of mystery  perhaps it was by the sheer force of Harris' delivery and miss the fact the third conflict is lost in a 30 second bit of narration at the end that talks up Cromwell's achievements after the King's execution but leaves out all the good stuff like the conflict in Ireland and the grisly postrestoration exhumation though I suppose its better to leave it on a upbeat note rather an a close up of the great man's decomposed severed head on a spike. So the lesson of Cromwell is that History sucks so you should ignore the bits that don't play too well. True of course because given the choice between the real thing all dour and droning on about Catholic persecution this and the King can't do that i'd rather spend time with Harris any day. Hail to the Chief!".

Arguably one side cannot exist without the other and it is their coexistence as well as a powerful free press which gives us our relatively benign system today.Cromwell's 'experiment' was stillborn in executing Charles he destroyed his own blueprint for a new society and only cut the head from a multi stranded Hydra.

I don't know how anyone can give this movie a 10. It's like I've no idea what the movie was about so it must have been good. or if I say I didn't get it people will think I dumb.And I don't respect who give it a 5 by saying the story deserves a 0 but it is so pretty that I will give it a 5.

	schema:reviewBody "Attending the official screening at the 'Sala Grande' at the Venice film festival. The applause for the attending actors finally stops and I find myself waiting with some excitement for a film created by one of the most praised directors of the moment lining up some great names like Ben Affleck Rachel McAdams Javier Bardem and Olga Kurylenko. I was also expecting another great actress to appear on the screen Rachel Weisz. I would soon find out that she was being cut out and some more were. It is not the first time this happens. Malick has a notable history of cutting actors out of his films which is of course his good right.After a typical romantic scene in Paris more resembling a travel advert then anything else I start to get nervous. Why? Because the romantic blahblah doesn't seem to stop. An overhead voice speaking french doesn't make a movie artistic. Loosely filmed scenes in corn fields are not per definition beautiful.Kurylenko in the role of Marina comes to the hometown of Neil Affleck some nowhere ville in Oklahoma where they continue their fairytale romance. Kurylenko is constantly doing little dances and pirouettes on the street or whereever she is located. Giggling singing hopping on the bed and looking over her shoulder while laughing towards the camera. That kind of sums it up since Affleck hardly speaks a word. He is just the typical guy and she is just the typical so calledartisticfrenchlovingandbeautiful girl. After she and her daughter return to Paris he has a identical affair with his hometown sweetheart McAdams as if super attractive women are just available everywhere. Then Kurylenko returns because she needs a Greencard. Explained in just one very meaningful phrase Forgive me they have a fight. Also very typical but yes finally some action!. Of course some kind of vase is shattered and its all tears and gestures.Then suddenly Javier Bardem appears as a priest seeking spiritual fulfillment in a church. These scenes seem detached from the rest of the story although the same church is visited by other characters. Some cleaning personnel and people who are 'worn down by life' are also given some screen time placed randomly into the movie in high contrast to the blazing beauty of the main characters.The religious undertone becomes stronger and stronger towards the end of the movie making it all too clear that love and religion are one and the same. And that all of the Hallmarkinspired beauty seen before must be powered by the divine.Enforcing religion onto an audience reminds me of brainwashing and it is something I cannot appreciate. Showing religion in a movie is no problem since it is a part of most people's lives but trying to emotionally convey someone to a certain religion doesn't matter which one should be a priest's job not a film director's.I must say I admire the wish to look upon cinema in new ways and I can see very clearly what the idea was for making this movie Malick tries to tell a story by not showing the key moments conversations or explanations he shows the inbetween. The silent moments 'life'.This is how the movie fails there doesn't seem to anything inbetween. The emotions seem empty love seems superficial religion is fake.The thing is I applaud to art cinema I am very much fond of romantic stories I love it when a filmmaker pays attention to cinematography. Maybe all of this made me more disappointed in To The Wonder then anyone else.After it was finished some applause but also loud booing was heard from the audience. I sure wasn't the only one frustrated and appalled by this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "TO THE WONDER is the new film from master writerdirector Terrence Malick. The story begins with Ben Affleck's character Neil in Paris where he falls inlove with a single mother named Marina played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko. Neil brings his new love and her daughter Tatiana back home with him to the United States. When Marina's visa expires and Affleck's character is reluctant to marry her Marina and her daughter return to Paris. Neil begins spending his time with a childhood friend Jane played by Rachel McAdams. However Jane is a woman of great faith a faith that Neil does not share. Back in Paris Tatiana leaves to go live with her father and Marina becomes depressed longing to return to the US to try to work things out with Neil. It is at this point that the story falls apart.It's impossible not to compare TO THE WONDER to THE TREE OF LIFE simply because the two films are shot in the exact same style. Beautiful shots and gorgeous cinematography accompanied by a classical score and poetic voiceovers from the characters. The Tree of Life was and is not only a masterpiece but one of the greatest films to ever be made. I thought maybe To The Wonder was a little too soon for another Malick epic but I do not believe that is the case as far as why this film fails.The two characters I felt for and wanted to see more of was Javier Bardem's Father Quintana and Rachel McAdams' Jane. Here we have a priest struggling in his relationship with God and a woman who has suffered through the grief and loss of a child yet has found a way to continue living in harmony with great faith. These highly interesting characters are underused as the film focuses more on Neil and Marina who by the end of the film we begin to hate.The actors do not help the film tell it's story it almost seems like they walked onset without a script and improvised their parts. In Tree Of Life we had Jessica Chastain Sean Penn and Brad Pitt giving the performances of a lifetime not through dialogue but simply through facial expression movement and body language. There wasn't a need for scenes of dialogue the story was understood. With To The Wonder I was craving a scene of dialogue towards the end. I didn't want to believe Affleck and Kurylenko's characters were as shallow and selfish as they seemed I wanted and felt I deserved to know more about them and why they continued to struggle. Why are they so frustrated and angry? No matter how abstract or convoluted a film is I've never had an issue coming to some sort of an understanding and usually the more a film leaves open for me to interpret myself the more I respect the film. However To The Wonder leaves us with two characters we no longer have any reason to care for and the film gives us no way to understand or relate to them in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always wondered about people who give one star reviews. Is it for the extra attention? Is it a joke? Can a movie really deserve one star?Well finally I have seen a movie which simply does not permit me to give it any more than one star. A movie that has prompted me to create an IMDb account and write this review so that other cinema goers do not have to share the mind numbing agony of my experience. My woes stem from the fact that To the Wonder seems to be an experiment into expressing nothing but the emotions of love and loss. Initially this seems a noble cause but it comes at the expense of plot dialogue and even character development. So if you sit through the first 30 minutes thinking I wonder if anything is going to happen? sadly the answer is no. There seems to be the assumption that an audience can share in the on screen emotion without ever being given access to the motivations and events which led to them. It is like watching The English Patient and trying to understand Ralph Fiennes' emotional turmoil without being shown the flashbacks of his life before hospital. So without any narrative or dialogue the poor actors are left trying to convey their emotions by looking gloomy as Ben Affleck does for the entire movie or by performing pirouettes and looking wistfully into glinting autumn sunshine for Olga Kurylenko.If you are a huge fan of the back of Ben Affleck's head you'll love this movie. For me the only enjoyment was in the irony that a film about emotion should be so emotionally uninvolving. That and the joy of seeing the end credits finally roll upon which I punched the air and shouted Yes! This is something I have never felt the need to do before in a cinema and it certainly surprised my wife who looked mortified. I didn't care. This film marked a new found level of tedium so extreme that it should probably be reserved for Guantanamo Bay. One star tedium? You bet.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is closest to a silent film that I've ever seen. The plot is really simple. Neil Ben Affleck and Marina Olga Kurylenko fall for each other in Paris and then they move to Oklahoma where Neil works. You really couldn't have made a more obvious comparison between the old world with Paris and the new world with Bartlesville Oklahoma. Marina doesn't really enjoy it there and they grow apart. Neil rekindles his love with an old crush Jane Rachel McAdams. It doesn't work out and Neil and Marina get together again. The characters also meet with a priest Javier Bardem who is having a crisis of faith. Ben Affleck looks like he's been hit on the head with a shovel for most of the movie. He just walks around dazed not really there. Olga Kurylenko just spins and runs in fields streets and parks giggling and smiling at the same time with Affleck's character following her nearby. They also stare at each other a lot wideeyed and wistful. I mean for real there's only a certain amount of this stuff that I can take seriously. Javier Bardem is the clich priest trying to speak to God through inane ruminations on faith. Feeling he's there but seeing nothing 'Show us how to seek you' and so on. This isn't interesting in the slightest. Rachel McAdams well she's there for a bit and then she's gone again. The overly poetic and pretentious voiceovers are like a selfparody of Malick's style with platitudes like 'What is this love that loves us' going on and on. Affleck and Kurylenko don't even look like people who could be saying those things. During the whole movie I just thought they'd fit perfectly to a high class perfume advertisement. You might believe they'd speak like they do in the voiceovers if there was any proper characterization. The motivations and histories of these characters are unclear. There's no real dialogue between the characters and it was impossible for me to care what happens to any of them. The actors don't really have much to do except silently look at each other. The film is beautiful visually but it ultimately feels empty. Many of the shots seem completely unrelated to anything. Rainwater falling in a drain a shot of a puddle a street light in the dark an rundown house a row of houses in some random neighborhood a classical pot during the sunset. What is the point of all these shots? Maybe they're shot with skill but they're utterly pointless. Malick's Thin Red Line is a masterpiece and it actually used these kind of beautiful shots to contrast the destructiveness of man with how nature simply goes on anyway despite all of this and it was brilliant and quite profound. The line between profound and pretentious can be extremely thin though and in To The Wonder Malick went way over it to pretentiousland. What really worries me now is that after seeing this pretentious nonsense I can't go back to the Thin Red Line and enjoy it as much as I have because I'll keep thinking about this movie. What's also bugging me is the constant use of magic hour shots. Sure it's beautiful but to fill the entire movie with them? Again it's like someone who doesn't like Malick's filming style went out of his way to parody him. Cinematography itself isn't enough it should serve a compelling story. I wasn't just looking for beautiful images I was looking for a movie.".

What really worries me now is that after seeing this pretentious nonsense I can't go back to the Thin Red Line and enjoy it as much as I have because I'll keep thinking about this movie. What's also bugging me is the constant use of magic hour shots. Sure it's beautiful but to fill the entire movie with them? Again it's like someone who doesn't like Malick's filming style went out of his way to parody him. Cinematography itself isn't enough it should serve a compelling story. I wasn't just looking for beautiful images I was looking for a movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Some people say that film is like a language but that is not exactly right it is like language itself and just as there are different languages there are different cinemas. It seems to me that in his last two films Terrence Malick has been creating a very special type of cinema that had hitherto existed only in an embryonic form. While most films have maybe 50100 scenes replete with dialogue and action Malick's new cinema MNC has over twice that number of scenes but they are fragmentary and consist of only the essence of meaning that was in a scene that would normally have been much longer. This can be sometimes several minutes or only a couple of brief shots.Last evening I drove the 25 miles to see the early performance of 'To the Wonder'. I did that with the intention of returning to write this review while the film was still fresh in my mind. But after it I was so drained that I couldn't write a summary let alone a review. At the current late stage in my life what interests me most about the cinema is its limits. How far can the cinema go and what exactly is a film?Given the above Terrence Malick is evidently the man for me and I am convinced that 'The Tree of Life' is among the five greatest works of this greatest of the arts. So after a masterpiece 30 years in the gestation and three  in the creation how would Malick fare with a film relatively thrown together in a year or so?On the face of it this is a story of the relationship which starts in Paris between an American environmentalist? Neil and an otherworldly French woman Marina. When they return to midwest America Marina suffers from a sense of dislocation made greater when he daughter decides to go and live with her father in France.But Malick seems much less interested in the events which he depicts than in expressing the feelings of the characters. Just the same way that 'The Tree of Life' was an impression of childhood rather than the story of a childhood 'To the Wonder' is an impression of a love affair rather than its story. This is cinema infused in every shot with Heidegger's dasein. The logic of Malick's cinema is to perfectly catch the moment and in doing so extract the truth of the experience. Hence for Malick a film story is simply an assembly of 'essences'. These essences stay in the mind to thrill and haunt us. There have been other examples of great filmmakers who have made films exploring the cinema's intimate connection with mental processes  Resnais and Bunuel come immediately to mind. But with Malick it seems the cinema's similarity to the mental processes of memory dream and conjecture have ignited a wildfire of creativity that has advanced the film art at a greater pace than has occurred since the sixties. Here I have to admit to being only at the beginning of being able to appreciate what seems to be dizzying complexities in the film. My French is not up to totally understanding much of Marina's dialogue which as I am in France was not translated in the subtitles so I am sure I have missed an entire dimension of the film. But Olga Kurylenko's performance is so magnificent that this 'comprehension gap' didn't seem a problem.Then there is the obvious question of the film's theme. Love the very 'different' nature of women dislocation in the physical emotional and cultural senses  these are all up there writ large. But they are mixed with a nagging worry that to return to my earlier concern Malick has stretched the cinema to its limits but sometimes maybe beyond them. I do not think of myself as stupid but I found great difficulty in grasping the relevance of certain shots or scenes. I rest convinced however that this is another example of a film that it is necessary to watch dozens of times to find all of the poetic and meaningful connections.I have great sympathy with those who go to the cinema wanting to be told a great story in the clearest manner possible. That is honourable and reasonable but it is not the only experience that the cinema this great and wonderful art of the cinema can give. And it is certainly NOT the case that films that don't take the more prosaic approach are pretentious meaningless or boring. 'To the Wonder' is to popular cinema what lyric poetry is to airport novels. So if that is all you are looking for it is best to avoid Malick's film. But for those of us who know that beyond the sky is the limit for great cinema Malick and MNC is the route to the stars and 'To the Wonder' is a step if a somewhat halting one along that route.".

He has a very loyal group of fans of which I am one who appreciate the unique mental and emotional ride that his projects provide. To say that his films are not accessible is understandable. His objective is to challenge you to access your own beliefs and thoughts rather than the characters in his movies ... they are simply the tools he uses.Less than two years ago I was struggling to put thoughts into words after watching Malick's The Tree of Life. Now in record time for him he releases another film that is even more impressionistic ... actually abstract is not too strong a description. The usual Malick elements are present  nature uncomfortable relationships minimal dialogue breathtaking photography and powerful music. Where The Tree of Life focused on Creation and Family this latest takes on Love and Faith.Water imagery is a frequent key as we see the personal relationship mimic the changing of the seasons. Neil Ben Affleck an American visiting Paris meets and falls for Marina Olga Kurylenko a freespirited local filled with light and energy. Their love affair moves to the stunning Mont SaintMichel before settling in the drab plains of Bartlesville Oklahoma.It's not surprising that the relationship suffers as the newness wears thin. The interesting part is how Malick presents it. We mostly witness bits and pieces ... he shows us moments not events. We easily see that Neil's aloofness and sullen looks don't jibe with Marina's effervescence. When she returns to Paris Neil easily falls in with an old flame played by Rachel McAdams. When she later accuses him of making what they had nothing we all understand what she means ... and why.While Neil is proving what a lost soul he is we also meet Father Quintana Javier Bardem. He has lost the light of his faith and is in full crisis mode even as he attempts to console and guide Marina. There is no secret that much of this film is autobiographical and that Malick is working through wounds he still carries these many years later. As a moviegoer there is little to be gained from Alleck's disconnected character or from Kurylenko dancing in the rain. The real prize is awakening the thoughts and feelings many of us probably buried over the years to hide emotional pain. Malick seems to be saying that it's OK to acknowledge your foundation regardless of your ability to succeed in a socially acceptable manner.If you prefer not to dig so deep emotionally this is a beautiful film to look at  thanks to Director of Photograpy Emmanuel Lubezki a frequent Malick collaborator and listen to  a blended soundtrack with many notable pieces from various composers. While this will be remembered as Roger Ebert's final movie review he liked it very much it will likely have very little appeal to the average movie watcher  and I'm confident that Terrence Malick is fine with that.".

At the same time all of the hand held camera work lends a sense of a misconstrued narrative that has been made so popular by all of the fake reality TV shows. Nothing wrong with hand held camera work just ask Jack Torrence!! Exactly!! All of that camera work in the Shining provides a narrative point of view and meaning To the Wonder implies some on ground omniscient point of view when coupled with the story just washes out to a tag line that should read dude don't marry crazy chicks and when you love someone that you have everything in common with and don't dump her because of nostalgia or the good ol' times. Pretty common sense granted I'm sure that we've all stepped in the same pile of crap more then once in life but by the time we are in our late thirties or early forties experience tends to make the right decisions for us. And the same can be said about this picture in every way.".

I came here to see The Master but was also interested in Malicks new film. i was hesitant to get excited for it though. Malick is widely regarded as a control freak as a director meditating for years and releasing his films incredibly infrequently. i felt that it was way too early between drinks for malick to release another work. after such a personal film like TTOF i thought this might be more of a minor work like how the Coen brothers did No Country and followed up with the minimalistic screwball comedy 'burn after reading'. How unprepared and wrong i was.To The Wonder is a magnificent film. The tree of life was a towering achievement IMHO and this film doesn't fall short by much in terms of scope ambition and achievement. by any standards its a great film. its a strong addition to malick's small yet vital body of work. The acting is very good but like TTOF takes a a bit of a back seat for malick to do his thing. Affleck and McAdams a very good as are bardem and kurylenko. i don't want to give away to many plot specifics or character details. most of that is in the lengthy plot synopsis released online yesterday anyway. it is very dreamlike and has a lack of dialogue like TTOF. it tells most of its story through imagery music and how characters physically act towards each other. i never liked affleck as an actor before this. he's good here but i wouldn't have minded someone else in the role.About what affleck said yesterday. that to the wonder makes TTOF look like transformers. that statement is so exaggerated and pretty much wrong. if anything TTOF is still more experimental than TO THE WONDER. that doesn't detract from the huge ambition of this film though. I'm so excited to see malick working quicker now. it really is a dream to have malick films in 3 successive years. next year is knight of cups. couldn't be more excited. like TTOF this film will richly reward repeat viewing but is a little more accessible than TTOF. people who had problems with the whole universe and dinosaurs thing in TTOF wont have to worry here. although ambitious it is a little more grounded and will be more palatable to a bigger audience. thats not to say that the mainstream will embrace this film because they wont. its a malick film through and through and i couldn't be more grateful for that.Before i saw this the race for my favourite film of the year had really boiled down to THE MASTER which was great but still processing and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD. Malick's film has opened up the field. 55".

	schema:reviewBody "If you know Terrence Malick's work then you pretty much know what you're walking into when you attend his movies. His films don't look walk talk or even sing like anyone else's. He is a cinema artist whose work is quiet poetic and breaks away from the standard narrative cutting down just enough plot and dialogue so they don't seem intrusive. With this stylistic approach he is at work in a sea of mostly cookiecutters. Other directors tread safe waters of action and romance while Malick is satisfied to let our expectations wade just a bit. We become lost in his tapestry of images. If you're willing to give yourself to his lyrical canvas you find his work engrossing. If not you'll find it frustrating and boring. It is strictly up to you.To the Wonder his latest film is an engaging cinematic poem that explores the mysterious chasms of the human heart. Wherein his last film The Tree of Life contrasted the evolution of the universe with his memories of growing up in Texas this one tries to encompass the evolution of a relationship from courting to settling in to marriage and eventually to its breakdown all told with stunning images and a winsome soundtrack. What dialogue exists is heard in passing. We hear only what we need to hear the visual canvas tells the story.There isn't a lot that we need to be told in To the Wonder because having experienced the rise and fall of relationships in our own lives we recognize the situation. We meet Neil Ben Affleck and Marina Olga Kurylenko lovers who are spending time in Paris. He's an Oklahoman she's a single mother from the Ukraine. We catch up with them after they have already fallen deeply in love in Paris at the prehistoric island of Mont SaintMichel. Neil brings Marina home with him to Oklahoma to an area where he works overseeing the construction of a Southwestern suburb  moving from an ancient European preserve to the modern MiddleAmerican world of rapid reconstruction she is a stranger in a strange land. The sparseness of the dialogue symbolizes the lack of communication between them.They settle into a life together but then real life comes calling. They can't marry by sacrament of the Catholic church she has an issue concerning a former marriage among other normal everyday problems that occur in a relationship. What happens in their union is not surprising given what we know of them. They argue they make mistakes they reunite they breakup they makeup. They love each other from the depth of their being and their reaction to one another startles us. There is a moment when he becomes angry with her leaving her stranded by the side of the road but what he does next is surprising. You don't see it in other films.What is surprising is the way in which their story is told. Malick breaks away from the phony Hallmark version of romance that is obtrusive in most Hollywood romances by telling us just enough about these people to allow us to care deeply about them. Ben Affleck who has reinvented himself as a director and a much more focused actor uses his screenpresence to great effect. He is the masculine part of this equation. Olga Kurylenko seen this month in the Tom Cruise adventure Oblivion is an extraordinarily beautiful Ukranian actress possessing a face and an essence that Vermeer might have captured on canvas. We're less familiar with her than we are with Affleck and that make her much more of a mystery to us.Their story is compelling but it is only part of a larger canvas. Another story happening around them focuses on a Spanish priest Father Quintana Javier Bardem who has come to Oklahoma making him another stranger in a strange land. His eyes tell us everything that we need to know. He is a servant of God devoted to his work but whose heart is feeling the pangs of emptiness. All around him are people in joy and pain. He officiates a wedding later he visits inmates at a prison. He visits the sick and the elderly but there is doubt in his eyes. He wonders about his placement in God's service has he given himself to the cloth at the expense of a joyful life? There is also the suspicion that he is feeling confined by his vows. He can officiate and comfort but as a priest he is unable to have a life of his own. He sees lovers getting married but he knows that he can never experience this. Bardem in his best work is an actor who can speak volumes without speaking a word. It's all there in his face. In mainstream films he plays villains as in Skyfall or his Oscarwinning performance in No Country for Old Men but this role proves that he can also be quietly and powerfully introspective.Malick's films are not for everyone. There has been a mixed reaction to this film from critics who charge that he has made a film of empty images. You might agree or disagree depending on your point of view. This is not a popcorn movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is a work of art a symphony of images with very few words. It is one of those movies that on the surface seems baffling and incomprehensible but the deeper we look the more it reveals. of four".

It doesn't start out too bad and the promise of some event or occurrence is what kept me watching unfortunately it never arrives and what transpires is that this film is a snapshot of some random peoples thoughts about love and life. If it wasn't for Olga Kurylenko's lovable character I would have scored the film 110. Ben Affleck could be absolutely anyone in this film he is ill cast and appears as a bumbling mute giant devoid of any thought or character. The cinematography is at times wonderful and I get the link to God and creation but the insertion of a priest Javier Bardem!!! into the mixing pot of jumbled thoughts that is the script is a blatant and insulting attempt to get the viewer to draw some ethereal conclusion and leaving them fulfilled....it doesn't.".

	schema:headline " A series of images adding up to one relationship and you get to add the meaning";
	schema:reviewBody "Following up the dramatic success of The Tree of Life 2011 Terrence Malick has gone simpler but more abstract with To the Wonder. Following only one relationship we see Neil Ben Affleck and Marina Olga Kurylenko fall in love grow apart fight to stay together and fight to stay apart. It's about the resolution or lack of resolution of one illfated romantic relationship. The key is that we see them in these various stages. This is an entirely visual film with nothing else. No dialogue. There are a few random lines of narration and even fewer lines that one character may speak to another character but following the strict definition of dialogue  a conversation between two or more people  there is no dialogue. There also isn't any characters. That's not really true but we don't learn their names I only got them from a plot summary we don't learn anything about their past and we also don't see them in between the turning points in their relationship.The turning points in their relationship is likely a major factor in determining if you'll like the film. We apparently jump back and forth in time with flashbacks and flashforwards but there is no distinction between the scenes so you're just left to guess at what point of time they're in. But for lovers of subtle works of art it also means that you get to figure out on your own what causes the relationship to crash and burn or rise above the flames. At first I was offended by the depiction of the failing of their relationship. I thought Terrence Malick was the opposite of a misogynist and was representing women as ultimate perfection and completely innocent no matter how deplorable their actions. But then I realized that he wasn't saying anything at all. He was just presenting us with images and we get to add the meaning and words. Like a MadLib but not very funny.Take one relationship add in some beautiful scenery  both European and stateside add in some Christian undertones add in children jobs and visas to create some important societal structure within the relationship and then remove all conversations and orientation of time and you've got To the Wonder. You can get out of it almost everything that you put into it  there's always something lost in the translation.".

The Tree of Life is his finest achievement one of my five favorite films ever.

That's the problem but it's also part of its appeal. I did not have high expectations for this but I also didn't really think it would hit greatness. I was sort of right. By this point it's safe to say that you're either fond of Malick's general style or not. Obviously I am and so there's nothing here that's challenging for me as a viewer because I know what to expect. But even with his former weakest The New World there was still something unique to each of his five films. This is To The Wonder's biggest problem. The cinematography is beautiful and would blow your mind away if this was your first Malick film but as it is it's kinda predictable. The story at the core is also never fully brought to life in the way the story in his last one was although Kurylenko and McAdams both bring some truly ethereal presence. It sounds like I didn't even like it. I did but I also think it started off pretty great and kinda lost itself and got weaker as it went on. And while there's still a lot to admire I'm not surprised by the criticisms and it's finally the film where the term Malick clich can be applied to.".

	schema:headline " One of the sweetest movies I've ever seen!";
	schema:reviewBody "No contest I will say this marks the best of the Farrelly Brothers.  Not because this film is laughoutloud funnyit's funny but not hilariousbut because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions.  Sure the premise is funnya shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500pound woman who he also thinks is a fox.  It's a great premise but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone preventing it from turning it into a lame onejoke slapstick comedy.  This is a comedy with hearta rare finding.  In between laughs you really get wrapped up in the characters and storyline.  The gags flow quite naturally without the Farrellys forcing any humor onto the screen.  If a comic opportunity comes along they take advantage but there's no random acts of slapstick.I am pleasantly surprised with Jack Black who has proved in this movie that he doesn't only have what it takes as a comic actor but also as a serious actor and a romantic lead.  I've always enjoyed seeing him on screen but he usually plays the same woundup hyperkinetic characters.  Basically he's funny but you still know you're watching Jack Black on screen.  This time he exercises his ability as a method actor he succeeds well.  Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and sweet capturing the audience's sympathy with her winning smile.  Joe Viterelli is amusing as her overweight Irish father and actually pulls off a fairly convincing Irish accent.  The sizzling hot Brooke Burns makes a few appearances.  And Jason Alexander is always a joy to watch.I think Shallow Hal does the best job at conveying the message that beauty is on the inside.  It has been conveyed before in films like The Nutty Professor but I feel this film conveyed it best.  This could've easily been a 105minute fat joke but it doesn't travel that route.  There are no crude or meanspirited gags.  Could it be that the Farrelly Brothers matured?  Even of the films of theirs that I liked ex.  Dumb and Dumber There's Something About Mary are a little uneven and contain a few gags that are just plain cruel.  Like in Mary Cameron Diaz's brother is mentally ill and the butt of a few jokes.  Here we have a character that walks on both his arms and legs but he's portrayed as a normal character and not as a gimmick for some cheap laughs.  There are moments that really tugged at my heartstrings.  The burn victim scene brought quite a few tears to my eyes.  The story is solid with no boring lulls.  And the soundtrack is pretty goodI have criticized the Farrellys in the past for using crappy music in their sountracks.If you're looking for a good romanticdate movie with some good laughs and a good message Shallow Hal will be an absolute delight.My score  8 out of 10".

He carried the whole movie along with Gwyneth Paltrow and they both did an excellent job filling roles unlike any they have done before.  Many people will like this non traditional comedy that has a strong moral message.  If you are someone who enjoys a lighthearted meaningful story than definitely see this movie.  Don't be fooled by reviews that say it makes fun of overweight people only because it's message is that size doesn't and shouldn't matter. Yes the main characters are shallow and say some awful things but their main purpose is to represent those of us who need to change the way we view and treat other human beings.  I've always like Jack Black as a comedian but never pictured him as a boyfriend character until seeing this movie.  He was able to transform the very shallow unappealing Hal into a very likeable person. See it for Gwyneth if anything she is very cute in it.".

I wasn't too thrilled with There's Something About Mary after all the hyped reviews I was thinking that their other movies would be like that. Especially with the touchy subject of obesity in our world that usually big people are not attractive making it into a comedy is tricky. But somehow I really loved Shallow Hal. Even though it was a bit hypocritical it's still really funny and I think it's mainly due to the cast. Jack Black made for a great male lead going from a total jerk into someone that the audience absolutely adored in the end.Hal a superficial man and his equally shallow friend Mauricio share an interest in beautiful women and try to act cool and hip when around them but most women find them obnoxious and want nothing to do with them. Hal wants to see women for their inner beauty but his fixation on physical beauty gets in the way. By a twist of fate Hal meets the famous American life coach Tony Robbins while stuck in an elevator. Robbins understanding Hal's situation hypnotizes him into seeing people's inner beauty not their external selves. Subsequently Hal meets and is smitten by Rosemary the daughter of his boss. Rosemary appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind generous nature but is in actuality morbidly obese. Rosemary who is used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance initially interprets Hal's interest in her as mocking and insulting but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine. Mauricio becomes worried about Hal's new taste in women especially when he finds Hal is in a relationship with Rosemary. One night while Hal is on a date with Rosemary Mauricio catches him and says the trigger phrase Shallow Hal wants a gal which breaks Hal's hypnosis. Now Hal has to learn on his own that the woman that he loves may not have been all that in the looks department but is everything that he actually wants in a woman.My main problem with Shallow Hal is it's shallow message unfortunately Hal if he wasn't hypnotized would have never gone for a girl like Rosemary. Even though he learns his lesson not every shallow man or woman is going to be hypnotized into seeing what true beauty is. But there are some really great laughs that Shallow Hal provides it's also just a heart warming romantic comedy. It's something different and the cast really made up for what could have been a disastrous movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind to a different kind of comedy with some good laughs.710".

He keeps failing at it and his attractive neighbor Jill even turns him down after he begs her to go out with him. The next day at his job he's bummed that he didn't get that big promotion and happens to bump into Tony Robbins in the elevator while leaving his work. They get stuck in the elevator and Hal explains him his love life. Robbins then puts a spell on him to see the inner beauty in women so that he can judge a woman based on her personality. Suddenly things starts to change for Hal. His best friend Mauricio played by Jason Alexander notices Hal's fresh new standards with his taste in women and doesn't like it one bit. Hal then begins dating a woman who is overweight named Rosemary played by Gwyneth Paltrow. He sees her as a beautiful petite woman and they hit it off. Mauricio who is much more picky with women and more shallow than Hal can't believe it.That's the plot for you and I won't spoil anything but let's just say that the story is predictable and the characters are memorable. I can't give the cast enough credit for doing such a wonderful job and it's interesting to see Jack Black like you've never seen him before departing from his usual slackerstoner role that he's given. Shallow Hal is a movie with a lot of brains and heart to it as well as a great date movie.

Hal gets trapped in an elevator with a guy who opens Hal's mind to the inner beauty of women.  Hal then suddenly finds the more unattractive girls perfect for him and this leads to some funny scenes.  This also leads him to Rose Mary a gal he finds perfect but everyone else sees a 300lb gal.  This movie says a lot about how shallow our society is and does a good job of it.  Though I don't think every unattractive or fat gal is beautiful on the inside and every attractive gal is ugly on the inside as the movie implies.  The movie also could have been more clear that people Hal already knows would still look the same.  I just wish ladies were as open and approachable as the movie portrays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you judge a person  particularly a woman  by her outward appearance? If you do you're shallow and that's the message played out in this comedy. The humor in here is good very funny in spots. There are plenty of jokes and sight gags. If you are obese and very sensitive then skip this film because you won't appreciate some of the humor in this film. But if you can laugh at yourself you'll enjoy it too  and especially the message this film brings.Jack Black was pretty much of an unknown actor when this came out but he's wellknown now after School Of Rock King Kong and other films. Gwyneth Paltrow everyone knows. She looked very pretty in here maybe the best I've ever seen her. Jason Alexander and Joe Viterelli provide good supporting help. By the way it was strange hearing Viterelli with an Irish accent. This is a guy who almost always plays Mafia types.The only thing offensive to me was the beginning with some irreverent humor that was not needed not part of the story just a cheap shot against ministers. Also for a lightweight comedy the profanity could have been less. Can't someone make a modernday comedy without language and sex issues? I wish someone would at least try. It can be done  just look at the classics!Anyway this is still a pretty funny story with of course a good message about judging a book by its cover.".

I can't recommend it enough. It's the kind of romantic comedy that you can both enjoy evenly without one of you or the other gritting their teeth and trying to make it look like a smile. Yes it shows people being shallow callous and sometimes mean but it also portrays some of those same people growing maturing and taking on depth. The casting is great. Gwyneth Paltrow is cute and sweet and Jack Black walks the line between comedic goofball and serious romantic very well. Sure there's a predictable happy ending but the most popular romance stories tend to have that in common. Romeo and Juliet isn't everyone's cup of chai after all. There are laughs but this movie has heart too. 10 out of 10. Both thumbs way up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard all of the critical talk about this film portraying women badly in this film months before it even came out. Generally being turned off to stereotypical plots I was very hesitant to see this movie. Of course all of my friends totally loved this movie. They thought it was sweet and charming and bashed the critics for thinking that it was demeaning to any one type of social group because they felt that since Hal chose to be with Rosemary at the end of the film that that meant that the movie itself was teaching everyone some great beautiful lesson about how you can see the beauty within. Well being a plus size girl myself Im a size 16and cute to boot heheI made myself watch this movie and all I can say is that I beg to differ. To be fair I do think the Farrelly brothers were trying to send a positive message here. I don't think that their intent was to degrade anyone but they ended up making the movie a hypocritical mess. Not only did they portray Ugly woman as fat with bad skin and big nosesthey also portrayed Beautiful women as being megabitches with a whip. As if we women and men don't have enough to feel self conscious about. I mean think about it. Jack Black while being a very funny guy and good actor just isn't conventionally Hollywood attractive. But he loved Rosemary. Which is great however they would never think about putting let's say Brad Pitt in as playing Hal and have him running off with an obese woman in the end. So therefore Obese women can only get someone like Jack Black to love them??? The other stereotype that irritated the crap out of me was that not only was Rosemary obese but she was also a glutton. As if ALL big women eat 5 course meals every time we sit at the table. Anyways just a big peeve there.The point is that everyone knows that movies and Hollywood set this impossible standard on how women and men should look and everyone here admits it's wrong yet people still feel they have to alter themselves to be something that they are not. I feel that this movie while trying to mean well...exacerbates this concept and causes hurt feelings.A valiant effort of the FBros part but it just didn't cut the mustard with me. Sorry".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to laugh at this film because the jokes are so broad but it's equally easy to be offended. The issue I have with the movie is that in the course of making the point that we should see the innerbeauty in fat people the Farrellys are implying that by being overweight you are universally ugly. In fact in the world of Shallow Hal if you are fat you are a wellmeaning mammoth who couldn't possibly be fancied unless under hypnosis or after an epiphany.The movie also seems to suggest that the friends of fat people are ugly and that uglies keep each other's company because no one else will want to associate with them which is another reinforcement of social divisions. All of Rosemary's Paltrow friends are as we see at the end equally fat or gross or otherwise physically undesirable. Most disturbingly the Farrellys undermine the innerbeauty point they've spent 40 million trying to make through Hal because Hal's friends betray the judgmental reality. When his buddies see Rosemary for what she is i.e. grossly fat they are universally horrified in a what are you doing with her? way which carries a more powerful punch than any of the tepid attempts to suggest she's beautiful because of her personality moulded we are told by years of personal abuse because of her size. The overall message is correct  inner beauty is ultimately what counts because a sparkling character will outlast youthful good looks by decades. But the Farrelly's have approached the subject in a way that actually insults rather than genuinely educates. It's not going to uplift anyone who's overweight it'll just depress them. The majority of the film perpetuates the idea that being fat or ugly makes you a pariah or the object of sympathy or vulgar fascination.  There are some sweet moments and a few laughs so the movie's not a wholly worthless experience. But in the process of making its valid point it reinforces rather than rejects stereotypes.".

Jack Black is short and pudgy with bulldog features and Jason Alexander looks like something that's been boiled and painted.  Why is their lack of attractiveness never part of the plot?  Good Lord they roam around the movie looking for babes as if they were a couple of Adonises.  Both of these distinctly not goodlooking guys get pursued by attractive women and what's more the squat foureyes actually turns down his dolly on the grounds that she's got a long toe. All this is later justified by his inner hurt feeling...awwwww!!Another sign that the movie was put together by a couple of cases of arrested development Rosemary never stops talking about her low selfesteem can't handle compliments etc. yet in every second scene she's wearing something short and tight.  This way Gwyneth Paltrow gets to prance around in her skimpies and yet then we're supposed to get a big yukyuk when her fat body double is shown falling out of the same outfit. I would love to see a female director redo this movie using a couple of ugly women as the leads and then have attractive men pursue them just as they are.  Wait I guess no one would buy that. And one final thing just because Rosemary was fat they didn't have to show her constantly stuffing her face.  It got to the point where she's grabbing half a cake at a time.  That was just pointless and mean and it was way beyond even a juvenile chuckle.".

It opens with nine year old Hal at his father's death bed being given rather blunt advice about women. Jump ahead and Jack Black as Hal hits the clubs with Jason Alexander and still has no luck with women. When he is met with a famous hypnotist he ends up only seeing a woman's inner beauty. This causes him to fall in love with a 300 pound woman who appears as the thin beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow. It turns out that she is the daughter of his boss and she works with handicapped children. Brilliant work by Peter and Bobby Farrelly with clever surprises involving physical identities. Black is fantastic bewildering his friends on the relationship that only he can see and understand. Paltrow amazingly convinces us of her insecurity. Jason Alexander is superb as Black's best friend with his own secret. Joe Viterelli steals scenes as Paltrow's father. Sometimes vulgar in that some of the dialogue regarding specific women but hits hard truths about our perceptions of people. Tony Robbins makes a great impression playing himself as the hypnotist whose aim is to improve Hal's insights. It is a hilarious film that is far from shallow. Score 9  10".

	schema:reviewBody "even if it is a new take on an old idea  character sees someone's inner beauty and is shocked when the magical curtain is torn away.Hal Jack Black is someone whose last words from his dying father were dad  under the influence of extreme pain killing drugs  telling him to go after pretty girls and forget about love. The message is almost pornographic. This confuses young Hal who is all of age ten since dad had always been an upright citizen and a preacher too. Hal blocks this shocking scene out of his conscious mind but the message becomes the ruler of his subconscious. As a result as an adult he is constantly going to bars with his equally shallow pal Jason Alexander as Mauricio and trying to chat up and dance with girls way out of his league and he's not even subtle about it.Fate changes when Hal gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who puts him under a spell that will make him see only the inner beauty in people not the external packaging. He winds up catching a glimpse of Rosemary Shanahan who has a beautiful soul but is also 300 pounds. At first she thinks he is just making fun of her but when she finds out his interest is real they start seeing each other. The catch here? Her dad is Hal's boss and he's been getting nowhere lately getting a promotion at work. One day when Hal and Rosemary come over to her house Hal ends up talking one on one with the boss and ends up getting the promotion he's been wanting. Of course his coworkers see his progress see him cozying up to Rosemary and think that he is lower than lice  using the girl to advance his career. As for Mauricio he goes in search of Tony Robbins to try and undo whatever spell has been cast on his friend because it is disrupting his social life and Hal's new aesthetics makes no sense to him.When Hal is put back to normal everybody now looks how they did before. Their physical being is what he sees. This means that he is doing everything he can to not actually see Rosemary since he is in love with her and doesn't want to lose that feeling. From Rosemary's end it looks like Hal got his promotion and is done with her. This is the same opinion that his new boss  who for some reason doesn't fire him  and his coworkers have. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.There is plenty of low brow humor here but it is seasoned with a bit of empathy...EXCEPT that the film still indicates that being overweight is just about the worst thing that could happen to someone AND that the reason for that is always out of control gluttony. In other words if you are not a size five it is your own fault. I've never been a fan of Jack Black but I think he did a good job here. As for Jason Alexander as Mauricio he is still playing George Costanza from Seinfeld but that is fine with me.".

	onyx:emotionText "even if it is a new take on an old idea  character sees someone's inner beauty and is shocked when the magical curtain is torn away.Hal Jack Black is someone whose last words from his dying father were dad  under the influence of extreme pain killing drugs  telling him to go after pretty girls and forget about love. The message is almost pornographic. This confuses young Hal who is all of age ten since dad had always been an upright citizen and a preacher too. Hal blocks this shocking scene out of his conscious mind but the message becomes the ruler of his subconscious. As a result as an adult he is constantly going to bars with his equally shallow pal Jason Alexander as Mauricio and trying to chat up and dance with girls way out of his league and he's not even subtle about it.Fate changes when Hal gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who puts him under a spell that will make him see only the inner beauty in people not the external packaging. He winds up catching a glimpse of Rosemary Shanahan who has a beautiful soul but is also 300 pounds. At first she thinks he is just making fun of her but when she finds out his interest is real they start seeing each other. The catch here?

To me anything more about the plot would be revealing too much you should see the movie for yourself to fully enjoy it.Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent so is Jack Black in his first leading role. The rest of the cast is the usual Farrelly cast that is always so marvelous. Also some of the most beautiful girls ever on film parade from time to time.One thing that has to be clarified This movie DOES NOT make fun of overweight people. The Farrellys are not hypocrites nor politically correct but that doesn't mean that they are cruel. Fat people shouldn't be patronized by anyone. This would be the real insult. And that goes for every Farrelly movie.Finally I just wanted to say that 'Shallow Hal' came as a surprise to me. I never would expected the Farrelly brothers to have so much artistic power left to be able to rise above today's low standards in comedy with yet another gem which in my opinion is the best movie of 2001.".

I was hugely disappointed in it for a long while but as the film progressed I kept wondering if my disappointment was merely a product of my unfair expectations. That's probably the case. I expect a daring comedy from the Brothers Farrelly but Shallow Hal is surprisingly lowkey. It doesn't go for easy laughs as it easily could have done. The plot concerns a looksobsessed guy Jack Black who is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of others. He falls in love with a fat woman who appears to him as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the film came out a lot of people complained that this was terrible he only loves her because he is attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow not the fat incarnation that appears in only a couple of shots in the first 90 minutes of the film. But these people didn't really stick around for the payoff in the third act. What's so surprising about this film is how emotionally involving it is. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow who actually gives one of her best performances. But fans of the Farrelly Brothers as I am myself will not be shocked to find that emotional center. It was there in both Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. It's just as fun when the Brothers are meanspirited however as they were in Me Myself  Irene and even better the unfairly maligned Dumb and Dumber. The serious themes are really on full display here though. The Brothers have a true and touching affection for physical outsiders. I still wish that they wouldn't have forsaken comedy so much though. I suppose the only jokes would have been fat jokes but maybe not. Jason Alexander provides almost all of the good laughs. We wonder why he and Jack Black are so mean about the looks of others when they aren't especially gorgeous themselves. Some people are still asking how such a man as Jason Alexander can be so shallow in this film but they as I've said before didn't stick around until the end. This film may improve on repeat viewings as it was bothering me for a long while. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an overweight girl I watched much of this movie with tears in my eyes but not for the reasons you might think.  The Farrelly Brothers made a beautiful film with SHALLOW HAL.  True....it's no 'classic' but for those brothers it is very insightful.  I went into the movie expecting to watch it rolling my eyes every few minutes at the crude remarks and tasteless stereotypes of society's 'uglies.'  Instead I found that the movie provided an interesting look at selfesteem and what it's like for so many girls and guys in this country where outer beauty and perfection is held to be so important.I found the acting in the story to be very realistic.  Gwyneth Paltrow truly captured the whole character Rosemaryher insecurities at being so big and her inner beauty which helped her to give so much of herself to aid those in need around her.  I also think Jack Black was amazing as Hal.  I never thought I'd crush on him but he was really sweet and presented such a good soul that it's hard not to like him.  Jason Alexander was good as his nuerotic selfabsorbed friend who actually SPOILER is not as shallow as he seems.  He too suffers from the insecurities placed on him by a society which values perfection. END OF SPOILERThe movie has some loose ends and some characters who don't totally fit into the plot.  Also...as a bigger girl I can say that some of Rosemary's outfits are totally unrealistic but hey...more power to her!! D  The movie also disregards the idea that appearance isn't really important for attraction. To truly believe that is actually as shallow as thinking beauty is the most important thing.But in the end the movie promotes strong selfesteem.  Liking oneself and knowing that one is good enough no matter what is a theme that comes across.  The film also reminds us that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder....enough so that we are reminded to at least take the time to get to know people before we judge them based solely on their looks.I give the movie a 4 out of 5....for totally surprising me and for being such a sweet movie.".

D  The movie also disregards the idea that appearance isn't really important for attraction. To truly believe that is actually as shallow as thinking beauty is the most important thing.But in the end the movie promotes strong selfesteem.  Liking oneself and knowing that one is good enough no matter what is a theme that comes across.  The film also reminds us that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder....enough so that we are reminded to at least take the time to get to know people before we judge them based solely on their looks.I give the movie a 4 out of 5....for totally surprising me and for being such a sweet movie.";

	schema:headline " Nice for Fans of Bronson and Russell";
	schema:reviewBody "Guns of Diablo 1964  12 out of 4 By the numbers Western will work a lot better if you're fans of Charles Bronson and Kurt Russell. In the film wagon trail leader Linc Murdock Bronson and his young pal Russell head into town for some supplies but once there Linc sees the woman Susan Oliver who he fell in love with years earlier but also the three brothers who kept them apart and now want him dead. This feature was taken from episodes of The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters and you can see in various scenes that it has a TV look. While there's nothing overly special here I think fans of Bronson and Russell with enjoy their performances enough to make this film worth viewing. What we've got here are two TV episodes built around some new footage which includes a pretty risqu love scene between Bronson and Oliver which was clearly added for the European market where this film mostly played. This and the rather violent shootout at the end are two of the better sequences but we also get a pretty good open with the wagons trying to cross a violent river when Bronson must jump in to save a man. Another good sequence is a 20minute flashback where we see how Bronson came to be so hated. This here was taken from the TV episode but it actually features some pretty good cinematography and nice drama. Bronson actually turns in a pretty good performance here as he gets to throw in some romance as well as tender drama which is something he wouldn't get to do decades later when he was appearing in various Canon films. He works well with Oliver and the two have great chemistry together and really sell the love story side of the film. Russell is also very energetic here and makes for a good sidekick to Bronson. Seeing the two now legends together was a lot of fun and I think fans of both will enjoy seeing them here. The supporting villains aren't written too well and John Fiedler 12 ANGRY MEN doesn't come off too well either. Douglas Fowley gets some good scenes with Russell as the elderly man who claims to be a millionaire. If one comes to this film expecting a John Ford production then they're going to be disappointed.

	onyx:emotionText "Guns of Diablo 1964  12 out of 4 By the numbers Western will work a lot better if you're fans of Charles Bronson and Kurt Russell. In the film wagon trail leader Linc Murdock Bronson and his young pal Russell head into town for some supplies but once there Linc sees the woman Susan Oliver who he fell in love with years earlier but also the three brothers who kept them apart and now want him dead. This feature was taken from episodes of The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters and you can see in various scenes that it has a TV look. While there's nothing overly special here I think fans of Bronson and Russell with enjoy their performances enough to make this film worth viewing. What we've got here are two TV episodes built around some new footage which includes a pretty risqu love scene between Bronson and Oliver which was clearly added for the European market where this film mostly played. This and the rather violent shootout at the end are two of the better sequences but we also get a pretty good open with the wagons trying to cross a violent river when Bronson must jump in to save a man. Another good sequence is a 20minute flashback where we see how Bronson came to be so hated. This here was taken from the TV episode but it actually features some pretty good cinematography and nice drama. Bronson actually turns in a pretty good performance here as he gets to throw in some romance as well as tender drama which is something he wouldn't get to do decades later when he was appearing in various Canon films. He works well with Oliver and the two have great chemistry together and really sell the love story side of the film. Russell is also very energetic here and makes for a good sidekick to Bronson. Seeing the two now legends together was a lot of fun and I think fans of both will enjoy seeing them here. The supporting villains aren't written too well and John Fiedler 12 ANGRY MEN doesn't come off too well either. Douglas Fowley gets some good scenes with Russell as the elderly man who claims to be a millionaire. If one comes to this film expecting a John Ford production then they're going to be disappointed. If you have 79minutes to kill and are a fan of the cast then I'm sure you'll at least stay entertained from start to finish.";

	schema:headline " Reno 911! Miami  A Different Kind of Road Trip";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I saw the regular series on television I definitely enjoyed it. Reno 911! is a highly creative and very funny show. However much to my dismay I've only caught bits and pieces of it so I went into this film not knowing nearly as much of the characters' backgrounds as many others in the theater on opening night. Fortunately enough was explained that newcomers could quickly pick up on what went on despite some injokes definitely being present. Now even with bearing my limited level of Reno 911! expertise in mind I thought it was hilarious. The biggest problem this film will face is it was setup in a very similar style to last year's Borat. Between the carefree male nudity and how sex was addressed the resemblance was very much alike. Despite this approach being taken this was very much its own movie and accomplished what it set out for.The realtime mockumentary comedy that Reno 911 represents has been prevalent on television for the past few years and recently it appears as if it's now being a preferred alternative on the big screen as well. This is with good reason because the characters seem more like actual everyday people than some ridiculous caricature that doesn't resemble anything close to a human being. Viewers can identify with these personalities more and thus stand a better chance of becoming sucked into the different situations no matter how over the top they are. I predict that humorous films will start adhering to this relatively new formula and will be the kickstart to a whole new generation of cinema.Notwithstanding some of the downright hysterical moments there were some pieces that didn't work. To start off with the first half was much funnier then the latter part. As if the writers began running out of jokes and settled for any suitable finale. Also most of the dialog in the show is improvised where it appears that for the movie it was scripted the other way around and this certainly took away from the actors' spontaneity. Finally some of the scenarios are almost a little too farfetched even for a notorious farcical ensemble cast such as this.All in all I found myself laughing out loud a lot and was very glad I caught this one. It appears it won't beat out the television show due to the advantage of getting to compress the running time but it's still a very comical motion picture that'll guarantee to put just about anyone in stitches. I'd say there's a very good chance a sequel will be in the works and surely look forward to it. Law enforcement is no stranger to either parodies of itself or becoming a target for instances of goofiness that could never really happen but this is a new take on bighearted police officers that can't seem to get anything right that'll have you mimicking them for hours on end. Between the witty quotes the oddball lawbreakers and the refreshing celebrity guest listMiami didn't know what hit it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Whenever I saw the regular series on television I definitely enjoyed it. Reno 911! is a highly creative and very funny show. However much to my dismay I've only caught bits and pieces of it so I went into this film not knowing nearly as much of the characters' backgrounds as many others in the theater on opening night. Fortunately enough was explained that newcomers could quickly pick up on what went on despite some injokes definitely being present. Now even with bearing my limited level of Reno 911! expertise in mind I thought it was hilarious. The biggest problem this film will face is it was setup in a very similar style to last year's Borat. Between the carefree male nudity and how sex was addressed the resemblance was very much alike.

The show was very funny and made me laugh out loud at times but i feel it could have been even funnier. With Reno 911 I expect a lot because of the reputation they have built for me. The movie steps into the line of R rated issues that I have no problem with but show a lack of intelligence originality and surprise. The movie becomes predictable as it goes on. Too much focus is put onto dangle and Trudy. Certain members of the team have only a handful of lines. What i love about reno 911 the show is that every character makes up the team and every character can make me laugh. In the movie too much focus is attempted on too few characters. I wasn't disappointed in the movie but from a critical view I think more could have been done. as for the comments about Borat the movie...I see no reason to compare the two...except that i guess for some borat is a new thing to most Americans this year and they feel a need to compare seeing them as 2 comedies this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to tell that Reno 911 Miami is based on a TV series just by watching it. How can you tell? There's maybe 25 minutes or so of solid material and an additional 60 worth of filler. In bringing the Comedy Central half hour reality cop show to the big screen you get the sense that the filmmakers had a hard time trying to stretch the thing out. The show itself is often quite funny and the movie works when it's remaining close in spirit to the TV series. But then they have to go and throw in a silly plot and a series of celebrity cameos that take us out of the movie.The film takes the incompetent cops from the TV series out of Nevada and into Florida where they have been invited to attend a police convention in Miami. They only got invited because every police force got in. They arrive for some fun in the sun only to discover a bioterrorist act unfolding at the convention center itself which has trapped every single police officer inside. Since the cops of Reno are the only available officers not inside the building when the situation kicks in these eight dimwitted enforcers of the law must literally become the entire Miami Police Force keeping peace in the city while trying to find out who is behind the chemical attack at the convention center. Other subplots include the Reno officers trying to deal with an evil Scarfacelike drug lord Paul Rudd who keeps on threatening them and discovering the truth behind a mysterious tattoo of a man's face that has appeared on the breast of one of the female officer's after a night of sex and binge drinking.When Reno 911 Miami is following the Copsstyle reality show format the movie can be a lot of good fun. The opening scenes where the eight individual officers are introduced and the scenes where we get to see them on the job and dealing with situations such as a chicken that got loose made me smile and laugh quite a bit. The actors are at ease during these moments and they're obviously having a lot of fun. Then the whole plot has to kick in and the movie just doesn't seem as much fun as it did before. Reno 911 has never exactly been about plot it's always been a series of mostly improvised skits skewering reality cop shows. While the movie does try to hold onto this format giving us some various misadventures around Florida that have nothing to do with the biochemical plot they don't seem as fresh or as funny as the Reno scenes early on. A lot of this has to do with the fact that a lot of the gags are either anticlimactic or have no real pay off. That's not to say that there are not some gags that work. A scene where the cops have to remove a beached whale from a topless beach had me laughing quite a bit and the pay off involving an explosive device is one of the few that actually lives up to its set up and earns its laugh. More often than not we either find ourselves smiling politely at the effort the actors are making or simply staring at the screen with casual indifference to what we are seeing.The movie seems to suffer from an identity crisis as it doesn't know if it wants to be a series of skits and gross out gags or if it wants to attempt to try to tell an actual story and parody action movies. It never finds a central tone or target for satire and seems to change its mind every five minutes. This gives the film an annoyingly disjointed tone from which it never recovers. The celebrity cameos sprinkled throughout also don't work the way that they should as they take us out of the movie. We're no longer watching a comic mockumentary making fun of cop shows but we're watching a highly paid actor taking a cut on his paycheck for the sake of getting a quick laugh from the audience. I liked the scenes where the Reno cops took center stage and were being their usual incompetent selves the best. It's fun watching these improvisational comics many of whom have worked together for years on other TV shows play off of each other and just be goofy. But Reno 911 wants to keep on reminding us that we're watching a movie and the good stuff keeps on getting drowned out by uninspired gags or unnecessary plot.I certainly don't regret seeing Reno 911 and I think fans of the show probably won't either. However the inconsistent tone and the uneven ratio of hit and miss gags don't leave a positive impression overall. Maybe this would have worked better as a regular half hour episode with all the filler celebrity cameos and silly plot removed. The cast certainly seems more comfortable with a shorter amount of time to work in. That way they don't have to compete with a bunch of stuff that shouldn't even be there in the first place.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reno 911 Miami the Comedy Central spinoff movie spoof of Fox's highlyrated reality ridealong TV show Cops qualifies as a consistently hilarious comedy of errors about a loopy lot of law enforcement personnel who wouldn't know what to do with a clue if they found one. Mind you the cable TV show Reno 911 is as much an acquired taste as the film that it has spawned. People who cannot tolerate politically incorrect attitudes unapologetically racist characters and anything in between that consists of the lewd the rude and the crude won't appreciate the skewered humor of either the television show or this movie. Happily everybody from the superbly silly small screen saga about Reno Nevada's mentally challenged sheriff's department reprises their role in this big screen adaptation. Moreover nothing drastic has changed in terms of the irreverent wit the wacky characters and the preposterous predicaments except that Reno 911 Miami is bigger and better. Aside from a disposable plot that involves a poorly parodied Scarface mobster who wields a weedeater rather than a chainsaw most of Reno 911 Miami will tickle your ribs.The premise of Reno 911 Miami is that the sheriff's deputies receive an invitation to attend the American Police Convention in Miami Beach Florida. They invited us Lieutenant Jim Dangle Thomas Lennon announces to Deputies Raineesha Williams Niecy Nash Travis Junior Robert Ben Garant S. Jones Cedric Yarbrough James Garcia Carlos Alazraqui Clementine Johnston Wendi McLendonCovey Trudy Wiegel Kerri KennySilver and Cherisha Kimball Mary Birdsong because they invited everybody. When our hapless heroes arrive in sunny Miami after an uncomfortable crosscountry bus trip convention officials cannot find either their credentials or their registration packets. Since they cannot register at the convention center motel Dangle and his deputies have to check into a seedy dive called the International Inn. The next day they return to the convention center and learn to their surprise that terrorists have exposed the over 2000 cops including the Miami Beach police in the convention center to a biological toxin and Homeland Security doesn't possess an antidote. Meaning the authorities have quarantined everyone in the convention center and acting mayor Jeff Spoder Patton Oswalt reluctantly presses the Reno deputies into service to stand between Miami and rampant lawlessness. Predictably chaos ensues with the Reno crew wrecking Miami's Ford police cars and fumbling one situation after another in ways characteristic of the television series. Garcia and Jones investigate an alligator in a backyard swimming pool in what is one of the funniest scenes and get advice from a redneck next door neighbor. Meanwhile another series regular shows up. Nick Swardson generates a lot of hilarity as the nutty male prostitute on roller skates named Terry. Terry's role is considerably larger here than in the TV show. Raineesha and Trudy have some funny moments at the beach with Raineesha trying to coach Trudy in the proper etiquette of talking to beachcombers. Dangle and Travis wind up at a topless beach trying to remove a beached sperm whale. Eventually our heroes run afoul of the chief villain a wannabe Tony Montanastyle drug czar played by Paul Rudd that constitutes the more lackluster part of the plot. When the film focuses on the drug lord it is not as zany as when the Reno crew dominates the action.Cowriter  director Robert Ben Garant and scenarists Thomas Lennon and Kerri KennedySilver have done a smooth job transferring their deadpan improvisational humor to the screen. Basically Trudy emerges again as the craziest of the eight deputies. For example at an exhibition where cops shoot at a guy modeling a bulletproof vest Trudy cannot hit the vest but she manages to wound the man in the arm. She triggers a rocket while seated in an assault helicopter and blows one of Miami PD's prowl cars to smithereens. Oh that was my bad she remarks as the fireball explosion dissipates. She continues to have her crush on Dangle who has nothing but revulsion for her. At the same time Clementine is trying to figure out how she got a tattoo of a mustached man on her left breast and Garcia is having a difficult time deducing how he got a tattoo of a blond on his loins. Every character gets a chance to shine and anybody that doesn't know anything about them will learn quickly what makes each deputy unique. As Lt. Dangle Lennon practically repeats his first season speech about his penchant for wearing tightfitting cutoffs. Niecy Nash is especially funny when she explains how she likes to push around men. Reno 911 Miami boasts three cameos with Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock scoring best as a butterfingered SWAT expert who blows himself up while Paul Reubens of PeeWee's Playhouse turns up as Terry's wealthy father. Like many recent movies Reno 911 Miami isn't content to wrap up its antics all nice and neat before the end credits roll. Stick around for the end credits and you'll see three more amusing skits. The best one involves a proctologist explaining how his medical equipment works. The performances by a seasoned ensemble cast are uniformly sidesplitting throughout and the comedians never wear out their welcome in a 10million film that clocks in at 85 minutes. Fans of Reno 911 won't be disappointed with this bigscreen adventure. Reno 911 Miami ranks as the funniest cop comedy since the Broken Lizard Club's first movie Super Troopers.".

You can tell that the writing by Garant and Lennon is that of a TV show. I know that it can be kinda hard to go from writing episodes to a feature movie. That may be why it is kinda short 84 min. It just left me wanting more.Other than that it was very good. The actors were spot on and the directing wasn't too bad either. We'll have to see how Garant does with films in the future.Go see it!!".

Sure it wasn't as realityish the camera doesn't shake around as much as it does in the show but all the awesomeness of the show was captured in the movie. All the antics shortshorts and stupidness of the cops are there in full force. They even brought in recurring characters such as Terry and Patton Oswalt who continued to utter DD phrases Someone complained of too much filler. If you've watched more than 2 episodes of Reno 911 you know that most of the show is random filler. That's what makes it funny. Both the show and the movie follow eight cops who are bad at what they do. If you're expecting a solid plot then you really haven't seen the the show and you should watch something else.This plot like Snakes on a Plane is an excuse to put the characters in a ridiculously funny situation.But in the end that's what makes it great and original. The movie is just as good as the show both in styling and comedy. I was very pleased with the way the movie turned out. The actors seemed to enjoy doing the movie and the jokes were funny. I truly recommend this movie!SPOILERNot really a spoiler as much as a warning. Stay through the credits and watch whats at the very end.".

Two of the woman officers go to the beach and one has a very large backside that she shows off in a thong. It is a very ugly image.

It also would've been better had they shot it more like a fake reality show like the TV show is. The fake reality show context helps to set up much of the humor. It's difficult to understand why this movie was made the way it was. The rarelyfunny Patton Oswalt was the worst part in my view. Even Oswalt is good in his few brief appearances in the TV showone of the few contexts in which he is ever funnybut in this film he was horrid.Not even Paul Reubens could manage to be funny in the film but in the TV show he's amazing.I feel bad for the crew because they are really pretty funny people that really know how to do comedy who just got caught up in a bad project.".

Lightening the mood considerably he had five pretty young things roaming the French country side in search of a holiday they can't afford due to an economic reality the perpetually penniless director knew all too well. He may very well have been alone in incorporating this aspect into a genre generally focused to an appropriately almost obscene degree on lavish luxuries out of reach to the vast majority of its intended audience. BANANES MECANIQUES  its title a reference to Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE which was called ORANGE MECANIQUE in France  was the first and most financially viable installment in what was to become Davy's trilogie paillarde which would translate as naughty or ribald trilogy and remains one of the first seriously sexy movies to play regular theaters in France outside of the specialized circuit. The story hastily penned by Davy over the course of a weekend may seem like a simpleminded mix of broad comedy routines the girls distracting a man pushing a wheelbarrow prompting him to bump into a wall and fall down cute cinematic references all five kissing their communal lover goodbye shot like a western showdown complete with Morricone type music and severely dated politics chairman Mao is paid considerable lip service but is presented with such a hell bent for leather enthusiasm that it hits more than it misses. As a result while clearly a product of its time the movie retains an infectious charm lacking in many of its contemporaries. Summer's here and five girlfriends who have trouble making ends meet at their dead end jobs decide to semisquat at the villa of one of their fathers who's gone to the coast with his youthful mistress while leaving his daughter Pauline the exquisite Pauline Larrieu to her own devices. In tow are a temperamental wannabe starlet portrayed by skin flick stalwart Anne Libert who starred in Jess Franco's cutrate horror trilogy LES EXPERIENCES EROTIQUES DE FRANKENSTEIN Dracula CONTRA FRANKENSTEIN and LA FILLE DE Dracula who was dumped by the roadside with her kid sister sweet MarieGeorges Pascal from Jean Rollin's LES RAISINS DE LA MORT who tragically took her own life in 1985 following a spectacular row with her manager Davy regular Philippe Gast the sister's best friend played by the director's sister MarieClaire stepping in for another actress at the last moment and the sympathetic salesgirl who allows Pauline to nick stuff until this behavior gets her sacked a nice turn from seldom seen Elizabeth Drancourt who had appeared in Julien SaintClair's LE DESIR ET LA VOLUPTE with equally alluring lookalike and exDavy acolyte Denyse Roland. Not an awful lot happens. The girls sit around talk dance get naked a lot thankfully and try to catch the eye of the local menfolk. Contrary to the director's subsequent endeavors PRENEZ LA QUEUE COMME TOUT LE MONDE and Q the sexual content isn't played for purely laughs here  a slapstick styled tale of a burglar satisfying neglected housewives notwithstanding  and as its freewheeling largely improvised as Davy readily admits in the accompanying DVD interview approach leaves pacing all over the place anyway nudity is lingered upon to enchanting erotic effect. Highlights include luscious Libert carnally contorting in front of a full length mirror and the ubiquitous fireplace love scene involving goodlooking Gast and lovely Larrieu the latter a respected French thespian who graduated from au naturel appearances in Daniel Dart's LE VOYAGEUR and LES FELINES to tons of TV work in some of the country's bestloved and longest running shows. As an actress she's clearly head and shoulders above the others. Like most dedicated amateurs Libert would either go full throttle as this part allows her plenty of opportunity for or remain strictly decorative with little room for nuance between both extremes. She possessed a zesty personality that translated well to the series of the undemanding yet lively sex comedies that called upon her services. Watch for a cameo by the director as the fledgling communist who tries to bed the delectable Drancourt whose tearful reaction to this character's selfinflicted death late in the proceedings plays more like an injoke rather than honestly attempted drama. The soon to be Mrs. Davy Dominique Valle appears at film's end as the mistress to middleaged character actor Jacques Robiolles playing Pauline's illtempered pops throwing the lot of them out of his house after a drunken orgy. With colorful camera work by Roger Fellous on the verge of gaining considerable if largely genrerelated recognition the movie holds up as a pleasant and completely unpretentious piece of fluff presumably best viewed within context for the place it occupies both within Davy's body of work and erotic cinema history in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this goofy clunker in 1990 when a couple of friends of mine made the mistake of suddenly wanting to do something on a weekend night without having anything planned beforehand sometimes that can result into something cool at others it can result into just watching a movie.I had also rented Sibling Rivalry starring Kirstie Alley who has an afternoon fling on her husband Scott Bakula but her fling ends up dying of a heart attack and all kinds of problems ensue from there.  It was mildly amusing and Alley would be better off in my opinion on future endeavors like her shortlived tv sitcom Veronica's Closet and is cuter on her current Pier 1 commercials is that the name of the chain?.There was also an Adult section at the video store where I rented Rivalry but I was a bit selfconscious going into it so I just snagged Erotic Escape which was sitting just outside of the section having a decentlybuilt blonde on the cover in some lingerie which I hid from my friends so I could enjoy cough it by myself later.Unfortunately that evening turned into a bust big surprise eh? as I think we decided to try to go bowling but the alley had almost no bowling shoes available to rent one of my friends had to leave early he was probably better off and my remaining friend fell asleep during Rivalry which he didn't miss too much.And it turned out that hiding Erotic Escape from my friends was the right idea but not in the way that you might think which I had the displeasure of finding that out when I put it in my vcr the next day.I have over 3 12 years legal experience none of which covers any kind of retail law but I doubt there's any kind of legal guidelines saying that whatever is on the cover has to come anywhere close to matching the content of the actual video you could tell the photo of the woman on the cover was taken recently  sometime during the 80s  due to the quality of the photo the hairstyle and all but once you started up the video you could tell by the grainy look and the hairstyles it was foreignmade in the 70s and then dubbed into English as the woman on the cover was very! doubtfully not in the movie unless there was a baby girl somewhere in the film that actually WAS her snirk snirk.Five women inherit a mansion or something but they have no way to get there which is common in a lot of foreign lands unlike the United States which currently has more vehicles than registered drivers so they have to bumble around the country in order to claim the inheritance I think...so this film can be chalked up as to being an earlier  version of Planes Trains and Automobiles minus the babes since the latter starred Steve Martin and John Candy and most of the humor.About the only really funny part was when at one time a guy passes all of the women stranded on the side of the road without even slowing down which the women yell FAG! at him which makes him stop the car and yell back btch!  I've got a wife and  kids! I think the number was four.Personally it gets old when you listen to death metal and idiots ask if listening to it makes you want to kill people not to mention this could also label you into doing drugs drinking having sex with goats or whatever.  Most of it can be laughed off but at times it gets pretty irritating as people saying things about me gets old...but one thing I DON'T like is being questioned if I'm gay at least this doesn't happen very often although I am in my 30s and have never been married so it IS time to do that since people are starting to wonder... ...but enough about me as the humor in that scene was killed when the man got out of the car and proceeded to slap each and every woman in the face which was unnecessary especially since jokes about violence towards women aren't funny in the least.Speaking of which there's no background on any of the women at all as they're just THERE to watch and all although at one point they put on a play for someone in regards to women's lib and equality in the workplace and all which this could have provided some interest as far as instilling some character development for the women but there is none pretty much which is how the whole movie seemed to be it was just kind of THERE not really very funny not really interesting and definitely not erotic kind of like tv's Love Boat remake of The Next Wave which I could have sworn the original Love Boat was a comedy yet whenever I turned on the remake repeatedly I never even came close to watching an entire episode I never saw anything funny in it or dramatic or anything...it was also kind of there and that was about it.WARNING supposedly a spoiler follows but since this doesn't appear to be available on any kind of video or DVD format at the time of this writing it shouldn't really matterOf course the women make it to their escape near the end and along the way they invite a nice guy into their place where he proceeds to get no sleep that night as the women one by one have their turn with him sexually...which isn't even half as titillating as it might sound there's only a couple of seconds of nudity here and there and the only woman who comes anywhere close to resembling the woman on the cover i. e. being somewhat built doesn't take off her clothes.I hate to sound like a pig in regards to that but hey those of us wanting something like this occasionally it's been about 2 12 years since I've rented anything that resembles the cover of this movie since unless you're a porn addict 90 to probably 99 of all porn isn't very good should GET it...however one good thing I will say is that since this was made in the 70s when the Twiggy look was the rage with most of the women starring in this being as skinny as they were if they took good care of themselves some of them might still be decentlooking today as they are probably in their 50s by now.  END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERThis is one movie that could be remade and actually be funny and sexy if done properly and pretty much no one would groan about yet another crappy remake being done since the original wasn't very funny or sexy especially since pretty much no one in America would even be familiar with the original probably the closest this comes to being remade somewhat themewise is this year's Chasing Papi about several yummylooking Latino I think they're Latinos babes chasing after a guy that twotimed them all but I heard that movie wasn't really worth the time or ticket price either.After all the video order guide for Erotic Escape is currently blank at the time of this writing so you can't get any regional version of any kind on video or DVD.  Oh well at least that makes it easy to avoid and probably the only chance you have of seeing this would be an edited version on latenight foreign tv.Until then beware of false advertising.  I would say it would be a mystery as to why this movie was ever released to the States over a decade after it was made but putting a babe on the cover that probably had nothing to do with the movie was probably just to hopefully make some video company some money.".

It was mildly amusing and Alley would be better off in my opinion on future endeavors like her shortlived tv sitcom Veronica's Closet and is cuter on her current Pier 1 commercials is that the name of the chain?.There was also an Adult section at the video store where I rented Rivalry but I was a bit selfconscious going into it so I just snagged Erotic Escape which was sitting just outside of the section having a decentlybuilt blonde on the cover in some lingerie which I hid from my friends so I could enjoy cough it by myself later.Unfortunately that evening turned into a bust big surprise eh? as I think we decided to try to go bowling but the alley had almost no bowling shoes available to rent one of my friends had to leave early he was probably better off and my remaining friend fell asleep during Rivalry which he didn't miss too much.And it turned out that hiding Erotic Escape from my friends was the right idea but not in the way that you might think which I had the displeasure of finding that out when I put it in my vcr the next day.I have over 3 12 years legal experience none of which covers any kind of retail law but I doubt there's any kind of legal guidelines saying that whatever is on the cover has to come anywhere close to matching the content of the actual video you could tell the photo of the woman on the cover was taken recently  sometime during the 80s  due to the quality of the photo the hairstyle and all but once you started up the video you could tell by the grainy look and the hairstyles it was foreignmade in the 70s and then dubbed into English as the woman on the cover was very! doubtfully not in the movie unless there was a baby girl somewhere in the film that actually WAS her snirk snirk.Five women inherit a mansion or something but they have no way to get there which is common in a lot of foreign lands unlike the United States which currently has more vehicles than registered drivers so they have to bumble around the country in order to claim the inheritance I think...so this film can be chalked up as to being an earlier  version of Planes Trains and Automobiles minus the babes since the latter starred Steve Martin and John Candy and most of the humor.About the only really funny part was when at one time a guy passes all of the women stranded on the side of the road without even slowing down which the women yell FAG! at him which makes him stop the car and yell back btch!  I've got a wife and  kids! I think the number was four.Personally it gets old when you listen to death metal and idiots ask if listening to it makes you want to kill people not to mention this could also label you into doing drugs drinking having sex with goats or whatever.  Most of it can be laughed off but at times it gets pretty irritating as people saying things about me gets old...but one thing I DON'T like is being questioned if I'm gay at least this doesn't happen very often although I am in my 30s and have never been married so it IS time to do that since people are starting to wonder... ...but enough about me as the humor in that scene was killed when the man got out of the car and proceeded to slap each and every woman in the face which was unnecessary especially since jokes about violence towards women aren't funny in the least.Speaking of which there's no background on any of the women at all as they're just THERE to watch and all although at one point they put on a play for someone in regards to women's lib and equality in the workplace and all which this could have provided some interest as far as instilling some character development for the women but there is none pretty much which is how the whole movie seemed to be it was just kind of THERE not really very funny not really interesting and definitely not erotic kind of like tv's Love Boat remake of The Next Wave which I could have sworn the original Love Boat was a comedy yet whenever I turned on the remake repeatedly I never even came close to watching an entire episode I never saw anything funny in it or dramatic or anything...it was also kind of there and that was about it.WARNING supposedly a spoiler follows but since this doesn't appear to be available on any kind of video or DVD format at the time of this writing it shouldn't really matterOf course the women make it to their escape near the end and along the way they invite a nice guy into their place where he proceeds to get no sleep that night as the women one by one have their turn with him sexually...which isn't even half as titillating as it might sound there's only a couple of seconds of nudity here and there and the only woman who comes anywhere close to resembling the woman on the cover i. e. being somewhat built doesn't take off her clothes.I hate to sound like a pig in regards to that but hey those of us wanting something like this occasionally it's been about 2 12 years since I've rented anything that resembles the cover of this movie since unless you're a porn addict 90 to probably 99 of all porn isn't very good should GET it...however one good thing I will say is that since this was made in the 70s when the Twiggy look was the rage with most of the women starring in this being as skinny as they were if they took good care of themselves some of them might still be decentlooking today as they are probably in their 50s by now.  END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERThis is one movie that could be remade and actually be funny and sexy if done properly and pretty much no one would groan about yet another crappy remake being done since the original wasn't very funny or sexy especially since pretty much no one in America would even be familiar with the original probably the closest this comes to being remade somewhat themewise is this year's Chasing Papi about several yummylooking Latino I think they're Latinos babes chasing after a guy that twotimed them all but I heard that movie wasn't really worth the time or ticket price either.After all the video order guide for Erotic Escape is currently blank at the time of this writing so you can't get any regional version of any kind on video or DVD.  Oh well at least that makes it easy to avoid and probably the only chance you have of seeing this would be an edited version on latenight foreign tv.Until then beware of false advertising.  I would say it would be a mystery as to why this movie was ever released to the States over a decade after it was made but putting a babe on the cover that probably had nothing to do with the movie was probably just to hopefully make some video company some money.";

Although not as good an actor as Sinatra Martin had a charming presence on the screen and was always entertaining to watch even when you knew he wasn't taking it too seriously.

The one billion dollar theft will cause world wide financial panic and its up to Matt Helm to save the day. Of course in any spy film of this nature you have to have beautiful women and there are plenty here.

He says Do me a favor PLEASE DESERT ME!. However she comes through in the end and there is a good fight scene between her and Nancy Kwan. For trivia lovers Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee helped to set up the fight scenes for this film. People have commented the fight scenes involving Helm are fakey what do you expect? Dean Martin was 52 when this film was made. Sharon really stole the show in this one in fact they later based one of the characters in the Austin Powers films on her character here. This was her last film before she was murdered by the Charles Manson family. Its chilling when you watch it and think of how horribly her life ended.".

Dean Martin plays the part of Matt Helm with his typical laid back swagger which is just right for the featherweight material. Not as reliant on gadgetry as the 007 series probably due to budgetary restraints this still has some cool set pieces and that swingin' 60's atmosphere. It also has that same 60's sensibility to it's female characters namely viewing them as sex objects and little else if you're willing to take that into consideration before viewing this is a pleasant way to pass a little time. Aside from Dean the cast is full of beautiful women. Two of those knockouts Tina Louise fresh from Gilligan's Island is in and out of the film in under ten minutes and Nancy Kwan's part doesn't require much more than her looking great in psychedelic dresses and doing karate chops. It's the other two ladies who make an impact despite the script's rather weak efforts to provide them with anything to work with. Elke Sommer phenomenally beautiful manages to be silkily devilish in one stunning outfit after another. The real standout is Sharon Tate as the klutzy but endearing Freya Carlson. This was the tragic beauty's penultimate role before her murder and coupled with her amusing performance in the previous year's Don't Make Waves it shows that she had a very real talent for comedy add into that her lovely looks and she could have had a solid career ahead of her as a glamorous comedienne. Of the four films in the Matt Helm series the first The Silencers is probably the best but this one is a close second.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen any of the other Matt Helm films first off. My main reason for getting this film was that Sharon Tate was in it. I think it's safe to say that out of her very brief acting career her role in The Wrecking Crew is her best out of all her films. In all her other roles she played the blonde sex kitten with little to do but smile pretty for the camera. In this film however she gets the chance to shine as a tough yet sexy redhaired secret agent who assists Dean Martin's Matt Helm in apprehending a group of gold thieves. The plot is ridiculous Dean Martin looks more than a little out of it and the sets and music are bursting with such an infectious '60s vibe that you just have to love it in all of its corniness. That title song is stuck in my head for weeks after I watch the movie  and I love it! Don't miss the catfight between Sharon and Nancy Kwan as well as Sharon's jawdropping bootyshake dance sequence. Oh man what a babe.".

	schema:headline " Better Matt Helm Flick Than The Previous 2 !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Much better than the previous 2 Matt Helm films but not as good as the first THE SILENCERS. THE WRECKING CREW was directed by PHIL KARLSON as was the first Matt Helm movie 3 years earlier. This time around Matt Helm DEAN MARTIN is sent to Denmark to immobilize Count Contini NIGEL GREEN who has hijacked a fortune in gold bullion. Assisting Helm is eager but bumbling Freya Carlson SHARON TATE. Freya is more of a hindrance than a help however. Contini's former flame Lola Medina TINA LOUISEis willing to provide pertinent information to Helm for a cut of the action. She is killed though before she can tell him anything by a bomb laden bottle of scotch placed in her bar by Contini's current paramour Linka ELKE SOMMER. Another beauty in the Count's arsenal is Yu Rang NANCY KWAN. Contini tries to buy Helm off but when that is unsuccessful resorts to a dozen lame brained attempts to murder him. Will Helm triumph over the evil Count Contini ? What do you think ? One of the reasons that this movie is better than the previous 2 is that Helm is giving a female sidekick that is funny. As in THE SILENCERS where you had klutzy Gale Hendricks STELLA STEVENS here you have Freya SHARON TATE in a similar role. Neither MURDERERS ROW nor THE AMBUSHERS had that. And TATE although only 25 when this was made showed very funny comedic ability. The production dollars spent appear less than in all 3 prior Helm flicks. In a scene where Helm is sparring with one of Contini's men outside of the Count's chateau the artificial grass fold up like a rug. The interior sets look like something from a porno movie. The fight scenes are slow and obvious. At 51 MARTIN was getting a little old for this kind of thing. Plus JAMES BOND aside ersatz Spy Films were on their way out. If you watch the credits at the end you'll see a notice that states  Matt Helm will be back in THE RAVAGERS. Alas it was not to be. This genre had run its gamut and what a schmaltzy time it was !!!".

	schema:headline " Green steals the gold Tate steals the movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Fourth and final in a quartet of spoofy films that Martin starred in as secret agent Matt Helm this one is among the best thanks to some curvaceous women and a shift away from the more preposterous gadgetry that marked some of its predecessors. Martin begins the film as usual living the life of a photographer surrounded by buxom women in various deliberately idiotic costumes. He's called into action when alreadywealthy Green pilfers a train car filled with a billion dollar's worth of gold. The first step is interviewing Green's discarded mistress Louise though he is soon entangled with Green's current squeeze Sommer dangerous Asian Kwan and clumsy travel guide Tate. Meanwhile Martin's boss Larch taking over from James Gregory of the previous three installments oversees the operation occasionally pitching in to help. In typical spyfilm tradition everything comes to a head with an extended chase and battle to the death this time involving a helicopter and a train. Martin always at his most relaxed in this series barely takes time to act though he is clearly enamored of Tate the best sidekick he had after Stella Stevens in The Silencers which was a somewhat similar type of character. Green makes for an adequately snide and slick villain constantly referring to his shhedule. This actor died a few years after this film in a sleeping pill overdose. Sommer is a total knockout making a sensational entrance in an almost waisthigh slit lilac dress and showing off many other flattering Moss Mabry creations and striking hairstyles during the movie. Louise turns up the heat in order to get some attention on the crowded canvas and manages to do so rather well. Kwan is sadly rather wasted here. She gets a fair amount of screen time but is mostly underutilized and rarely shown off to her full advantage. The real gem of the movie is Tate. Overcoming a truly atrocious red wig and some decidedly dorky costumes she nonetheless creates a hapless uncoordinated yet utterly appealing character. Her entrance alone is hysterical and predates Mary Katherine Gallagher of Saturday Night Live by more than two decades. Her penchant for loudly stating the obvious often right in Martin's ear only adds to the physical humor. She flaunts her considerable assets at the camera yet backs it up with a deftly handled acting job. The thought of her being viciously murdered in real life not too long after this is almost too much to reflect upon. She is remembered more for her role in the champion of camp Valley of the Dolls but here she proved she was far more than just a looker. It's a shame her own lovely hair wasn't used. Oddly absent this time out is Martin's secretary who was played by Beverly Adams three times prior. These films while always meant to be amusing are enjoyable now because the dated clothes and music add even more to the fun. They entertain almost in spite of themselves and are of special interest to those who enjoy the Austin Powers movies. The credits song House of 7 Joys a place which is not exactly heavily featured in the film makes a bit more sense when one is aware that that was the working title of the movie prior to release. This time out the music can be a bit overbearing. One's tolerance for the sounds of the era will determine how much bah bah bah BAH can be withstood before annoyance sets in. An announced fifth film The Ravagers never came to fruition.".

After a couple of pretty big missteps the series returns to the fine form of the first film The Silencers. This is in no doubt very much due to the return of that film's director Phil Karlson of Walking Tall fame.While the budget was obviously reduced for this one it may have helped the pacing which is not bogged down by cumbersome set pieces and elaborate gadgets. From the time Helm first arrives at Contini's chteau the movie races breezily along helped by well choreographed by Bruce Lee!fight scenes in place of the earlier movies' overblown hovercraft chases runaway spaceships and the like. Additionally this is the only one of the 4 Helm movies where the main villain's death doesn't seem anticlimatic. The soundtrack is great and absolutely helps to keep things moving along as well.This cast is most enjoyable with Nigel Green stealing the show while stealing the gold. He delivers many of the best lines in the movie nay the series. Nancy Kwan and Elke Sommer are excellent as a couple of deadly femme fatales and Tina Louise is rescued from Gilligan's island just in time to give Helm his first lead. Sharon Tate showed a proclivity for comedy that was so deft and popular with movie goers that she was supposed to reprise her role in the never to be made The Ravagers. Also notable was the film debut of a little known martial arts expert named Chuck Norris. Dino himself seems to be enjoying the proceedings this time around and is a little more energetic. MacDonald Helm's boss is now being played by John Larch and actually takes part in some of the action.In conclusion this is one tight exciting and truly funny without being silly little movie at least by Dean Martin Matt Helm standards. It's too bad this was the last in line because it could have served as the action comedy template going forward.".

They include in this film Tina Louise Elke Sommer Nancy Kwan and Sharon Tate.

This film has the curvy very sexy Sharon Tate as Dino's sidekick. Along the way Dino has to locate a billion dollars in gold bullion stolen by mastermind Nigel Green. However he must contend with a bevy of 60's beauties and several henchmen whose fighting is more inept than his. Elke Sommer is Henchwoman elegance Nancy Kwan is exotic beauty and Tina Louise is sultry seductiveness as each takes turns getting in his way. The opening sequence with Martin dozing amongst his young protgs and his penchant for adding new words while singing old songs in order to explain plot points are both funny. Late 60's flavor permeates throughout the film especially in the infectious soundtrack and in the female outfits.However Martin was a bit long in the tooth for this role and he mostly sleepwalks through the film. As a result the film is tedious at times and some of the action scenes seem like repeats of previous scenes. The sound effects for the handkerchief grenades seem out of sync with the footage. The fight scenes are laughable and hopelessly phony at times despite being choreographed by Bruce Lee. Chuck Norris makes his film debut in a bit part as a waiter in a night club. However he is wasted. You won't see him but his voice is unmistakable. Sharon Tate in her second to last film role steals this film and she displays her comedic skills delightfully. She is the best reason to see this film and was the inspiration for Heather Graham's character in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. At the time Tate was considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood and guys watching this will not disagree.  of 4 stars.".

The aging Dean Martin is pathetic as a Bondesquire government agent that women somehow ? find irresistible even those who aren't trying to use him in some way. Austin Powers Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is most often compared to James Bond but he's clearly more like this version of Matt Helm than he ever was to 007. Like Austin Powers Helm's cover is that of an international fashion photographerplayboy. He is in reality only slightly sexier than Don Knotts character in The Love God?. He seems on the edge of sobriety throughout the film and in the scenes where he's up close and personal with his lovely costars I couldn't help wondering if they were fighting the urge to throw up from his rank cigarettebooze breath! Talk about suffering for your Art! I probably feel the worst for the other actors in the film because the whole project could have been better than it was. Yes it was a parody of the secretagent genre of the 1960s that peaked several years earlier but I guess the picture is so disappointing because it seems to be built instead around the person of Dean Martin and his real life image as that of a heavy drinking swinger. Please I'm not completely disregarding his acting ability because he did in fact make some pretty good movies before this one. I liked him in the films he did with Jerry Lewis but Martin just seems to be taking it way too easy in this one and not really even trying. Perhaps when you're an established star you don't have to. The legendary Bruce Lee choreographed the fight scenes in The Wrecking Crew but I can't imagine him bragging too much about it. Tina Louise Gilligan's Island goes through the same kind of seductress routine she worked so hard to perfect with Bob Denver all those years on the uncharted desert isle and is as lovely as she ever was. Elke Sommer is convincing as a menacing moll but Nancy Kwan is forgettable as a stereotyped Asian. I've seen that Chuck Norris was in the film as well but I've never been able to spot him. Nigel Green is just plain annoying as the Count who's responsible for stealing the gold. Just try counting the number of times he says schedule. Aaargh! He comes off as a poofy snobby aristocrat. Alright maybe that's how he was supposed to be. Goofs Although the film supposedly takes place in Denmark everyone including the cops who drive Ford automobiles speak English with no accent whatsoever! There are a few shots near the beginning of Matt Helm driving through a Danish city but that's it! The driving scenes with Matt Helm and Freya Carlson are obviously California. The scenes involving the train may be Europe but I'm not sure. I'm in Germany now and have been in Europe for the past 4 years and I have seen many areas that resemble the terrain in those shots. At various times in the film characters watch video screens to see the train speed through the countrysidehow? Has the evil Count placed cameras along the track? Does he have tiny flying robots equipped with cameras to follow the train? I guess I'm looking too deep. The most glaring blunder has got to involve the astroturf used in several shots to make the outside of the Count's estate. Matt Helm throws an exploding hanky ???? at a door seconds before he dives over a hedge onto the grass. As he hits the grass it compresses because of the extensive padding beneath and a large area of the astroturf kicks up. Come on editor Maury Winetrobe. And now Sharon Tateshe is probably the one reason to watch this film. She plays Freya Carlson and got the most screen time in this film than in any other of her previous works. The only other movie she made after this one was called 12  1 in which she also had a major role. Sharon Tate was beautiful. She also came across as a very sincere actress in all of her roles but The Wrecking Crew gave her the chance to be more that just a pretty face. She had said in an interview early in her career that she knew she could never do Shakespeare but would like to try light comedy. She went on to say that she realized that comedy was very difficult because you have to be so serious. I'm so glad that Sharon got the opportunity to do both this and 12  1 before her life was taken. She proved that she did in fact have very real potential as a comedic actress. Sharon really shines every time she's on the screen and I really came away feeling like I had a much better concept of what she must have been like as a person than from any of her other films. Why on earth the director had in a red wig is beyond me. She had such beautiful blonde hair at that time in her life. I highly recommend this film to any fan of Sharon Tate. 8 out of 10 because of her.".

	schema:headline " Much Like the Other 3 Matt Helm Movies";
	schema:reviewBody "A train carrying 1 billion in gold is hijacked in Denmark and secret agent Matt Helm Dean Martin has only 48 hours upon his arrival there before British and American markets collapse. The person the secret organization I.C.E. believes is responsible is the multimillionaire Count Contini Nigel Green. Assisting him is his beautiful but deadly fianc Linka Karensky Elke Sommer and his top agent from Hong Kong YuRang Nancy Kwan. As luck would have it Count Contini has recently dumped his mistress Lola Medina Tina Louise and she is willing to make a deal. So with only the help of an assistant named Freya Carlson Sharon Tate waiting for him in Denmark Matt Helm flies to Copenhagen to retrieve the gold. At any rate rather than reveal what happens next I will just say that this movie is loaded with sexy women who all want to get close to Matt for one reason or another. In that regard I thought both Elke Sommer and Nancy Kwan performed very well in their respective roles. Dean Martin was solid and Tina Louise looked great. But her role was a bit too short in my view. Sharon Tate also put on a good performance but her character was too inconsistent. One minute she's a dulllooking klutz and the next she's a sexy secret agent. Likewise except for the fight between YuRang and Freya the combat scenes were quite boring. In short this film is much like the other 3 Matt Helm movies with some really nicelooking actresses thrown in for good measure. It definitely has some flaws but all things considered it's still watchable all the same.".

	onyx:emotionText "A train carrying 1 billion in gold is hijacked in Denmark and secret agent Matt Helm Dean Martin has only 48 hours upon his arrival there before British and American markets collapse. The person the secret organization I.C.E. believes is responsible is the multimillionaire Count Contini Nigel Green. Assisting him is his beautiful but deadly fianc Linka Karensky Elke Sommer and his top agent from Hong Kong YuRang Nancy Kwan. As luck would have it Count Contini has recently dumped his mistress Lola Medina Tina Louise and she is willing to make a deal. So with only the help of an assistant named Freya Carlson Sharon Tate waiting for him in Denmark Matt Helm flies to Copenhagen to retrieve the gold. At any rate rather than reveal what happens next I will just say that this movie is loaded with sexy women who all want to get close to Matt for one reason or another. In that regard I thought both Elke Sommer and Nancy Kwan performed very well in their respective roles. Dean Martin was solid and Tina Louise looked great. But her role was a bit too short in my view. Sharon Tate also put on a good performance but her character was too inconsistent. One minute she's a dulllooking klutz and the next she's a sexy secret agent. Likewise except for the fight between YuRang and Freya the combat scenes were quite boring. In short this film is much like the other 3 Matt Helm movies with some really nicelooking actresses thrown in for good measure. It definitely has some flaws but all things considered it's still watchable all the same.";

Sharon Tate in one of her last screen appearances reprises Stella Stevens' klutzy sidekick part from The Silencers but like the movie as a whole does not quite hit the right note with it making for a hit and miss performance. The whole exercise is silly beyond belief the usual jokes about DeanMatt's drinking and womanizing fall flat and Dean himself was beginning to look a little old for an action hero. Plus the sets and settings looked a bit cheap and stagebound for what was supposed to be an international action hit. What 'entertainment' value there is here involves the camera lingering on the legs and cleavages of Dean's shapely costars and the tight plot from Don Hamilton's novel is a dogeared illogical mess by the time it hit the screen. Any true actionsuspense fan will rapidly develop a headache from the gaps and gaffs in the logic of what is left of the plot.The final credits advertise a fifth Matt Helm adventure  The Ravagers  which was never made.

Instead of another American city or even TokyoLondon this time around we watch Moscow under attack. Instead of having to see the characters running and hiding around the same New York for the nth time we are presented an 'unknown' scenario that has a lot of charm going for it.Another plus is the aliens themselves. Not your typical armorwearing soldiers or 'greys' but in here they have a very original design bodyless masses of light. It is sad to hear the clichd excuse for their invasion but they are very interesting to see.Despite these flairs of originality overall the film suffers from the typical Bmovie scifi problems. The blandness of the cast and some logicdefying situationsdevelopments every Russian they meet speak perfect English for example are downsides but the straightforward plot lack of an overly pretentious message and nonboring development more than compensate.Overall this is far from a great film but it is a fun straightforward Bmovie with some welcome flashes of originality.

I really wanted to see Sir Brad Bird's Mission Impossible but my friend wanted to see it with me so I went for the next best thing a Summit film. If you have can't the best get the worst Fat Man sez. Just going to start off with a disclaimer SPOILER ALERTS. I won't say the movie was predictable but it certainly wasn't rational. Throughout this review I'll be throwing in some sane personwriter pop quizzes. Let's see how you stack up!The Darkest Hour starts with our   heros     I really couldn't put enough quotes around that word  flying in to Moscow on the worst CG airplane I've ever seen. Nice Summit. Sean and Ben are there to pitch their newest internet craze Apple phones apps  World Travel Hunter I honestly don't remember  to an investment group. They find that their Swedish buddy Skyler has ripped off their idea and is selling it as they walk in the room. WHOA!! In a fit of being sad they end up at a hip hip Moscow night club with two of the stupidest people on the continent Natalie and Anne. Now that we have our cast of dummies aliens invade. They hide in the basement of the club for a week until the coast is clear.POP QUIZ 1! Aliens have attacked and slaughtered most humans alive. You're an American in Moscow and still alive. What do you do? A Head for the closest police station. B Head for the closest military base. C Head for the highest building to get a vantage point on the action. D Head for the American Embassy.If you chose D you're in good company. Off they go! Oh wait it's time forPOP QUIZ 2! Aliens have attacked and slaughtered most humans alive. You're in Moscow and you know nothing except that they are out for blood. You've got to get to sigh the American Embassy. How do you get there? A Try to move from building to building using interconnects. B Walk down the middle of the biggest street you can find in full view of everything. C Use the ancient Moscow sewer and tunnel systems. D Take advantage of the extensive underground transit system.If you answered B not only was that the best choice but you're still alive. Now at the embassy they find nobody is there but somehow discover there's a SUBMARINE leaving soon that will take them to relative safety. Joined by others along the way they finally get on a boat to float down to the sub. Oh Ben Skylar and Anne are now dead. Guess those choices weren't so good after all. A huge blast knocks the boat over and everybody manages to make it to the sub 50 feet away except for NatalieFINAL QUIZ! 3 FOR ALL THE MARBLES! You are trying to get to the safety of a submarine when you're knocked in to the water. Do you.. A Resurface swim to the sub and get in. B Resurface swim to the sub and get in. C Resurface swim to the bank walk 20 feet to the sub and get in. D Resurface swim to the bank head a half mile inland at a dead sprint and hide in a bus.If you chose D you are the love interest of The Darkest Hour and we're supposed to be cheering for you to make it. Wow. Wow. Needless to say or maybe I should since nothing else made sense they retrieve her kill a few aliens and head off. The crappy VO at the end lets us know a few other aliens have been killed and one or two ships blown up. So? They're stripmining the earth and then leaving.I've aired most of my complaints already but it's worth noting a few other things. Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella are no slouches acting wise but you couldn't tell. Even good actors need direction I suppose. I also take back everything I've said about wanting better monster design. These were completely original and completely horrible.Darkest Hour really leaves me a little torn. On one hand I enjoyed the film immensely. It's like watching a car full of Hollywood producers roll down a hill catch fire and burst in to flames. Beautiful and hilarious in its tragedy. On the other hand this film got heavily marketed released in over 2000 theaters and did terrible in the box office. Hollywood complains that nobody wants to go to movies nobody is buying tickets it's all the fault of pirates we need more more more restrictions so we can make every bit we can. Funny the top monthly grosses have all happened since 2007 most since 2009 and 4 in 2011 alone. Who's not making enough money? This will also be held up as an example of why original work doesn't sell  more prequels sequels and remakes for everyone! Maybe if you had a screening process for scripts and gave creative control to directors and writers instead of a pile of producers good original work would be successful.Merry Christmas everyone. Continue to vote with your dollar and give your hard earned cash to deserving movies.".

Sure the whole alien invaders thing has been done a lot and this sticks to the formula to a certain extent minus the annoying deus ex machina plot device but it was original enough to set it apart.The acting while not Oscar worthy was definitely fine for this genre of movie. The setting deserted Moscow after the invasion was well done and the effects apart from the opening airplane shot were pretty good too. There was just enough suspense and action to keep things interesting and while I didn't feel a deep bond with the characters I still rooted for them to survive.All in all this was a pretty fun movie and throughout it I keep wondering to myself why there were so many bad reviews because I was definitely liking it.Don't listen to the critics who are too full of themselves and don't get this kind of movie judge for yourself. If after seeing the trailer you think you'll enjoy the movie you probably will if you go into it unbiased. I definitely did.".

There was just enough suspense and action to keep things interesting and while I didn't feel a deep bond with the characters I still rooted for them to survive.All in all this was a pretty fun movie and throughout it I keep wondering to myself why there were so many bad reviews because I was definitely liking it.Don't listen to the critics who are too full of themselves and don't get this kind of movie judge for yourself. If after seeing the trailer you think you'll enjoy the movie you probably will if you go into it unbiased. I definitely did.";

The movie is set in Moscow the most actors are Russian and the 2 supposedly American girls are occasionally speaking with a British accent. This is probably a bit too much for a patriot. The next point would be the acting it is not that good and the special effects range from brilliant to not so brilliant but then again this is a 30 Million Budget movie they city of Moscow went through hoops to make it happen by closing down main roads and entire quarters. The scenes when humans are getting killed are extremely well done an innovative and the whole plot is very exciting and doesn't give much time to breath.If you aren't ignorant to let another country but the USA be the good guys for once you will simply love that movie if your heroes must kiss the love interest in front of an American flag then forget about it.Great movie not so great actors but all in all enjoyable and 8 points for a new idea of an Alien Invasion.".

I confess I hadn't wanted to go at all but my friend insisted and so to keep the peace I went. Granted the beginning is a uneven and it was unclear where the story was going but once it clicks in the thing moves right along. You are never sure who is going to die next and that helps keep the suspense level high. The acting is serviceable and the location is a refreshing change from the usual New YorkChicago skylines. It's frankly more interesting to watch the tale unfold against the dinginess of contemporary Moscow and with Russian soldiers instead of Americans. Moreover the special effects are simple but effective.In essence invisible beings are here to steal our electricity and only insulators e.g. glass or Faraday Cages enable us to be hide from them. Because they are ruthless and utterly determined there is no hope for negotiation no chance for peace. Early on it is made clear either we win or we will be exterminated. I liked everything about the movie even though the alien invasion genre has gotten a bit tired of late. I was never bored and was always in suspense as to what would happen next. At 89 minutes this joint RussianAmerican production probably could have taken more time with its story and characters and not be in such a hurry to kill them off. Since the background is so different maybe they could have shown us more of the city or used the locations more effectively. Yet for all the obvious complaints one can make the move works if you let it. I believe viewers will find it worth their while. Take it for what it is and I honestly think you will have a good time at The Darkest Hour.".

Here's what I noticed defining this movie from other alien invasion concepts SPOILERS 1. They weren't identifiable humanoid invaders. That definitely gave me a different perspective on differing lifeforms. 905 of the alien movies I see even if they try to hide their true form end up being mostly humanoid in shape. 2. There was no identifiable warning for the alien attack. It just happened and it was sudden. 3. It was through the perspective of every day schmucks who had to figure it all out on their own. There were no convenient plot devices like a misc. scientist who just popped up and already knew all of the answers. 4. The mode of fighting back was a gradual process.

SPOILERSIt most certainly is not the most creative alien movie I have seen in a long while I reserve that for Paul but it most certainly was not unoriginal. They took the reference of an alien invasion for our resources which is a common plot device but changed the perspective eventual solution and even the antagonistic element. I haven't seen that since Battle of Los Angeles though that movie only received a 2 so I guess I shouldn't really be surprised Darkest Hour is getting this kind of rating. Also not to try and call anyone specific out but it's easy to say something like It's unoriginal while giving no hint as to what you think would constitute as an original idea...I keep reading these reviews that have the phrase It's unoriginal stretched out into 3 paragraphs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Granted I wasn't expecting a great deal from The Darkest Hour where the trailers have probably spelt out the entire film from beginning to end and more than validated it to be nothing but a special effects extravaganza. Then again what you have already seen is it as The Darkest Hour indeed is the darkest in terms of filmmaking having nothing else served up to excite nor to thrill sticking to what would be a rote storyline packaged hundreds of times over.The selling point of the film is of course Timur Bekmambetov's name on the credits a filmmaker who had made everyone sit up and take notice of his inventive stylish science fiction films out of Russia  Night Watch and Day Watch  that Hollywood had come wooing and from then on it's either producer creds to help boost some languishing production or allowing the filmmaker to helm his own like in Wanted. Not everything he touches turns to gold of course and sadly The Darkest Hour boasted what could have been something he could have done but ultimately falling very flat on its face because of the lack of freshness in its story written by Leslie Bohem M.T. Ahem and Jon Spaihts who also had screenplay responsibilities.The premise is as bland as you can get and frankly can work in any other major city if not for the exoticness of Moscow and Bekmambetov's connection of course. The characters too can be anyone other than the software engineering duo Sean Emile Hirsch and Ben Max Minghella who flew halfway across the world to find out they were outplayed by their Swedish competitor Skyler Joel Kinnaman and two holidaying teenage girls Natalie Olivia Thirlby and Anne Rachael Taylor who all got together in a hip pub only for what could have led to respective one night stands interrupted by a parade of lights falling from the sky which from the trailer you will know contain some mean invisible aliens out to annihilate all of humankind for our energy.Yes you read that right invisible aliens. They have this innate ability to light up bulbs activate anything that's run by electricity since it's a signature they carry before being allowed to reveal something extra in the final few scenes. Sure something invisible would work in playing up our fears but the way director Chris Gorak did it his inexperience shows. Similar genre films like Attack The Block built anticipation nicely but here we get nothing of that sort of emotional engagement as it teases through elements that suggest vulnerability and chinks in the adversary's armour force fields of sorts that are entirely resistant to whatever arsenal us humans can throw at it if we can get to realize their positions first.The plot could have been written by any newbie hack sent packing home to watch countless of alien invasion and monster movies to be able to come up with something that's really quite plain and lacking true suspense. In some ways it's like an amalgamation of science fiction films from I am Legend to other contemporary alien invasion type movies except that we don't give a hoot too much for the characters involved here so much so that the filmmakers have the audacity and courage to ensure equal opportunity to become alien fodder which is a rarity.Effects wise this two trick pony will soon wear out its novelty the first of which is the way the aliens turn humans and all living creatures into swirling dust upon contact and the second of which is an electrical whiplike probe that goes feeling around for lifeforms. Nothing terribly original here and after a while these limited bag of tricks do become a little stale. As for its 3D presentation there's only depth of field getting human dust falling all over as well as having exploding debris hurtle toward the screen. Some large scale effects like collapsing walls and huge probes to siphon Earth's resources still looked a little bit rawPerhaps then if you're looking for any sliver of merit to watch this it will be for the on location shoots in Russia as well as having this film mark what would be a rare treat at having Russian soldiersmercenaries in action up against the enemy compared to the usual US led war machinery in any alien invasion film and this one also marking a USARussia collaboration amongst survivors in this postcold war era. But you need not have to look that deep into this film because it's indeed a struggle to find something unique and of narrative quality failing which The Darkest Hour is only at best a mediocre film that offers nothing new.".

	onyx:emotionText "Granted I wasn't expecting a great deal from The Darkest Hour where the trailers have probably spelt out the entire film from beginning to end and more than validated it to be nothing but a special effects extravaganza. Then again what you have already seen is it as The Darkest Hour indeed is the darkest in terms of filmmaking having nothing else served up to excite nor to thrill sticking to what would be a rote storyline packaged hundreds of times over.The selling point of the film is of course Timur Bekmambetov's name on the credits a filmmaker who had made everyone sit up and take notice of his inventive stylish science fiction films out of Russia  Night Watch and Day Watch  that Hollywood had come wooing and from then on it's either producer creds to help boost some languishing production or allowing the filmmaker to helm his own like in Wanted. Not everything he touches turns to gold of course and sadly The Darkest Hour boasted what could have been something he could have done but ultimately falling very flat on its face because of the lack of freshness in its story written by Leslie Bohem M.T. Ahem and Jon Spaihts who also had screenplay responsibilities.The premise is as bland as you can get and frankly can work in any other major city if not for the exoticness of Moscow and Bekmambetov's connection of course. The characters too can be anyone other than the software engineering duo Sean Emile Hirsch and Ben Max Minghella who flew halfway across the world to find out they were outplayed by their Swedish competitor Skyler Joel Kinnaman and two holidaying teenage girls Natalie Olivia Thirlby and Anne Rachael Taylor who all got together in a hip pub only for what could have led to respective one night stands interrupted by a parade of lights falling from the sky which from the trailer you will know contain some mean invisible aliens out to annihilate all of humankind for our energy.Yes you read that right invisible aliens. They have this innate ability to light up bulbs activate anything that's run by electricity since it's a signature they carry before being allowed to reveal something extra in the final few scenes. Sure something invisible would work in playing up our fears but the way director Chris Gorak did it his inexperience shows.

Similar to the above movies we follow a small group of survivors as they try to escape the human extermination. The alien invaders eschew WMDs and choose hand to hand combat patrolling as near invisible ball of sparks and zapping humans to ash as they find them.One thing I should probably clarify is that this is a scifi movie and not a horror movie. I am making this distinction because the aliens though deadly and powerful do have their limitations that create rules for surviving and fighting them.Another thing I noted was that the movie really respects its Russian characters even though the movie is presented through American eyes. I noticed that Timur Bekmambetov was a producer in the movie and had probably something to do with it. We meet the heroic soldiers fighting the aliens the resourceful young girl and the crazy scientist using homemade equipment to figure out the aliens. This is quite refreshing since most American productions in foreign countries suffer from this malaise that they make the local characters weak and one dimensional.If you like this genre this is an above average movie in the genre and quite entertaining. I don't think it manages to rise above its genre but as an action scifi movie with 3D and lots of special effects it's worth the ticket price.".

	schema:headline " Fun but formulaic scifi thriller that should have been more";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a Bgrade movie and you should go in expecting one. Certainly it won't win over many critics. Still there are some thrills in this apocalyptic scifi thriller. Even though it leaves a middling aftertaste. Thankfully it runs at a lean 89 minutes and doesn't waste too much time in exposition which are sometimes cringeworthy. For me it does throw in a few interesting ideas which prevent it from being just another cookiecutter entry in the increasingly stale genre.First the aliens. Instead of taking on the snarly form we've seen in countless films they are invisible to the human eye and exist in the form of microwave energy. The only way they can be detected is when they pass through an object powered by electricity. And they kill humans by turning them into ashes. Because the aliens can't be seen the killings are unpredictable.Second I like the idea of transposing the American protagonists and the apocalypse to a foreign city Moscow instead of the trite New York City or Los Angeles. The stereotypes of Russian culture are played for laughs though most of the jokes come across flat. However you get to relish the many famous sights and landmarks such as The Red Square in ruins.In terms of characters most of them are disposable. Even the leads Emile Hirsch Olivia Thirlby and Max Minghella come across as likable at best but not memorable. It doesn't help that they are given lame oneliners. I wish they had given the eccentric Russian electrician and his cacophony of gadgets more screen time.The Darkest Hour has a great setup. Pity the makers didn't have the balls to strive beyond formula. Even if the ending sets it up for a sequel I reckon its box office performance will convince the studio they need one.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a Bgrade movie and you should go in expecting one. Certainly it won't win over many critics. Still there are some thrills in this apocalyptic scifi thriller. Even though it leaves a middling aftertaste. Thankfully it runs at a lean 89 minutes and doesn't waste too much time in exposition which are sometimes cringeworthy. For me it does throw in a few interesting ideas which prevent it from being just another cookiecutter entry in the increasingly stale genre.First the aliens.

One can easily guess that Timur Bekmambetov's name was only added to make sure more people will go and watch this garbage  even if the decent CGI and Russian milieu not to mention the use of many Cyrillic letters are all his signature elements these cannot sell something that is severely underdeveloped. It was a huge disappoint seeing Emile Hirsch in such a film after the remarkably welldone Into The Wild. The repertoire of Emile and his companions includes such wonderful sentences as Don't got there!

The comedy is fastpaced and often very sharpedged and almost any viewer will find it hitting close to home at one time or another so it is best not to take it too personally. Yet this is not a meanspirited feature in that it treats everyone the same way and it shows sympathy even for the very characters whose faults it so ruthlessly exposes.Frederic March as a hardened newsman and Carole Lombard as an appealing woman who is nevertheless living a lie make a good combination. They are both likable enough to make you care about them even when they are at their most opportunistic. The supporting cast likewise features several good performances with the likes of Walter Connolly and Sig Rumann getting some fine moments of their own. William Wellman shows a good feel for the material getting good mileage out of the story without pushing it too far.This kind of feature is somewhat unusual even among movies of its genre. Most satires choose their targets ridicule them and put the opposing forces in a positive light. But Nothing Sacred takes no sides between the small town and the big city between the powerful and the powerless or between one character and another. It points out the human flaws to be found in almost all of us.This is the kind of movie that can only be enjoyed if you don't take it personally or too seriously because in that case the message will be misunderstood. Rather than targeting any one kind of person it intends to make some more general points about human nature that while sometimes rather pointed are encased in enough humor to make them palatable.".

If you don't want to see physical abuse made funny don't see this hilarious satire on everything politically correct. Of course what really makes this hilarious is that in 1937 they didn't KNOW it was politically incorrect to show man hitting women to show 'darkies' irascible and  rude  New Englanders etc. Then there's the propellerdriven airplanes the first of the airliners flying right past the head of the Statue of Liberty.  And guess what?  Jack Welch's fortress Rockefeller Center looked then just like it looks now. Some things don't change newspaper chicanery among others.  The hoaxes they bring about and the hoaxes they continue to abet all in the name of news is not news anymore.....it's SOP. Right now the current hoax is the nomenclature used to describe the appointing of the Cabinet as though the election were a fait accomplis Andrew Card the president's new appointee...... and other such insiduously assumptive language has been used before as this movie wonderfully points out.  In this case it's a woman at death's door dying of radium poisoning.....who ain't!!!  I'm giving nothing away it's perfectly obvious from the beginning.  I suppose I should rail against the prejudice shown against all newspaper folks by the good people of Vermont as they shut this guy out....with one toddler biting him on the leg as he walks down the street....but it just felt too good. After all some really do take their jobs as members of the 4th Estate and protectors of the common good seriously.The color is pretty good for 1937 and you'll see the Wicked Witch of the East portraying her less wicked but still spiteful self. What will give you chills is the pervading knowledge as you hear Carole Lombard's dialogue about death and dying...that she wasn't to ever grow old gracefully but died in a plane crash not long  after this film was made. She was a beautiful woman and did quiet a good job of acting in this manyfaceted satire of life and our attraction to dying or the pretense of it.Well worth your time on many levels ...just to see filmmaking of the 30's and how good it could be for one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The incandescent Carole Lombard was simply the most beautiful comedienne during Hollywood's golden era of the 1930's. In fact the one conceit of the film is how her stunning glamour especially in the newspaper photos seems at odds with the innocent smalltown girl she portrays in this 1937 screwball comedy classic directed in licketysplit fashion by the twofisted William Wild Bill Wellman. Lombard never let her beauty get in the way of being funny and her effervescent manner makes her seem dotty enough to make the crazy situations she gets into believable. Moreover the film's constant tweaking at the public obsession over a young woman's impending death predates the concept of reality programming by nearly 70 years.For a movie that clocks in at just 75 minutes the farfetched story is fairly dense but clips by without a wasted moment. In brief Wally Cook is a New York tabloid reporter relegated to the obituaries after his most recent story is exposed as fake. Seeking to rehabilitate his career he uncovers a story on Hazel Flagg a woman in rural Vermont dying of radium poisoning. When he arrives in her town she suddenly learns that her diagnosis was a mistake and that she is not dying at all. However feeling constrained by her small town existence Hazel pretends to be terminally ill in order to accept Wally's offer to take her to New York City. In true 1930's fashion New York pours its heart out to her making her an instant media celebrity. Hazel starts to feel guilty over the misdirected attention and of course Wally and Hazel find themselves falling in love amid all the deception and inevitable chaos.Just coming off his classic dramatic turn in the most cohesive version of A Star Is Born stalwart leading actor Fredric March gamely plays the initially cynical Wally with the right everyman demeanor though I kept thinking how much more at home William Powell or Cary Grant would have been in the role. The lovable Lombard makes Hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan. They have a classic sparring scene near the end where each lands a punch on the jaw of the other. Familiar character actors complete the cast with Walter Connolly in constipated frustration as Wally's constantly boiling editorinchief aptly named Oliver Stone Charles Winninger properly pixilated as Hazel's fraud of a doctor and familiar faces like Sig Ruman Margaret Hamilton Hattie McDaniel and Hedda Hopper in little more than walkon parts.Wellman displays an idiosyncratic way with the camera for instance focusing on Lombard's ankles as she flirts with March in an open crate or having a tree branch cover their faces during a key dialogue scene. Unsurprisingly the director of Wings and Lafayette Escadrille inserted a scene aboard a plane to show off the Manhattan skyline. One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age a constant popping noise exists in the background. Not as good as My Man Godfrey nor as funny as Bringing Up Baby Nothing Sacred is still great entertainment and a rare opportunity to see the luminous Lombard at full star wattage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing Sacred has been remade in whole or part many times but no version comes close to the original 1937 screwball comedy starring Frederic March and Carole Lombard. Directed by William Wellman with a script by Ben Hecht Nothing Sacred is more topical today than it was then. There's been a good deal written on this board about the political incorrectness of it racism drunkenness physical abuse stereotyping. It's true there's something to offend everyone. Instead of judging everything by today's enlightened standards I prefer to notice that yes things were different in the past and then move on to the wonderful witty script the very modern topic the great performances the early muted color Lombard's outfits the old airplane and the scenes of New York as it was in all its glory in the 1930s.March is Wally Cook a reporter in hot water for writing about the Sultan of Brunai who in reality is a regular Joe working in New York with a wife who identifies him while he's making pronouncements. Wally goes to Vermont to hunt down a story about a woman dying of radium poisoning and finds her in the person of Hazel Flagg Lombard. Hazel has just gotten some very bad news from her doctor Charles Winninger  she's not dying. The diagnosis was a mistake. She had hopes of taking a trip out of Vermont that was offered to her and asks the doctor to keep the new diagnosis of health quiet. Soon after she meets Wally who wants to bring her to New York for a last fling at the expense of the paper which will follow her until her last poisoned breath. Hazel agrees and takes the doctor with her. At first she has a blast with only the occasional twinge of guilt. Then a German specialist is brought in and blows Hazel's scam all to hell.One of the comments had it right  this story predates reality shows by something like 63 years. Hazel like so many today is an ersatz celebrity famous for being famous. What will never change is milking a subject for profit until it's dry. Nothing Sacred has some hilarious scenes and great lines including the big fight scene in the hotel when Wally tries to make Hazel seem ill by forcing her to fight with him in order to sweat and raise her pulse rate. The nightclub scene is a riot.Lombard is beautiful and wears some stunning outfits and gowns a gift to Hazel from the newspaper. She was a very adept actress with a wonderful sense of comedy. How sad that she is in a film about dying young and would do so five years later at the age of 34. She and March do a great job together  he's normally not known for his comedy but does well here. He approach to Wally is serious and he plays Wally's intensity and affection for Hazel for all it's worth. Connelly as his editor is fabulous as is Winninger as the doctor who drinks his way through New York.Nothing Sacred has been a musical Hazel Flagg and remade as Living it Up with Jerry Lewis as Homer Flagg. Most recently the general plot was reworked as Last Holiday. See the original in the screwball comedy genre which is alas no more.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1937 screwball comedy is perhaps the only Technicolour film of it's genre and what a fun exuberant ride it is! Reliable 30's leading man Fredric March stars as Walter Cook a reporter at the New York newspaper 'The Morning Star' who will do anything for a good story. After a botched attempt to pass off a AfricanAmerican commoner as the Sultan Of Brunei Wally desperate to redeem himself travels to Vermont to cover the last remaining weeks of Hazel Flagg's the wonderful Carole Lombard radiumpoisoninginterrupted life. The trouble is Hazel's not really sick at all she was initially misdiagnosed by her bumbling Vermont doctor. Still Hazel jumps at Cook's offer for her to take a lastgasp trip to the Big City. She's a big hit with the City as the new 'bleeding heart' story. As the pair inevitably fall in love Hazel's conscience starts to get the better of her and things start to unravel very fast.Lombard and March! What can I say...they are terrific together! Carole's bright and gorgeous this is one of her best performances. She's slightly too glamorous to be a smalltown Vermont gal but she's very believable in the role otherwise. As one of the best comic actresses ever to grace the screen she lights up and gives wit to every scene. March is likable attractive and does comedy very well. The pair share numerous classic moments together particularly in the mock 'fight' scene. They IMO rank up there with HepburnGrant and GableColbert as one of the great screwball pairings.The colourful supporting players are a lark too. Watch for the lady better known as The Wicked Witch Of The West Margaret Hamilton early in the film as one of the many seemingly 'backward' residents of Vermont. Yep anyone? Walter Connolly is priceless as the stressed newspaper boss Oliver Stone. Applause must go to Billy Barty as the young Vermont boy who bites March on the calf for providing possibly the most spontaneous and funny moment in the entire film.Aside from the fun and games this is a wonderful satire on both the values of modern society and the corruption of truth by the media. From the opening shots of busy New York nightlife watch for the very prominent CocaCola sign and Bigcity skyscrapers obviously inspired by King Vidor's silent 'The Crowd' we know that we are getting a screwball comedy with a message. Aside from certain racist and sexist elements that the modern viewer may find slightly off putting this film holds up very well.The only problem with this film is the rather slow opening sequence. The laughs only really flow fast and freely when we arrive at Vermont and Lombard makes her entrance 15 minutes into the film. The colour is slightly dodgy or is it just my copy? which is understandable as it is one of the early colour films.Another one of those 30's comedies that didn't have to rely on toilet humour or sex jokes in order to be entertaining.My rating 810".

Nothing Sacred is mandatory viewing for anybody who loves old Hollywood comedies screwball or otherwise and I rate it a solid TEN.".

When Wallace and Hazel 'wrestled' at the end of the film it was to fake Hazel's pneumonia in attempts to make it seem more realistic. I thought it was a good idea to reincorporate it.

	schema:reviewBody "Frederick March is a reporter on a New York paper desperate for a feature story. He digs up a notice of a young woman in Vermont Carole Lombard who has been diagnosed as terminally ill with radium poisoning. Not knowing the diagnosis was a mistake made by a bibulous rural doctor March rushes to Vermont and offers the dying woman a trip to New York all expenses paid for a last fling. Lombard has discovered the mistaken diagnosis but in thrall to the prospect of a vacation in the Big Apple agrees to go along.She's exploited by the newspaper and becomes a celebrity. She gets the keys to the city for her bravery. People weep at her name. The governor endorses a Hazel Flagg Day. Everything Lombard does  such as getting drunk and passing out at a big affair in her honor  is interpreted as a sign of her mysterious but debilitating illness.A quartet of European doctors finally uncover her real state which has more to do with radiance than radium. She and March have fallen in love. Lombard leaves a farewell note to the city claiming she is going off to die alone like an elephant and the couple escape on a ship.I'd heard this was an outstanding screwball comedy of the sort common in the mid and late 30s so the first time I saw it years ago I thought I had caught the wrong movie because it wasn't very funny. I've just seen it again and it's still not funny.It's rushed yes and sometimes a little hysterical and everyone involved tries for boffo laughs but it doesn't clear the bar set by such other examples of the genre as Bringing up Baby or It Happened One Night or The Palm Beach Story. I hate to say it because so much effort is on display and because Carole Lombard scintillates in the role of the deceptive but fundamentally decent Hazel Flagg. But Frederick March a fine actor in serious parts is miscast. Somebody like Clark Gable or Cary Grant is called for  an earnest extrovert. The funniest scene I gather is when March knocks Lombard unconscious in the bedroom. Maybe I'm becoming patriarchal but it doesn't make me laugh to see a woman punched in the jaw. Well maybe my ex wife. As it is the funniest scenes involve ancillary characters like German doctors and Scandinavian firemen who are on screen collectively for about ten minutes.The plot itself has a lot of builtin tension because after all both Lombard and the audience know she isn't sick.

	onyx:emotionText "Frederick March is a reporter on a New York paper desperate for a feature story. He digs up a notice of a young woman in Vermont Carole Lombard who has been diagnosed as terminally ill with radium poisoning. Not knowing the diagnosis was a mistake made by a bibulous rural doctor March rushes to Vermont and offers the dying woman a trip to New York all expenses paid for a last fling. Lombard has discovered the mistaken diagnosis but in thrall to the prospect of a vacation in the Big Apple agrees to go along.She's exploited by the newspaper and becomes a celebrity. She gets the keys to the city for her bravery. People weep at her name. The governor endorses a Hazel Flagg Day. Everything Lombard does  such as getting drunk and passing out at a big affair in her honor  is interpreted as a sign of her mysterious but debilitating illness.A quartet of European doctors finally uncover her real state which has more to do with radiance than radium. She and March have fallen in love. Lombard leaves a farewell note to the city claiming she is going off to die alone like an elephant and the couple escape on a ship.I'd heard this was an outstanding screwball comedy of the sort common in the mid and late 30s so the first time I saw it years ago I thought I had caught the wrong movie because it wasn't very funny. I've just seen it again and it's still not funny.It's rushed yes and sometimes a little hysterical and everyone involved tries for boffo laughs but it doesn't clear the bar set by such other examples of the genre as Bringing up Baby or It Happened One Night or The Palm Beach Story. I hate to say it because so much effort is on display and because Carole Lombard scintillates in the role of the deceptive but fundamentally decent Hazel Flagg. But Frederick March a fine actor in serious parts is miscast. Somebody like Clark Gable or Cary Grant is called for  an earnest extrovert. The funniest scene I gather is when March knocks Lombard unconscious in the bedroom. Maybe I'm becoming patriarchal but it doesn't make me laugh to see a woman punched in the jaw. Well maybe my ex wife. As it is the funniest scenes involve ancillary characters like German doctors and Scandinavian firemen who are on screen collectively for about ten minutes.The plot itself has a lot of builtin tension because after all both Lombard and the audience know she isn't sick. So how and when will the charade be brought to a finish? Actually it leaves a thoughtful person a little uncomfortable because what we have here is an example of an aborted rite of passage. A rite of passage marks the transition of the subject from one status to another.

Then in an attempt to redeem himself he then immediately makes the exact same mistake. He rushes into another feel good story without doing any research. Hazel Flagg is meant to be seen as a pitiable girl in over her head but acts like a spoiled child. Dr. Enoch Downer can't make up his mind between being a reluctant participant or complete imbecile. And the movie's message is that newspapers always lie to get a story and readers are foolish and selfish to latch onto sob stories. The worst part of it all is that this screwball comedy just isn't funny. Site gags and clever wit are very rarely seen and even more rarely successful. The final joke of the movie is the doctor waking up and thinking the hotel he is in has sunk underwater because he hasn't realized he's on a boat. That joke belongs in a Looney tunes cartoon.

Frederick March was 40 years and had been starring in movies for 8 years. He was starring in his 37th film. Thus we have two top stars totally professional at this point yet still young. They're at the top of their game and are a joy to watch. I'm afraid that I have only seen two other Carole Lombard movies My Man Godfrey and Made for Each Other. Neither of these impressed me. However this movie did impress me. She is hitting each emotional note perfectly without straining or overacting in any scene. Frederick March stands with Bogart Muni Cagney Gable Grant and Tracy as one of the top actors of the 1930's. He's on autopilot here but the material is so good that he doesn't really have to inject more than his natural for the time acting style. For me this film ranks with His Girl Friday and It Happened One Night as one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. William Wellman The director is as good as they come. He has a great visual sense and knows when to let scenes play out without making too many cuts. In the straight jacket of the Hays Moral Code after 1934 it was difficult to show people acting immorally and having fun without creating a sense of guilt. Somehow the writer Ben Hecht was able to come right up to the wire and sometimes even jump over. This movie is still more outrageous than most of the outrageous comedies of the last 20 years.".

Oddly enough there has recently been a two part news item in the New York Times about the plans in Abu Dhabi for a cultural center and university on a large scale.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to go wrong with a story about clever criminals who must worry not only about the authorities but about the treachery of other clever criminals. Master thief Joe Hackman decides to call it quits after a profitable jewel store robbery in which his unmasked face is caught on camera. Trouble is he's already committed to another bigger jobstealing a gold shipment from a Swiss freight planefor his fence  paymaster Mickey Devito. Mickey won't pay off for the jewel job until Joe does the Swiss thing. The film's first big flaw is that the animosity between Joe  Mickey who are apparently longtime friends  associates is never explained enough to justify why they are so willing to stick it to one another. This is a problem because Hackman's character is supposed to occupy the moral high ground always important when everybody's a criminal but in the story comes across at least as treacherous as Devito's. Fine portrayals by Hackman  Devito cover up rather than diminish this flaw. From then on it's all one twist after another not all of which twist without leaving open holes behind. Will Joe do the job and if so end up doing it the way Mickey wants? Does Joe's supercool ImpossibleMission crew Lindo Jay  Pigeon trust him  stick with him all the way? Is Mickey's brash young nephew  protg Jimmy Rockwell whom Mickey sends to watch Joe really as cluelessly macho as he seems? Joe's heist plans cute as a pailful of kittens are too complicated to work unless His Honor Judge Murphy is too sleepy to enforce his law. But they provide a marvellous venue for Mamet to work the lost magic of Welles  Hitchcock developing characters through interaction  dialog. The supporting cast carries most of this task  does it very well particularly thieves Lindo Rockwell  Jay. Jimmy's pushy questions to the other thieves are met by cool obfuscating questions in reply How long's he been with that girl? How long is a Chinaman's name?. Pigeon is suitably hardedged for this taut film but a lone actress surrounded by so many tough actors has to bring something extra to stand out. Though he'll probably be best remember for Hoosiers and with respects to DeNiro in films such as Heat  The Score Hackman is the most accomplished actor in films such as this whether as a cop The French Connection a privateeye Night Moves a technician The Conversation Enemy of the State a spy Target or even an attorney Under Suspicion. He's the top master because he rarely fails to score even in films with plot holes weak premises  contradictions with his strong  convincing characterizations the almost insane passion that lurks just beneath his plain Midwestern veneer. Fine production values understated but effective actions scenes  an aboveaverage music score help Hackman  Co. make Heist a watchable rather than forgettable thriller. Enjoy the portrayals  action but don't think too much.".

Going into this film I didn't expect anything but asurprise surprise heist flick. I got just that. Not just a heist flick but a wellacted nicely directed and quite entertaining one at that. The plot is pretty good and keeps your interest throughout. There are a fair bit of doublecrosses throughout and near the end it does get somewhat tiresome. The acting is all topnotch. Not one performance was even slightly off. It's no surprise to see such highquality acting from Hackman Lindo and Rockwell but I had not expected such excellent performances from DeVito and Jay. The writing is very good but Mamet uses too many clichs and there's just a tad too much going on in the shadows people conspiring against each other. The dialog tries oh so hard to be clever and occasionally succeeds but more often than not it just comes off as pretentiousness with all the slang the attempts at being clever and the ridiculously high pace it sometimes sports. The cinematography is great not one shot was poor or out of place. The pacing is mostly good though the film seems to go on just a bit too long. All in all an entertaining heist film but not one to watch much more than one time. I recommend this to all fans of heist flicks any of the actors and David Mametwho seems to be all about these films. 710".

I know her demeanor is quiet and conniving but she just struts around waiting to make overly witty replies. The rest of the cast were excellent Delroy Lindo outshined Hackman as his righthand thug Ricky Jay pulls off the calm and collected badass Sam Rockwell delivers a good presence that you just hate DeVito was awesome as the breakyourballs bad criminal and Hackman played his part well as he always does. The story bored me however.  You knew what was going to happen before it happened and there were too many twists in the movie that they lost their affect.  Twists are good when used sparingly and when used at the right time.  I didn't like the timing of them in this movie or the overuse of them.  It got boring because the characters always pull something out of their hat when you least expect it. For me dialogue has to be  two things witty and believable.  Now the dialogue in this film is witty Mamet probably took a while to compile all these quotes into one movie but it is too much.  It is simply to much.  All Rebecca Pidgeon says is these crafty responses and she engages no real conversation.  As for believable people don't speak like this. No one not even the coolest cat in the world and half the time I am trying to figure out what the hell they mean. The plot is way too contrived it is too much.  Their is a backup plan for a backup plan for a backup plan for a ...  The scene on the runway was crap impossible.  Never would have happened.  Too many overly perfect plans and too many twists make this plot boring to watch. Wait for the rental.".

It's the usual Mamet fare about a career criminal pulling one last job before retiring replete with the typical cons deceptions crosses and doublecrosses.  I thought Gene Hackman's characterization was poor his performance coarse and roughedged without the subtlety or smoothness of a trickster or confidence man Phil Silvers would have been more believable.  The other performances are passable but Mamet's old cardsharp buddy Ricky Jay is just terrible. Mamet is normally very smart about how to spot Jay in films as he did in Things Change making the terrific this is a matter of public knowledge speech but here he is asked to carry a few scenes and he's really hung out to dry.  The scene where he explains to his little daughter why Daddy has to be away from home works because he speaks in a false condescending tone that parents often use with children.  Trouble is he sounds like that all the time and in other scenes he is really exposed.      But the real star of the movie is Mamet himself that is his wannabe dialogue that aspires to the cornball cleverness of something like Sweet Smell Of Success.  Some of the lines are funny everybody needs money that's why they call it money others clunk with a heavy thud and you just cringe with embarrassment.  Try these on for size     Nobody lives forever. Frank Sinatra gave it a try.      OR     My MF's so cool when he goes to sleep sheep count him. OR     Cute plan though. Cute as a Chinese baby.                   Ugh.

Frank Sinatra gave it a try.      OR     My MF's so cool when he goes to sleep sheep count him. OR     Cute plan though. Cute as a Chinese baby.                   Ugh.      I'm a big fan of David Mamet's work so I'm a little more kindly disposed to his failures.  But at least his failures show some thought effort and intelligence.  2  out of 4";

One reason this movie may be receiving so many negative reviews is that it's basically a comedy caper.  Don't expect to take this one seriously.

Just be forewarned  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.  Although it's not quite a comedy it is what I would consider a feelgood movie.  It's both interesting and entertaining but not necessarily realistic.  I have to admit it does have an amateur feel but it moves quickly and is fun to watch.

Music is by Theodore Shapiro and cinematography by Robert Elswit. Joe Moore Hackman and his small band of thieves are coerced into taking on one last big job by their shifty fence Mickey Bergman DeVito. But when Bergman's nephew Jimmy Silk Rockwell is sent along on the heist with them it could prove to be a recipe for disaster?The one last job theme is a familiar plot device in many a crime and noir picture but as Mamet proves here it can still remain fresh if given its own sheen. Divisive amongst Mamet's fans and seen as a lesser light in the director's neonoir output Heist improves greatly upon a second viewing. In fact it holds up as a clinically executed piece of noirish cinema it's smart crafty and laced with essence of cool.You're a piece of work!I came all the way from China in a matchbox.Structured around twists and tricks where nothing is ever as it seems  including the wonderfully ambiguous finale  Heist positively thrives on the snap crackle and pop of Mamet's dialogue dialogue that comes trickling off the tongues of characters whose loyaltiesdisloyalties are never 100 certain. Quite often what is being said is in clipped format where the meaning is different to what is actually being said while visual exchanges also sometimes mean more than it appears at first glance. Make no bones about it this is no ordinary caper movie it's labyrinthine in plotting and the director toys with the conventions of the formula.My MOFO is so cool when sheep go to bed they count him!Visually Mamet and DOP Elswit keep the colours smooth but they do throw in some interesting angles and use smoky lenses to accentuate the possibility of cloudy means and motives. Acting performances are mostly excellent. Hackman underplays it perfectly as a world weary crim who may or may not be one step ahead of the game? Lindo is muscular and cool Jay a stoic sidekick DeVito slimy and Pidgeon Mamet's wife provides layers as the fulcrum femme. Only real disappointment comes with Rockwell as the poisonous adder in the thieves nest. A few years away from becoming the great actor he is now Rockwell here lacks a dangerous dynamism a raw sexuality to really make the integral character work to its potential.Elsewhere there's flaws such as the key heist involving an aeroplane that stretches credibility to breaking point a shame since the opening robbery that introduces us to the characters is brilliantly constructed and the big shootout scene lacks the energy to really raise the pulse but even within that scene is a great moment as DeVito's Mickey Bergman in amongst the flying bullets shouts out the question why can't we just talk? why indeed? You see in Mamet's badly under valued neonoir talk is everything. Beautifully so. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by David Mamet this superior crime thriller begins with a brilliantly choreographed jewellerystore robbery that demonstrates just how professional and skilled the team of thieves are. The obviously high level of trust and understanding that they share enable them to cope when things don't go exactly as planned and to improvise well whenever the need arises. The pace and precision of what happens in these opening scenes is impressive and intriguing and sets the tone for everything that follows. Numerous plot twists doublecrosses and humorous moments then add to the fun as the plot becomes increasingly complicated and the gang have to cope with some unexpected challenges.When veteran thief and gangleader Joe Moore Gene Hackman accidentally has his picture captured on a security camera during a highvalue jewellery robbery he knows that the most sensible course of action is to retire immediately and head south on his boat with his much younger wife Fran Rebecca Pidgeon. He encounters a problem however when his fence and financial backer Mickey Bergman Danny DeVito opposes the plan because he's already invested a large sum of money in setting up the gang's next job. Bergman isn't willing to make any concessions and withholds the gang's share of the proceeds of the robbery to force them into carrying out the Swiss thing.The Swiss thing turns out to be an extremely dangerous but highly lucrative robbery of a huge shipment of gold from a Swiss cargo plane. To make matters worse however the distrustful Bergman stipulates that his nephew Jimmy Silk Sam Rockwell has to go along as one of the gang to ensure that they go ahead with the heist exactly as planned. Silk is young inexperienced and impulsive and also has designs on Fran. He sees Joe as an old guy who's losing his grip and soon starts to think of how he could get away with both the gold and the girl.Joe feels compelled to go ahead with the gold heist and although he has complete faith in the loyalty and professionalism of his righthand man Bobby Blane Delroy Lindo and his diversionary expert Pinky Ricky Jay the ongoing presence of Jimmy Silk continues to be a source of great concern even after the ambitious heist has been successfully carried out.David Mamet's style of direction is perfect for this material as he brings great coherence and momentum to the intricate plot and his dialogue as usual is sharp witty and quite unique. Some clever quips and brilliant banter illuminate the exchanges between the main characters but the usual formality and stilted nature of Mamet's lines are less apparent in this movie possibly due to the presence of Gene Hackman. His skillful delivery is so warm and natural that it makes even the most contrived phrases sound quite spontaneous and his interactions with Delroy Lindo are a real highlight. Both actors excel in this movie as do Ricky Jay and Danny DeVito who also make their characters very real.The high quality of the direction the writing and the acting ensure that a higherthenaverage rating is merited but what's probably even more impressive is the way in which Mamet has taken a very simple and familiar plot and developed it into an enjoyable thriller that actually gets better with each repeat viewing. In the case of Heist once is definitely not enough.".

And then you watch it and realize what a gem it is.Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike is renowned for his ultraviolent films. This is a delightful departure for him and proves what a tremendously versatile director he is. Yes there are some snippets of violence including a rather brutal machete attack. But that's all offset by the film's wonderfully whimsical nature.The film revolves around a Japanese businessman sent to a remote Chinese village to inspect the jade mines for his company. Along for the ride is a yakuza man to ensure the businessman's company's debt is paid off.The film not only chronicles their colorful journey  those turtles must be seen to be believed  but then taps into the characters' psyches as they reach the village and suddenly find themselves trapped there. These two disparate men both find themselves enchanted by this magical place.I won't give away much more of the story because you really should watch this film. Miike injects magical realism into his story and some moments are beautiful in every sense of the word. There's also plenty of humor. The van scene is positively hilarious especially given the driver's deadpan reaction.The film's very much about our need to dream. But it also tackles important issues such as the encroachment of civilization and the importance of keeping some places pristine and innocent no matter how valuable they might be to the rest of the world.If you like interesting foreignlanguage films that open a whole new world then do yourself a favor see this film. You will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw my first Miike film the cinematic suckerpunch of Audition about two years ago and slowly but surely since then I've been building up my steady little collection of his works as my respect for him grows. Admittedly as yet I've barely scratched the surface of his obscenely prolific oevure but with each gem I uncover it merely reinforces my absolute adoration of unquestionably the most fiercely original filmmaker I've ever encountered. His unflinchingly diverse career is one constant curve ball  I become excited each time I find another film of his because I never have ANY idea what to expect. Not only are two Miike films rarely alike but the vast majority of his efforts I've seen to date are simply beyond comparison to ANYONE. He ploughs a unique furrow that rather than imitating the style of his masters sets new standards in cinema for the rest of the world to at some stage catch up with.Tonight I watched The Bird People In China made in 1998 which is without question in my mind the most mindblowing Miike film I've come across so far. Bird People is the type of masterpiece that most directors could never possibly hope to achieve even after years of practice... But to give you an idea of this man's insane work ethic  he also made three other movies that year.Typically genrebending Bird People begins as a quirky gently comic adventure story and gradually morphs into a truly epic exploration of the very nature of human emotion loaded with rare insight a deep true warmth and some utterly unforgettable imagery.Our strange story begins with Mr Wada Mashahiro Motoki a Japanese businessman being shipped off to China by his company in search of a priceless vein of Jade that can only be found in a small village amongst the unchartered depths of the Yun Nan province. Upon his arrival in the country he is quickly accosted by Mr Ujiie Renji Ishibashi a Yakuza who is owed money by Wada's corporation and intends to collect his debt by following Wada out to the village and usurping some of the Jade. They are to be guided by the perpetually jolly but somewhat seedy Mr Shen an old Chinese explorer who has been to the Jade Village before.It's not long until they're way off the map stuck on a rickety raft that's pulled by turtles and smackbang in the middle of a Mountain range. Shen around this point has a rather embarrassing incident with hallucinogenic toadstools bumps his head on a tree and loses his memory of how to find the village. This is when things start getting a little strange as the three mismatched men find themselves on an overwhelming adventure that will inevitably shape their entire lives and change them all forever.To analyse the film's rabid lustforlife philosophy and examine the complexities of the script would be a media student's dream come true. Rich in symbolism and wild directorial flair Miike continually pushes the question of whether technological progress modern day perceptions of civility and even spoken language itself are adversaries or allies to man's untamed nature and desire to be free.Yaddayaddayadda  I know that as a subject of discussion it sounds like old hat and I'm probably doing little more than making this come across like a glorified road movie but Miike uses a combination of hugely unpredictable situations poetic dialogue and some of the most unbelievable bizarre and downright beautiful imagery I've ever seen. Loaded with breathtaking aerial shots of sumptuous green vistas the film is shot with such magnificent grace as to make it unrecognisable as more being from the same eye responsible for unleashing the breakneck splatterpunk deathtrip of Ichi The Killer upon the world. The crowning jewel however is Miike's trademarked humour  selfdeprecating occasionally misanthropic and surreal but ultimately just very funny indeed. There are many genuine laughoutloud moments in amongst the soulsearching and Deep Thoughts tm which make the film infinitely more accessible and well... human.Of course I'm of the firm belief that a film is only as good as its ending and with the possible exception of The Wicker Man I don't think I've seen one that packs as much of a punch as this one. I have no desire to spoil any second of this movie for anyone so I'll just say that the final few frames of The Bird People Of China are some of the most pleasantly surprising and magically filmed images I've EVER seen  it just left me slackjawed reeling with joy and wonder.If you're not sold on how much you need to see this film already I'm afraid there's no hope for you. This is as good as it's ever going to get. Seriously.".

I have seen about 6 movies from Miike but this one was hard to find. I couldn't rent it anywhere but I really was interested in this piece of cinema because I liked the story and that it was something completely different from other Miike movies although none of his movies are alike. So I ordered the DVD artsmagicdvd version.From the beginning I was really into the movie. And after finishing it I enjoyed every second of it! It has humor adventure a little action and emotion! The scenery in this movie is fantastic and I want to visit these places in the movie If I know where they are! Miike takes you into his dreamworld and you don't want to leave. It is fantasy but believable and not over the top. The story is surrounded by mystery and I wanted to know all about it. I won't tell about the story because you can read that on this site. I just want to recommend this movie to every fan of Miike well....to everyone who can enjoy a piece of rare cinema with a great story and beautiful scenery. Sometimes a movie is great but the ending is a let down. I think this movie is really completed from beginning to end. Ohh....and the music is great as well. It is one of those movies you want to see again the moment you finish it. I hope Miike makes a movie like this again in the future slow beautiful mysterious.....I think it is very strange that a lot of crap is put on DVD but a fantastic movie like this is hard to find. I had to import the DVD and I can imagine not everybody likes to do that. So in Holland this gem isn't released. So I hope people just order a copy just get one anyway you can you won't regret it! On the DVD there is an interview with Miike an audio commentary and some extra stuff. There is a trailer of this movie on the disk as well. But I STRONGLY suggest not to watch that before watching the movie. Why? Because the ending is in the trailer!!! I think that is very strange and I am happy I didn't watch it before the movie otherwise it would have spoiled the ending for me.So you get the idea I am very enthusiastic and I think you will to after seeing this beautiful film. What are you still doing behind your desk? Go get a copy!".

	schema:headline " Another Masterpiece from the Indefatigable Miike Possibly My Favorite of His";
	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike is the living definition of the word indefatigable. In a career that began in the early 1990s he has directed a staggering number of films in a mindboggling array of different genres from horror to family films even a musical ! but Miike is probably best known for his Yakuza Japanese gangster films. The likes of FUDOH ICHI and DEAD OR ALIVE with their overthetop violence and surreal often disgusting setpieces are Miike's chief claim to fame. In one respect that's a pity because every once in a while Miike will produce a wild card and BIRD PEOPLE IN CHINA is a film that fits into that latter category. The man character is a young Japanese executive named Mr. Wada Masahiro Motoki who is sent by his boss to a remote region in the wilds of China to survey a supposedly rich jade mine. He is joined on his trip by a Yakuza named Ujiie Renji Ishibashi who plans on taking the jade as payment for some outstanding debts on the part of Wada's boss. After they are taken as far as the train will go Wada and Ujiie are met by their guide the absentminded Mr. Shen scenestealer Mako who takes them through the rugged unsettled terrain of rural China first on foot and then on a raft pulled by several huge sea turtles. When the three men finally reach their destination a village left untouched by the ravages of industrialization Wada and Ujiie have a few epiphanies that will prove to make leaving rather difficult. It sounds like a simple story and it is but there's something about this film that makes it great but that I find hard to articulate. No doubt the startlingly beautiful cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto has a lot to do with the film's hypnotic quality. And then there's the genuinely touching story of two men who discover a whole other side to themselves that they were never previously aware existed. And finally the film's deft blend of genres is seamless it shifts gears from a screwballbuddy comedy to a junglebound adventure to an existential rumination on identity and civilization finally ending on a dreamlike note of perfect serenity. There is one scene of Yakuza violence that seems inserted to remind us that we're watching a Miike film but it's fleeting and compared to some of what can be found elsewhere in his films it's utterly tame and inoffensive. There's also an ecological message packed into the mix. So final verdict for fans of Miike who wonder what else the man is capable of I highly recommend BIRD PEOPLE IN CHINA surely the gentlest and most poignant of all the man's movies at least that I've seen.

	onyx:emotionText "Takashi Miike is the living definition of the word indefatigable. In a career that began in the early 1990s he has directed a staggering number of films in a mindboggling array of different genres from horror to family films even a musical ! but Miike is probably best known for his Yakuza Japanese gangster films. The likes of FUDOH ICHI and DEAD OR ALIVE with their overthetop violence and surreal often disgusting setpieces are Miike's chief claim to fame. In one respect that's a pity because every once in a while Miike will produce a wild card and BIRD PEOPLE IN CHINA is a film that fits into that latter category. The man character is a young Japanese executive named Mr. Wada Masahiro Motoki who is sent by his boss to a remote region in the wilds of China to survey a supposedly rich jade mine.

Like most of the others I do enjoy Miike's work though not to the level of unconditional love that seems to be common here. In my limited experience around nine Miike films so far none have been a waste of time and several are fairly amazing. Notably Audition though definitely not for the faint of heart.This film left me with mixed emotions. It truly has touching moments but it also suffers from common issues with Miike films... disjointed structure unmotivated action particularly from the Yakuza character a bit of excessive violence a kitchen sink approach to ideas... every possibility explored even when simple would have been more effective and finally a liberal borrowing from other films. In fact I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned in other reviews. Miike clearly took much of the premise and emotional content from the movie Local Hero. A corporate drone begrudgingly travels to a remote village and to his amazement is touched by the locals and the lifestyle. There's more to the similarities but I don't want to give away too much. Though I will note that he pays homage to his source material by throwing in a Scottish song as a major motif. I also didn't buy into the ending... it seemed to detract from the more realistic aspects of the film.All of this aside the film is worth seeing. The scenery is amazing and fairly unique the photography handsome considering the budget Masahiro Motoki as Wada is quite good as he was in OkuribitoDepartures many of the secondary characters are wonderfully drawn another Miike specialty it's genuine and funny at times and it takes you on an unusual journey an actual adventure... rarely a dull moment.".

He shifts it into a magical cinematic world and imagines scenes as episodes within this containing structure.So we get impressed by the big idea  moreso if Japanese  and also impressed by some of the episodes those that work. Oddly the general audience thinks that Miike prefers violence but I think he will simply do anything that has cinematic power that fits his largesmall vision.Japanese have a strange relationship with the mainland. They know they the main race on the islands originated in Korea. The urge is to project back beyond that and posit a people who came as a group from some magical location deeper in the mainland. This story in the large hangs on the myth that the race came from a remote mountainous region in China Yunnan. It isn't quite China with the people and traditions being a melange of China Tibet and Indochina. A dear Japanese wise man explained to me that the indigenous people on the islands came from Polynesia and had a horizontal cosmology while the later migration from the mainland  being mountain people  had a vertical cosmology. This subtle insight advises all sorts of things architecture for one cinematic composition for another. In this case it includes the myth that the protoJapanese could fly.Here we have two stereotypical characters plus one who appears briefly on a quest to find this magical source. The film is clearly in two halves. The first half is realitybased and full of jokes. Then in the midst of a flood after crossing mountains the thing takes a shift into magic. They are transported the final leg by harnessed turtles itself referencing an ancient story.Into this they carry all sorts of things associated with Japan by modern Japanese and little of it makes sense in this new place. A simple view will see a simple ecological message but that is not the case here. It is about what is pure its attractions and curse. The final scene is very nice but what matters is the narration of our reporter right before that. The longing is pure.Li Li Wang plays the woman at the center of this place. She is amazing.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Acting in the movie is amazing my favorite character in the movie is Ujiie the yakuza played by Renji Ishibashi he was so fun to watch also Mako and Masahiro Motoki are great in their roles. The Landscapes of Yunnan gives me chills i was amazed by beautiful landscapes worth watching only because of that.I recommend this movie to everyone who loves JapaneseAsian cinema nature and locations out of modern world you will enjoy for sure.I am looking forward to see more movies from mister Takashi Miike.My grade 810.".

A van falling apart is something too hackneyed cf. Takeshi Kitano comedies American cinema  cartoons to be funny while it's often mentioned as the peak of this comedy. 4 Too little of actual flying. If it's supposed that the kids can fly in that distant area show some footage at least from distance if you have a very limited budget. Not just a few seconds of that before the final credits. 5 The connection with the real world the poemballad taken from the history and the war plane that had crashed into the pond is destroying the eerie feel of the production  would prefer the verse created specifically for this movie and the connection to the wild nature why not actual birds? not to the downed plane of the WWI or WWII times.It's got to be tweaked to become an excellent movie more nature less quirky violence more funny and natural jokes and more actual flying. To my view Japanese Dreams  Dolls and Russian Stalker surpass this one in every aspect while dealing with similar topics.A 5 out of 10  a good but mediocre try. Thanks for attention.".

Yes...but not so funny or endearing as KATAKURIS. It just didn't gel for me. I think a lot of it was that the first 13 of the film seemed pretty disjoint and uninteresting. Once they made it to the distant land they were seeking the film improved considerably but not enough to make me especially like it. It's funny but a friend told me I MUST see this movie because he knew I'd like it but I just was left pretty flat.

Never having been to that country he first rides a train then is taken in a decrepit van which stops when a yakuza joins. The yakuza roughs up and threatens the salaryman over money that his employer failed to pay him but upon realizing the salaryman's mission opts to join him on the journey.Unfortunately the movie fails to make us interested or excited.

It's a poetic arthouse production which focuses on the most covert aspects of the human psyche evaluating the dreamlike realm of our minds. A Tokyobased salaryman is sent to the most remote place in China where no information goes in or goes out on a mysterious mission to follow a precious Jade Jewell trail. Along with him comes a fierce Yakuza enforcer. While the two men arrive in a strange village they discover more than they really bargained for. It's an adventure of the most inscrutable kind showing how the frightening unknown can change the way we perceive our world. It's also about the farreaching changes that people go through when they're suddenly placed in front of some strange and unparalleled new sensations frequently resulting in some unexpected alterations of our everyday lives. The thoughtprovoking tale about men flying on colossal wings gives the film a much needed sense of surrealism merging what's real and what's beyond human control.With a contemplative storyline mesmerizing and fascinating imagery audacious and sinister sense of humor and a most haunting song you'll ever hear The Bird People in China comes both as a very strong position in Takashi Miike's directorial career and as a perfectly satisfying and detailed exploration of human emotions.".

'The Bird People in China' is one of these gems that attest to the director's great versatility. Which is not to say that Miike's staples are not present here they are merely reinterpreted. After all one of the mains is a spastic yakuza but his character undergoes severe transformations as the movie progresses deep into dreamy landscapes of endless green mountains. The other main character is less typical in Miike's filmography but is a very Japanese trademark of the jaded young salaryman.The combination of these two characters begins as a comedy and the initial stages of the movie border on adventure. Citizens used to the frantic life of Tokyo are flung into rural China and forced to match completely opposite personalities as the journey becomes more and more insane. The cultural gap is evident and very interesting in that it is within Asia. All too often there is a tendency for missing the fact that there are profound differences within the Asian continent.China here is not only a real country but it is a land of dream. The imagery and the theme of people flying is reminiscent to Taoist concepts of inner landscapes of the soul and the movie corroborates this. But the wealth of influences that went into creating this work of art were manifold so that it is not all that surprising that it should echo the Heart of Darkness in later moments. And yet it remains a solid unit in which a sense of prevailing ethereal beauty harmonizes everything.For all the dreamy atmosphere that is so dominant the ending is realistic. Idealism is sobered by realism. Life lessons are learned in a place akin to paradise but to remain there may be counterproductive. Or perhaps it is simply a different choice. It is up to the viewer to decide and to enjoy this wonderful experience of beautiful film making.".

But the wealth of influences that went into creating this work of art were manifold so that it is not all that surprising that it should echo the Heart of Darkness in later moments. And yet it remains a solid unit in which a sense of prevailing ethereal beauty harmonizes everything.For all the dreamy atmosphere that is so dominant the ending is realistic. Idealism is sobered by realism. Life lessons are learned in a place akin to paradise but to remain there may be counterproductive. Or perhaps it is simply a different choice. It is up to the viewer to decide and to enjoy this wonderful experience of beautiful film making.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last month at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. Based on a play by Michael Drucker and adapted for the screen by writerdirector Ella Lemhagen this is the story of a gay couple living in white picket fence suburban neighborhood run by a homeowners association and populated by an all straight community. Goran Skoogh Gustaf Skarsgard and Sven Skoogh Torkel Peterssonave taken a singular surname complete with wedding rings and a marriage but they want to adopt and raise an infant child to round out their marriage and live as a family. They have been put on a long waiting list to find a child they can raise from a baby and finally one becomes available. Or so it seems. A typing error that should have read Patrik age 15 has been mistyped by the social service agency as Patrik 15. Believing they are about to bring into their lives an year and half old infant they are shocked to discover their baby is actually 15 years old homophobic and with a history of delinquency and violence. Sven was once in a straight relationship and has an ex wife and a teenage daughter. He is hesitant of raising any child again let alone a readymade troubled teenager. Goran wants a baby desperately but can see the good and discovers he can help bring out the good in Patrik Thomas Ljungman. Nice cinematography from Marek Wiesner and production design from Lene Willumsen which give the film a rich textured look. It's a good cast withe some interesting peripheral characters. It's not an edgy film but is light and humorous with a some touches of drama without coming across as a message movie and it has an appeal to a general audience. I liked it and would give it an 8.5 and recommend it.".

Very little sex and language but rather incredibly deep characters and struggles in relationships.The main character Goran is spectacular. He is gentle and sincere while being incredibly strong in protecting his family. Amazing work. His partner Sven struggles with settling down starting a family again he has a 16 yr old daughter from his previous marriage and living in a typical suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood dynamic is great. Each neighbor is really big on keeping their white picket fence front yards in amazing shape to outdo their neighbor. However perfectly pruned front yards doesn't mean the family behind the door is doing as well.Amazing film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not want to concentrate too much on the story... it is relatively predictable  no surprises. Ordinarily I wouldn't give it such a high rating. Except ... it is so beautifully acted especially by Gustaf Skarsgrd as Goran the the doctor and Thomas Ljungman as the kid up for adoption...that it really does deserve a high rating. The situation is not completely realistic in that I don't really see a gay couple deciding to live in an area that is so completely heterosexual and even a bit homophobic. I would have expected them to find a more mixed neighbourhood  but then again not knowing Sweden perhaps they are in a small town which doesn't really offer them many more choices? I also found the changes in Sven the doctor's spouseplayed by Torkel Petersson to be a little too pat both in his original negativism what makes him so extreme in his reactions? and later on in his seemingly tooeasily arrivedat acceptance. This problem in the script might be why Torkel doesn't impress us as much with his acting  his character seems to be less dense and more obviously driven by the writer's needs than his own. But all of this pales when the realism of the emotions is placed before you. These are people you DO care about  because they make you care. OK...the kid was perhaps too nice for someone who is supposed to be a petty criminal and allaround troublemaker. But everyone can identify with the basics here. The need for family. The petty ignorance and discrimination of others. The problems of making a relationship work. The stupidities of officialdom. And the way people can suddenly work their way into your heart before you have even realized it. I hope that Thomas Ljungman and Gustaf Skarsgrd end up making more films on an international level. They are wonderful actors note the look in Ljungman's eyes when told the agency has finally found a family for him I have NEVER seen mixed emotions more perfectly portrayed... and considering the small output in Sweden it would be a crime not to get this talent out into the world at large.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film to be a very satisfying experience but then again much of Swedish cinema has this effect upon me.This is not so much a story about a gay couple attempting to adopt a baby boy and being sent a surly delinquent 15yearold as it is about family relationships fitting in making compromises and ultimately discovering that what you have may just be what you need.Most of the movie takes place in a 'nice' suburban street a kind of StepfordmeetsPleasantville. Residents spend their spare time in the garden socialising with others in the street and being nice to one another. Enter a gay couple who are in the process of adopting a child. Not only does the neighbourhood have to adjust but so do the couple themselves and eventually the 'child' they adopt. Gustaf Skarsgard carries this film almost singlehanded. His character  Goran  is subtle charming patient and caring. He is the one who eventually forms a meaningful relationship with the 'son' who turns up at their door  wonderfully played by Tom Ljungman who will be someone to keep an eye on in the future. It's hard to believe he was only 16 at the time of filming as he creates a character in 3 dimensions.I like peoplemovies and this is definitely a people movie. It is not complicated or terribly deep but it held my attention fully and I was sorry when it ended.Just one more comment........... There is a blue car which speeds down the street and kids and dogs have to jump out of its way. This happens about 23 times throughout the course of the film and is never explained. It reminded me of the motor cycle which sped through the town in 'Local Hero' rather a nice touch although not original.9 stars.".

They understand that Patrik is a one and half yearold baby and they prepare a room for the baby. However there is a typo and Patrick Tom Ljungman is actually a fifteen yearold homophobic teenager with criminal record. The gay couple assumes that there is a mistake but it is Friday afternoon and they need to wait until Monday to contact the Social Service. Along the weekend Sven has friction with the adolescent but Gran befriends Patrik who is an experienced gardener. Gran and Sven have an argument about Patrik and Sven leaves Gran.When Gran learns that Patrik has been rejected by families for ten years he decides to adopt Patrik. But now he is alone and the process of adoption is no longer valid and he needs to prepare a new application. I am not a fan of films with the theme gay couple but Patrik 1.5 is a pleasant surprise. The story is funny dramatic and romantic and the trio Gustaf Skarsgrd Torkel Petersson and Tom Ljungman is charismatic and shows a great chemistry. The director and writer Ella Lemhagen is very sensitive and never overexploits the gay relationship of Gran and Sven.The prejudice of the neighbors of Gran and Sven is impressive considering the image of freedom in sex that the Swedish people have in my country.

	schema:reviewBody "The Birdcage 1996 Reinas 2005 The Wedding Banquet 1993 Law of Desire 1987... many good films have been made about gay people's relationships with each other and their straight friends and families. Ella Lemhagen's 2008 dramacomedy Patrik 15 is the first film I have seen from the director but joins the above movies in the category of watchable gay comedies.The plot goes as follows Gran and Sven Skoogh Gustaf Skarsgrd and Torkel Petersson are a happily married gay couple who have recently moved into an idyllic new suburb and are anxious to adopt a baby. However they find their dream difficult to realize since no foreign country is willing to give a child to a gay couple and suitable Swedish babies are difficult to find. They are overjoyed upon hearing that an orphaned 18month old baby has become available for adoption but are dismayed when their baby Patrik turns out to be a 15year old homophobic delinquent Thomas Ljungman due to a typographical error in the adoption documents.With a premise like this one could expect the story to be a sappy tale of overcoming prejudices which carries a laughably obvious message like gays are people too but luckily that is not the whole point of Patrik 15. Sure Sven and Gran do encounter homophobia ranging from kids calling them names to the neighbours forgetting to send them an invitation to a house party but ultimately the story focuses much more on the characters' relationships with each other be they gay or not. In fact the movie does not find it necessary at all to specifically point out that it is OK to be gay as it goes without saying right from the start. A less subtle film could have been built entirely around stereotypes like effeminate clothing lispy voices and giggly flamboyancy but the couple in Patrik 15 is completely ordinary and very likable if also a bit generic and unmemorable like average people are  the film laughs with them not at them. A downside would be that in its quest for ordinariness the film does not differ very much from many other movies about parenthood.Although the overall mood and message of the film are thoroughly sympathetic its basis as a feelgood dramedy lessens the effect of the serious drama plot regarding Gran's suspicions of Sven not being the right guy for him after all. More masculine than his partner Sven is not free of prejudices himself and acts in a very hostile manner toward Patrik who always comes across as more scared than tough even surprisingly so being a convicted delinquent and all. When the focus is subsequently turned to the budding friendship of Gran and Patrik the gay theme becomes secondary and the film plays out like any family drama of a sullen kid opening up in a loving family. Cheesiness is not entirely avoided although the actors do a very good job throughout particularly Skarsgrd and Petersson as the lead couple.Besides the cheese other complaints about the movie could include things like occasionally overly shaky camera work and the somewhat underdeveloped character of Sven's daughter Isabell Amanda Davin. The hostilities between the superfriendly Gran and the secretly sensitive Patrik also dissolve unrealistically quickly but I guess they wanted to keep the mood on the lighter side after all so wallowing in past traumas could not be paid too much attention. Nonetheless I liked Lemhagen's film alright and greatly prefer it to for instance the Adam Sandler comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry 2007 that wanted both to make fun of gays and promote their acceptance at the same time. In the end Patrik 15 is certainly a movie about more than just gay issues and can be recommend to anyone looking for a positive little tale of family relationships.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to say that this movie is one of the best gaythemed movies that I had ever watched although the core of the movie is more into finding love in any type or form especially outcasts who regularly shunt by the ignorant and the narrowminded.Goran  Sven are a Swedish married couple trying to adopt a child. Their options got limited to adoption except for Sweden due to lack of interest from other countries to allow a gay couple adopting a baby. Later the institution promised them a baby boy by the name of Patrick turns out Patrick is actually a 15yearold delinquent with a criminal record and to top it all a homophobe. Waiting to clarify the mixup with the institution the couple has to deal with the teen and it doesn't help that Sven has second thoughts about the whole adoption thing.The movie poster and the plot may suggest that the movie is kind of a comedy and the movie is full of light moments but it is far from being a comedy.The 1st twothird of the movie is quite good and bring a realistic view about what might had happened if the story is real. The Ending is put to satisfy the regular watcher which might be fitting or not fitting to the movie flow depending on your view but nevertheless a good ending for this type of movies.A very good watch even if you find such movies to be too sweet. I bit many will find something to relate to in the movie in a way or another.".

	onyx:emotionText "I would like to say that this movie is one of the best gaythemed movies that I had ever watched although the core of the movie is more into finding love in any type or form especially outcasts who regularly shunt by the ignorant and the narrowminded.Goran  Sven are a Swedish married couple trying to adopt a child. Their options got limited to adoption except for Sweden due to lack of interest from other countries to allow a gay couple adopting a baby. Later the institution promised them a baby boy by the name of Patrick turns out Patrick is actually a 15yearold delinquent with a criminal record and to top it all a homophobe. Waiting to clarify the mixup with the institution the couple has to deal with the teen and it doesn't help that Sven has second thoughts about the whole adoption thing.The movie poster and the plot may suggest that the movie is kind of a comedy and the movie is full of light moments but it is far from being a comedy.The 1st twothird of the movie is quite good and bring a realistic view about what might had happened if the story is real. The Ending is put to satisfy the regular watcher which might be fitting or not fitting to the movie flow depending on your view but nevertheless a good ending for this type of movies.A very good watch even if you find such movies to be too sweet. I bit many will find something to relate to in the movie in a way or another.";

It doesn't have any agenda it's not trying to make a point it's not preaching and yet it accomplishes some of that by simply showing you the reality itself. It's funny and yet hearttugging without being syrupy or melodramatic. The casting was spoton even through the supporting characters. The script is solid the direction is clear and concise and the actors bring their best. I am currently looking to find other films the 3 main characters are in hoping for the same level of quality. I usually hate subtitled films because you miss the nuances the actors are giving you in both their expressions and their delivery but it was worth it here. Bravo.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't remember the last time I was so completely charmed and moved by a film. What an absolute delight and a wonderful achievement from everyone involved.I'm very lucky because for my work I get to watch at least one or two films a day but good lord most of those films are tedious to watch all the way through even once  so it's very rare to encounter films that can be watched with pleasure over and over again. And I'm not talking about superduperonceinalifetime films like Aliens that of course we can watch a million times but films made on modest budgets by teams who obviously put their hearts and souls into making something beautiful and meaningful with limited resources.Patrik 1.5 is an unusual romantic comedy in that it's about the love relationship between fathers and sons  a nonsexual love story between a man Goran who desperately wants a son and a boy Patrik who desperately wants a father. It's also a love story between the audience and Goran played absolutely perfectly by Gustaf Skarsgard  I cannot believe that even the grumpiest conservative could not fall in love with such a beautiful kind caring vulnerable but brave person and I think it's depictions of regular guy gay characters like this in films that will have more influence in bringing about change for the better than the most strident political hectoring. What the film recognises and depicts so beautifully is that in any father son relationship the sons even very young sons understand that sometimes they have to look after their dads or father figures  that's what it means to be a man. Perhaps the reason the film provoked so many tears for me is because it made me realise all the love that my deceased father needed that I was not able to give him.Director Ella Lemhagen has done a fantastic job organising cast crew and production staff to build a first rate film on a bargain budget. And of course that would not have been possible without the most crucial raw material the complex and beautiful script by Michael Druker. The production design is superb and the music by Fredrik Emilson is perfectly judged to enhance and colour the moments of poignancy and desperate unspoken longing.And Gustaf Skarsgard  what to say? How is he not the most famous and adored of the Skarsgard acting clan? Usually I don't have much respect for actor children of established stars because you always feel they got a legup into an exciting job that we'd all love to do but don't have the chance. But I don't get the impression that Gustaf Skarsgard is an entitled movie brat  I think he really surrendered himself into this role and let down all his defences to give people a beautiful cinematic and emotionally cathartic experience  and that's not something that many actors are capable of or willing to do whether they come from acting families or not.Anyway for me this is one of those very rare films that scores 10 out of 10.".

It is also a nice story of how Patrik and Gran try to connect and gain each other trust. It also has some scenes that made me smile I'll give it that.But if I judge it as a comedy it fails almost completely. As I said a found a few scenes funny but that's all. Far too long stretches aren't funny at all.It is well acted especially Thomas Ljungman that plays the 15 year old Patrik a vulnerable kid that has totally lost confidence in the society. A average script too as a drama again but far too full of clichs and predictable to really be something to remember.There seem to be something between Swedish cinema and me that doesn't work.

In In Bruges Gleeson had to battle for compliments against Colin Farrell who has never performed better and had most of the best lines. Not here.

	schema:headline " Understated and funny a showpiece for Gleeson";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that I live in a bustling metropolis all of the theaters that show smaller films are somewhere between 30 and 50 miles away. In Dallas Traffic Time that translates to somewhere between 90 minutes and 16 days. As a result I don't get time to see many of these films until they come to DVD if at all. In my experience art house films are often the most difficult to write about and even more difficult to properly judge particularly in the summer. When almost everything I've watched in the last three months has involved superheroes aliens or jokes related to bodily functions I have a tough time transitioning to more mature and cinematic endeavors. So it is with The Guard a film entirely unlike anything else I saw this summer.Sergeant Gerry Boyle Brendan Gleeson is an offthewall somewhat crotchety veteran police officer who patrols a small Irish town. Shortly after beginning an investigation into a peculiar murder Boyle discovers that his case is related to a major drug ring that is currently being hunted by FBI agent Wendell Everett Don Cheadle. As straightlaced as they come Everett is an odd pair for Boyle but the two are forced to work together to take down the cartel. When the case pulls Boyle in deeper than he would have ever imagined he is forced to reexamine his life's work and turn himself into an unlikely hero.If that synopsis makes The Guard sound wholly serious bear in mind that it is completely and totally a comedy. A dark comedy to be sure but a comedy nonetheless. If you've ever wondered what Hot Fuzz would be like if it was subtle and less overthetop The Guard fits the bill. This is writerdirector John Michael McDonagh's first full length film but I would never have guessed it if not for the magic of IMDb. It is a witty wellwritten film that makes its tone clear from the first scene. The pacing isn't exactly what I would call slow but instead calculatedly casual it knows where it intends to go and it makes its way with balanced determination. This is a film that knows its own identity and doesn't stray from the dark comedy path more than a time or two. Its humor is smart and lively. Even with the thick accents which probably caused me to miss a joke or two The Guard is filled with exquisite dialogue and understated jokes that brought more laughs than anything from all but the very best big budget comedies this year has brought. The plot of The Guard is simple but refined and that pushes all of the attention onto the characters and the actors who portray them. Cheadle is a solid straight man and as he always does he makes the absolute most of every scene he is given. As one of the ringleaders of the drug ring Mark Strong's character is straight out of a Guy Ritchie film a role Strong is great at playing. Please Mr. Strong stick to these films and stay away from popcorn crap like Green Lantern. But despite all of the excellent actors around him The Guard is all about Gleeson. His work in 2008's In Bruges coincidentally directed by McDonagh's brother Martin finally brought him the attention he deserves but Gleeson has always been a favorite of mine a magnificent actor who never fails to impress no matter how little screen time he is given. Boyle is a without a doubt a curmudgeon and a slightly racist one at that but Gleeson makes him exceedingly likable. He is a wild card the type of guy who does the right thing when you're absolutely sure he's going to continue to disgrace himself and Gleeson pulls this off perfectly. Moreover he once again exhibits the brilliant comedic timing that has made him one of the best and most versatile actors that Ireland has to offer. I'm not saying it's his best performance but rather another in a long string of quality portrayals that illustrate just how undervalued this guy really is.Fun intelligent and genuinely hilarious The Guard is an excellent departure from my typical fare this time of year. I've made no bones about the fact that I really like summer blockbusters. I love them in fact. But when a movie like The Guard comes along in the midst of the Conan the Barbarians of the world it serves as an incredibly refreshing reminder of what we have to hope for in the coming months.Check out my site www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com".

The plot of The Guard is simple but refined and that pushes all of the attention onto the characters and the actors who portray them. Cheadle is a solid straight man and as he always does he makes the absolute most of every scene he is given. As one of the ringleaders of the drug ring Mark Strong's character is straight out of a Guy Ritchie film a role Strong is great at playing. Please Mr. Strong stick to these films and stay away from popcorn crap like Green Lantern. But despite all of the excellent actors around him The Guard is all about Gleeson. His work in 2008's In Bruges coincidentally directed by McDonagh's brother Martin finally brought him the attention he deserves but Gleeson has always been a favorite of mine a magnificent actor who never fails to impress no matter how little screen time he is given. Boyle is a without a doubt a curmudgeon and a slightly racist one at that but Gleeson makes him exceedingly likable. He is a wild card the type of guy who does the right thing when you're absolutely sure he's going to continue to disgrace himself and Gleeson pulls this off perfectly. Moreover he once again exhibits the brilliant comedic timing that has made him one of the best and most versatile actors that Ireland has to offer. I'm not saying it's his best performance but rather another in a long string of quality portrayals that illustrate just how undervalued this guy really is.Fun intelligent and genuinely hilarious The Guard is an excellent departure from my typical fare this time of year. I've made no bones about the fact that I really like summer blockbusters. I love them in fact. But when a movie like The Guard comes along in the midst of the Conan the Barbarians of the world it serves as an incredibly refreshing reminder of what we have to hope for in the coming months.Check out my site www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com";

WriterDirector John Michael McDonagh is the brother of Martin McDonagh who brought us the excellent In Bruges which also starred Brendan Gleeson. I figured it best to say that upfront because there is no way to avoid comparisons of the two films. Clearly these men grew up in the same house and were trained in a brilliant method of writing dialogue.Brendan Gleeson delivers a powerful and hilarious performance as a local cop Garda in rural Ireland. His Sgt Gerry Boyle is quite an enigma  he gets along great with locals yet struggles to fit into society. This is never more apparent than when FBI Agent Wendell Everett Don Cheadle hits town on a drug smuggling investigation. The key to their relationship is crystallized at the moment an exasperated Agent Everett says to Boyle 'I can't tell if you are really smart or really dumb'. Of course I am paraphrasing because the Fword gets literally worn out in this movie. There aren't many lines I can actually quote in print. But the word rolls off Gleeson's tongue as if it's a work of art ... especially in conversation with his ailing mother played well by the always terrific Fionnula Flanagan.The international drug smugglers being chased are a trio led by Liam Cunningham and the always interesting Mark Strong. The endless rips insults and jokes are fired rapidly at Americans Brits and anyone unfortunate enough to hail from Dublin. Boyle uses his Irish background as a crutch for his racism and insensitivity. But he leaves no doubt about his expertise as a cop. Heck he even recognizes the importance of some 9 year old kid riding around on a pink bicycle. That's just another example of the offcenter approach to story telling offered by McDonagh.If you are a fan of In Bruges Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels I think you will enjoy this one. It falls just short of that level but not by much. Gleeson is outstanding and the story is simple enough yet with plenty of twist turns and hilarity.".

Right from the start it's easy to understand where the humor will come from  Brendan Gleeson who also played a large role in In Bruges. The car goes out of frame skids squeals and crashes in front of Gleeson's patrol car. Oh did I mention he's a cop this time? Quite the role reversal. The crash wakes him  slowly  from his day dream and he pulls up to check out the scene. After rummaging through the pockets of one of the people in the car he finds a bag of drugs which he tosses away from the body though not before dropping a tablet of acid for himself. Cut to introductory credits.If this doesn't get you off leave the theatre and begin questioning your understanding of what's funny. The rest of the movie is comprised of smartass remarks and brilliant dry humor.Don Cheadle plays a straight laced by the books FBI agent from the States investigating a drug smuggling scheme that's rumored to be happening in the area. These two must work together to find crack an overlapping case Cheadle's looking for the drug lords Gleeson's looking for murder suspects  the same people. It's a good buddycop narrative between the two and they work really well together.I don't want to gush too much more over this movie just go see it. I'll leave you with a quote that should depict a fair picture about the humor in this movie Gleeson I'm Irish. Racism is part of my culture.See this movie. Until next time folks cheers!".

I haven't expected a thing but it does seem that this directorial surname becomes something to be kept close within the radar.It has somewhat of that Warhallike touch to it within the play of multiple strong colors and nuances where it is visually provoking and satisfying easy to relate and almost as easy to touch. Along with remarkable scenery and those absolutely sets details the roles are accordingly brilliant. Brendan is more than expectedly good and from my point of view this might just be his best role so far though all are excellent. The easiness and the flow make the movie a cake one swallows easily. Though grim at all times it puts a big smile on a face from the first moment. Unpretentious and fresh it has a tiny nuance of early '90 movies such as Pulp Fiction but unlike others the directing made it look absolutely different. It is unpredictable at all times yet one keeps waiting for Gleeson's next line. Probably one of my favorites for some time. Will watch again definitely.As for the language I have to agree with the issue  English is not my native language but it was so awful trying to watch it with those unnatural subs in English. It took half of the fun and I simply turned it off and enjoyed it understanding it easily. Being so lost in translation it certainly will not be as great as it really is  even one line lost is too much for such a screenplay.I'm not an Irish right. Yet I could identify easily with the characters and feel the ease. As for this year's movies I've seen so far this was the biggest surprise and biggest satisfaction.With simple soundtrack which turns out fully unexpected towards the very end  much of a Mexican standout The Guard is truly a rewarding movie and a hope that there are still ways to make fresh ones to enjoy without having to compare or predict.".

I feel a little for John Michael McDonagh as he will no doubt always walk in the shadow of his brother. Which is a burden most writer  directors do not have to deal with. Already an early reviewer has compared it to In Bruges. I think I gave In Bruges a ten star rating. This has an eight. In Bruges  as extraordinary as it was  had a whiff of truth about it and the danger in the movie was real. Here the action is so cartoon that it generates no tension at all and you never really fear for the characters. Of course Gleeson is in both movies and in my opinion give a much better performance in In Bruges. . Here he is just having fun. Who can blame him... The characters in The Guard are drawn with very broad brush strokes and lack any kind of subtlety. The subplot involving Fionnula Flanagan feels bolted on and slows the movie down. It's intended to show the main character has a softer side but you can get that through the thrust of the main story and the elements are there to take advantage of this. Simple things that could have been done to add a little more realism and heart to the movie that would have generated greater emotion depth of feeling tension jeopardy and ultimately bigger laughs.At the Q  A afterward it was suggested the script was written in 13 days. Clearly that was just a first draft  but I do think subsequent drafts were not worked hard enough. As sometimes there isn't enough breathing space between the jokes... so the bigger gags  situations don't build in the way they should. Or a moment of compassion is lost because a laugh comes rolling on top of it due to a cheap gag.In that respect it feels to me as if the writer  director is still learning pace and rhythm. It's very common in comedy where a writer doesn't want to lose what he feels is a good gag  but sometimes you have to cut gag A in order to get a bigger laugh on gag B. A stronger script editor on the film could have made all the difference.So all in all it is a bravo. I very much enjoyed the movie. I do expect John Michael McDonagh to go on to bigger and better things and I wish the movie great success. After all 810 is a great score.".

	schema:reviewBody "First you need to read the full storyline of this movie then consider the two main characters Sergeant Gerry Boyle and FBI agent Wendell Everett played by Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle respectively and you have yourself the makings of something special. Many of you know about Cheadle but perhaps the name of Gleeson not as much he has a wealth of experience and you will not be disappointed by any of this actor's performances. Since I watch a fair share of Euro productions I knew I was in for a treat. Sergeant Boyle is a character you can't help but loathe and really like all at the same time in other words an ideal character for the screen and he's got the physical appearance that commands attention. Cheadle plays such a different character that the pair's interaction has you hooked for the duration. It is not a gut laughing movie but one that uses humour naturally flowing from Irish culture. Oh yeah your ears are likely not tuned for some of the dialogue which is heavy with the Irish dialect so the pauserewind features will come in handy by all means use them it's worth it not to miss the colorful dialogue.To describe the outrageous Sergeant Boyle is something that could turn you off you'd likely dismiss the movie trust me seeing him is an entirely different thing because Gleeson makes him very real not at all outrageous that's acting. The crime story that unfolds is slow to average pace because it had to be it's happening in a small coastal town in Ireland. Anything quicker paced would be unrealistic. There are other very good supporting actors in this movie and UK movie enthusiasts will recognize them immediately like Liam Cunningham Mark Strong Fionnula Flanagan. I have written often that I watch an inordinate number of movies in hopes to find gems small low budget productions big viewing value I rarely do and less often have the chance to recommend one. I recommend this one. My usual sources critics sites etc. gave it a strong rating and that pleases me.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the brother of the director of In Bruges. In many ways the film follows a close pattern of dark comedy fantastic characters that you love and huge belly laughs. An FBI agent arrives in a small Irish town and must deal with Brendan Gleeson's rude and crude local cop. Gleeson's Boyle is a wonderful creation. He has heart but is such an arsehole you're surprised people can remain in his presence. He appears not to care about taking drugs and doing hookers but when it comes down to serious matters he's at the top of his game. What's wonderful to see is Gleeson putting up a front to appear stupid and ignorant but then uses that to surprise both his colleagues and his enemies. Along the way we are also introduced to a trip of philosophy quoting drug traffickers that also have a sense of humour about their job. This is almost like a Lethal Weapon movie with real people where they don't know they are in a buddyaction comedy. Bad guys aren't acting bad and good guys aren't acting good. The humour breaks the mood in many scenes but in the best possible way. The setting only adds to the brilliance of it all. It's like a small WickerMan community where big drug dealing is going down. Like In Bruges it gave me characters I cared for action I was enthralled by and restrained camera work that allowed me to appreciate everything that was going on.".

Largely it's been a summer of super hero spectaculars lame remakes of lame originals bromances and animated dreck nothing to which I could give a definitive answer to the question Would I get more enjoyment out of seeing this movie or sticking my tongue in a desk fan?So...seeing that two of my alltime favorite actors Don Cheadle and Brendan Gleeson were appearing in the same movie? I literally went to the first screening I could get to. Mind you I wasn't expecting anything more than a chance to watch two estimable actors practicing their craft but Lord knows that would have been enough. What I got was a very smart well crafted piece of cinema nothing that will change anybody's life but just a solid pleasure to spend an hour and a half in a dark place watching. Cheadle is stuck playing the straightman which he does quite well but really this is Gleeson's show. He plays Gerry Boyle a very venal sergeant in the Garda Siochana a languid hefty blob with a predilection for prostitutes and a taste for controlled substances Boyle is entirely underestimated by those around him. He is very much a relative of Sheriff Patton the seemingly slowwitted officer in Raymond Chandler's Lady in the Lake he is only able to be lazy because he is very efficient. He also happens to be very moral and incorruptible. The leads are admirably supported by a crackerjack cast including Mark Strong as an English drug dealer and David Wilmot who plays a psychopathic excuse me I mean a sociopathic enforcer. Another solid performance is turned in by Fionnula Flanagan as Boyle's cancer doomed mother. I know that this film will inevitably be compared to IN BRUGES for me this was a superior movie it was less bombastic and much much funnier.".

Most of the films belonging to that subgenus are pieces of crap such as Hollywood Homicide The Man or Showtime. That's why I took a quite pleasant surprise with the film The Guard which proves that there's no need to reinvent the formula in order to make a very entertaining film with likable characters who aren't caricatures funny humor simulataneously subversive and affable and an ingenious screenplay in which the suspense and the anguish don't dilute the comedy.Besides of the precise screenplay which includes some genuinely unexpected turns and the hidden connections between the characters the best thing of The Guard is witnessing the ups and downs in the relationship from the two main characters opposite extremes regarding preparation methods and even physical appearance but identical in their tenacity to make the justice be respected even if they don't share the same definition of that word. The odd couple films tend to rely on the same jokes and the same conflicts and contrasts in the characters' nature The Guard also occasionally employs those clichs but it does it with an astute sense of humor which suggests a hidden level of satire to the movies from the same subgenus.What I can say against The Guard is that some details could have been better polished while other ones feel a bit forced. Nevertheless I think The Guard works very well in various levels mainly thanks to the various attributes from the screenplay and the perfect performances from Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle who can both perfectly balance the humor and the drama. The bad guys are also interesting thanks to the solid performances from Liam Cunningham Mark Strong and David Wilmot who didn't forget to bring humanity to the villains they interpret. In conclusion The Guard isn't a great film but I liked it pretty much and I recommend it.".

Its constantly pushing the boundaries of how odd a cop comedy can be and its right on 999 of the time. The acting is incredible Gleesons portrayal of a drinking womanizing racist but extremely likable cop is outstanding but even the minor actors really do a hell of a job.

Brendan Gleeson probably best known for his nonstarring roles really steps up to the gauntlet. An original title The Guard is extremely funny but in a smart way. Anybody can make fun of an Irish law enforcement officer and thats what at first this film seems to be about. But is it? As Wendell Everett Don Cheadle so aptly puts it You're either really....smart or really.....dumb. I just can't decide which. This movie is McDonagh's directing debut and it really does seem like he has a bright future ahead of him as a director. Another thing I loved about this film is the fact that Gleeson stays true to the role. He doesn't at all dilute Sgt.Boyle's thick Galway accent even though this may be a source of annoyance to nonIrish viewers. He is utterly convincing as Boyle. As is the portrayal of the Galway natives  not a small bit stereotypical. From my experience of Galway people this film is all to accurate! In short The Guard is certainly the funniest thing to come out of Ireland since Father Ted. A must see wheter your from Portumna or Portugal Carraroe or North Carolina. Enjoy!".

As the American FBI Agent Everett Don Cheadle comes across to deal with the drug smuggling gang he finds his task somewhat hijacked by the straightup Irish Guard Sargent Boyle Brendan Gleeson. His frank but careless attitude appears him to be the last man Everett would want to deal with but stuck with him they go on to form an unusual partnership. The film always maintains the spirit of its Irish humour and consciously rejects any Americanism which is often imposed on films of all genres. We can see this in the rejection of Everett throughout the film as the American is out of place in the Irish setting. It is only through the reserved acceptance Boyle shows him that he goes on to play a significant part.Performances by the cast are superb with Gleeson being of particular merit there is never a moment in the film you come to doubt him or his character. The pacing and direction are equally excellent and there is little if anything to falter. It is hard to stress the caliber of this film you will find it hard to fault a thing about it. It is a film that will remain in my collection and I shall certainly be returning to it for repeat watches.".

This movie is cut from a similar cloth although Gleeson is anything but the straight man here. A delightfully politically incorrect caper with some great characters and fresh writing. You may find yourself shaking your head in a combination of wonderment and pity at Gleeson the Guard but ultimately I wish every lawman on the planet had his sense of honor and fair play. Strong supporting cast with a notable performance from Mark Strong and Don Cheadle plays it perfectly as well. Sure hope you'll give this one a look and enjoy it as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody ".... The simple answer is YES! This a great film and make no mistake. I seriously doubt it will get the audience it deserves though which is a great shame for both the actors and crew  and of course its intended viewers.Set in the rural west coast of Ireland the film follows the local police sergeant as he investigates a shipment of drugs heading to the local port. You could say that there isn't anything here that we haven't seen before but that would be missing the point. This film is brimming with clichs and obvious plots. But that the whole point! Its an Irish parody of the traditional Hollywood fayre... Tongue firmly in cheek! Gleeson is simply superb as the Guard. His delivery of his lines is faultless and provides much of the humour for being so. If there is an underrated actor in mainstream film making then Gleeson is the fellow!.However not far behind are his two costars. The wonderfully able Strong and Cunningham. Both of which are more than watchable as usual. I've liked Strong since i caught him almost 20 years ago in Sean Bean's SHARPE series of TV films. He was an accomplished actor then and he's only improved. He doesn't appear to age either! Cunningham is just as good  there's something about him that allows an air of psychosis and he fits this role like the proverbial glove.Our leads are helped out by a terrific supporting cast. Some of which may be well known in Ireland but alas were not to me. With the exception of Pat Shortt who I recognised from the FATHER TED sitcom.I loved this film from start to finish. It has a nostalgia about it of a time and a place that perhaps i don't even remember. If that makes any sense? More please!".

In between noising up his colleagues he likes to break the rules e.g. drug taking and despite the chance of a lifetime drug trafficking case turning up in front of his nose he seems disinterested.Brendan Gleeson wise cracks as the seemingly jolly but bitter lead whilst Don Cheadle acts as a foil as a US drug enforcer trying to get any cooperation to crack the case.The drug deal becomes secondary through much of the film. It's more a humorous study of our man. It's a bit of a redemption story like some we've seen before a kind of comedy Bad Lieutenant. The lead reminds me of Irvine Welsh's book Filth but that's possibly coincidence.Anyhow our main man is interesting but not all will love it. The film doesn't paint rural Irish people in a good light but it shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's laugh out loud at moments although you may feel uncomfortable at some points.Well written but nothing special it's a fair ride and will keep your attention. Has its more serious moments that turns all on its head. You can see the ending a mile off but it doesn't matter.Enjoyable and funny it's a good movie that some will lap up.

	schema:headline " Wonderfully dark humour with great characters and dialogue throughout  Gleeson owns it";
	schema:reviewBody "Sergeant Gerry Boyle is a rather unconventional police officer  and perhaps not as effective as he could be. When the FBI trace major cocaine players to his district Boyle is surprised to find that none of them are black or Mexican but ends up assisting FBI agent Wendell Everett who for his money cannot work out if Boyle is really smart or really dumb.The scenario with The Guard makes it sound like a standard fish out of water tale with Everett being the fish or another buddycop movie where two conflicting or bickering partners come together to solve the case. True it has things in common with this genre in its dialogue and gunfire but this film is much more like someone took such a genre film and handed the script to the Cohen brothers and Graham Linehan to work on. The plotting is pretty straightforward here but it is the comedy that drives it. Those looking for the easy broad laughs suggested by the trailer might be disappointed because the film is funny because it has great characters and dialogue that is infuse with a wonderful Irish melancholy. Free of sentiment the film is funnier for it because it is just so wonderfully odd.The heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson and he owns it. He gets his character just right and has great comic timing and delivery making the most of the dialogue which is wonderfully shocking and funny throughout. Writer and director McDonagh did an interview recently where he was acerbic and a little too honest about his feelings about his younger brother's success and he uses this dark edge well in his writing as well as mixing in visual and musical references to good effect his script is as strong when it comes to oneliner jokes as it is in regards the brutal humour of his characters unsentimental realism. I'm not sure how they got Don Cheadle on board but he is pretty good and to his credit the Hollywood star knows that he is supporting Gleeson which he does. The supporting cast has Cunningham and Strong as philosophising drug dealers and they are as good as the entire supporting cast because the script is great for all the characters.Overall The Guard is a hard film to pigeonhole because while it is essentially a mismatched cop partner comedy it is infused with a real oddness and dry Irish nononsense humour that works really well. Gleeson loves every minute of it and dominates the film while everyone wisely plays their part to support him in his lead role. McDonagh does a great job and The Guard will more than help him with his sibling rivalry.".

What begins as a fiction filled alignment ends up as a touching friendship.McConagh's writing and direction are as fine as they come for films of this sort. It will be necessary for most viewers to turn on the subtitles to understand the brogue the few Gaelic passages are not translated!. The cast from the major roles to the minor ones especially the extraordinarily beautiful Katarina Cas including Laurence Kinlan and Fionnula Flanagan is superb. This is a very fine comedy well worth the attention of a very wide audience! Grady Harp".
